yeah yeah i think we're good to go everybody's fine now can we go right away to the uh the church book in the figurement age and we are where you stop let me try to see if i can get it here okay so have you noticed during rally all right i just uh played from what we stopped last time and then we can be able to pick up our discussions i know there are some questions that were said to me but i never really had the time to review them because they were sent to me a bit late but i'll be looking at it as we are listening to this and then we can also go through them okay i'm good to go 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word bride proving she has the spirit in every church age we hear these words he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the spirit gives the word if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age as those true christians took the word for their age did you get that last thought i repeat every church age ends with the same admonition he that hath an ear let him an individual hear what the spirit sayeth to the churches the spirit gives the word he has the truth for each age each age has had its own elect and that elect group always heard the word and received it proving they have the seed in them john 8 47 and he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because he are not of god they refused the word jesus and his words for their days but the true seed received the word because they were of god and all thy children shall be taught of god holy spirit isaiah 54 13 jesus said the same thing in john 6 45 being one with the word proves whether you are of god and spirit filled no other criterion but what are tongues and interpretation and the other gifts they are manifestations that is what the word teaches read it in first corinthians 12 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all then paul names being one with the word proves whether you are of god and spirit filled no other criterion but what are tongues and interpretation and the other gifts they are manifestations that is what the word teaches read it in first corinthians 12 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all then paul names those manifestations now comes this very good question i know that you are all anxious to ask why isn't the manifestation and evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost because you surely could not manifest the holy ghost unless you truly were spirit filled now i wish i could say that is right because i don't like to hurt people or walk on their doctrine but i wouldn't be a true servant of god if i didn't tell you the whole council of god that is right is it not just let us take a little look at balaam he was religious he worshipped god he understood the proper method of sacrificing and approaching unto god but he was not a true seed prophet for he took the wages of unrighteousness and worst of all he led the people of god into sins of fornication and idolatry yet who would dare to deny that the spirit of god manifested through him in one of the most beautiful portions of absolutely accurate prophecy the world has ever seen but he never had the holy ghost now then what do you think of caiaphas the high priest the bible says that he prophesied the kind of death the lord should die we all know there is no record of him being a spirit-filled and spirit-led man like dear old simeon or that sweet saint called anna yet he had a genuine manifestation of the holy ghost we can't deny that so where is manifestation as an evidence it isn't there if you are truly filled with the spirit of god you will have the evidence of the word in your life let's show you how deeply i feel and understand this truth by a revelation now that is something i wanted to uh quote out of what brother banner has been emphasizing on this paragraph can i have the screen hack please now in this paragraph he indicates that the manifestation is not confirmation that one person is filled with the holocaust how many understand that all right manifestation is not proof that you are filled with what a ghost but many people again go on the contrary to say or to teach that manifestation is not of god have you seen any way yes since we have started reading the church edible have you seen anywhere in this church edible where brother banh has one time spoken against manifestations if you remember tell us have you seen it anyway nowhere at all as a matter of fact in this church book brother banham's emphasis is on the word and the manifestation of the spirit but now you need to understand that the church edge book is meant by the bottom his intention was the intention of the holy spirit to have him do this was for an outreach whereby this book would go all over the world among the theologians those who are not the theologians among whoever so that they can be able to read the revelations of god in our generation because this book has a compilation of every teaching that we believe and teaching this message all the message doctrines are in this book not our church money not misunderstanding we don't have a church man okay but i said all the major teachings that are taught in this message are in the church are you following me yes now i i want you to uh follow me can you please set that up make sure there's no sound at all okay now uh okay i wonder if you can if you can still hear me can i be hard because i'm not quite sure whether i can still be hard i don't know if i'm getting again here can someone here try and tell me the ones online are taking quite long tell me whether i can still be honest yes hello can you hear me okay so since uh sarah arquello i say you are connected here since the peace i really wanted to know whether or not you can hear me yes okay what about now is the volume fine is it fine now okay if you tell me that the volume is fine then we can continue oh yeah but you know but that that was a few minutes ago maybe not now okay is the volume fine now people are getting problems using this technology it takes quite a long okay for whatever reason our volumizer let me try to see if i can make it better okay do you think that that is better or it is worse is that better um technology we're having issues today let me try to see if you can be able to adjust it oh yeah it's quite low i wonder now can i be hard i think that should be fine what do you think yes yes okay forgive us for the low volume really forgive us i also see those who are on youtube you need to let us know whether it is well now okay shall we proceed so i was explaining a point here that i think is very important for us not to just bypass and go and go on without explaining it yes [Music] you see brother banham in this portion is trying to emphasize that they prove the evidence that someone has is filled with the holy spirit is not because they manifested the spirit and this of course is offensive to our friends that mental customs because they'll be like how come that you can manifest he himself he says it down up here did he read it yes he says why isn't the manifestation and evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost because you surely know you because you surely could not manifest the holy ghost unless you truly wear spirit filled they say now i wish i could say that is right but i don't like to hurt people or walk on their doctrine but of course it's going to do just that but i would i wouldn't be a true servant of god if i didn't tell you the world cancer of god that's right is it not now and then it goes ahead to tell you manifestation is not the proof you have the holy spirit in your soul he gives you an actual example actually one he gives you two examples here the first example being that of caiaphas and the other example being that of balance how many remember who balaam was yes you know who balaam was billy paul who was born okay you don't know and yet you raised up your hand who was bottom okay we don't want to call him a first prophet really because actually even what he prophesied was true okay but we want to say that he was not filled with all of us because he had a gift of prophecy it was a manifestation a true manifestation but he as a man in himself he was not changed he was still having the lust for the money he was still having the lust for those things of the world he was still having lust for gold lust for that you know the man was not changed but the man had a right gift he had the right manifestation but he himself was not changed so it is true and possible for someone to preach and many people go to heaven and forgive he goes to heaven it is true and possible for someone to sing out of the anointing and go to hell it is possible for someone to speak thanks and and go to hell it is possible for someone you understand and therefore went by the banner listen to me everybody that's what when brother banham said it is what some people use in a wrong way when they say that you can still be feel you can still have the holy spirit every day of your life and still go to hell that's what it meant can we get it i saw that they put they posted it on the group and some of you started to beat yourselves then but that was actually true but the balaam says it all right so you need to be told right so that you can know can you get me that quote brother if you can get it to me then it will save me my time here of looking looking for it hallelujah okay let me find my phone here okay did someone find it brother did you find it that you can be baptized with the holy spirit or filled with the whole spirit every day of your life or you can have the holy spirit video of your life and still go to here by the time did you get it okay you will find that i'm talking now why would he do that why would he say that to some they have thought he meant that he meant he meant what we have been talking about here that if you don't have the holy spirit you will go to heaven that's not actually what he meant and uh let me get down i'm realizing that some are even confused while i'm talking so i need to get that quote right away okay okay someone online can you send it to us hmm allow me to take my time and get this quote for you is every day of your life my mind i can't find the question are you watching that chat group are you sure university for some reason maybe i'm using the wrong heat words but uh i'm not getting it as fast as i thought i would so but none of you is also trying you don't have the table on your phone friends just come on it's a bible study huh pull up your phone you get search those words on your job no some more about it what does it say are you ready for us the choice of your conduct you pull you can't mix it now you are either for god or against god and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside see the call cover many of you think i got the baptism of the holy ghost i am going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you are going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the bible says so amen you believe that do you believe that yes do you believe that did you believe the message of this generation yes so do you believe his message to be true so do you believe this yes i believe it without my heart but you see you need to believe it with understanding okay and that's why i thought i should bring this up and connect it with this quote here in this quote by the banana is not trying to say that that you must not have manifestations okay i want us to separate things here i want us to separate the manifestation and the baptism of the holy ghost or the feeling of the holy ghost and the believing okay you believe but you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost are you following me and by the bottom here gives us two examples of chi of us and who else these two people had the manifestation of the spirit and you cannot have the manifestation of the spirit without the anointing of the spirit you get the point there are certain things you can't fake by yourself you see people jumping up and down speaking tongues and falling down and you know those things you can't well there are some people who who know who are very good comedians and they can know how to fix such but i wouldn't even really know why you faked that i don't know why you would why you would want to fake that but i know some people can't but some of these things even we see it in abundance among the pentecostal world today you know they speaking in tongues the prophecy they they come on the manifestation about the manifestations what happens yeah you don't tell yourself to dream a dream just come to hell the vision you know all designated spirits all these things yeah the gift of healing and you know you can't fake that if it has happened it has happened there are people out there who have a gift i don't know if they're in here also can just place their hands on you pray and ask for your reading and you'll be healed immediately and each of you actually must have that each of us must have that because it belongs to us hallelujah now let me not veer off from the point let me follow this line this thin line so you can be able to get this even if you got this and you really got it well i would say that our day has been fruitful okay so now you can manifest those things but it does not mean that you are baptized with the holy ghost but you can say this the version of the world says yes sir but it doesn't mean you're baptized with the holy ghost so what confusing us know about confusing you there are three you are three in one that's right can you say i'm three in one come on say it lovely live in one one body god bless you two here is that you can be baptized with the holy ghost every day of your life on your body and on your spirit and you still go to hell but if you baptize the horribles in your soul as a sin it is there and you cannot be lost now people who have the baptism of the spirit of god on their soul and on their spirit or rather on their spirit they put it that way on their spirit they can be able to manifest all these gifts because actually by the time i say when you receive a new spirit it can be able to link up if you can get me that quote also quickly brother can you find that quote there oh you have gotten this one right you want to leadership can you project it oh you didn't get it yes you wanted me just straight yes that one can you project it so so that the others can also see it if they do not get it as uh we will find this one as well he says that uh what did i want to say you have it right there okay i'm going to take my time because what i'm teaching now is a very sensitive part and i need us to be able to see that thin thin line oh brother uh should i quit relying on you so i can just use mine here you're taking quite long i did not want to change this but i think i might have to so that's uh yeah but uh you are okay now i'll just uh okay this is the first one we range yes i put it up a little bit let this warm up brother martin can you please scroll up okay all right i think everybody cannot see that okay now you allow me to project this okay can we read together notice you you put a new spirit god has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with you have you heard that now you can't get along with yourself that's all there for spirit you had in you so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit now remember the new spirit is not the holy spirit but the new spirit is your new spirit but guess what it is put there by god no but by god by the spirit it's a new spirit it is put there by god half physically by his spirit okay but actually it is your spirit are you following me yes you know if you you are like cussing drinking smoking yeah speaking of what yes yeah abusive yeah being abusive you know you know speaking with having the language uh your mouth is like vaga you know the things of the world uh you're not ashamed of them you know and then you know the way you are speaking the way you are behaving the way you are dressing the way you are you know because of that old spirit which you had it had the appetite for the things that are aware of the world so even yourself sometimes you'll feel depressed you'll feel bad you'll feel funny you'll feel you know you would even feel bad about yourself you always feel you know you can't get along with yourself even that's why people commit suicide you know because of that old spirit that old nature which is in them now you can't even get along with yourself without without all spirit how do you think you can get along with god by the bottom says so what does it do for you he gives he puts he says so he got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit i'll put a new spirit in them this is in ezekiel and i'll put my spirit in them he said after he's given you a new spirit that is you don't get it confused with god's spirit it is not it is you and you so you can get along with this now if he ever gives it to you please i hope i'm presenting it right he says that uh if when he gives you a new spirit so you've got a new spirit before you get a holy the holy spirit now when you get then then the new spirit it will help you to get along with the holy spirit if god ever gives you the holy spirit so it means you can actually have a new spirit without the holy spirit and what will the new spirit make you do the new spirit will make you to easily get along with the holy ghost but that doesn't mean you have the holy ghost mark that what does a man who can easily get along with the holy ghost do when do you sing a song you only need to do this bless the lord oh everybody in that place in here who had a new spirit you had something already clicking in you and you feel like oh i i i want to sing that oh i want to share i want to worship the lord you know yes but if you have no new spirit you'll be like ah that's what i mean you know but if you have any spirit you will immediately sink in when people begin to shout and they're aiming to hold on to drop their hands and jump around even if that's doing them anyhow it's automatic why because you have a new seriousness you easily get along with him when he moves when he comes down and he takes your hand you don't say ah leave me you don't act like a god you act like a because you already have a new spirit within you to get along with him when he shows up you understand but don't make a mistake that is not dead and when that is on you when you have a new spirit and you easily get along with him so he can calm down and he can even use you like that donkey that was with bottom that's right you remember when they were oh glory to god when god came down and balaam was there and paul was going to curse the people of god what did god tell him he said don't go you put him here no he did not hear he refused he said i'll go and cast them because of the money which they had put in front of him now badam started out to go as he was going to go and cast the people of god the angel of god appeared but because ah was blinded because balaam did not have the holy spirit to design the things of god at this time at this moment he was now having his eyes on the money so that's why people within his spirit but without their holy spirit are very very dangerous because they are confusing sometimes sometimes they act like they it is god is truly using them and sometimes they act like the devil is truly using them is the same one who came and and uh prophesy to the children of israel very good things and then he came here and spoke with king balak and he was very and they were cutting the idea of you know getting the money and going to cars he was double dealing people with a newspaper but without the horribles can beat our dealers when they go they behave like vultures sometimes when they go in the wild they eat when they come in the church oh wow [Applause] you know what is happening they are just having a new speech but they are not they have not gone all the way you gotta point they have not yet received a seal god has not yet been able to to to put his seal on them he is up on them to say i own this one he's saying that you still have a way to go so he can hold you you still have the lust and the desires of the world he can't own you that way so these people can be able to even speak tons and to prophesy but they don't have their holy spirit if god as balaam was going and he was blinded he wouldn't even see the angel because of the blind in the spiritual blindness but the donkey was it a donkey yes he saw the angel and it stopped and but but i'm told it what is wrong with you why are you dreaming me can't wait the dog was like my master why are you beating me i thought they ever disobeyed you can't you see the one who is in front of us balaam because he was too blind that he didn't even get shocked that this don't be speaking to you imagine if that again started speaking to you and then you are like ah go away like your mind is focused on something that you can't even see this is a miracle how can a dog speak but i'm almost that blind so blinded that you cannot see that's how this better cause as many of them are so blind that you bring the world they can't see their worthy but they are like the spirit like that man women spirit you can't see the word of the day [Applause] you know you understand they feel they so they think they are rich but actually they are blinded because of the things that never presented before them okay there's a thin line here and that's why i'm taking my time because i wanted by the time by the end i present by the time i end up presenting this i want you to see it very clearly so you can be grounded very well on this now the donkey continued to speak and these guys continue to slap it and they don't have to bypass the angel to continue going but here is my point the donkey prophesied the dog is fought in times and prophesied because that wasn't his language so it's times and it's prophesied because you spoke a message and understand so it spoke in times and interpreted that is prophesying hallelujah so this donkey could do dark tangs and interpret them or prophesy because a tongue which they have tweeted by the battle says it is a prophecy but this man was so blinded that he couldn't see so here is my point now let us leave the man alone let us look at the donkey i wanted to show you that you don't need to be a soul filled with all the gods to talk times and prophesy this donkey i'm not saying i don't even believe it would be the right he does not soul at all but has a spirit right it has no soul that's why it could get anointed to prophesy so every human being if you have a new spirit of god you can be able to prophesy you can be able to speak in times you can be able to manifest all these gifts why not because you have the holy ghost but simply because you have a new spirit and you can easily sink in with him when he shows up when he comes up your spirit is made in a way that you can easily receive him that's what a new spirit means can we now read it in that understanding i will put a new spirit in them and i'll put my spirit in then he said after he's given you a new spirit that is you don't get it confused with god's spirit yes it is not it is your new spirit so you can get along with the holy spirit if he ever gives it to you amen now because in your condition never get along you never get along you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband you can't get along with your neighbor yeah even some of you can't get along with your siblings yeah you always want to fight and disrupt each other that's not good because you you have that old spirit of yours you know which gets angry quickly yeah you can't get along with your husband you gotta get along with your neighbor how are you ever going to get along with god so he has to give you a new spirit before you can get along with him are you following yes so he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts here yes everybody with me and then he puts his spirit in you gives you a new spirit a new look outlook a new faith then he puts his holy spirit in hallelujah that's what happens when he has given you a new spirit and prepared your heart prepare your soul to receive him and then now he will actually i should believe that you people should actually begin to prophesy and speak talents before you even receive the holy ghost so if there is no manifestations in your life it's a clear sign you you you have not even received the holy ghost it's a very clear sign you have not even received the holy ghost because before you receive the holy ghost you receive the new spirit and the new spirit will make it possible for you to manifest those gifts so if you've not even manifested any of those things in your life it is a clear sign even in this spirit you might not have it let right along the holy spirit if the word of god comes and they preach and you are like a dead rock it's a clear sign that you are not even going to see the new spirit i'm talking some of you here when you're mediating on sunday i love that oh i wish i wonder when we will have church again that's wonderful even as we were burning up in the church oh i tell you we were panicked we were jesus we're hollering we were shouting why because christ had come and when he comes up when he gives us his word and the brighter jesus is in the world and you know you feel you're full with it and then you know you can't hurt people to shout and clap your hands and dance around you know why because it is broken down in your heart but you see i'll show you that thin line that separates the pentecostals and the truth in one believers okay and i want to show you more quotes here about this before many people that spirit that new spirit god had given to you and your spirit to get along with his spirit well some people some mean they can't even get along with themselves let alone with god if he would come that's right so that was so doubtful ah and up and down so doubtful god has to give you a new spirit god has to give you a new nature so you can get along with yours where comes my good lord i hope you see god gives you a new spirit for yourself and then he puts his spirit in there amen to dwell with you and to and you know what and to abide together with you and to abide with you all right here's another one the new spirit it's a new life that has nothing that's good but god has to give you a new spirit so we can get along with his spirit the old spirit you had you couldn't get along with yourself let alone god the spirit so he puts he gives you a new spirit you see all right one last one here and i'll give you a new spirit now many times and there has been a terrible mistake the people have thought uh sometimes that the new spirit was the holy spirit but it isn't it's a new spirit god gives you a new why you couldn't get uh along with yourself with your old spirit how how are you going to get along with the what goes god had to give you a new spirit so you can get along with this spirit and sometimes people i knew how to i had affliction so you will receive it then a new spirit in that heart and then i'll put my spirit in that he gives you a new heart then he puts any spirit in that new heart and then he gives you the holy spirit new heart new spirit and my speech three things is pop off now many times we try to make a that thing just say well as soon as you get a new spirit you quit your stealing you quit you are lying things like that you say oh hallelujah i got it and you find out the first time you anyone crosses your path a little a little bit oh must see what a difference yeah you know you you when you get a little bit like oh why it is because you never had the holy ghost really you only received a new spirit and you find out the first time anyone crosses your path to say oh my so you blow up up like a frog eating back back and shout someone crosses your path you just blow up like a frog eating back shot but let me tell you brother that is the reason you never got godly spirit yeah yes that is true oh you say he stepped on my toes i i'll just not put up with that that shows what you got in you that is true i will put a new spirit and then i'll put my spirit in him hallelujah now the heart is in the center of the emotions of the human being your heart is in the middle of you that is exactly right so god puts a new heart in the middle of the old man then he puts a new spirit in the middle of the new spirit or heart and puts his spirit in the middle of the news hallelujah what is the name of the lord amen actually it continues even let me see if i can get this one okay all right let me see there's another watch on this that i wanted to to get um he said when you receive a new spirit okay yeah now just like i think the gifts of the spirit the gifts of the spirit is not it's the attributes of gifts of healing speaking in tongues and all those other things are attributes it's the fruit that the tree bears so the trees is the main thing the holy spirit and the holy spirit is god and god is love and god is love hallelujah so there is another quote i wanted you to see here wherever the banham says that why would you receive a new spirit you receive a new spirit so that those things can be able to manifest in your life hallelujah that's when the shout comes yes praise the name of the lord okay let me find for let me find that for you here give me a second okay looks about a new spirit oh i wish i'd get this quickly okay if i don't get it surely you can be able to continue with what you have okay let's see if this will address it all right uh i i uh whenever i tell you to remind me for some quote or something you people need to someone needs to take that up and be sure to remind me uh okay so all right now uh i uh this isn't what i was trying to find again i couldn't find it right now so how do we proceed now i want us to go back to the court that we were we are on in the pegamon church age and we try to review this okay so while we're here yeah right here oh so when he says again don't forget the other quote which i read for you and it got so many of you who lose in your mind that you can how did you put it i want the words exact words so that's exactly right yeah you can you can have the baptism of the holy spirit in every hour in your life in your yeah every hour of your life and still go so you remember where last time the other portion where we ran and he said yeah i said yeah i got it and he says no you haven't got it that's the same thing he's trying to talk about here such a person was receiving the new spirit you know like you are baptized every day what every day yep every day or every hour every year every hour you have baptized everywhere until when oh can you give me that scripture brother that until the day of your redemption getting that that quote okay as you are getting it let us read this again he says that many of you think i got the baptism of the holy ghost i'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to hear me no sir you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour in your life every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell now the message and the bible cannot contradict now the scripture says did you get that brother okay yes go project that for us here i'll just remove this in a moment okay this is a faith there you're welcome thank you for being a part of the program okay he says here ephesians 4 30 and grief uh you cast about words and give not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed until when your next revival until when you feel that again until the point the first person finishes so friends when you receive that holy spirit of god the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul it is one time and you are with him until the day of redemption it's a clear sign you can never be lost it's a clear sign you're going in the rapture you see why you need him yes therefore if you are playing around if you are playing around and you don't receive the holy ghost you are lost no matter how much word you do okay so the holy spirit you receive him one time in your life in your soul in your soul and these other the one he was saying that you can have the maximum of the holy ghost every hour in your life what is he talking about he's talking about he's not talking about manifestation he's talking about the baptism of the holy spirit in your spirit spirit in your spirit that's what brings the manifestations as we have already covered that and that one can come in and go coming and go coming and go depending on the weather and the spiritual environment you know you remember how one day brother soul he was moving around around it and god came and they spoke to him through someone he said you are going to receive a sign that a sign which will show you that you are the right king of israel or this this is the first king of israel do you know the sign that god gave him he said that when you go among the prophets when you reach the sons of the prophets you will prophesy like them that will be a sign when you prophesy that will be a sign you are going to be the king for you so when as he was walking he went and met the other sons of the prophet and the man said the prophet said people were walking around and said isn't that so he's also a prophet he's an but is he a prophet no he was never a prophet but people always are like that when they see someone speaking like a prophet they say is a prophet but aparnam says prophets are born they are not men there are for that man who was not born a prophet therefore would not be a prophet that's right but he had a gift of prophecy on him that was a manifestation it was where on his spirit you remember even when he was going to take david when he was hunting david and that they would live somewhere in the in the house of uh i think where they have the boosts or some people like that so he was sending people to go and depict to go and pick that man living and the more he said there the more they did not come whatever you would say do not come but you know what was happening whoever he was sitting there was reaching there and anointing was coming on him so he would begin to prophesy so also so when he went there to go and pick up david to bring him uh he said let me go myself this is the boy i'm saying that i'm not coming when someone reached there he started prophesying from morning until because he was in the right atmosphere you understand so this manifestation comes depending on the atmosphere yes you know as we were starting here some of you you are wondering what was happening we are not starting because there was an atmosphere that came here it was hard for me to continue making the road around it and things got around then i came out of that atmosphere it was going to be very hard for me to continue you know because i was in that atmosphere of prophecy i was in the atmosphere of the anointing of the holy spirit so now when you get into that atmosphere when you have a new spirit you begin to prophesy when you have any spirit you begin to sing when you have holy spirit you become happy you grab your hands you jump up and down you understand when you have a new spirit you you become lively yeah that that the holy ghost comes and he quickens you and your spirit and you getting through they they they move you can't be just their staggering from the beginning of the service until the end it is a clear sign you have the old spirit which is very dirty and stinky that's true it means you have not been changed at all maybe you have only received a new heart but you may be if you receive a new heart it means it gives you appetite for the wife so if you receive a new heart you should have a new speech also soon afterwards because if you have happened for the world it is the word which brings down that anointing for you to also receive the new spirit one day you hear the word and something convicts you and then you are like oh god and then it strikes you again you come it's fixed you you know and one of those days the one will strike you well enough until you feel like means you are now a candidate you are warming up to receive your holy ghost anytime soon hallelujah so now but the bottom is saying you can receive that anointing you can receive that anointing on your spirit every day of your life and you prophesy and you speak tongues and it never went down and you do all those things of the manifestation of the word of the spirit and you still go to hell there are fire that's what we say about the pentecostals they have the anointing of it they have a new spirit many of them actually when you preach to them they watch something's guessing inside them he closes his eyes you know i've always seen them i always enjoy that by the way you know when i'm in the field there you know you're preaching and you're evangelizing to them you know i was with one brother sometimes i pushed him and he was like he was an old man of 65 years but as i was still preaching i was preaching because he was saying these things i can't understand them yet anymore another right now so i cannot go there but my father is a physical brother you know and i was preaching to him and that he did like this he was and then he did like this [Music] you know the man was being grieved by the power of the what of the holy ghost by the power does it mean that is the time he was filled with the word spirit no but it simply means he had a new spirit so he could easily tap into the holy ghost and know it is god moving so he was grieving under that you know it comes sometimes with the mornings that we cannot be attacked how does it put it you people me get that these cookies you all don't know them so if you don't know them how are you going to become them then romans 8 26 what does it say likewise the spirit also helps our infirmities the spirit does what for we know not what we should pray as we always we don't know what we should pray we don't know when you've got to pray you don't know what you're going to pray and let me tell you never going to pray because i have been all figured out i'm going to go and tell god about this about this about this and about that and then i will read it it means you have not even reached ever when you go to prayer god they are with the bible you don't i feel like being in the presence of god you know and i feel like talking to my husband my wife you can hear me i feel like talking to my husband sometimes she comes around me and sits down and says what is it i'm busy you know what what is it yes i feel like talking to you i'm like i'm business but i want to talk to you now can we do it right now it has to be now you know what is it i said what do you want to talk to me about i don't know but i want to talk to you it will come as we are talking you see that's how it has to be even with the holy spirit amen hallelujah and i'm glad god understands you know he doesn't he doesn't doesn't do like how i do with my wife like i'm busy now maybe later whenever you go to him you'll say i'm around what do you want to say honey yeah can you drunk can you judge me for the presence of god you should be ready to open up amen tell him lord i want to talk to you i don't know about what i want to talk about you see we for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself makes intercession for us how with groanings which cannot be uttered hallelujah and you you'll be like oh god you know oh hallelujah is the spirit of god groaning in him with groanings which cannot be attached hallelujah amen you know before you know it you begin to burst out in terms you'll be like oh god and and you know what is happening you know something is happening in the spiritual realm you get you are getting connected but that does not mean that you are feeling the word god's name you understand yes that's what the sign that you have been filled with all about but then one of those days nasa managed to say so then how can we know that someone is filled with the holocaust i will tell you this these manifestations okay oh i hear something from the spirit hallelujah let me ask you a question if some of you see it here i'm telling you receive the holy spirit let me ask you a question can someone receive the holocaust without the manifestation yes what comes first let's take it down the line what comes fast god bless you what comes first a new heart god gives you a new heart breaks forth and gives in your hand then that new heart gives you appendage for what for the world and the love for the word you pray for the word you'll be like i pray for the world i want to eat the one when you hear people talking about what you're sharing yeah because you you are in love with it when you come around here the bible says you're like ah yeah yeah you know you are very active yeah this oh yeah i have a question you have appetites you you come in time because you have what appetite it is given to you by what by the new heart and when you receive a new heart somebody tell me that very moment when you made your decision you received a remark that was the moment you said in your heart that was the moment say when you surely if some of you here are faking it well you don't even have a new heart even you happy that for what we're doing now but if your you each of you has ever made a decision which i don't want to give this one for you each of you can only give your mind for me the moment i remember i accepted the word that was the moment god had given me a new heart to accept that what you believe it i meant it's the change of heart i made up my mind i made up my mind to go all the way the rest of my life i've made up my mind to go all the way the rest of my life oh i've made up my mind to [Music] you see the moment you make up your mind to go all the way with christ yes it's the moment you decide to leave all the worldly pleasures it's the moment you decide to cut yourself off from the world you've got your physical spiritual america called from the world that very moment you get disconnected that very moment and then you get connected to another one the life giver the source of life hallelujah and now as you continue on hearing the word word afterward the word after while you see this is the word that does it friends it's the word that does it do you amen here in the world so those people how can tell me how they receive the holy spirit of the world if all these processes by the one yeah and they received they received how they flew inside if the process from the from the from the beginning down is by the word how can they receive the holy ghost tell me they shouldn't i am interested to know how they see the word of god they believe in this message i am interested if you have ever seen anyone who says they have the holy ghost and they don't believe this message of the year i really want to know how they fruit insane no one can receive their holy ghost without the word no one no one i say i insist no one can receive the holy ghost with that one that's right it has to be the one basis hallelujah even though the parliament was talking about in the pentecostals that had been filled he said that that is baptized in the holy spirit he we now know what he meant yes that is the holy ghost sure but is it the seal and do they redemption sure enough it has to be by the way then as you go on up you receive a new spirit the word keeps striking when you accept you you you say ah ah [Laughter] [Applause] man but he said is it bad now next time you don't say anywhere at this time you go you come back again you say i believe okay what can i do but you have not yet been touched but you are saying like what i believe it is a progress there's a problem that's happening like we're saying there's a progress we're not saying but it's truly there yes hallelujah and then one day hallelujah you come and they will hammer you well enough that day hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] today but don't forget it is not his spirit is your spirit he just he just worked on you hallelujah he gave you a new spirit because the one you had was old and healed and a beauty problematic give you a new spirit hallelujah amen now when the white goes on you can no longer chew things in the church when the word goes on you can no longer speak in the church when the word goes on you can no longer use your phone in the church when the what goes on you can no longer cause why you have a new spirit when the people's preaching for you you're not even hearing much of the words you're connecting with the spirit the things the preacher is speaking you are hearing them in another language hallelujah the preacher says you can make it you will hear 10 words out of that how the spirit of god will be able to take that word and connect it with your tribes and connect it with what you have been fighting with and connected how in you and connect you to all those things and you'll be like yeah i can't get it amen amen but if you don't have any speed you'll be like you can make it yeah you understand he walks with me and nothing of this earth [Music] [Applause] so let the storms reach high [Music] [Applause] within the [Applause] shall have me foreign even now as we are sharing in this you know when you hear the word you get close somehow something begins to you know bring you closer and closer and closer to where they're all your voice from from the main sanctuary you progress to the holy place from there you progress to the glory of what you do today no one can tell you to stop people like hallelujah i'm having a glory out of yourself hey no one can touch you brother because there it is that's what you worship you sing you breathe where you don't even feel like stopping what is happening why can't you what do you feel like going on and on because you have reached the holy voice what happens next that's not all that's not all hallelujah when you receive the new [Applause] spirit you are now ready to receive him who christ himself to come on the throne of your heart remember when you receive the new spirit the word will come forth you will rejoice under that word you will have joy and speaking one full of glory sometimes you can even bust out in two times into prophecy you can pass out into shoutings and glories hallelujah you understand why because you are new those things that are manifesting is not actually you it is manifesting it through you just like he manifested through that donkey you understand yes but that is because you are in the condition for him to manifest himself within you why did he tell those people we will start tell me if a story can be able to give them glory hallelujah and shout for the lord what about human beings who have a spiritual body can't you see you people don't even need to act you should be ashamed if you can act like those stones because they themselves can even shout so it means even the lowest thing which can give god glory can give good glory then if you are you cannot even behave better than a stone that means you're even worse than a stone because a stone is light lively according to jesus they say that you can give god glory that's what god says some people sit there what can i say i can't even say like a song because a strong can some people can't worship god no matter what you know i'm not saying that you must do like everybody else but at least there must be some bit of life in you yes you know there must be some bit of life in you some people they be on the zoo meeting because the zoo meeting when you are there you know you are you are being actively engaging in the service that you if you have a new spirit you will connect with what the people say yeah you understand yes you will receive it hallelujah you will write yours that you put there amen let it bless somebody who was losing you say hey yeah someone said amen also you understand you hate me yeah when you have a spirit you you you can't be there you'll be alive fully alive then one of these days after all that is done after all having said all that you receive the holy ghost now many people when they receive a new spirit they stop there they think that's it that's what mother madam was trying to say but but basically holy spirit you can even bring the word to them they reject it if they are not the seed of god they will reject it even if they are the son of god sometimes they can reject it until it is still the holy ghost that i said that it is impossible for you to praise god without you without faith it is faith in the word of god but it gives you the holy ghost it is the holy ghost that helps you to get stuck with the world no matter what in what situation you apply the word you understand and how does the holy ghost come into a believer the all of us comes into a believer shouting but the bottom says that one of the mysteries that were open in our time is to be filled with a holy ghost without sensation yes even if we end with this one today because i want you to really understand what this is all about okay let me get that for you here okay i have it ready it says all these mysteries can you put that up the screen please all these mysteries follow me please the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation without the person of christ performing in you the same words that he did hallelujah hallelujah i said hallelujah now the holy spirit comes with doubt and some people use this to say what is this gibberish crying like babies pentecostal babies when it was about sensation but remember can you receive the boxing of the holy ghost without manifestations can you answer me after what you know now this comes last this can't last that's right wait it was meaning what he was saying i've already believed the word i've received a new heart i've received a new spirit where god has moved like in my heart where all the manifestations are actually some maybe or more depending on how you walk with god you know god has already manifested himself in my life shouting how that one is even now my lifestyle speaking in danger that is every time you know i have no problem prophecy that's always a part of me you understand running on the floor that has never been a problem you have been up and down ah it is always a part of me you know when ever since when ever since god changed me when did he change you i'd rather give me a new spirit i've not been the same since that time that's right you know no but you don't have the holy ghost yet when those things happen why did those things begin to happen i've been already for a long time and i've been changed i can say i've been changed i'm not what i want to be yet what does it mean i'm going to receive that person with the whole visit i'm not what i want to be yet but i'm not what i used to be there is a change in me happening i've not yet received a full redemption but there's a change in me happening are you following me and then one of those days as these things is the lifestyle so who are you you are a believer a believer who has already see who believes in the pentecostal blessing who believes in shouting and i shall not believe it but actually already manifesting it you are let me put it this way you are a believer already manifesting the life of already manifesting the life or the let me put it to you you are a believer already manifesting the attributes of christ in you you are i believe already and then one day you are somewhere praying and god gives you the holy ghost the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without god [Music] if some was to dwell in you what would happen now would you know that he has come in you yes you would know why because you will change because you change have you had that that's right because now you can have the new speed as you want you can speak in times as you want you can manifest all the gifts as you want but still have last but still be alive still be a thief should be another fornicator you can preach even and under the anointing and still be a thief but let him come in your heart he is not the shouting the shuttle has already been there now people use this to me there's not going to be shouting there isn't going to be anything you just come in your visa and you may not spend and then eventually someone will tell you you have him say yeah by the way do you understand no actually the shouting and the praise the glory is hallelujah i have already been there there will be the year there is no way you can deceive the world that's what we say there is no way i can receive the holy ghost without manifestation because manifestation has been already the holy ghost comes in and out why why do we also say when he comes in your life you must know how can someone entirely another person coming in i don't know how i know what i think how i think how my thoughts think i know how i behave i know what i you know i know my name and everything when i begin to realize my name is no longer what i thought it is the moment it's not like that maybe after some time i realized no you realized at the very moment what has happened i don't feel that way anymore amy i was having headache for that brother [Music] when he comes in amen you must know when he comes in hallelujah so it's not like a mystery that it happens mysteriously decided we know it rather means when he comes in you amen he is not he is not a shout he is not the the wind he is not come on the tongue is not those manifestations right yes but he is that's too small voice amen the still small voice gives you a message the person comes in your life sister brother to live a life in you whereby what will he do continue finishing that quote performing come on somebody you see now we are not even talking about manifestation as such we're talking about the works of the holy spirit the works of the flesh are manifest and these are but the works of the spirit are also manifest and these are faiths those are the kindness you see this is a character we're talking about someone's character yes like jesus has a way like you have a way about you some of you like pulling your nose so even jesus yeah he has a way he behaves when his character comes in you yeah you understand some people they just like touching their ear [Laughter] um you cannot be the same again now you can say what about the manifestations it's just going to now continue increasing perfectly god bless you hallelujah and one of them was an adulterer and another was a very clean brother he saw it in a vision he saw the brothers in the church and then in the vision he saw them like that and by this time for him he did not know even the things which we are preaching about he didn't know them at that time so you went among these people that jesus called me or you know started singing and then one brother was speaking with another preaching and then he said these brothers are they having this is this the spirit of god and then he saw a vision if someone was an adulterer another one was not so he was asking how come that someone can have the spirit of god and then behave like this how can they be and then manifest the gift of the spirit because for them they thought god cannot sit on that vessel meaning if you don't have the holy ghost what cannot come in your life you understand but that's how god revealed this that the rain falls on the just and the unjust that's right the good and the bad this this they want to tell the ones who are going to heaven they will all god does not say are they saying i'm going to only give you to my bride this can suffer and suffocate if god is generous he will give his reign to everybody so therefore israel means the spirit but this spirit like he said in the book of job i will put my spirit upon all flesh he's not meaning the baptism he's not meaning the person of christ performing in newport in the veil works he's not meaning that christ coming in their soul but he is meaning the manifestation of his spirit coming upon them and that surely can come upon any that's right whether believers are not believers there are facts we as believers does it mean we should reject it as a matter of fact if we reject it it clearly shows it clearly we can't even see the holy spirit if someone is saying i have the one who is brother but actually he he is a very very very a you know cold ground zero person you know it's a clear sign they're lying they don't have the holy ghost you understand yes i have a way about me i can't even just say amen i'm just there i'm attentive i'm just like joshua you know no that one is a curious sign this brother is lying to us you understand there must be that life in you i've got a life of god in me i've got a life of god in me when it is in you you can't be the same you can't be group one anymore like like lovely now this year is lukewarm but you you can't give you one when his life is in you you can't be white there are five having known everything that you know now let me now ask you a question amen can you what is the proof that someone has the holy ghost the life of christ what is the proof that someone has yes so where is manifestation as an evidence it isn't there if you are truly filled with the spirit of god you will have the evidence of the word in your life i love the way it puts it if you are the spirit of god you will have if you are filled with the spirit of god you will have the evidence of the word in not that you will believe the word in the election please please repeat this correctly he's not saying you will believe the word intellectually you be like a professor you feel like you know someone was known in the world for years you just you know he's not meaning that when he says that me brother do you know how long i've been in the message brother in if you are not excited the way you were excited when you first came in then it shows that you don't have that worry he says the evidence is the word of the word in your life not the word in your head please understand that not the word in your head but the word in your life the life of christ was infested in you hallelujah that word is christ himself hallelujah and he cannot be in your life manifesting his characters without manifesting his characteristics some of you need to understand he cannot be in your life manifesting his character without manifesting his characteristics you got it now i mean can i say the third time yes he cannot be in your life manifesting his character without manifesting his characteristics hallelujah what is the character of brother o'kara brother of carol his character can be defined by his beauty the way he is but his characteristics will be defined in the way he behaves the things we see and he hear and can tell about him the character and the nature of christ in you is what we read in ephesians is what we read in galatians the works of the spirit are manifest what are those is the words of the spirit this is character love long suffering peace all those things but then we need to see the characteristics of that character we need to see the manifestation surely if god in me is patient that's special that's a character in that same patient god in me we praise god in times of truth that's right you know i'm just being patient because i've lost this and that i'm just being patient actually if you're patient enough you'll praise god and you're trying to say hallelujah you know that sacrifice of the holy spirit look this is no longer even a new spirit anymore it is the holy spirit himself now if the holy spirit in you is love when someone steps on your foot you will hug them you will do it and tell them brother i know you need me i forgive you i know you didn't mean to hurt me my sister i forgive you amen hallelujah and then when you come in the church you will dance together you'll not be like okay i have patience but because i'm sad today even i cannot dance even like i can't even worship god even i cannot i have no joy now because this has happened to me it is a clear sign you have no character on christ because that character goes with characteristics it goes with its life it goes with that with everything about it you know you see that while the preacher is preaching the word i i have faith in the character not so i have faith but i'll just receive it silently you know if you have faith brother you will jump back [Applause] you know it's the life of it you understand there is your evidence that you have the holy ghost it goes together let me tell you the things that i said in this service for about one hour now i never plan to say them myself i'm going to go back and listen because i believe it was the holy spirit revealing this to us today that's right i have not had it i've heard it from him hallelujah therefore we'll go back and listen to these things so i can be able to get inspiration on what i can preach on regarding this subject i believe the holy spirit was really really opening this world for you young people because there's a purpose he has for you because he has been i've never seen it this way brother okay the way he has been able to connect all those courts for us says who are you talking about are you talking about yourself pastor no i'm talking about him because he's here we have been able to bring all those sports for us how some have used some of us wants to confuse us and take away our liberty make us think that if you have the holy ghost you're going to be like a dead wrong if you have a holocaust you're just going to accept the word and put it in your head as long as you can be able to tell those words and if someone begins to read the quote yeah let us take a little look at but if you do not have that life of it in you you are just wasting your time and i'm about to close i thought that was a very important thing to do for us today let's show you how deeply i feel and understand this truth by a revelation god gave me now before i tell it i want to say this many of you people believe me to be a prophet i don't say that i am you said it but we both know that the visions god gives me never fail not once if anyone can prove a vision ever failed i want to know about it now that you follow me this far here is my story many years ago when i first came across the pentecostal people i was in one of their camp meetings where there was much manifestation of tongues interpretation of tongues and prophecy two preachers in particular were engaged in this kind of speaking more than any of the other brethren i thoroughly enjoyed the services and was truly interested in the various manifestations for they had a ring of reality to them it was my earnest desire to learn all that i could about these gifts so i decided to talk to the two men about them through the gift of god resident in me i sought to know the spirit in the first man whether he was truly of god or not after a brief conversation with that sweet humble brother i knew that he was a genuine solid christian he was real the next young man was not at all like the first one he was boastful and proud and as i spoke to him a vision moved across my eyes and i saw that he was married to a blonde lady but was living with a brunette and had two children by her if ever there was a hypocrite he was one now let me tell you i was shocked how could i not be here were two men one of which was a real believer and the other was a sinful impersonator yet both were manifesting gifts of the spirit i was troubled by this confusion i left the meeting to seek god for the answer i went alone to a secret place and there with my bible i prayed and waited on god for the answer not knowing just what portion of scripture to read i casually opened the bible to some place in matthew i read for a while and then laid the bible down in a moment a wind blew into the room and turned the pages of the bible to hebrews chapter six i read it through and was particularly impressed by those strange verses hebrews 6 4-9 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak i closed the bible laid it down and meditated a while and prayed some more i still had no answer i again opened the bible aimlessly but did not read suddenly the wind blew into the room again and once more the pages turned to hebrews 6 and remained there as the wind ceased i read those words over again and when i did then came the spirit of god into the room and i beheld a vision i saw in the vision a man dressed in the purest white who went forth into a freshly plowed field and sewed grain it was a bright day and the sewing was done in the morning but late at night after the sower and white had gone a man in black came and stealthily sowed some more seed amongst that which the man in white had sown the days went by the sun and rain blessed the ground and one day there appeared the grain how fine it was but a day later appeared the tears the wheat and tears grew together they partook of the same nourishment out of the same soil they drank in the same sun and rain then one day the skies turned to brass and the plants all began to droop and to die i heard the wheat lift their heads and cry to god for rain the tears also lifted up their voices and pleaded for rain then the skies darkened and the rain came and again the wheat now full of strength lifted up their voices and cried in adoration praise the lord and to my wonderment i heard the revived tears also look up and say hallelujah then i knew the truth of the camp meeting and the vision the parable of the sower and the seed the sixth chapter of hebrews difference they were of different seed here also was the answer to matthew 7 21 through 20. have you seen it yes yeah let me play that for you again the seeds were people elect and reprobates both partook of the same nourishment water and sun both prayed both received help from god for he may see where people who nourishment of the water and the sun both pray both receive the help from god for he makes his son to raise to his son andre to fall on both the good and and though they both had the same wonderful blessing and both had the same wonderful manifestation somebody said that again at the same wonderful situation talk about all of them there was still one great difference they were all different they were of differences so the issue here is the seed so what we see the pentecostals do they are impersonating it because it was not meant for them rather it's not it's meant for the believers this raid was meant for what it was made for the follower the wheat it was meant for the wheat this thing was meant for the manifestation was made for whatever are you getting on my point yes i hope someone is understanding something new here the manifestations were met for them the world was meant for the spirit was meant for nonetheless the what that's the tire also enjoyed the same but bacteria cannot be healed with the shack that the seed brother cannot be here with a shark the shark cannot be here with the siege as much as it will enjoy the rest but it cannot go on unto perfection and how does perfection come perfection comes in by receiving the true genuine holy ghost in your soul and how do you receive that by accepting the word of your debra amen hallelujah and basking yourself under that word day by day but says the revelation striking after the relationship it breaks the stimulation of revelation hallelujah let me know this is a mystery the things you're hearing not very many people know that not very with his son and reign to fall on both good and evil and though they both had the same wonderful blessing and both had the same wonderful manifestations there was still that one great difference they were of different seed here also was the answer to matthew 7 21-23 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity jesus does not deny that they did the mighty works that only the holy ghost can accomplish by way of men but he did deny ever knowing them these weren't backsliders these were wicked unregenerate reprobates these were the seed of satan and there it is you can't claim that manifestation as the evidence of being spirit born spirit-filled no sir i will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the holy spirit doing mighty acts but it is not the evidence of the individual being spirit-filled even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations the evidence of receiving the holy ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of our lord it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word the works would follow that is bible now jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the pergamian age which was as yet 200 years off from the patmos vision he knew that drift would cause them to go into the dark ages he knew that the way man originally got away from god was by first leaving the word if you leave that word you have left god thus he is presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages i am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which i am giving you the word is a revelation of myself i am the word remember that i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in first john 5 14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him now we ask what is the will of god there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god lamentations 3 37 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the lord commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it is in his name there it is again jesus the name is the word will you can't separate god and the word they are one now then this word he has left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life he said that his word was life john 6 63 be but that is exactly what he is john 14 6 i am the way the truth and the life romans 8 9 be if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what jesus is he is the word so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man if the church way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the living word in their midst the power of god would not have faded as it did in those dark ages and right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without doubt that the glory of god and the wonderful acts of god will be in her midst again one night as i was seeking the lord the holy spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as i grasped the pen to write his spirit gave me a message for the church i want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride here is what i am trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each specie brings forth after its own kind even according to genesis 1 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and thence into fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride church christ's seed will come to the headstone and she will be the super church a super race as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denominations cannot produce this wrong seed they will produce their creature denominations cannot reproduce or produce this why because this says that this is in order to be united with you they will be one they will be the very manifestation look at that there will be a very manifestation of the word of the living god the very manifestation of the word of the living god the right the church the true church will be the very please can you put that on your mouth there will be one there [Music] how can you be a manifestation of the world of god you remember what he said about the baptism of the holy ghost without no he continues on yeah hallelujah you you are missing the most important part now how come how could you miss that my brother hmm look he says but the person of christ performing in you the same wax that he did hallelujah there is another part i think it's on the other quad which we rent what does it say probabilities here in the in the church edges here right here yes this is what my heart was running into if you are truly filled with the spirit of god you will have the evidence of the word come on in your life if you are truly filled with the holy ghost you will have the evidence of the word in your life your neighbor if you are truly filled with the word [Music] what evidence down here what did he say he said oh my they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denominations cannot produce this because they are the wrong seed denominations cannot produce the life that this message can produce in your life denominations cannot go are you getting what i'm talking about this message will produce a masterpiece this message will produce a people that are going to live for the name of christ this message are going to produce a people that will behave differently women that all listen to me please the women that will dress differently women even who would treat themselves like women denominations have collided and and collaborated with the devil to undress the women but in this message the message will place women in the right positions both in the church and in their homes this message will we will put the men in the line and give them the mind of christ whereby they will be able to do those things which seem and which are right you see this message will make us for fake the things of the world denominations can't do that that's why people are there and they can do what they always do are you listening to me hey please listen to me now they are in their denominations and they behave the way there they don't find a problem with what they are doing and when they come in the message are you saying that this is wrong even that is wrong even that is wrong even that is wrong but believers who are truly believers of this message hallelujah [Music] look at me hallelujah from since i knew the message and when he said me you can as well see yourself from sins i believe this message have not been the same from sins i believe this message i've lived a separate life from since i believe this message i've lived a life hallelujah that is beyond reproach hallelujah where jesus himself came on this earth and he said show me where i have broken the law show me the if i have not done what was written of me tell me connect me tell me amanda you can condemn me of sin that's what jesus said how come he would say that do you know that the bible and the message tells us we are going to be the very manifestation of that word we are going to be christ not even christ like we are going to be christ we are going to be here the prophet says she is him in this same such book somehow we shall find i think maybe down there she is him this message is going to produce a very different species this message is made that's why sometimes people are like oh these are high standards they get out they feel like they must say ah this high standard is up there they get out there even many who claim to believe it they make their own standards leaving the standards of the world they will not be counted among the bride christ is only looking for those that are his seed and his seed will manifest the very word of the living god in our generations the denominations cannot manifest that one do you know what separates us from the denominations do you remember of course if you want to know what separates us from the denomination then you should know what makes us who we are what makes us a true church so can we now remember what make us a true church those two principles have you forgotten them already the fewer words of god the viewer of god the manifestation of god's power in our life hallelujah now the denominations are those that don't believe in the pure word of god even if it's what but there is no life they are dead god demolitions so there could even be some who put themselves in the category of believers when they actually donations can you imagine brad yes it's not what i say is what the one says the denominations cannot produce this i'm getting blown away this one is blowing me away are you feeling blown away amen like wow i never knew this is in the message yeah you might have read it many times maybe several times but let me tell you the word of god in reference in the newspaper when i read it was for yesterday this word is the same yesterday and forever hallelujah whenever you read it even when we go back now at the revelation of jesus christ we start again you realize that how did you see this the word of god is always new you
