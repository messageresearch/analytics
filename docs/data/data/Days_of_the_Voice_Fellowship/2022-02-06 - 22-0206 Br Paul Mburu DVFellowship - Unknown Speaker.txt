praise be the lord yeah we have to bear one another's burden you should not forget to pray for our brothers and sisters of not coming yet praise the lord yeah i'm running i'm trying to rush very fast i'm going to read the report from sunday school sunday school report 65 2022 scripture john chapter 1 verses 12 text people of god and children of god listen all the people in the world are god's people but there is a group of people called the child of god amen and then the offerings our offering were 1400 healings children present we are seven though only two came on time we appreciate all the parents and continue encouraging them to keep time always our teacher was brother wanga henry shalom here we have announcement the outside mat is basically for crying children and those who want

in front of and you before i give in my special song it will come from uh number 205 near the cross that's the head of the soul i'm so much humbled for the pressure that spoke to us last sunday in fact i doubt whether there is any other person that was that the word went to apart from me no the preacher said there is someone i don't know whether he brought it that way but that is what i got in my mind you didn't want to come to church but you were first and you are being forced by the spirit of the lord let me give a bit of that you know sometime back at school because when i was uh i was one of the leaders in the ministry and definitely when things would not work out well i would wake up early at around four five six there i go pray somewhere then i leave the service to go at least up to 10 then afterwards i followed them up or at times i would just say i'm not going to change like i told brother solomon that sunday man i'm not coming to church i might not come to church when i felt my heart was really damaged i felt i had a lot of things on my face that i would not come and face the brethren here so when the the preacher spoke i felt inside me but the word hills i had a lot of wounds i cannot express all that but really i got delivered i thought maybe it was just a mere say i tried turning you're not checking myself as i was sitting there i i didn't expect myself to have gone back the way really i was free but i want to give glory unto god because he delivered me [Music] and for that matter i'll just take this moment to worship him in this song jesus keep me near [Music] from calvary's mountain jesus keep me near the cross there are precious [Music] mountain [Music] [Music] near the [Music] anymore [Music] in our [Music] my [Music] god [Music] me [Music] my glory is [Music] oh [Music] till i reached [Music] my [Music] god bless you i hope it's the same pressure that's going to speak to me today [Music] amen thank the lord for the spiritual soul praise the lord amen [Music] very fast because time is not on my our side [Music] yeah there's a note here also ensure that at the end of the service you pick yourself a message titled christ is the mystery of god revealed everybody are copying so after the service we have a booklet which you always give this message called christ is the mystery of god revealed so make sure that you go at least with a copy we help them in plenty praise the lord yeah so let us give in very fast then we are going to sing one song as of your coming our pastor [Music] oh let us see on a single chorus then we shall sing
