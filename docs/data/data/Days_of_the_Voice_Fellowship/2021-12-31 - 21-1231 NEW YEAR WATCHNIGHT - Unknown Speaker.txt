this new year write it lord in the precious name of jesus christ [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] for the audio for the other things for the audio [Music] [Music] this and the mothers with children please control them not to speak anything if you possibly just close the door i want to greet you all in the name of jesus [Music] although you don't look like you're happy to make it here now [Music] this is the first the first person to uh to collect money for for our chancellor um i should be the first one to give something yeah okay i thought i would give you a full report and a way forward but being that many are not here so let us wait for sunday and then i will keep that [Music] [Music] amen please [Music] [Music] and so you see the more you bring to the lord the more stars you will have in heaven do you know that even in heaven we are not going to be equal as an equal you know we are going to have different glorious is going to be determined by how much you have learned from the lord we should talk about [Music] uh [Music] and now bring down all your 21 did you know that whatever you have not done in 2021 you're not going to do it food [Music] this moment their plan is to plan on how to to torment you [Applause] [Music] god has given some few grace to be able to see in hell what happens and when this little boy where is he what was uh when he was born anywho where's that who are god gave us grace to see those demons which had okay we would not see them when we were planning in here we saw them when they had come to fulfill their out their plans at the same time in the morning or in the night and uh it was i was the first to wake up and i have seen you know them all around them squeeze the life out of him and you know they were talking with one another you see but talks about demons and when he was in um what you would call a designer session to tell someone maybe if you had a spirit which was tormenting you you know and then he is trying he is going to expose it let's say it is cancer and you know because the demon knows is about to be exposed at the moment he would expose that this one has cancer can we achieve and then many times in the meetings if you have been listening to the message of course some some of these things are enjoyable if you have been listening to them but i would like us to bring in everything in this service i believe that all of us here will also have enough time for prayers i really feel that the new year should find us when we are going in prayer but i will warn you you're not going to hear you know the kind of new year's newer message that you are you are you always here oh my god and i know well of course even when coffee came the first time they said this year yeah i said they're going to cook is 10 and the lord said that to moses go in unto pharaoh for i have had in his heart and they out of his servants that i might show this this is my signs before you um and sun what things i have wrote in egypt and my signs which i have done among them that you may know how that i am the wrong hero amen and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thou saith the lord god of the hebrews how long would thou refuse to humble itself before me let my people go that they may serve me alone [Music] hallelujah so i don't think i would really want to thank god for this opportunity for this place uh we have good neighbors you know the lord gave me the desire for us to have this even before i knew that they were going to stop overnights now i know that we are coming we have come a long way germany we have come a long way of 12 months it's been not shocked but there will be it's been long about everyone how many things have you had in this year how many bad things have you had this year being to be making you all having a couple do you know many have died because they became sick of what they were saying and many were taken by the same sickness that was tormenting you allah and so when he came he returned actually before he when he was leaving he wrote a text on whatsapp group chat how many but you do not see it but to me i think that the very first message you should see every morning when you wake up is one day when the church group is quickly now as i will be traveling to toronto at 3am today for barry you know you know the whole family and the world church family would have been so sad family we are laughing but this is reality they were involved in a very terrible uh risk of an accident [Music] but the lord delivered them don't you think we should have a time like this driven life [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] around and see the good things he has done for me i know of the world i love my whole life so much oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] foreign this way [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is my [Music] oh my god [Music] amen if you have so much thank you for just giving up [Music] uh [Music] you tonight of course i may not preach that much but i'm going to speak to you as friends brothers and sisters but i pray that you listen very carefully there are some people without cars as they are working but in this case each of us is in a car why there is a purpose why we are living now each human being that is on earth today body move is such a normally considerable on youtube on a video interview of uh who is that man who was putting himself like that that black man made himself like a white michael jackson i believe that my life was that i was born to entertain people he believes that he was born to entertain to dance for them every night that was the cause he was reaching forth brother we're going to use the microphone so the sun can't be better okay so michael jackson my conduction lived all his life not to please others he even had to do a facial change of his body yes seemingly without a cause course they wake up in the morning they eat nobody made it they sleep yes is like doing something that everyone will remember doing something for such people remember um legacy is something that you leave behind after your life what people will remember you for ah those are not the only things why we are born you see and so now you can watch it was that what and for the right course you will see what you didn't really want to do you are living for the wrong one a man or a woman leaving for a course i've always sung into whatever you do in your life it will reflect your cause you see if you are all right i hope you also selected the audio there by the shape don't forget to select usb audio because this will be for nothing if it's not selected praise the lord if you do not live for the right course you will live you are people who were in the land of egypt and these of course as you know where the people of god the jews the hebrews and now these people abantubano they found themselves in egypt they sang a mystery they found themselves serving listen please they found themselves serving a certain purpose they found themselves living for a certain cause [Applause] how how do they do the bricks you know they have to they found themselves doing those kind of things they found themselves being beaten and they grew up many of them thinking that that was the reason why they were born they thought they were born to be slaves they thought they were born i never ever thought i'd seen anything else another you see until some of them even have to fall down you find them doing those things younger men you find them doing those uh you know rasta rasta cards [Music] you find them having boyfriends so you get caught up into what you find them doing the night with no quality one with your sons still they even make it feel that if you do not do what they are doing that you are you you are backwards until you need this yeah [Applause] tonight i want to talk about a purpose-driven life in this coming year can't we live a life that is purpose-proven whatever you are doing you have a purpose oh god of course if you live a purpose-driven life there are many things you cut off from your life removing there was a and so these people in egypt i went to another mystery they started uh you know as i had i've explained they were doing all those things if you are behaving or doing certain things or keeping some fellowship with some wrong kind of people you cannot do things that is out of that jurisdiction i saw these people some of them they knew they needed to leave amen that you can make a choice amen to live a purpose-driven life you
