she gave birth to the little one she had certain attacks went and prayed with her and the Lord delived her you know usually those things happen when the child is special she's a special child amen we have um um still um a Vista that has not been mentioned to us God bless amen we are going to read out of the book of Ephesians and then we shall sit also um i' would like to welcome um My Brother David from s she was directed here by Sister Esther I think they had talked in the past but it is recently that he failed a pool to come and called sistera this morning and said I would like to go with you to your church is down she said she was not able to come but he said I'll go anyway so my brother David I believe you will not regret God bless you and let us remember to pray for sister Esther and also brother Emma and his wife send greetings spoke with them this morning Emma the one who had an accident um they maybe getting discharged today and we thank God for that so will you remember brother Emma in your prayers and sister sister as well amen shall we go to Ephesians chapter 1 uh we we will begin from three and read up to vers 9 if you there say Amen okay so we are reading from vers three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved everybody say accepted in the Beloved accepted in theed in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself [Music] for for he is deted Pur amen amen may you be seated May so this morning I just want to it's 13 minutes to 12 we usually um want to St stop preaching at one but on Sunday being that many are not able to make it during the week we us do a little extra preaching for about an hour and a half so um I'm I'm speaking this just for those who like looking at their time so that you don't say oh Pastor is going be it's because we are starting a bit late and also if you can help me and have give me your undivided attention you don't move move around that will be lovely is brother Fred here no not yet back it's a young man who just graduated uh they they join us when he was just completing high school and um I'm I'm just so happy that he now has graduated amen so I'm speaking on a subject that have called being accepted in the Beloved being accepted in the see how it says there vers six okay we can begin from vers three let us read verse by verse blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ so he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings not some all in Heavenly places according as he has chosen us okay now let me read this differently according as he has chosen me now you read it that way also then it will make sense he has chosen me in him before the foundation of the world that I should be holy he already chose me to be holy the devil cannot stop me from being the Catholics when they die the pope can make some of them saints I don't know with what power he he makes them saints but our God because of predestination he has already made us s so we are already a saint I am a SA Aman Joseph Danel you say Amen if you are Saint that's why I said God bless you Saints so he has already blessed us and he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world this morning I want us to get into the word for us here dvf we love the word we have no business for jokes we just love the word amen how many love the word amen so if you love the word get ready to enjoy the get ready to enjoy the word this is much better than a movie my much better than a football match hallelujah amen I don't know your expectation but mine is very hard I'm getting ready to enjoy Amen brother so I want to hear your amens if so in other words he says he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy so in other words he chose us in him to be holy he chose me to be holy the devil can't stop me from being holy the condition around me cannot render me Unholy I was chosen to be holy amen Without Blame so in other words I am Holy and blameless is there anyone here like me I am Holy and blameless tell your neighbor I am Holy and blameless I was chosen to be that it is not my choice it is his choice amen it was not my decision it was his decision it was not my declaration his declaration he declared he chose he decided deter that there will be somebody that will be holy that will be blameless the devil can't do anything about amen amen yes having predestinated us un to adoption meaning he he predestinated I would be adopted predestinated that I would be a son that I would be a daughter of God so so now it means there are no things that did not happen or that has happened that can change that I was predestinated unto being adopted and the adoption of Jesus of children by Jesus Christ to himself by Jesus Christ in other words Jesus is the Difference Maker here without Jesus no adoption but because of Jesus I I was destinated to adoption by Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his will now you understand this is something that happens because God has willed it it is God's will for you to be perfect is God's will for you to be ho you have heard people saying no one is perfect tell them what did you say Look At Me by the way this is true me I am perfect you are perfect now remember this Perfection is regardless of your physical impurities this Perfection goes beyond what this flesh has caused you this is something that confuses it says how can someone be perfect Jesus is coming back to take a church that is without sport that is without wrinkle meaning that is a church which is perfect How can there be a church without SP without rink he's not talking about a church building is talking about people in this world today is a group of people that have no sport that have no wrinkle they washed in the blood they perfect they don't have any problem they are holy they are blameless whether they feel it or not whether they they are excited about it you know someone many times people want to feel excited I feel you may not feel holy you may not even see the Holiness but if you said it then believe in my brother it is according to the good pleasure of his to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he oh my let me go back bit to the praise of the glory of his grace the glory of what Grace you know what Grace is Grace means it is on his Merit not on your am I preaching to Believers he merited it Grace means un favor something you did not work hard to achieve but something which has been simply given to you because of choice because of love love and grace go together it's it's not about how many sins you committed in your life for how many you did not do that's why the devil defeats us many times because we look so much at ourselves and then we see failures we see sin we even see our thoughts B we see sincerely it is not possible for me to overcome as long as the devil has got you there you will always be defeated but you should quit looking at yourself because they sa here he it is afterward he says to the pray of the glory of his grace and I told you Grace is unmerited favor something you do not deserve you are being favored because you are Been Loved When a Man Loves a girl he chooses her meaning he has had Grace upon you you may come and say she's ugly she's short she's she's dark she's very red she has a big nose she has a big mouth but you see the more you speak those things the more you will irritate the the one who made the [Music] choice when someone makes a choice you who have not made that choice should be careful to say anything because you think you are advising but you are they actually beginning to dislike you how can you make such a choice can you see this this sister her eyes look bad even look at her teeth one teeth is out and the more you speak You're frustrating this person he may be quiet but if you are not careful the next thing you hear is a big you're not the one who chooses for me he he he has made his choice Out of Love Love Lies you know in the eyes of the beholder and he chooses according to how he feels and sees fit whether you agree with them it's a matter it's a personal matter it's a personal Affair it doesn't want your opinion that's why when it comes to choosing a wife you have to make your own choice no one makes a choice for you it is a type shows that what God has done an imited favor love covers a multitude of sin whether they will tell you this one they family they night dancers if truly you love her you don't care you said don't you worry I will deliver her by my prayer they tell you this one their family they divorce don't you worry mine is different it's a choice love covers a multitude of sins if they tell you those things and you change your mind it means you don't love that person but if you love that person regardless of what the words you hear regardless of what someone tells you your heart is already smitten and you have already favored that person and you will not change your mind many times people change their mind but God is God God is not a man God is not a man his first thought a perfect thought his perfect thought never be changed so now he in his mind before the foundation of the world he chose me he saw me as perfect blameless he saw my end the beginning the way I see you you are blameless You Are Holy you are perfect chosen you to be my bride and here I am today I know who I am I am a son of nothing nothing present nothing to come that fact that's not a presumption that is a fact to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us the Lord Jesus Christ and he has made me accepted in Christ sinc when you read the scripture with Revelation you cannot be that Sil as I was reading it I had all sorts of mixed feelings I was so happy to see that he has made me accept I am accepted in the Bel in whom in who in Christ in whom we have Redemption through his blood Redemption Redemption is not forgiveness you get a point forgiveness you have done something and you forgiven but Redemption you've not done anything you are what you were in his mind before you did anything so when the devil says they did ABC God says I don't see it I don't see it why because something happened God himself came down and he put on flesh and he died the death we were supposed to die [Music] we were supposed to in other words he took our place he was B because of so everything he went through was because of you and me so I don't have to go through it I am not guilty the Bible says he became sin that I might become the right oh God I am the righteousness of God can you imagine that you are the righteousness he became you so that we might become him and that's why he has said here he has made us accepted in whom we have forgiveness forgiveness we have what Redemption we have Redemption what were we in the beginning we were perfect we were sinless we were blameless without SP without wrinkle after his death on the cross where are we now we are blameless without sin we are perfect SP R we are redeemed we are taken back our original estate we are taken back in the only original where we were in what about ours can we be realistic a bit we indeed had but what happened to them there is something called The Sea of forget all our sins the moment we confess it doesn't matter how big they are it doesn't matter how huge they our carried away and they thrown into the sea of forgetfulness can God do can God forget yes that's the only thing God can do will always forget he forgot about my sins he forgot about what I did he forgot about my bad side he doesn't know about my bad side oh he only knows your good side when he sees you he calls you blameless he doesn't call you forgiven he calls you redeemed the only reason is he doesn't remember you were even forgiven for Hallelujah [Music] I am his child not just now forever I was his child I am his child I will be his child devil wants to SPO my my sound my sound has gone my hallelujah amen I was here I am here during sin and I'll be here after some of you when you see sin you just bow please forgive me Father don't attack me don't attack me please oh please leave I have time I'm going whats take don't don't bow to AC Hallelujah in whom we have Redemption through his blood and forgiveness of according to thees [Music] of his is [Music] what they say is in family with poor and rich people when the rich person comes usually poor people don't bring their they wait for the rich person to come when they come what they everybody say that is it we see according to my understanding instead of buying the pl of 50 million let us buy a of because since we a big family how do you point is very Paramount because is Rich they know even if they fa will put M tell you the we are talking about is Rich Jesus's Grace is Rich for that cause when he says you are forgiven you have been redeemed no one can refuse amen now listen to even your canot ref cannot refuse because he has spoken and he's Rich ince Hallelujah known unto us the mystery of his will prophet of God says that's right I never was any good neither was you there is nothing we could do about it that's the good part of it and when you can just recognize that that you are not good then you will not trust in your own good there's no goodness in you that can help don't trust in your own [Music] good but I want to show you something one thing you could you could do to Merit yourself you would have something to brag about Lord I've you day and night you can say that to him he said no man can come to me except the father draws him and God seeks man and not man seek so you don't have one thing to say you can only say it was your grace that did it amen and then as long as you are accepted in the Bel how can God bring you into judgment when he's already judged [Music] you how could you have to suffer for for your sins when Christ has already done it people who are not in Christ suffering for their now right now they suffering their sins haunt them their mind they have nightmares someone kill someone and they can never be free will always be on someone you know goes into immorality and always they why because you see they are not in Christ why you find people getting depressed you find people getting you know s [Music] down become so sad sinful people are sad people [Music] by are you hearing me sinful people are what sad people they are the saddest people on Earth that's why they always like going to because they're trying to cover up look at all those singers they go and they entertain [Music] people when they go back home many of kill themselves they why because they sad they are the saddest people on Earth because they don't have Christ whatever they do com it hunts them day and night them and if you don't have question in your heart that's why you get those sad sad episod and you feel L low at night many of them lose sleep at night why because they are sad the spirit of sadness has come how does it come on you because it has access to you it get access to you you through sin when you put your sins under the blood then there is a barrier around you those spirits will be completely removed oh since I got Jesus I sing and I shout I am happy there is joy in my soul I believe is a joyful person a Believer is a happy person am I speaking to Believers a Believer always wears a smile when you are sad you look happy when you have no money you look happy when no school Fe you look happy no food to eat you look happy when they have kicked you from your job you look Happ regardless of your situation you look Happ why because there is a peace that go beyond any understanding that is in your heart because of Christ amen amen praise the name of the Lord so you cannot suffer for yourself and if you're hearing me this morning and you have been suffering because of your sins you have no reason to continue suffering Jes suffered for and then you begin hiding them you know sin is so St you have to hide it you know the burden of hiding sin is the most dangerous thing that any Christian can ever why do you carry a heavy Lo Jesus come unto me I will give you amen rest is in Christ don't cut your sin don't don't be a secretive sinner if you a sinner sin [Music] publicly are you hearing what I'm saying don't sin secretly public so that we can see you and help you we will give you what we received we will give you the blood what give you the blood yes preachers have a right to distribute the blood how do we do it the word what am I doing now I am very busy Distributing you are receiving it and the word sets you free the Bible says the truth shall set you free free from bondage how could you have to suffer for your sin when Christ has already done it God would be a two and an awful person when it was suddenly paid by Jesus Christ and you accepted it and as long as God accepted Christ he accepted you with Christ and when and when he he did it when he did do it brother before the foundation of the world when he spoke him into existence he spoke you you you redeemed in [Music] Christ and by the way when did he speak Christ into existence before the found spoke you in him and your name was written the L's book of the foundation of and then you scared oh if I could just keep holding on let me hold on I quit that Longo thank you so much amen I quit that long ago let me hold on hold on you know you're looking at yourself will I never even try in the I just stand L and let him do my sister my brother yourself lose the devil will say you run yourself to death he cannot let you run yourself to stop fearing those demons that have been [Music] tormented the devil works and operates with fear but God works with love and he says he loves you and he L you before you do losing yourself losing yourself why because he holding it is not you holding we need to stop preaching the gospel which makes us save ourselves no one can save themselves hear that brother you cannot save yourself if you say you try there is nothing you can do that can save you that is why God sent the last age to bring a message a message which bring us back into the world that Jesus is our savior someone said when I was sick at that [Music] time when I got over it said did you keep your religion during your I say no sir ITT me that is the difference and that's what happened amen the religion we have is Christ the hope of glory when we are SE it will hold us when we in Temptation will keep many times you try to fall away why are you here because he h you he spped away but why are you here he holding on you even if you try to fall away I dare you you cannot you cannot you canot why because he's holding on you he is holding on us amen hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah Hallelujah someone says let me go and you cannot fall away a SE cannot fall away yes he can fall but he cannot fall away why because when he fall you arise again that's why in M he said when I fall I arise don't don't sin and say it's okay for us we were defeated just accepting it when you fall when you fter don't be relaxed rise up again the strength of a Believer is not in the inability to fall all of you who are looking at you have fallen many times over so don't behave as if you have you have never done anything you have fallen and fallen and but why do you keep coming what is seeking after why because the heart of a child of God you cannot fall away when you fall you arise the power of a Believer is in the ability to fall and Rise a sinner cannot rise again but we are not Sinners we are the redeemed of the Lord that is why you know when people Peter fell he quickly repented and Rose up again but when Judas did the same thing he could not forgive himself he HED himself why his name was trapped off of the he became a himself he could forgive himself but brother I don't have to forgive myself Christ forgave me already and he told me you are not just forgiven you are [Music] redeemed remember when he told me you and [Music] said I don't know where that was only one episode you had others now I'm preaching to my interpreter the name of the Lord but it doesn't matter how many times you reach why are you still here oh why am I here regardless of those EP I am not proud of I am here because I am supposed to be here I was here before those here during those I will be here the devil might as well get used to me you should get used to me I am going nowhere I am I am going nowhere I'm going to be here for a real I'm going to be here even after time itself I'm going to be here in eternity amen come on rejoice church I'm going to be here even during eternity the devil should get used to me templation should get used to me because they will never surely make me fall away I know who I am there is power who there is a power in knowing who you are in the Book of Matthew 3:1 17 I say he says unw a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and John 316 says for God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son that soever believeth in him should not perish but everting life so he says this is my beloved Son so when I say I'm accepted in the Beloved I mean I'm accepted in Christ in joh in John 317 says for God said not his son into the world to condemn the world Jesus is the only one who never came to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name he has not believed in the name have you believed in the name baptized in the name While others are saying I baptize you in the name of [Music] Father for you you believed on in the name and you were baptized in much water in the name above all name the name of the Lord Jesus oh my so we are accepted we are not just [Music] tolerated we are fully embraced and Val you know we have a saying that says accept me the way I am but usually people try to compete to be accepted that's why women use makeup they're trying to be accepted so even when she's ugly she will have to apply as much to make herself ACC that's why true genuine Believers of the word sisters they do not use why they know who they are they know they a fearfully and wonderfully they know and they know men who want to marry them are not looking for outside Beauty as such they are looking for God's character in them that's why our sisters do not use makeup because they already beautiful what has made them beautiful beauty of Christ so they are not trying to compete AC so they see my lips that is not what you're following because you know you already accepted many women were coming to see the king and one of them you know she refused to accept anything extra others were asking for more but when it came down for Esther she said I don't want anything else only want to see the king sister before you get married you don't need to be accepted by other girls or other boys you are seeking for approval don't seek for approval of men seek for approval of God when God approves of you he will bring you his son he himself will bring his son to you you w compete there are sisters who compete for men brother do you know when are you getting getting married she's competing the way I see this brother he has been eying the other sister but the way I see him he should be mine so let me compete the way I see you brother are you really even planning about it is not your [Music] sister to ask a man's hand in marriage Pastor I didn't ask for his hand in marriage I simply asked him when he's marryed so what it is not your place my sister your place is to be approved by God be accepted by God then he will bring you his son he will bring you his son when he has accepted sh amen we don't believe in sisters proposing those ones are in religions you are singles that is true we don't do that Believers we have a way we handle our issues come and ask the pastor and the deacon amen so our sisters are already accepted by God when you are accepted by God then he will get you a very good son someone who will not give you hustle hallelujah hallelujah we are accepted when we accepted by God we it means we are not just tolerated you know when someone tolerates you it means you are bad but it's okay we will see we can I can it's okay I'll see whether they will change God is not like that waiting to see if you don't change he pushes your away if you change no accepted means we are not d we are fully embraced and we are valued by God and there is nothing that you have done to earn that it is fully based on Christ's Merit [Music] Romans 51 there being justified by faith we are justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith we have access say it say I have access I have access access to go where listen into this grace I have access I feel like shouting right now I have access into this gra where I in with [Music] stand I am not just breaking into this grace I am not forcing myself into this I have been given access and I stand here only because he made away for me Howen and I rejoice in the hope of the glory of God Galatians 31 says but that no man is is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith Philippians 3:9 and be found in him not having my own righteousness what I'm saying don't hustle so much about being good no just be who he said you are accept who he said you are and the goodness will come it will not be your goodness it will be his goodness and you will be found in him not having your own rightous which is of the law put on a SC okay okay okay don't do this not done this I've done this you are on rightous because of the law but you are which it says that which is through the Faith of Christ the right which is of god by faith so it's it's the righteousness of God not yours we believe in good in giving believe in put and all those things but we don't force anyone to do them and if anybody says that your church is aw a church of Commandments they don't know what they to I'm going to show we have two seeds there is a seed that will never understand what it can't even grasp the life we have it will try to imitate to but but for that seed it is a it is laws I don't want to come back to your church because you have a lot of laws you be like where are the where are the RO for us is our life it's like telling is like like telling a God I don't want to come back to your pen because for you you don't mingle in mud you have a lot of rules but for us it's okay nothing we can go in Mad have a good time but you are telling a sheep sheep does not understand that language be asking what are you talking about you mean mingling in mud is having a good time and the little piggy would say yes but for you of rules if I were you I would tell little piggy go and enjoy your M let me enjoy my beautiful pen I am here because I have access I am here because I've come here through the access of Grace by [Music] faith I don't go to this school it is not just I don't have the appetite I don't drink Al that because I am resenting I don't have the appetite for alcohol I no longer take women because I'm not a man but it is because I changed when the Holy Spirit came in me he did a work in me and he brought me to be accepted into Christ and to me it is not a law and to me it is a new life Hallelujah Galatians 3:21 is the law then against the promises of God God forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life very righteousness should have been by the Lord but the scripture has concluded all sin that the Promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them them not everybody them that believe before you talk to that person is he believing or is not the promise is to them that believe and in Hebrews chapter 7 1957 says you you quit you quit drinking you quit smoking quit telling Liv you go to church and try to do this and try to do that you are still can these are I told you we getting into these are just some some deep stuff we not in tonight want to finish you want to finish this El and go to the university I'm talking about the spiritual univers not the cular one you quit drinking you quit smoking you quit telling lies you go to church how many have done all that don't need to raise up your hand you are still that is just the law the law makes nothing perfect but what makes perfect I might quit lying quit chewing quit all the things but I'm still God God doesn't receive it because I have nothing to offer him in [Music] prop follow me don't follow me but the minute that I lay my hands upon the Blessed head of the Lord Jesus and I say Lord I am not good see I smoke I lie I drink oh God I am not good I am lustful I go with men I go with God I will you take me as your ser and God kisses away my he kisses oh my my my my I don't leave my sin God kisses my the moment he accepted me he embraced me and he kissed me the kiss of Love kissed away all amen I stand in the sight of God why I not standing on my own marriage I am standing I'm standing on his and he has perfected us through his suffering and his blood praise the Lord now in the sadan church age uh brother B say a few comments to try and speak about the book and he speaks about different names in the book and I want to just s a little portion of it put this whole thing into perspective th if God has so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a seel in a a section of the Lamb Book of Life and cannot those names cannot be erased for they are the names of his then we must accept that there is a section in in the book of life amen I believe the the the chapter of that section is titled the Lamb's Book of Life in there are names of those that are supposed to be his bride and those names can never be by the way this enti message is all about seeking for the bright that's why I'm preaching something like like this it is impossible to fall away it is impossible to be lost it is impossible to be deceived if it be possible they shall deceive the very the elect cannot be dece you mean Pastor should walk bragging yes walking in me I brag of nothing except in Christ amen I Christ so I can walk as a child of God and I I'm a child of a king I will never fall I never see to hell yes sir the devil cannot understand that I'm going to heaven I'm the rapure I know what I am that is not that is not Pride it is busting in Christ it is busting in Christ oh Hallelujah hallelu Believers we should learn to yes sir so if it also states that there are those whose names were placed in the record of the book of life but in the for knowledge of God those were to fall and have their names removed we must also accept them it was not in the other section it was just in the general book but their names were removed because they fell one of them is brother Judas he fell but can fall amen you remember when Jesus told them Rejoice because your names are on the book Judah was among them but he fell and his name was but God knew that also and if there are those whose names were never placed upon a record of life we must also accept [Music] them by the way there are also some whose names are not there which means this is scary but listen which means they can never be I'm going to give you an example today from the Bible no matter what you do they cannot be their names are not on the record of [Music] life you find them nowhere they don't even come out at the their names are not they of another seed we are going to say them they cannot be accepted no matter what you do no matter what they do these things when you know them brings you to a place say God I can't understand everything and why everything is that but all I understand is that you love me and that's enough for me and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white thr judgment Solly on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of God who are his brethren then we have to accept that so there are some I don't know where where their names are we don't know we don't know all we know is that they receive eternal life simply because they good to the Brethren when we are you naked and we fed you when we are in the hospital and we visit for as much as you did unto these little you did it unto me so there's that category we don't know where thees are all I know they receive life now you will know why God said to K we going to read it if you will do good who knoweth the mind of the Lord that he should instruct him rather let us be subject in faith to him who is our father and we should leave you can now turn to Genesis 4 I to show you what God spoke to Cain this is a brother we call him a brother but actually his name was not the book he just uh it's just mindboggling if you want Genesis 4:3 from 3 to 7 and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel also brought of the fast fatlings of his flock and of the fat there over the Lord had respect unto Abel unto his offering but unto Cain unto his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy gness Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted but if thou doest not well sin life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou sh rule over him [Music] hallelujah hallelujah did you read read from vers 3 to vers 7 of Genesis chapter 4 [Music] friends I want you to follow me here we are now going the CLX of this um we see there are two seeds here Twi twins but you see later on we also see other twins Bible es and Jacob now the Bible says God hated es and he loved who when when did go do that what did what did es do that made God Hur him what did what did AB do I mean jaob was as B because remember when he they were both born they were even fighting when they were in the womb and when he was born you know he was a supplanter he was not a good guy he was a cheat I'm talking about Jacob you know we can go in the story but you see what made God love Jacob and what the same thing that made him do that is the same thing that made him love you not because you were perfect he he loved you actually before you even manifested good or bad it's called predestination you were in his mind when you come to the world you have a desire you have a longing the body is doing things as everybody you are you are longing for something yet others had not long for their longing was the B you wanted to be filled with the Holy Ghost you wanted to be changed you are seeking for something no can give you others can exchange it for anything but you could not exchange it for anything all you wanted is a chain you felt you were something in your heart that you were not on the outside and you had a lot of fear but if you knew by the if you get what you desired would wash away all the fear I'm talking about jaob and that's why Jacob when he got that birth it was a best of of everything in his life he led him to the Angel and the angel came and they wrestled they wrestled they wrestled and he say leave me the day breaker he said as God leave I will not leave you I want something so what do you want I need a name change I need a blessing Bless Me Now oh I don't let go of you that's why we think that's why we think it is us who s God because we are seeing ourselves like jaob you know I prayed and I prayed and I prayed I held on to the man I told him until you bless me and then you blessed me if I had not prayed it is true but it is false because God loved Jacob before he prayed God loved Jacob before Jacob knew anything about life and everything was leading to that moment God allowed things to go the way they have been going in your life even sin has been in your life so that glory to God so that when the word comes it will have an effect on you that you will be convicted say oh God bless me now change me now it wasn't you seeking the whole thing was God seeking you and then eventually his name was changed he said your name has been changed from a jaob to Israel Prince with God you are royalty when did he become royalty from before the foundation of the world from before he was born he was royalty the Bible says that we are also Kings and priest so weyty don't with me I am a must not pray with you you are a PRI you are a priest amen when the world say you think you're something what do you mean of course I'm I'm something good of course yeah I just don't think I know it because I am a prince I am a princess and that's why we see Kan same thing Kan was born by Eve and ab was born by Eve out of the same womb they were twins but they were two different seats we see that both of them gave offerings God rejected offering of of Cain and they accepted the offering of and Cain was angry he was so sad and angry you know the spirit of competition is usually the spirit of can children of God don't always mind about what others have what others have got because they know they are the blessing of God whatever God purpose for you to achieve in life no one can steal it away from you if a brother buys a car you have no reason to be angry you just be happy but some people on the outside they go behind the car when dedicating the car we are saying let us dedicate the car of the brother you're very busy also now what about competition don't about yourself what is yours is yours no one can ever take away what is belongs to you your blessing is coming be careful about the things that I said on the pulpit because they happen so if the word was your blessing is coming and you believe it it will come and and was was happy but Cain was not God asked him a question God came that day he was the preacher of the day the church was full Eve and other sisters we don't know church was full songs were s offerings were given after offering God come he doesn't need to read a Bible because he the book and then when he looks through the church he Sayes brother Kan very angry in the corner and he brother very happy and he says church today my sermon is if thou doest well shall not thee be accepted and you know those preachers who call names of people sometimes the pastor can call you exactly when he's talking about the thing that belongs to you you think did someone tell no it is always discernment when a pastor a preacher is preaching he prophesying he doesn't know but he's prophesying you you know and so he begins he says for example brother Kan my son only do well if you do well like your brother will you not be accepted will I not be accepted you is God a liar God is never a liar if he said it he meant it but did believe it no after the seron that day brother Kan was in the church saying amen am for sure I will do good his tears were not out of conviction was out of sadness that he was not accepted amen even no problem said the church is dismissed when they dismissed the service went to brother he said brother yes my brother bless you brother be they if you he somebody saying theyed not the word was roting stop saying they roed us said they roed me because God knows you you know now my brother I have an idea since God accepted you and he also the word came to me said that if I also do what I take me to the field let me see how you do your business so that I can also Lear you know me I'm a farmer and you know me I believe that even you know this is problem with and I want you to see it and then I'll finish CU I'm going to read so listen carefully so he said farmer you so God loves what you are doing so teach me there no problem not everyone that says teach me wants to learn always design the spirit brother Abel accepts him they go in the field and then while he was showing him now you see now when you take this what are you talking about in his does it mean it has to be sheep in Anger he gets where the other brother was showing you know the brother was happy just you know naive not knowing that this brother is a different seity they are not children of the same father got the stone said you see show me brother what have you done let me ask a question do we see people killing this people the same today the spirit of is not there I'll leave that there and then after that God comes down what have you done nothing Hallelujah but God has seen everything but I want to us talk about this what was the problem why did God not accept K's offering why did he accept AB I will restore unto you say the Lord in that message now in these two in there there are these two [Music] boys one of them Kan and another both of them were Believers that yes sir both of them believed in God and if Faith had had sorry and if faith and belief in God is all God requires then if God condemned Cain and accepted Abel and both of them believe as God is unjust that's right because both of them was Believers you hear some people said today the only thing you have to do is to believe just believe we B become a member of the church that's enough no it is not enough that's just to begin someone said brother what about Abraham Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him right that's true Abraham believed but God gave him the Seal of circumcision as a testimony that he had confirmed his faith and today a man can believe unto God for eternal life and he gives him the Holy Ghost as a circumcision as a confirmation of his Fai so in other words after believing you have to be filled with the Holy amen okay now notice in Genesis then I could see both boys wanted to find favor with God now Kan is not a communist neither is he an unbeliever he's a Believer and a worshiper now there is not a starting now I'm going to use these two microphones here this afternoon as two trees both boys you say this is Abel and that's both boys come up to God the east side of the garden I suppose and as these two boys come up they both come up to worship God both of them is that right Bible scholars both boys come to worship and both of them built an altar that would be a church both of them had churches so watch out has a church today and so the church you belong to is it that of or if God is satisfied and all it takes to belong if you belong to church and be a believer and belong to church you think that that's what god isied with watch just a minute not only that but both boys offer a sacrifice then if being a Believer a Confessor and a church member making a sacrifice if that is all of the experience you got you haven't got anywhere yet now you may be very fundamental but that don't mean anything now Kan belonged to church he confessed he believed on God he wasn't a hypocrite let us pause there Kan was not a hypocrite can you imagine that brother he I wonder whether everyone here is sincere but Kan was sincere so if you're not sincere you don't even qualify to be a Kan that is a hard saying isn't it all right let's continue here he wasn't a HP he believed God he worshiped God and he belonged to church an altar he brought a sacrifice and offered it and knelt down and prayed and made his confession brother if that ain't a good church member of this I don't know where ones at but that was not it AB done the same thing why did God receive Abel and condemn how many want to know why because had recompense unto the real world because Abel had a spiritual Revelation a spiritual revelation of the will of God can you say Amen AB had spiritual Revelation spiritual Revelation everybody say spiritual Revelation that is what you need that's what cannot have spiritual [Music] Revelation Jesus said upon this Ro I build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against what rock spiritual revelation of who Jesus Christ is if you have a revelation of who Jesus is then you must have a revelation of who you are and and Jesus yes built his church on so did not have Revelation remember they didn't have no book to read from they only had to have revelation of how to approach God and how to worship God how did Sin come into the world now don't miss this don't miss this how did Sin come into the world by mixing blood of the serpent with that of the human [Music] being and it brought forth a [Music] child and his name was brother did you know that was not the son of when you go into the genealogy of Adam you can't find kind there you find say as the first one because killed and the Bible says replaced amen now the geny of Adam it is like this God cream gave birth to se SE gave birth to is not but he also has his genology in the New Testament joh the Bible says that he was the son of the evil one who is the evil one it is Satan sin came through Bloodshed and sin cannot be dealt with without the shedding of blood you hear that now got the Revelation when he he shouted Hallelujah yes sir it was the blood which Jesus he went and slaughtered the L and he broke it broke blood gashed out and he burn it when it went before son the ration he has understood the Myster how sin came in the world he has got the Revelation how sin will leave the world he has killed the lamb because that ration he has known that in the future even me God I'm going to put on flesh die like a lamb AB has Revelation when he when he smelt of blood says surely that is my child but but was like the way I see my mother must have ate an apple it was an apple and he took all the apples and the PE if it wasn't Apple it must have been if it must have been watermelon orange or something one of the fruits he displayed all the fruits there he said God I've really now receive my offering it must have been Apple and he gave it what seed is that had no re because he was not a seed of God but God is SE has the revelation of the word amen hallelujah amen even today religions they still think that Eve ate an apple what is that they can't explain why the Bible says without Shing of blood there is no remission they don't know why they don't know why Jesus had to die they don't know why blood had to be shed they can't understand that it was because sin came into the World by shedding a mixing of blood thaten must go away by the shedding of blood of the innocent they don't understand that but the true seed understands it and that seed has been accepted in the Beloved that's why in Hebrews 11 by faith AB offered unto God a more excellent Sacrifice by what by what faith what is Faith Revelation by spiritual revelation my church don't don't sleep now don't sleep I'm finishing in a few minutes what is faith faith is a spiritual revelation of the will of God so Faith perfect and by faith offered unto God a more excellent you know and Abel didn't have a bible to read but it was revealed to Abel by Fai which is a revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of K which God testified that he was righteous a Believer does everything that she does by revation reation they gave sacrifices but one didn't have Revelation brother if you ever give God a sacrifice give by Revelation don't give by that's why we don't believe in in pumping people to give pulling for money is see that remaining in the B it give it that you get a blessing I would have been a good pentec preacher I would have pulled the man out of you but I thank God that he saved me the man can speak and say this is God surely surely this is God God is seeing it give it give it give it the blessing is coming is coming I see is knocking on your door and you pull out everything the blessing is coming but you see that's not by Revelation give by Revelation and others when they hear that because I don't have Revelation yet if you don't have revelation are not a seed of God a seed of God must always have Revelation the church is built upon revelation God cannot if the need if there is a need of 500,000 and you have two million I can assure you of this God cannot reveal to you to give 1 is impossible at least he will tell you pay it all and you see such people they begin to prosper why they doing things by the not by pushing foring no it is by Revelation and they do it cheerfully joyfully not for if you do ever do anything by Revelation expect a blessing in return if you're serving in Ministry Serve by re we don't want you to just come here to because you're gifted no no there millions of gifted people in the world but if you you Minister whether you're a musician or a preacher whatever if you Minister for any other reason apart from revelation God is is smelling a stench St in his no he's not happy with your sacrifice he wants re in your ministry to the extent Paul said this why unto me if I preach not the gospel because Paul had a revelation he was given the [Music] responsibility when God gave him the gift and he gave him the calling it was not for him sometimes some of us preachers we feel like you know maybe first going in a holiday of one year or two years but you don't even remember when When the Thought comes and flashes and disappears why because you have a sense of responsibility on your [Music] shoulders even if the government said now no more preaching that's why the president of this country is very white he has protected the church and in that way God has also protected him on the if you want to see fire stop us and I'm meaning it you cannot stop the church because there are some people like us who are radical you have said no preaching okay let us die preaching have to be same and if you stop us that you don't even go on the streets we shall do it I remember when I was in China I would never forget that experience and I remember says a man under pressure is who he is under pressure when you under pressure that's when you discover who you are me I discovered who I was when I was in a situation in China when they arrest you preaching as a foreigner there so I'm in a about 20 something five floors up in a believer's home the word has called fire preaching and the brother is interpreting in Chinese and then we hear a knock in just a split of a second the people had already he the Bible I don't know how when I looked I didn't see apart from only and The Interpreter now I told him what's happening he said I think it's the government and brother you will go to jail I don't know what happened just a moment something came over me I told the brother let's preach on my mind I made up my mind if I have to go to jail and eventually die let me not die as a coward let me die when I'm preaching it as hardest as I can yes sir that's why the apostles God manifested himself in great power signs and wonders to the ex their Shadows can heal the sick they could ra the dead they were operating under's anointing because they were ready to submit to the calling they had a revelation of who they were are what they were supposed to do the calling of God upon their life they did not allow any man to play with it this is my calling this is the gift of God in my life this is my anointing I am born for this purpose and they took them before the judges before pent and one day Paul was put there they told him all right before King agria and I said you can now go but don't preach again in the name of Jesus did he stop did he stop I'm fearing now since they arrested me he did it more and more and more now I'm telling you revelation will behave make you behave crazy that you are playing an instrument someone offends you no Revelation because you came to interpret I gotry there is a problem no Revelation may God give us people in the ministry that have revelation of why they here all of you are ministers all of you mothers be a mother by Revelation husband be a husband by Revelation wife be a wife by re everyone should do what you doing by Revelation spiritual Revelation the church is built upon that foundation and he said the GS of hell not Prevail against it as long as you are on the basis on the foundation of spiritual Revelation Satan will try but he can't finish you Satan will try to get at you but he will not finish you why you are on a solid foundation on a solid foundation hallelujah sister Esther nice to see you is that es she looks like Esther God bless you you are founded on spiritual [Music] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah we'll continue from there on your feet give the Lord a clap of Praises we need Revelation if you have that spiritual revelation it is revealed to you you are accepted in the Beloved what we are preaching is a revelation how many here are saved you saved it up why your hand is still up if I told you you are not saved and you are going to hell some will begin I think he's right but you you when you hear it you just put it out here I stand the blood of Jesus has washed my sins away I know I am saved amen God bless you why because you have Revelation it is revealed to you that you are accepted in the Bel my hallelujah hallelujah I not so glad to know who you are in Christ to know where you stand may God help us to understand that to know it's nothing to do with us it has everything to do with him brother ranas can you come and sing that song again about Calvary and I want you to sing it with Revelation Amen brother Marin you have words oh hallelujah thank you Jesus [Music] s and

get his visa on time so that's why he did not come I saw he was announced uh brother Pastor Jonathan Martin Jonathan Martin from USA from us so uh really this convention convention are usually a blessing these conventions are usually a blessing whenever you hear Believers Gathering you always want to be a part of and also support so we want to support as a church so that's why we are making
