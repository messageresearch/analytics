Oh, isn't it wonderful? [Music] So, he deserves worship. He deserves worship in our hearts. Worship is not so much of what you say. That is an expression of it. but you see worship happens on the on the throne of your heart state you are in it goes beyond the feelings of the body to what is on your heart [Music] what you believe he has done for you and you feel that he he deserves to be washed and then even if your body doesn't feel like it. You just lift up your hand, close your eyes and [Music] take the glory. Take the praise. I want all of you to speak with all your heart. Brother, [Music] let's come and take the Hallelujah.

It's all about listening to this. Listen, church. Amen. Why don't you close your eyes and worship me? &gt;&gt; I want to tell you friends, each of us has our own issues. But can we let this moment be about him? We have come here at the church Sunday morning. We want this moment our feelings and our problems. Give it all up. Let this be all about you. Let him be seen in your life. Let it never be confused. No matter what you're going through, you can lift up your hands. I'm coming back to It's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry for all the things that [Music] all about you about you know you about Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord. Christ about you, Jesus. It's all about me. It's all about you. It's all about Jesus. Tell him it's all about you. It's all about you. It's all about you. [Applause] It's all about you, Jesus. [Music] What did you do? [Applause] Follow me. [Music] [Applause] [Music] This is all about you. It's all about me. It's all about you, Jesus. [Music] Oh, have you ever been there feeling like worshiping him and everything? Like you keep repeating those words and in his presence. The more you say it, the more you sing it, the more he knows you. [Applause] [Music] The more words become real to you. [Music] [Music] Lord Jesus, we are here Lord. Our hearts are surrendered to you. The deepest of sincerity. Take all the glory. Take all your horn. Take all your worship &gt;&gt; that you may be seen &gt;&gt; that you may be known in our lives. the Lord. It will come to that moment, that place where everything else will fade away where we will no longer see ourselves, but we will see you, where we no longer see our brothers and our sisters. Lord, if we look at one another, we are so full of imperfection. We are so full of bad things. Oh God, when we look at you is all about Christ. Then we can see God in our see God in our system and all the other things do not matter because in your presence there is fullness of Lord Jesus take all my brothers and sisters that have come here today Lord may you oh God take them away they will cease to be seen Even they will cease to see themselves that you may be seen. Be seen in our worship. Be seen Lord as we hear the word. May it reveal Lord this mystery to us of what it is that you have done in this house. Somebody may say, "Lord, I feel dry." Doesn't matter how they feel. Your word is here to revive the dry, to revive the sinner, to heal the sick. Amen. You are here, Lord. and you're going to speak to us through your word to do the mighty works, the mighty miracles in our ministry. Father, we commit this service, the preaching of your word, however short it is, Father, Father, may we see you. May the people not simply may see you Lord. granted father in Jesus mighty name we pray and Amen. God bless you saints. It's a blessing to be in the house of the Lord once again to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. Can you turn to your neighbor? Tell them what Amen. received greetings from brother Brian. He told me he called me said he's in Hindi. &gt;&gt; So try to connect him the believers there and he's working there. So if you go working in a place always get in touch with us so we can connect you with the church. believer has to go to church every service. We have our two visitors that have not been welcome. &gt;&gt; Yes. Can you raise up your God bless you? Welcome. God bless you, brother Henry. God bless you so much. And before we go to the word, I just wanted to say sister Susan called me the other day and told me the gentleman that gave us the contact of the owner of the land um you know called her and said well you did not ask for money and he gave me little money so I want you to team up with me we go to the sale of the land we say that we want all both of us to be paid So that uh they can also give you and also we the increase at least 5 millions. And the sister went to with the owner of the land and all this. And she said to them, "Uh, no me. Uh, this is my church. Yes, I directed the church there, but not to be paid. because we are we are the ones collecting the money to buy the land. So I cannot be paid and uh you know I I think we need we we she deserves to you know be thanked for that sister Susan. God bless you for that knowing that this you're not doing this for me any individual here but for the sake of the work of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are only stewards. A pastor is a steward. You are stewards of the word that God has given. But we don't own anything. Even the land we are going to buy. None of us is going to own it. The church is going to own it. And and because we we we believe it's not only for us who are here. If the Lord tries for our children, for their children, our children, if the Lord tries, but if he comes quick, well, we don't care what happens to praise the name of God. Amen. Shall we stand up on our feet and still standing sitting? We reading in Colossians chapter 1 26. Brother, brother Baka, you always surprise me when I don't expect you and then I bless you so much. I'm always happy to see you, too. Amen. Amen. Uh Colossians chapter 1 vers 26. [Music] If you're there, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was just around it. But this is a new Bible and I was wondering it was just stuck in these pages. &gt;&gt; Chapter 1 vers 26. Um we could actually begin from up but uh for the for our reading let's just read from even the mystery which has been heed from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom God would make known what's the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus, where unto I also labor striving according to his working, which workketh in me mighty. Fore! [Music] Foreign! Foreign! [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. May God bless the reading of his word. I see some of us are making it a trend to be to be late. Just for a reminder here at DVF, we really try to keep time. We are not yet there, but we try our best. The service begins 10 sharp. But you know, you notice if you the majority are late, then somehow the service is a bit dragged and it's not a good thing. So the song leader is always here. Uh the musicians are always here 30 minutes before. at exactly 10 the service. So whether you are late or not, the service will not wait for you. But if you come late, you will not be in the spirit of the service. [Music] Somehow you you will not enjoy the service. Try to always try make it a culture that you always come 30 minutes before 10 and come and be here in silent prayers. You read the word, you meditate. When the song leader begins, before even the word, you already feeling blessed. And uh by one, I mean we'll we go after everything. I I feel that that can be edifying. I don't believe in dragging a service 3 four hours. You see, but we need to be in the same spirit when we do that. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen if we agree with you? &gt;&gt; Um, so brother Isaac, I'm still continuing. But today we are speaking on God having preeminence in his bride. So really our subject or our our title is our true origin. But um I mean you can finish a year on that. I don't have to remind you that every service but every service we really have a subject that so today we are speaking on God having preeminence in his bride. God having God having preeminence in his bride. Yeah. these things, you know, when you mess up one word, it's all gone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You clap for our brother here. Clap for him. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's a lot of things and uh and um just if you give me your undivided attention and um you will help me preach then I'm sure within a short time the Lord will speak to you and then we can have a short quick work this morning and then off you go and we worship and then you go. Amen. How many love the word of God? Amen. You know, I've I've seen that the bride loves the word. The bride loves the world. Amen. No matter which color, no matter which race, no matter where you are from. Listen, I've traveled around the world and I've seen one thing. And the bride loves the world more than anything else. And that's what makes us different from the the rest of the world. So now we see what I'm sharing on today is like what I can call the main purpose of the message. [Music] The main purpose of the message like we are talking about God resto restoring the relationship between God and man. When that relationship between God and man is restored, then God is going to have preeminence in that man whose relationship with God has been restored. Because you see that man has already found out where he came from. That man has already recognized his true identity. And therefore, it's no longer him. It's no longer about him. It's all about God. How many have ever listened to the message titled, "Why are we not a denomination?" Okay. Most of the majority have not go back at home and listen to that. It is the one of the very first I listened to when I came to the message and it's a very good message. I wanted to understand why are they always saying they are not a denominator. They saying they message believers and they are not Catholics. They not Anglicans Pentecostals and they are not Adventists. So what are they? So I wanted to know that's why I want to listen to that message. And um so when you you you'll understand when you you talk about God having preeminence in his bride, you will understand why we are not a denomination. You will understand who we are. What we are representing. May God help you to understand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, are you following me? May God help you to understand. Praise the name of the Lord. We have many big denominations but the purpose of God has never been to start any. God has never started any denomination. Denominations were started by man. And when Jesus came on earth, he came only for one purpose to bridge the gap between man and God to remove that gap whereby all those that were in the mind of God were now lost. lost in his sin, you know, uh can be restored. Now when they restored, he can now be again seen in them. Do you know when we are born, God cannot be seen in us? Think about the things you do. Think about the things you did before you received the Holy Spirit. Think about your life. And now ask yourself a question. How did it glorify God? It did not glorify God. Going to a disco club does not glorify God. Going to drink does not glorify God. going to do this and other glorify God going to pray you know a lossary hail Mary mother of God does not glorify God but you see God had a purpose and he wanted to be glorified he wanted to restore what we call the glory because the Bible says for all had sinned and all came short of that glory. So the purpose of God is to bring back that glory which was lost in the beginning which Adam had lost when he lost but God in himself that that glory must be restored. Amen. and it must be restored again, not to everybody, but to him that lost it. And that was man. Now, let's take it slowly here. Second Corinthians, we read this again, but let let us read it. Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me. For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy. For I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chest virgin to Christ. Praise the name of the Lord. I know some of you were in overnight and and you do not have good sleep since then. But please, you have come. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil rob you came for the last time I doed in church many many years ago. I went to church and I had never doed before. Not even in the Anglican church. I was not losing. It was me. Whenever I went to church, I really did not want to lose anything. I sat in church and then I realized my eyes were closing. I did like this. And when I first when I turned to my neighbor, I found my neighbor dozing. I just Oh, this is why. So I got up from there and I searched another place and that was the last time I do because I found out a second that if you doze it is because maybe sometimes you are seated next to a person who is dozing. So look around neighbors make sure they sober. If you feel that you are becoming tired and sleepy, immediately look around you. It's okay if you want to change a seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I want you to see second Corinthians here. Paul was not saying I brought you to my denomination. I brought you to my church that you may become church members. That's why here we say we have no book but the Bible. We have no law but love. And then we say we have no membership but fellowship. So we we we are not yet registered members so that our headquarter can know I am doing a good job. We are not registering members. No one knows how many believers of this message are in the whole world. The Bible says the secret is God knoweth them that are he. We don't need to count believers because even sometimes those who claim they are, they are not. Oh my. And those who think they are not, they are actually messages. Some of them right now they are in the Catholic shrine. They think they Catholics but they are going to come. How many were Catholics? Look, look those hands. You were there but you came out. How many Anglicans? I'm one of them. You see? So we are hungry but we are here. How many Adventists here? Lift up your hand. No, no hand. No Adventist here. We must have a representative. How many Pentecostals? &gt;&gt; Okay. Right behind there. Even is another hand. Raise it up, brother. Yes. Over here. You see all the denominations? I can now go and continue in all these other denominations. There is something I'm trying to to get to you. This message came to call out the seed out of all denominations, not to build another denomination. Paul says, I have exposed you to one husband that I may present you as just as a just virgin to Christ. But Paul had a fear in his heart. He said, "I fear less by any means as a serpent beguiled Eve through his subility. So your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity." [Music] Are you following me? The simplicity that is in Christ. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor the simplicity that is in Christ. &gt;&gt; The simplicity that is in Christ. &gt;&gt; Did you know what denominations have done? Oh my. May God help us to get this. Denominations have complicated Christianity. They have made it so hard to be a Christian. They told you if you are not a member of our denomination you are not a Christian. You are the only ones who are right and everybody else is false. You are either in our denomination or you are not going in a rap. But you see each of those denominations presented it that way. It was about them but never about Christ. And that's why God sends messengers in every generation. The purpose of the messenger is to drag it from the denominations. It's no longer about any church. It's no longer about any preacher. It's no longer about any denomination. It is now about Christ. And this is what Paul is trying to say here. So glad that I believe Paul's message. I'm so glad. I believe the message of brother. &gt;&gt; You know what it has helped me to see has taken me back again. The simplicity is in Christ Jesus. Let no man defile your mind and tie you to themselves. Today I'm going to deal with some things. May God help us to themselves and try to say if you leave me you have left Christ. No Christ is no longer tied to an organization. Christ is no longer tied to a church. Christ is tied to one thing, the word. Amen. And by the way, this is the purpose of the message. You know the purpose of the message by lose them and let them go. So we have been loosed. We were in the tombs of a region. We were tied down. We were imbalmed. And we were in the tombs there. When we heard the voice, &gt;&gt; what was it? A shout of Lazarus come out. &gt;&gt; You know, I heard my name and we had we we we already learned how we hear our name. When we hear the revelation of the word the mysteries of the word when they unveiled as they are unveiling then you hear your name how by the revelation in that revealed you hear your name here I was in in in the anglicant to home but when I add my name. I came out. I came out and here I am. Where am I? I am back again to the simplicity that is in Christ. [Applause] Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So do not let anyone be you and spill your minds, corrupt your minds. For if he that preach comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached or if he receive another spirit which he have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted ye might well bear with him. Let me pause this for a moment. We've had people who increasingly say just preach what you believe. Don't talk about where you came from. It looks like as if you're talking against those people. No, we are not talking against anybody. We're talking about the systems which had tied us down. You talk about Lazarus, tell me brother, who could tell Lazarus, don't talk about the tomb. &gt;&gt; Is it possible? I believe from the time he came out to the time he died, he he was giving a testimony of how he was made alive of how he was quickened. But you see, you could only give that testimony without talking about the grave where he was. He said, "I was bound. I was in the grave. But he called me out and he quickened me up. Now I am alive. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so Paul's work was to introduce the church to Christ. It was to introduce the church to Christ. 1 Corinthians 1:12. Please allow me to study this with me. Slowly slowly as you get it and as you have an open vers. Now this I say that every one of you saith, I am of Paul and I of Apollo and I of Ke and I of Christ. Are you hearing me? You are not hearing me right. I want you to respond. Are you hearing what I'm saying? I know you are hearing but I'm saying are you following now? Here you see Paul is saying something here. Some of you are saying you're of Keas, you're of Apollos, you are of Paul and and some of you say you're of Christ. And then he asks a question. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? He said, "I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Chris and gasas, lest any should say that I baptized in my own name, and I baptized also the house of of Stephanus. Besides that, I know not whether I baptize anyone. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of anything. Now, there's a lot of things in there. But I want you to remember talks about Paul's manner of ministry. And he says that Paul's manner of ministry set the pattern. We have a lot of stereo here. Can you bring it down? It says it set the pattern for all future messengers of the air and for all ministers of the god. Paul's manner of ministry. How was Paul's manner of ministry? It had three things. Paul was true to the word. He never deviated from the word. Number one. Number two. Paul had vindication manifestation within his ministry. things which were seen, things which were known by others by seeing, things that God did. Those manifest to prove that God is with him. Then the third level, Paul had evident fruit of his ministry. Not to say, well, I've gone to preach and there's no one believing. There were souls that believed the gospel. Paul preached one God. Paul preached baptism in Jesus. Paul did not believe the trinity. Paul believed the Sabbath is receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Paul told that tong should be spoken in church but with interpretation. And Paul taught many other things. But you see, he declared that uh that you cannot again make a camp or a denomination. You know, because he's saying some say they are of Apollo, some say they are of Paulo Keas and this and that. He's saying, "Brethren, my message did not come to make camps. My message did not come to start denomination. The purpose of my message by the way transport yourself and take yourself back in those days and understand it was not only Paul, there were other preachers. was a preacher. Was a preacher. And maybe there were even better preachers than Paul. Paul was a messenger of the earth. And then he says, "Me, my message. I was not sent to start a denomination. I was not sent to start a camp. The purpose of my message was to bring people back again to Christ. &gt;&gt; To bring, let me say, put it this way, bring the seed of God into a saving relationship with Christ by what? By the preaching of God. This is true today. Amen. This is true today. The purpose of the message of Yahweh, always give me that picture because you know there's I'm referring to seven messengers. The purpose of the message today is not so that Paul or William Brham can make his own come. Do you know that some people have made this message look like a cow? They want to show that everything they are preaching is out of this world. They want to present the message as something entirely new. Allow me to help you this morning. The message is not something new. The purpose of the message was to finish the mystery. not to start it. It has always been here. Messengers of different ages have been preaching the same things. But in our generation, the last messenger comes to tie the loser. Can you imagine? There are people who are currently saying, "Oh, brother is not a true prophet." Oh, when I was reading his books, I found that he he said the same things that another preacher had. I thought he received his teachings by supernatural imposition. Let me tell you brother don't be deceived. Brother Bon himself said he read books of other preacher. He even mentions those preacher. He says he read it. He studied it. And then he says but I disagree with them on this and this and this and that. M but I agree with them here where they got it right. So as a prophet of the age he how did he tie the loose ends? How did he tie the loose end? Yes. Uhhuh. How did he do that? by identifying where God had spoken and by showing us where man was misleading us. He dissected the thing and brought it to a an a wonderful conclusion. And the message we have today, it was given by God. What is it? It is Christ. The message is not something complicated. The message is Christ. &gt;&gt; The message is Christ. &gt;&gt; It is not some complicated. There are people who want to preach everything they preaching. They're saying the mystery, the mystery, the mystery. until you are in the message. But every time your head is going in circles and you don't even understand it yourself, but but because the way they have presented it to you, it looks so complicated and because it is complicated, you think it is true. And then when someone asks you what is the message of Yahweh brother God sent a prophet and the message is true. Can can you first calm down and understand the message is not the prophet. [Music] Am I hurting some of you? The message is not the prophet. The message is Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. Jesus Christ yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; Why does he send his men? send them to come and finish what he started and bring us into a saving relation said what are you saying Christ divided meaning I don't care who is preaching. As long as they're preaching the word, I believe what they saying, I follow what they are saying. But the moment they walk away from the word from that day, I walk away from them. And Paul said follow me as I follow Christ. So we are following Christ. When we follow Paul, we are following Christ. &gt;&gt; When we follow Brham, &gt;&gt; as long as what is teaching is the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you beginning to see it now? So now is the same thing today. This message is not for starting. Come. Amen. What is a denomination? Let me define it to you in a very simple way. A denomination is a group of people that organize and close everybody out. If you are not with them, you are lost. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what they claim to believe. That's a denomination. But what is the message? &gt;&gt; The message is not about us. It's not about our church. It's not about our organization. It's not about our pastor. It's not about our prophet. Is about Christ. Amen. So whenever you see a group organizing organizing organizing around something else that is a denomination you know what they do they have a set of doctrines believe this and this and this and this came and said well as as far as We are concerned. &gt;&gt; We believe in this and this and this and this and this and everything else the Holy Spirit will reveal to us. Our revelation is not closed. Come on DVF help me to preach to you this morning. Our revelation has not ended. Revelation is continuous because you cannot finish God. The word of God the unarchable riches unarchable riches. Where are they? They are in Christ. So you cannot finish it. And that is why we are not a denomination. Everybody is welcome. We have no membership but we have fellowship one with another. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there is no small use and big use saying oh Paul is a big preacher but Julius is a very small there is nothing like that. I fear that so many have started their own denomination yet they still claim to believe the message. They are not message believers. They have their own denomination. A true message believer you will know it's about Christ. Every minister ordained of the Lord will be focused on that one thing. that Christ, Amen, may have the preemin on this Sunday morning. I did not come with the attitude that let me go and show them I know something. Let me go and show them I know how to preach. That's not what it's all about. What a preacher does. A sincere preacher of the gospel. He will say let me go and for adventure Lord you will help me to make them see you. That's the purpose of preaching the gospel that we might bring you into a saving relationship with you. And Paul said, "Husbands, love your wives as also Christ loved the church. And he gave himself for it that you might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the blood that he may present it to himself a glorious church without having spot wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish. I want two things I want us to see there. He sanctifies &gt;&gt; and cleanses the church. Who does that? &gt;&gt; Christ. He sanctifies. Who is the church? I am the church. You are the church. He sanctifies you and cleanses you. Oh, let me pause that right now. You cannot sanctify yourself. You cannot cleanse yourself. And many of you try to do it. And many preachers try to do it. How do they try to do it? The preachers try to do it by by teaching legalism. You must do this and this and this and the people try to do it. I have no doubt. I have so many here trying hard. Brother, you are trying hard to live a better life. Sister, are you not trying hard? And then sometimes you come to the person say, "Pastor, it's not working out. Do you know I even made I said, "Oh Lord, I'm not going to do this. I'm going to do things like this. But every time I keep going and you're like, "But is it even possible? Is it even possible really live according to what they want and some people made conclusion and they said it is not possible, let me live my life. No, I'm not going to kill myself. After all, that is how I feel. I've tried but it has failed. But before I finish the word, when I see the next God, I all melt down. For that cause it will not be possible. Probably a serpent seed. God does not speak no sense. There must be somebody speaking like that. Now believers help me to preach this. I'm going to tell you why you are that way. Afterwards I give you a solution you are that way. Because you are you are you are trying to sanctify yourself. You are trying to cleanse yourself. But I will have you know there's nothing you have within yourself to cleanse yourself. If you did Christ died in vain but I will give you a solution this morning. Amen. What do you have to do? Submit yourself to the word of God. Why? Because what Christ does, &gt;&gt; he came and died on the cross and then he shed his blood and that blood is the bre bleach that removes every stain. I have a desire for sin. a bloody soft that anyone goes and dips himself. He will always be made white as snow. Even if they were sinners, he says come. Even if you have sin that is as red as color to wash yourself. Come and dip yourself. Oh well crimson is a flow. Amen. Washes me white as nothing other than the blood of Jesus. But the blood of Jesus is here right now in the form of the word in the form of a revealed word. Listen church. If there was no Amen. A don't know how you want to call it like a lock. If there was no God, everybody would access the blood. And I will tell you, brother, everybody that accesses the blood. You go in the rapture, but not everybody's going in the not everybody has access. Why? Because the thing was the mystery of Christ. has been hidden away in all generations in all ages. But in the days of the voice of the son of angels begin mystery. And when that mystery is finished, glory is restored. When the glory is restored, then you are sanctified. Then you are clean. How? by spiritual revelation. It comes to you, by hearing from the open book. What is the open book? The open book is the message of the angel of your day. All the others are preaching from a closed book. Paul in his day preach from an open book. If I may want to bring it that way, but we know in our day, we are preaching from an open book. The word, the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, the revealed word of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, can we now go back &gt;&gt; that he might sanctify you &gt;&gt; and cleanse you. Amen. With the washing of the water by the word, you now see that is the word that we will wash and cleanse. So whenever we sing, oh precious, God makes me If you reject the word, the floor can't wash you. So there are many who are singing the song but it is meaning nothing and accomplishing nothing. But you can say this church, the believers of this end. We have a right to sing that song because we have received a revelation. The opening of the seven seed in our generation. Everything is finished. Everything is finished. So I can now say we have received a flow &gt;&gt; of the blood of Jesus. It's all about Christ. &gt;&gt; So he does what? He &gt;&gt; he &gt;&gt; sanctifies me, &gt;&gt; cleanses me. Now you may say as you remember everything I did. Are you sure I'm sanctified? It doesn't matter whether you remember that is your mind. And the Bible says you should let your mind be renewed. &gt;&gt; Do not be conformed to the world but be transformed by the renewing of your hallelujah. Now he says continue to say, you see, then he presents after he cleanses the church and he sanctifies the church, then he presents the same church to himself. A glorious church, a glorious church without separation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to understand it, read the book of Esther. It is him &gt;&gt; that sent the the chamber line &gt;&gt; that went and and cleansed and washed the wrong time. And when it came time for Esther to be presented to the bridegroom, she said, "I want nothing else. Nothing but the blood. Nothing but the word of God. Nothing but the message of the hour. Do you get it brother? So now we have been presented to him &gt;&gt; as a glorious church without spo Vers 8. Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudments of the world, and not after Christ. and not after Christ. For in him dwell the fullness of the God himself. Oh, please follow me closely. I know you have read this many times. But God is about to open another and you are complete in him which is the head of all princip. Amen. So where is the completeness of the body of the bride of Christ? The comp our being complete cannot be found in ourself but it is found in Christ. [Applause] Amen. It is found in Christ. The Bible says we are complete in him. So let me announce to you church. Quit trying. Just stop it. It's not helping. Is pushing you deeper and deeper into sin. Yield yourself to Christ word how not only by prayer by feeding on the word [Applause] not only by a preaching on Sunday morning come on Wednesday also not only that read the word on your own read this Bible Listen to the message of the Allah. When you do that, then you will find complete in him, the more you yield yourself to the Lord. Amen. The more you will overcome the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That That's right. So now, Apostle Paul warns us here and he says, "Be aware, lest any man spoil you through philosophy." Paul warns us of three things. Oh, may God help me now. One, philosophy. Two, vain deceit. Three, tradition of men. Four, rudiments of the world. I can take one by one and I take an entire subject. But I want to just give you a little bit of maybe what you can call a synopsis here. Philosophy, the condition of men. You know what? I I I try to hint on those on Friday. We have a lot of traditions that have even try to creep into the message. Things which are not founded in the word but people will believe it and people do them. Why? Because they don't read the word by themselves. As long as their pastor says it, they follow blindly. The bride, the bl the bride is not blind. The bride has open eyes. Amen. Not suspicious, but with understanding of the word. You see, there are many traditions. You've seen people who say well the moment a brother fornicates or sister does something they come in the church on the on Sunday morning they begin confessing well then you have taken us back in the denomination that's what we did personally you grew up in the in theh east African Revival. This is what we used to do. We used to call itana, brother. We put you in the light and you come and confess these things before everybody. And sometimes you find a man that is respectable coming to begin talking about things. And some of us children you know by so doing you are not actually helping the body. You're just destroying. You're destroying the body. We are not confessors. We are not Catholic priests. This is not about me or about you. It's about Christ. Oh, brother, you don't know what I did. Well, the Bible says, "Confess your fault one to another." Well, if you feel like something some things can be heavy and there is no way you can let it go until you confess to somebody, let them pray with you. somebody spiritual and then it's not somebody to condemn you. It is someone who is going to help you. So you don't have to die with things. Get to somebody, talk with them, confess to them, someone like your pastor or a spiritual leader, somebody who is an elder or somebody that can listen and then they will pray with you. The Bible says you that are spiritual But also you do it while you are taking care of yourself. You can see this is on an individual basis not to bring you to come and confess to the whole. Are you following me? And then you find people who have tried to even come back to church. They will tell them you can't. Why? Oh, because the church is very angry with you. Very, very angry with you. What you did was so bad. You have to first stay there for like 5 months. Enjoy the world. Then you can come back. If you see, you will come. Friends, where are these things in the world? Traditions of I don't see it in the If you see it, come show it to me. Then we shall begin also to do it here. But if I can't see it, I can preach it. I am going to preach to you Christ not traditions of you find even married couples things go wrong and then you find them you know running up. They tell them all come and confess in the church. God have mercy. So you find a married brother in the church. Forgive me. What did you do? I did a BCD from that day. Watch people who do that. They can never be revived again. They will always be in the church like a shadow. Because everybody knows whether brother if we we tell you to say everything you did in your entire life even people who were respected [Music] from that day. Brother Baka, even if he was trying to preach, I no longer feel the anointing. What happened? Traditions of men took life out of it. There are many traditions, right? And I know by saying these things, I may make some enemies. But I have to preach to you what I say. what is revealed to me in the word and these people are not helped and many times to be helped they have to go to another church and they vacate from their church and yet they love their church praise the name of the Lord and then you've had traditions like courtship has to be for 6 months I don't see it in the message. I tried and tried to look for that. I didn't find it. It's a tradition because they do not have the council of the word or rather they don't want to take people to the council of the word. try to structure the message as a set of rules. We have a better way. The better way is the word. The word will guide us. The word will defeat every place in every situation. It will always defeat something. Hallelujah. Amen. But if we we we we we try to take the word and leave it and then use traditions. That is not a word. And what makes it so sad, they quote it as if it is the message of the hour. Brother said that you should quote for six months. What if you me I want to do two months. There's no so it becomes a rule. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, and I have a list of traditions or when you leave our church, you are out of grace. Oh, that has been so big in many denominations. But I really I mean churches. But of course they become denominations when they bring traditions instead of the word. I have personally spoken to people who are living in fear. He said pastor anything might happen to me. Why you know when I was you know my pastor said to me you have left your blessings here. The moment you leave this town, you are going with curses. Your blessings are still here. Okay. I will stay here. So I can stay in my blessings. You are staying in your ces. Because where there is love, where there is God, there is no fear. Hallelujah. You see friends, that is a tradition. &gt;&gt; Amen. your helper, your grace is not in a church. It is in Christ. Now see, everything is in Christ. Is all about Christ. You see, I hope there is no one staying in this church because of fear. Oh, what will the pastor say? If I go and join another church, you're welcome to do that as long as you are led by the Holy Ghost. We must always be led by the Holy Spirit. There are many things I want to read for you for you here. So today, if you just give me a chance, let me take a time to quote this course. in the choosing of a I didn't have time to gather all of them but say the same applies by choosing a church now you must pray over the church that you are fellowshipping in remember churches carry a spirit not the holy spirit a spirit Amen. &gt;&gt; You will go in a church and in that church there is a spirit of the spirit of other churches have a spirit of love and unity. Other churches you find witchcraft. I mean what I'm saying where you find people accusing each other that so and so beitched me. You find churches where which have anger right from the pastor to the lady. When the pastor is angry, he will show it. He can even slap you and it will come down from there to the families and people. They don't understand these people are not owned by the pastor. People are owned by Christ. The one who died for them, &gt;&gt; the one who gave his life blood, the purchase of the blood, they must be treated with honor. So he says, remember churches carry a spirit. But he says, but you go into a church. Oh my, praise the name of the Lord. Or you can come even in a church where the spirit of that church they worship their pastor. Some may even call it love. But you can see it's almost crossing the line of love and worship. Sometimes you go to a church with other spirit thinking they the best. If you leave their church, you are sure going to some of you even as I'm preaching, you have been through. Churches carry a spirit whereby you think that there's a church which thinks our pastor is the number one pastor in this country. &gt;&gt; But that's the place of Christ. Christ is number one and all the other preachers are on the same level. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. When I say the same level, I mean level of authority. But I understand in ministry we have seniority. We have elders, &gt;&gt; men who have labored for many, many, many years. And the Bible says we need to honor them. Actually, the Bible even says you must never rebuke an elder openly. But you find people who are in churches that they they have no problem with rebuking preachers. And it's okay in that church. You join that spirit comes on you. They are the ones you find on social media. When a minister write something, you find these young young people writing things and abusing and and and rebuking these pastors. As long as this pastor is not my pastor, I am from another church and my pastor, my pastor also has a problem with So let me show him the speed of that should never come. We must always honor to such as servants of God as why the men of God Christ wants to have preeminence in us in the body in the mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's happening. Churches are carry a spirit. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you go into a church and if you will watch the behavior that church, &gt;&gt; you just watch the pastor a while and you will usually find that the church acts like the pastor. Now you know why I'm preaching this thing. Because this is what I believe. And if I keep preaching it, you are going to begin behaving like that. Respecting men of God, respecting every pastor, respecting one another, honoring one another because this is what we stand for. [Applause] Sometimes I wonder if we just don't get one another's spirit in it instead of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You get to a place where a pastor is a really radical and carrying on and you will find out that the congregation is the same way. That's right. Is that not right? Sister peace are you sure know you're not yet a mother. So stay close. All right. Listen. You get to a place. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'll bring you to a church where I see the pastor stand jack their head back and forth. You watch the congregation. They do the same thing. You find when the pastor is doing like this, everybody begins doing like this. If the pastor preaching pulling trouser, every shame will come Julius will come. Everybody will be sure they're picking the spirit of their pastor. You watch the congregation, they do the same thing. You take a pastor just cut down anything. Usually the church will do the same thing. So if I was choosing a church, I would choose a genuine fundamental full gospel Bible church. If I was choosing one to put my family in. Praise the name of the Lord. And in the Ephesian age, brother to talk about the sacredness and the power of the church. How you know you cannot take the Holy Spirit from the people. God wants to lead his church. The pastor must rule over the church as the final authority. But he doesn't do it. Must be by the leadership of the Holy Ghost, not in a way. Oh sister, come and sing. This one is my cousin. Brother come and this one is my birthday. Sister come and and and teach school. This one is very close to God wants to lead us. He uses a man and that man must be led by God. Amen. And then when men choose to be under a certain ministry, &gt;&gt; they must believe 100% that God is leading that man. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't, that's the the moment to walk away. Pastor Are you chasing us? I love you so much. Nobody should go. But let me tell you, even this is important. &gt;&gt; The moment you are in a church and you have 90% confidence in your pastor, it's time to look for another child. That's right. I wish I had the time. I did not prepare to talk about One time I preach. Why? Because this is a man that God has trusted blessed there in charge of your soul. You cannot just say let me go and try at least I get 50%. No. Well, you can get 50% in a church you are visiting. But if it's a home church, unless you call your home, you must believe in that ministry 100%. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, but God wants to lead a church. God leads the preacher. God leads the pastor. God leads the people. Amen. If if if a brother comes up and tells me, see pastor, I've always told them pastor, I have the leadership of the Holy Spirit, you start a church 3 km from here. And I say shalom shalom. I will call him come brother shalom shalom and I will ask him a question. Are you sure? It is not you. It's the lead of the Holy Spirit. Yes, pastor. I have this sign. I have this prayer upon God. I I would say I you have my support. Matter of fact, I'll even give you some money and I'll ask the people to help you. And people who live around there, I'll tell them, go and support that brother. And those of you who feel like he can be a pastor, visit him and find out. What I just spoke now is almost impossible in the message. When I was in Australia, I met a pastor who has actually done it in reality and is still cooperating with this He told a couple or two who were it was like two hours away from the church said go find out if you are comfortable there it's all right you have my blessing and then they went but after a while they came back home said we are comfortable here we would rather drive 2 Why? &gt;&gt; It's all about Christ, &gt;&gt; not me, not you. &gt;&gt; But where it it you find those wars and battles and fighting and fasting. It's not about Christ. Many times it's about the pocket. [Music] &gt;&gt; What you mean? You have taken by brother he was trusting you but there is a big problem with you how can you take back but in other words you are saying how can you take my t it's not about Christ but if it is about Christ you don't care who go as long as they receiving the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's the truth. And there's a big issue, brethren, that we do not read the message. So we get looped into these things, unawares. You find competition in the body because of these things. One time I'll teach on that extension. Let me continue a little bit here with the traditions. Then I would say you cannot plate your hair. The moment you plate you, you are even an outcast. We excommunicate you. Plating hair has never been a basis for excommunication. Your prophet, the prophet of this age said plated hair now looks beautiful. That's not me. &gt;&gt; But pastor, he meant me. It's all right. We shall go into what he meant later. I am telling you what he said. But why do you people want to go and examine them? Because they have a legalistic mindset. I actually met a pastor who told me. Oh, you know sisters should have because you know in the new Jerusalem hair is going to be going down. So they should have hair. Oh, their hair should first of all should not be plated. Should not be flowers there, no oil, but they should just comb it backwards. And it's a doctrine. You cannot even put anything on it. If you put because you see what used to happen is they used to tell them you can't put any oil you can't put any oils you know hair oils and if they do put then they would have to call them to come and repent before the church [Music] and and and and so what they used to do is get a cloth and tie their head and when they see them do that they will call them sister what is wrong with you can you remove that finger that's encroaching in someone's private it's none of your business as a preacher it's none of your See, but you see these are traditions and people can almost die for it. You must be happy that you have the liberty in Christ. Because I know of areas people can literally die for the things I'm talking about. Some younger sisters have walked away from the church because they are tormented and they don't know what to do. So their hair will get lice and all because they can't take care of it. What I would tell you as your pastor, good care of your hair as sisters, don't be dirty and looking good care of yourself. But I will also say look as natural as possibly you can [Applause] look as natural as you can. You don't need to be plastic and all worldly beautiful but I have no standard for you. I can't give you any standard. The standard is don't cut your hair. Don't look like the world. The rest is up to you. And every preacher needs to do that. Otherwise when you leave and you cross that line then you are going into legalism and these are traditions of men and I can assure you it is not after Christ you see hair must face here must face there should completely remove their hair. Have you heard of that before? How many have heard of that before? Men should remove all. You don't find that in the scripture. We are we we we are taught by Apostle Paul to keep our hair short. What is short hair? Short hair is cut hair. Yes, sir. As long as you trim it, you don't keep it like untrim. And if you trim your hair, the the rest you do with it is none of my if you have the spirit of Christ in you. You will not want to look like a dup some fashionist. But then you find preachers who have left preaching the things that are going to build people spiritually and then we are pushing for make your hair like this, make your hair like that, make your hair like this, &gt;&gt; brother. It is so little. It's none of my business really. It's none of your business too. &gt;&gt; My business as a preacher is to preach to you Christ and Christ is the word. So anything not in the word is none of my business. When you believe the word they teach and they tell us as a tradition you have the Holy Ghost. You see that's a tradition also false doctrine and many believe that. And I wish I had time to continue but um um give me 10 minutes and I'll quit. Give you a few things here. Talks about the rudiments of the world. The rudiment of the world means here the basic worldly teachings and traditions that people rely on instead of Christ. [Music] When you are born again instead of Christ, when you are born again and you in Christ, you know what? You are dead to the ruments of meaning they no longer the ruments of the word no longer govern your life. How they see it doesn't govern my life. So opinion doesn't govern. &gt;&gt; What governs my life is Christ and Christ is the word as long as I'm submissive to the word. But how can you be submissive if you do not know the word? Study the message. Feed on the word. Praise the name of the Lord. Now I'm going to give you a quote probably the last one here. The question is the mystery of God revealed. Very good message for you to listen to. Although it's about three hours this one, but he says look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation. makes him the center of life of the revelation. Christ in you makes him the center of the revelation. Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. [Applause] But Christ in you makes you complete revelation of the whole thing. Hallelujah. Amen. In other words, Christ is revealed in his word. Not revealed in me. The mystery of God is not yet finished. Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in me is the complete revelation of the whole. [Music] Glory. Glory &gt;&gt; to whom God would make known the riches and the glory of this mystery which is Christ in you and then I prophesied Christ in you is the complete revelation of the whole what God is trying to do and now listen to this part. What is the new birth? This is a quote which I can read if I finish in a portion I'll confuse all of you. So you would say well what is the new birth? Listen. And he says, "It is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. How many can say amen to that? The revelation of Christ personally to you is a new birth. It means you're born again. If you have the revelation of Jesus Christ, but if I stop there, I am going to make it just intellectual. And sadly many preachers have stopped there and then they begin to have all sorts of you know like uh revelations flying in the sky until one of them said we no longer receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit the way they did in So can I finish the quote? He says not. He says it is a revelation of Christ personally to you. Not you joined a church. Not you shook a hand. You've done something different. You promise to live a course of rules. But the Bible, he is the word that was revealed to you. And no matter what anybody say what takes place, it doesn't matter. It is Christ. Pastor, priest, whatever it might be, it is Christ. Christ in you, brother. That is the revelation upon. And he says, "What is it?" It is Christ being revealed. It is the word. And when the word is revealed, oh, listen now to this one. When the word is revealed, it expresses itself. That is God's purpose. Please help me now. I'm finishing. This is God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to express himself to take his own laws. Don't miss this one. take his own laws and live by his own laws and fulfill his own law. Hallelujah. By death. Amen. And Christ God died in flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back only in the word of God and not try to swap it like if intellectual conceptions of That's God's idea. The new birth reveals this. If you want to know whether you have the Holy Spirit, you have heard. Now many start there and on that basis they say days of miracles are passed. Manifestations, signs, wonders, tongs. I even had this preacher. He actually called tongs gibberish. And he said, "Oh, they they speak gibberish and they call it God. That's blasphemy. You need to listen to the message of the hour because according to his revelation, he believes that tongues are only other people's languages. But the Bible speaks of tongues of men and of angels. Is that right? And in many times they spoke tong that nobody knew. &gt;&gt; And there was interpretation. Brother never said oh what a jibbery but he always said amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it not what wonderful that God will come and confirm through tongues and interpretation? But the preachers of today are saying it's gibberish. The revelation of today if you want the Holy Spirit just believe the no that's misconception intellectual misconception. Let me now read you the second point. And if a man says he's born again and he tries to place these promises of Christ in these last days to some other age, making him Christ yesterday but not today, then that man or that person as a delusion of s. And if a man says that he believes that it doesn't manifest through, there's a problem. Jesus said in Mark 16, these signs, everybody say with me, these signs shall follow them. Hallelujah. And says, casting out devils. When I when I speak these signs, you say, "Amen." Casting out devils, speaking with tongues and all these great manifestations of gifts, they would follow. Amen. And he says they shall not that may be they ought to be will heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away. If we say we are the people signs must be in our must move must be spoken. signs and wonders must happen. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Testimonies must appear. And I'm so glad we have had testimony after testimony of the working of the Holy Ghost in our ministry and as I'm finishing, there's a brother who conducted me recently. Maybe some of you didn't even realize it. I was your brother Daniel and I met him. I think he did something for us. I had been a soldier for a long time, many years. But no uh no rank. &gt;&gt; I told him, "Do you want a rank?" He said, "Sure." I said, "I give you that rank in the name of our Lord Jesus. I send it to you on the WhatsApp groups." He now has a rank. That's a manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you saw the other testimony of the sister who came to our meeting and you know she she for she believed God for something that she thought was impossible. I want she told God I want to earn 3 million. She was earning 7 500 and I've just been up to 700. So she said God I want 3 million. I sent you the testimony. She's now earning 3.8. And she said, "Pastor, the testimony is still hot. I want to share it." And there have been other testimonies you've been hearing. There's another one that I'm still waiting for to to to to get to prove. But before we share these testimonies with you, we want to prove them for you. There's a sister who shared a wonderful testimony. of a wonderful manifestation of the Holy Ghost. Friends, I tell you, the word is real. The power is real. We should not settle for less. We love the word for the word is Christ, but that Christ must manifest himself in our lives. Amen. It's 1 p.m. I will finish here. God bless you. Amen. Can we stand on our feet? Praise the Lord. You know, we just love the word. &gt;&gt; I just wish everybody would come here during midweek. That would be lovely. Amen. Amen. [Music] Praise the Lord. Come out. Shall we sing? He made a way, brother. Shalom. Can you come and help me, please? He made a way. He made a way. He made a way by opening us this uh revelation of the hour.

We want you to have preeminence, &gt;&gt; in us as individuals, Lord, in us as husbands, as wives, &gt;&gt; children, come and have preeminence, be seen as a ministry, as a church. We don't want anyone to be sin. Forbid it, Lord. Let it always be about you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Let it always be about you, Lord. Forgive us. Many times when we stray, Lord, we do not represent you properly. Forgive us, Lord, and wash us in your blood, Lord Jesus. But our prayer tonight is that you will help us that we will let you have the preeminence in our lives. Father Lord we have those with need tonight. May you bless them Lord and provide provide. Create where there needs something to be created. Lord, as we had a brother give a testimony today of a good job. Perhaps there's somebody here, Lord, who wants a job. Lord, we have also had another testimony of another sister who got a good job. May you give whoever wants a job, Lord, give them a good job so they will be able to serve you with their substance. Grant it, Lord. Bless each and every one of us. Let your presence fill our hearts. Let your presence fill our hearts and give us a wonderful week Lord. Provide for every other need Lord. Spiritual and physical need Lord in Jesus mighty name we pray. Amen. [Music] Amen. Amen. Lord bless you saints. &gt;&gt; Uh just want to dismiss you shortly. But I wanted to uh let you know the brother said that you may be seated. The brother said that uh this weekend, this Sunday was the last Sunday for the target that we were trying to do. If you remember, I announced that u we were supposed to pay by 7th August. But I'm going to pro most likely I might travel before August before 7th Zimbabwe. So that means we have until Sunday. So probably we'll meet this gentleman on Monday next week. the other week. So, uh we still have a shortfall of about 2 million shillings. &gt;&gt; I had what exactly is it, brother Joel? Do you have the figure? Is it exactly 2 million or more? &gt;&gt; 2.1 &gt;&gt; 2.1. Yes. So, that's what we need to hit the 100 million target. Um, so remember this is not fully paying the land off. This is just doing the like what you would call a down payment so that we can now sit and deise a plan on how to pay the remainder of the 120 million. Because remember the purpose was we were having we were here collecting money and then um you know land is appreciating for 4 years. We've been gathering money but but at that time land we were targeting in this area it was about was it 70 or 80 A plot meaning 160 million. But now this area we cannot even try. A plot around here is about 150 million. If it's not in a wetland, you know there are many people who sell land but many times you go you find is in a wetland. Yes. So we we thought it is wise to take what we have and put it on a property and then we begin collecting putting on property. So we still need one uh 2.1 million to meet that uh need of the down payment. I should commend John Wizzley this week. They have really improved a lot. God bless you because last week I think things are about 20,000 &gt;&gt; from 20 to 200,000 that's a very big improvement. God bless you and I hope that you can remain steady if we can all remain steady like that. It will help a great deal in achieving these targets. I should also mention I think you had a brother there's a sister from Kamoa all the way from Karamoja that we have a few people from Kamoja Island that stream our services and that sister is one of them. Um, so she sent she told me she's after after one of the subs she said she sent me a text. I did not know her but she said pastor I'd like to chip in something and she gave 100,000 shillings. So that is a very huge amount for someone injal giving 500,000 That's really a big contribution from that sister and she needs us to really pray for her. That was a generous contribution. Then also remember there is the other uh the other part that we used on the youth camp which we also are intending to have fully attained by the time we are going to pay the down payment. which we are intending to also have because remember it's a part of 100 million. Yes, it's a part of 100 million. So we intending to also have that and a brother heard about it. A brother heard about it from uh Nairobi, one of us, &gt;&gt; brother Kennedy, &gt;&gt; and he gave towards that 1,50,000 shillings. [Applause] Uh so the there's remaining now um uh uh 30.5 minus uh 1.05 that's about 29.45 45 and I know there are one or two who who told me pastor we are going to contribute towards that as well just to remind you to also do what you can do. You know saints we are doing these things by faith. Without faith it is impossible to please God. We have no solutions for anything. But if I have known the great things I have done in my life, I have done them by faith. &gt;&gt; I've told this story many times to a few and I'll tell it here again. One time I had a land I had purchased I was purchasing a certain a piece of land or half an acre that's about uh almost 10 years ago. So um I uh the land was a certain amount and uh so I wanted to pay a down and then I I I had some money in my hands and I felt I should put it in a in an asset but I wanted a huge asset. So I I I went and I met this owner the seller like the one we met this time because they are all real estate agents, real estate people. God bless you. So real estate company there's a difference between the brokers and the real estate people. company like even this land we are purchasing for the for the church it's not owned by an individual it's a um an individual who is running a real estate company and his offices are in road &gt;&gt; so uh this land that I was purchasing years ago was also like that. So I met this owner, she she was also that time she was a lady, she was so she was a Pentecostal like this one. So I told her I have just 6 million and she laughed. She said, "Pastor, you think you buy you you you buy land like you buy tomatoes? [Music] Go and look for money." &gt;&gt; I said, "Listen, I'm going to give you this money." But you a Christian, believe me, you don't believe my me. Believe my God. I'm going to come back. I told her within 3 months and I will pay the rest of the month if you give me. Did I ask for three or six months? So, I'll pay you the whole balance. And the balance was huge. She said, "Okay, I'm going to take this money, but there is no there is no assurance that the land is yours until you pay them." I said, "Trust me. My God will do it." Honestly, I did not have any idea where I'll get the money. Faith does not have hope. But faith hopeeth all things. You don't have because hope is based on a promise or something. Someone says, "I'll give you I'll help you." Then you promise somebody else on the best. But I did not have any hope. But I had faith. I believed that God is able to do it. Well, I I went back to Ethiopia because at that time I was still a pastor in Ethiopia. &gt;&gt; And then there happened to be one of the brothers in the church who was um you know sending tithe on my account at the time and um and uh he but I did not know I did not know really who was sending the money from because he had not called me and this money came on my account. Then I saw a notification and money came again and the money came again and the money came again like six seven times a certain amount not small and it came about seven or 10 I don't remember about seven or 10 times a number of times I said wait am I dreaming so I checked my account and I indeed found the balance there and it was more than what I needed to pay the balance of the land. So I I said to myself, I'm not going to first find out who said the money. Let me fast forward the money to the owner of the other land. Then I can do the investigation later. So I forwarded all the money and I told her balance paid in full. I said I need my land title. Today I have that land title and that's my testimony. Now, so today when people see it, they did buy it. But you see friends, we have a God in heaven. We have a God in heaven. And he gave me that land. I paid him for it. Now I went in the investigation. Who must have said that? So I went got a banker statement. I don't a brother in charge. He said brother how much money did you send some money? He said yes. I said how much money? He said I sent this such an amount for this and this purpose. I said, "Brother, but I received this much." He said, "No, I didn't send it." So I, he said, "Let me investigate. Let me find out." His brother had left the orders with the bank. But the bank kept on pressing, "Send faith. Send faith." But every failure was a breakthrough for me. [Laughter] [Applause] And and so I I realized the bank had my bank had leed my account balance [Music] like when I after spending it, they put it on a lean balance. So I contacted the bank. I said I'm seeing I received a lot of money. I don't know where it came from, but I also saw a lot of um uh I'm seeing a lot of lean balance on my balance. &gt;&gt; I don't know what it means. I never taken a loan before. Those who have taken a loan, you know means outstanding respect. [Music] All right. So now then the bank told me I'm trying to build your faith for something. So the bank told me uh well uh the money was sent by accident by the tailor. So you because you have spent it now we have considered it as a loan given to you. I said but I never asked for a loan. Don't worry there is no profit. You'll just pay it. I said but I can't find this lamb. He said no problem. &gt;&gt; Whatever you put we shall take. If you don't put we shall wait. So I diverted all the money on my other account for a period of time and whatever I allowed it to go there was going to the penance of the Lord God gave me until I paid it off. So friends, God is able to do miracles. Miracles are possible but we have to move by faith and not by sign. So we appreciate all the people standing with us and um those of you who are members of the church are not doing anything yet. Uh please come and do something be a member in one of the groups group leaders. Please stand on your feet. Please stand so they can see you. Look around. Look around. So if you're not a member of any group, see one of these people, brother Iran, Monica, Monica, sister, sister, sister Esther, Sister Shem, &gt;&gt; and brother sister. So meet them. brother and one of them and and tell them to put your name there so that you can contribute the little you can in a week and I can assure you church. We already have that land and we are going to build a church there. Actually I met a few brothers. I have a very wild thought. It is very wild my brother. &gt;&gt; I don't know whether you want to call. It's a thought about what we are going to do after but I can tell you we're going to build there and I know I've had a lot of temporary I feel like we're going to build a permanent right away. [Music] God gives you according to your faith. Well, the rest is over to you, church. Let's believe that God is more than able to do this. You know, you're here 80, 90, 100, but I tell you, people have things which are finished. [Music] you will see them coming afterwards [Music] by hundreds. That's why I don't know why but that's why. But those of us who are here on the foundation struggle looks like it is impossible. But don't look at what we are looking at now. Look at where we are heading. And this goal is achievable. So God bless you saints. We are dismissed. We'll meet on Wednesday at 6 p.m. &gt;&gt; Brother Shalom. God bless you. &gt;&gt; You are so precious to me. Lord, you are so precious to me and I love you. Yes, I love you because you fast love me. Lord, you are so precious to me. Lord, you are so precious to me. love you because you fast and love me. One more time. Lord, you are the Lord. You are so precious to me. And Lord, you are so precious to me. And I love you. Yes, I love you because you have love me. Afraid of Jesus. Oh, what a place that one so val. Should it rain like this to lead me to the sky? [Music] friendship [Music] with Jesus and the fellowship
