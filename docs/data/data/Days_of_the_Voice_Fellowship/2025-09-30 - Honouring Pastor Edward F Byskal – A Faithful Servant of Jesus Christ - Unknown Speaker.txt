========================================

while you have strength. Don't wait till you're laying someplace and and and breathing and gasping saying, "Well, if I only had my strength back, I'd go and do something for God." Do it now. &gt;&gt; Do it while you have your strength. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that word is energized. &gt;&gt; How many believe that this word is energized? And it's energized with a divine guidance system &gt;&gt; to take you to the ultimate destination. He said the word is again today being waved over the people. The word the locos because out from him has come a rise. We're going to conclude this age. I believe he has confidence. I have a people on earth that believe the word. They've consumed the veil. They know who I am and they know that I am in them and they are in me. And they are preparing now for the rapture because Satan has so contaminated our thinking that somehow we've got an allowance for a mistake that I'm going to announce to you tonight. This bride will not miss on one word. You Lors, Methodists, Baptist, Pentecostals, and nothing and world and sinners come out and be identified with your true lineage. It's not that you have to hear something new. Let God inspire the message you already know. &gt;&gt; You don't need something new. You need the fire &gt;&gt; to quicken what you already have. They ate there and they died. You're eating now to live. &gt;&gt; I have confidence that we're going to sit around the married supper table and we're going to look into one another's faces and a lamb will come and dry our tears away. something one day that called and said, "I want you to preach the gospel." It's him, Christ. And if it's not Christ, you folks are wasting your time. You ought to go and find yourself a pastor. That's what you need. You need somebody who speaks on behalf of Christ. So that there's something inside that says, "That's the truth. I'll hang on to that and stake my life on it." That's what you need. [Music] Hallelujah. We can praise him this. We can thank him. Can you say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That atmosphere. Amen. And it's a wonderful thing, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. I I personally want to thank God for the life of my grandfather. And I want to do it this morning just for a few minutes through my worship and praise. Is that okay? And I want you to join me this morning and let it just well up inside of you that thanksgiving for a man that's sacrificed for this gospel. Amen. And so join with me. I want to sing a glorious church. I'm looking at a glorious church this morning. Amen. One that didn't come easy. Amen. He came with sacrifice. So let's just praise him. Let me hear your voices.

Brother Ed knew the importance of worship, didn't he? He knew that it was going forth to prepare hearts so that when the word would come forth, it would be good ground for a seed to be planted. How many's experienced that before in this very church? Have you experienced that? There's nothing like it, is it? Huh? Praise our God. I stand in awe within the presence. Oh yes, we do.

Oh, what a friend [Music] who walks. &gt;&gt; Sing it now. [Music] My hand. [Music] [Music] You always [Music] [Music] Well, I hope if I ever have a memorial service, it sounds exactly like this. Uh, good morning. Uh, I'd like to thank everyone here in attendance. for coming to honor the life of my grandfather and my pastor, a man who has made it a challenge to find words to describe. I'm Edward Biscll's oldest grandson, Matthew Ardiel. Most of you know me. Um, we grandkids uh had a bit of a special insight to grandpa that um some didn't get to see. Uh maybe the playful side to him and his great sense of humor. I know a lot of you saw that too. Um, each of us grandkids at some point early in our lives, uh, some of the first instruction we received was on the, uh, principle of compound interest. Um, I think most of most of my cousins would agree with that. Uh, usually written on a restaurant napkin. uh whether we wanted to hear it or not. Some of us got it and some of us are still working on it. Um I'm just gonna I'll read a little bit more, but I was thinking about some of my times with grandpa and uh um you know the uh there was little things that would kind of describe the way he was. you know, we I had the opportunity after I just gotten my driver's license to uh drive home from Colona with him and uh some I I don't even know why. I think grandma must have come back with the girls or mom or something. So, it was just grandpa and I on with a nice 4-hour drive coming home from Colona. I was maybe 16 and just gotten my license and we got to Merit and he said, "Uh, do you want to drive the rest of the way?" And grandpa had a pretty quick car that could move. So I thought, "Sure, Grandpa. I'll drive." So we drove and you know, why not? I kept the speed limit. And we got past Hope. And many of you will know kind of that area between Hope and Chilowak. There's thick trees between both sides of the highway. And uh as I was coming through there, I looked over at grandpa and he just kind of dozed off a little bit. So I thought, "Well, I think I'll see what this thing can do." So, I gave it some gas and I'm flying through there. Grandpa's just kind of dozing to my right and sure enough, through those thick trees, police officer steps out, pulled me over. So, I uh I couldn't believe it, you know, 16 years old. I got my first speeding ticket. So, we pull over and grandpa kind of comes to himself, but I wasn't even looking at him. So, police officer comes to the window and says, "License, registration for the first time I'd pulled it out, you know, and I didn't even look at grandpa. I just grabbed the insurance." And he's just sitting there quietly. So, I hand my information, gives me a nice $150 ticket. Well, I'm pretty sure I didn't even have $150 in my bank account at the time, but anyway, hands me the ticket. And so, I just look at it. And that was the first time I kind of looked back over at grandpa like this. and he's just staring at me and he he looks at me and gives me a big grin and just slap me on the shoulder like that and grab the ticket out of my hand and he paid the bill. So that was that was what grandpa was like. And I'm sure we all have little stories like that, but uh sorry for saying something a little personal there. Um, I'm here for the most part to fill in some of the historical blanks of uh, grandpa's life, the history that shaped him. Um, grandpa gave the majority of his life to the gospel and spent his time and energy tirelessly for people around the world that drew on his wisdom, strength, and vision. Grant had endless care and compassion for any life in need, spiritually and naturally. I believe most present today are here to give respect and thanksgiving for what Ed Biscll contributed to their lives but would be unaware that he was born in the little town of Waka Saskatchewan on October 2nd 1934 that he has an older sister Anne that watched out for him as they were at times separated due to the death of their mother when Eddie was only seven. After his father remarried the family was blessed with Sharon. Auntie Anne and Sharon are both present today and would likely have many stories and fond memories to share. I'm sure most know that Ruth Biscll that sits here today is Ed Biscll's wife of 71 years. But maybe not that at the age of 11, he met this Ruth Harper in Dawson Creek, BC at the age of 18 and 19 respectively, they were married on May 26th, 1954. In the early 60s and now with three small girls in tow, Linda, Marilyn, and Joanne, they moved to Victoria, BC to aid in bringing the gospel to the native Indian villages along the west coast of Vancouver Island. With a love of music, Ed on the guitar, and Ruth on the accordion and piano, and a tiny trio of three girls, which you saw in the photos, they traveled to many of the reserves preaching and singing. They traveled. The love for song and harmonies has carried down through the generations and brings joy and refuge to us all as a family. Grandpa started working for Maynard's Auctioneers while in Victoria and soon moved up the ladder, being transferred to Toronto for several years and then taking presidency of Maynard's Auctioneers in Vancouver. Not very many years later, as grandpa's passionate time for the spreading of the gospel increased, he sold Maynards to his then friend, partner and friend, Bob Seabolt, who is present with us today. Thanks for being here, Bob. Grandpa and Grandma and the girls were living in a big white house on the main street of Cloverdale, just down 60th here at the time. And in the early 1970s, feeling a move of God amongst the youth, it became the Bible way house, a beacon of light for many of the young people in the local area. And I guess you could say the rest is history. I was thinking of the many visionary achievements of grandpa and it brought to mind a statement he made in recent months. even though his ability to express himself had become more difficult. A staff member her grandma grandpa Ben um was asking grandma what her life motto would be and my grandpa answered for her in a clear strong voice. He said there are no limits. That was definitely a motto for him as well grandma. And uh I brought this little Bible up here. It's Bible. First Bible I got from you was from 1984 and you gave it you and grandpa gave it to me on my seventh birth or at Christmas when I was seven. But uh we love you too, Grandma. So we're happy to be able to speak today. Thank you. [Applause] Beautiful Christ. Beautiful Christ. King of my life is he. Oh beautiful Christ, beautiful Christ. My an angel if you'll make your way up. Oh, beautiful Christ. Beautiful Christ, king of my life, is your king this morning. Oh, beautiful Christ. Oh beautiful my shall. [Music] Paul was weery on his journey. his body frail and weak. The apostle knew the end was near as he dipped his pen in ink. And he wrote, "Timothy, my son, I have fought the fight of faith. carry on what I've begun. But most of all, I pray. Preach the word. Preach the cross. Preach redemption to a lost and dying world. Lift your voice unashamed of the gospel of his name. until all have heard preach the word. [Music] Paul and Timothy are gone, but the letter still remains. And the mission that was written down calls out to us today. Lift the name of Jesus higher until the whole world knows the story of amazing grace. We are messengers of hope. Preach the word. Preach the cross. Preach redemption to a lost and dying world. Lift your voice unashamed of the gospel of his name. [Applause] [Music] Preach the word. Preach the cross. Preach redemption to a lost and dying world. Lift your voice unashamed of the gospel of his name until all have preach the word. Preach the word. Reach the word. Preach the world. Preach the cross. Reach red to a lost and dying world. Always lift your voice unashamed of the gospel of his name until he ever preach the world. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] Thanks, honey. He sure did. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're thankful. Thankful for all of you that are here this morning. And I look around the room and see friends and old friends and friends that have traveled far and wide. And for that on part of Sister Ruth's behalf, my behalf, the family, church, thank you for being here and making this day a special day for us all. I can say um he was an amazing man and for us that have known him um um I've known him all my life it seems and he's a man I feel privileged to be able to stand behind stand beside and say he was not only my pastor father-in-law friend he was a mentor guiding tonight and a wonderful pastor to this this church and local assembly. Brother Ed had a consuming desire to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. It wasn't just a desire. It was a burning fervent desire. And he was a man of God that loved the Lord Jesus, loved this message and put it into action. A lot of people can use a lot of words and say a lot of things and do nothing. Brother Biscll was a man of action that spread this gospel. Dad took a change of code or what we call a body change on September the 17th at 534 surrounded by his darling wife and children grandchildren and we are able to see this glorious passing of a man of God into the presence of the Lord. one of the most, as they say, the peaceful passing we have witnessed. So to show your love and be here this morning means a lot not only to mom, I'm sure, not only to the girls, Linda, Maryland, and Joanne, but means a lot to me and to this church. And we thank God for you and thank you for making the effort to be here, brother. a long way to bring Israel for the first time. Thank you so so so very much. He was an incredible man and yes, words could not really describe. I think you saw some slides before we came out and and if they have could be told, we'd be here a long time. Incredible father, incredible husband, incredible grandfather. Brother Biscll wished that that this service or would be much like a service church service that we enjoyed and behind the pulpit ministering the word of the Lord and it was great. Bob, you missed a lot. You would have loved to seen him in action. I think you saw a little bit and he was a tremendous friend to you. He loved you. Today we're going to hear from Pastor Ron Spencer from Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle from from Virginia, Pastor Tim Puit, Evening Light Tabernacle from Louisiana. These are caliber of men that brother Biscll and we've loved them and they've been a great part of our church here for many, many years. I have the deep honor to have you here. sitting on this platform with us. I want to thank every minister who brought their themselves and their wives of course and have traveled and sacrificed to be here. He was indeed a man that touched many lives. He was extraordinary. He only had a heart. a heart for his family and a heart for the family of God. What set him apart was this in unquenchable desire to reach the unreachable, to find the predestinated, to cross borders and to bring the light of the gospel to every corner of the earth. I have never known a man that has traveled for over 160 times overseas and many times traveling for not just a week or a weekend or for two weeks. In the beginnings they were three to four to five weeks at a time and he would call me and say I'll take the service on Sunday. I thought that was amazing until I got older. I'm not that old but older. I realize the taxing and how hard that is. And he was amazing. We thank you for taking this time to to join us and to be a part of this morning service as we thank God for a life definitely well-lived. And and um would it be all right, Mom, to explain this a little bit so that people don't think we're radical or something? Dad was a man of the wilderness and he had the privilege to hunt with a prophet. Hunt with a prophet of this age. And if you notice the picture here there on the corner there is a called a green checkered shirt. Brother Bram had a vision and told brother Biscll that there will be some young men and one of them will be wearing a green checkered shirt. And many of you maybe have seen it or not seen it, but brother Brandham mentioned it many times. And so it was thought that that would be the picture. Brother Ed let me use that gun one time. And I know why he let me use it. Cuz it broke my shoulder. It kicked like a mule. It was crazy. I said, "What a hunter." Dad was quite the hunter and the marksman. But that is why he he's not only a preacher. He was not only a a husband, a father. He was a man of God and he was a man of the wilderness. And as these brothers will come and minister the word of God, may the Holy Spirit punctuate the word speak to your hearts deeply. And again, I thank you all for taking your time to celebrate this great life of brother Ed Biscll. I'd ask brother Ron Spencer if you would come please at this time. God bless you. I would like to thank you for being here. I would like to thank Sister Ruth and the family for inviting me to be a part of this and I would call it the highest honor of my life. Brother Ed was a quite a mentor to me, a father figure to me, and I was honored to have so many opportunities to be with him. And and we had so many supernatural moments together. We loved him with all of our hearts for the about the last 20 years. I'm so glad to have my wife and my son and daughter-in-law with us. And for about the last 20 years, every day I committed to listen to brother Biscll a service every day because I loved him. So it wasn't man worship and neither was it trying to catch the personality of a man, but I loved the Christ that was in him. He loved the prophet and he loved this message with all of his heart. And I think all of us are sitting here that have been touched. I think we could all say that we have a brother Biscll story. And we're just thankful that his life touched our life and it made our life better. It made our life better. In in 2007, I was burned in a horrible explosion and I was taken taken to the hospital and then to another hospital where I would be in a burn unit. And it was on the about the fourth day my son was burned as well. and and uh my wife was between hospitals and brother Biscll called Sister Connie and said uh he talked to her and he said I believe the hearing is the last to go and he told Sister Connie that I was up early this morning which it would have been very early. I was up early this morning and the Lord spoke to me that we have bought Mount Baker Bible Way Camp and that you have loved and enjoyed. And he said, "The Lord spoke to me that Brother Ron will be the speaker next year at that camp." It was that day that they gave me up because my lungs were burned so bad. And Sister Connie would go for the next month to the hospital with doctors telling her that I wouldn't live. But the man that we're memorializing today had called her led of the Lord and told her that I would not just be at the camp, but I would be the speaker at the camp. We're honored to be here. I can't say enough words. I know you are honored. He lived three lifetimes in one. He had a phenomenal family that is sitting here today. And he told me many times of how much he loved each and every one of you. And I love each and every one of you. And we've had a lot of wonderful moments in our lives together with the meetings that we've gathered. Brother Tom and I and brother Michael and brother Murphy. Brother Murphy is brother Biscll's son and he told me that many times. He's my son. He had three wonderful, beautiful daughters and he had a son. And we're so thankful for Brother Murphy. We're thankful for brother Tom &gt;&gt; and his leadership since a boy and doing all the the work on our way here. We were we were just talking about the radio broadcast and listening to it and brother Tom was instrumental in putting all that together and we would listen to it on Saturday night and it would be clips of the prophet of God and then we would hear that and we had a we had a green box radio that we would set in our in our kitchen and we would all set four chairs and we would sit and listen to that and rejoice and shout and we just love the message all of our lives. That's what's brought us together. &gt;&gt; And uh and I'll just say it plainly. I think Brother Biscll is one of the greatest speakers that ever lived in life. And by saying that, I want to tell you, I hope that you appreciated your time with him &gt;&gt; and you gather it and look back on it as he would stand and speak masterpiece after masterpiece after masterpiece. And and I trust in the coming days, you'll go back and listen to some of those masterpieces. Of course, listen to the prophet of God, but listen to those masterpieces. and and uh no matter what it would be, I just trust that you would be blessed by that. I was told that this is not a memorial service, but it's really hard not to be. But I spoke a message in front of brother Biscll and to the family you will understand and no kind of holding things close to your heart. I was praying for days of what I would speak here because there's not enough time or not enough words that can be said. I'd like to speak to you on what will you be remembered for. I think this would be the theme of brother Biscll's life in first John chapter 1 and verse one. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, &gt;&gt; which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life. For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that which is eternal life, which was the with the Father, and was manifested unto us, that which we have seen, and heard, declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his son, Jesus Christ. and these things that we write unto you that your joy may be full. Malachi 4 and verse 5. Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of their children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. I believe we could use this as a text this morning in 2 Timothy 4 and verse one. I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom. Preach the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be instant in season and out of season. Reprove and rebuke and exhort with all longsuffering and and doctrine. For the time will come when they shall will not endure sound doctrine. But after their own lust shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears, and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and they shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things endure afflictions. Do the work of an evangelist. Make full proof of thy ministry. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure departure is at hand. I believe we could say this. I have fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. I have kept the faith. I have kept the faith. &gt;&gt; If anybody has kept the faith, he kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day. And not to me only, but unto all of them which also love his appearing. And we can all say amen. &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing that I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we could say decade after decade after decade, we watched Brother Ed Bisll do that. &gt;&gt; He never flinched. He never backed off. &gt;&gt; He stood faithful. &gt;&gt; He stood as a representative of this this message. I believe God sent an ambassador to the whole world. &gt;&gt; His life touched millions. &gt;&gt; We are taught that nothing can rem remove our name from the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; That God designed it all. God purposed our life. God pre-planned our life. God built us in a certain way. When God wrote his first Bible in the heavens, we were represented there. God prepared for our coming. He has prepared for our leaving here. God orchestrated it all. Our names are found in the lamb's book. And that ought to make every one of us shout. &gt;&gt; Phenomenal speakers said here today, men that have taken this message that have been inspired by brother Ed. men around the world that couldn't be here that have been inspired to pick up this message and run with everything that is within them. &gt;&gt; Every service, brother Biscll would talk of this message and his vision for it. And he believed fundamentally that if he had the message and he had the book, every believer should have the opportunity to have this message &gt;&gt; that they can read it. &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll was not only a great father, he was a great visionary. not just for you young people to have a school, but when we were around many years ago, he began to talk about a a kiosk. And he had a vision in his mind that this can be placed in places to where that a person can walk up and push a button and they could get the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we now have the message hub &gt;&gt; that thousands have worked on it. &gt;&gt; Anywhere in the world you can have this message at your display. I believe that we can say well done brother Biscoll in John chapter 14 and verse one. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. And if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't believe Jesus was just talking to those disciples that were standing there, &gt;&gt; but I believe he was talking to us. &gt;&gt; I had the wonderful opportunity as as I've been studying over this the last few days. And Sister Joanne, I thought about it. There was three particular messages that I sat with him and and he preached these sermons. A body thou hast prepared for me, a masterpiece of masterpieces. And he spoke, "A place by me." And he would take that theme from sitting on a log. Brother Tim, at your place, he would speak about he came to me there and you played while he preached. Sister Linda, this message wasn't just words to him. It was life. &gt;&gt; And he would speak another one that we're all looking forward to now. Anointed for rapture. &gt;&gt; I believe there's a people that is sitting here that are stepping into that role. &gt;&gt; It's not just a great sermon or a great masterpiece, but we're anointed for rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. For you that have sitting here that were in business, I believe I could say this. Brother Ed could have been the prime minister. He carried himself with such dignity to be a a man from the country, a uh just a country boy, almost an orphan child. But yet he carried himself and held his shoulders back. and everyone in the world could identify with him. And now being a visionary, he was a phenomenal businessman. Brother Matt, he gave me those same sermons about compound interest. I was in Switzerland and we were getting on a on a elevator. You'll like this. We were getting on the elevator and he said, "Brother Ryan, I want to talk to you and I want to have a meeting with you at breakfast in the morning." Brother David, it was hundreds of people having breakfast in the same hall. And he said, "I I want just you and I to sit at the table." And I was thinking, "Absolutely impossible. Everybody going backwards and forwards." And he just simply when we sat down, he said, "Look at me. Don't look at nobody else. I want you to hear every word I've got to say. It is important. You It's important what I'm going to tell you. And people would come and want to speak and it was just like he was zoned in and we had a glass hub around us. I will I will never forget he sat with me and he just sat down and just talked to me about preaching the responsibility, not being redundant, coming to the pullpit and being focused and being right on holding this message 100% fant with everything that is within me. And if you're not inspired in study, don't take it to the pullpit. And he repeated some of that, too. What a reunion that must be going on there. He's in a body that he can shout, worship. &gt;&gt; But I can just imagine as the voice went out, a new arrival. Ed Biscll &gt;&gt; has arrived. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I am sure thousands of people &gt;&gt; wanted to have a second to shake his hand. his mother, his father, his loved ones, preachers, my father, my father-in-law, brother Henry Green, &gt;&gt; Brother Dan Daisley, men around the world, Billy Andrews, &gt;&gt; people that you know and love, people that went on from this body of believers. And he wasn't an old man with gray hair today. his eyes sparkling and a step in his feet. &gt;&gt; It was everything that he preached about, &gt;&gt; every vision. &gt;&gt; When he preached about the log and sitting there with the prophet of God, he transported every one of us &gt;&gt; to sit in the log. when he talked about heaven, he transported every one of us &gt;&gt; to give us a vision of what he's going through. Sister Ruth today, we've had a few moments with Sister Ruth. And she says she hasn't shed a tear. Maybe in the future she will, but she's strong. She's listened to every one of those sermons. &gt;&gt; You know, behind every great man is a great woman. &gt;&gt; And if we would call him the greatest preacher, we have the greatest preacher's wife &gt;&gt; sitting with us. Let's give her a hand. The prophet says your birth here was pre-planned. I guess you believe that. &gt;&gt; Every one of you knows that your birth is pre-planned. Did you know that your birth never originated as just a myth or a thought? Everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundational world that you would be here. The infinite God knowing and to be infinite he had to know every flea that would ever be in the earth and how many times it would bat its eye. &gt;&gt; That's infinite. Our little minds cannot fathom what infinite means. The infinite God, he knowed all things. &gt;&gt; Therefore, there is nothing out of cater. Brother Bram talked to us in the unveiling of God and he says he said like a man building chimes or making chimes the molder every bell has got to ring different from the other. the same material that but so much iron and so much steel and so much brass to to give it the ting. That's the way God did. He bred this one to that one to this one and to that one to this one and to that one till he got exactly what he wanted. That's how he come down. God unveiled himself in a pillar of fire down through the prophets and then into the son of God which he was God. It's the same God bringing out exactly from perfection to perfection, from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way God does. Brother Biscll's voice, God made it in a certain way. If he is to be an ambassador to the earth, he has to have a certain thing. We heard as his life would go that he was almost like an orphan child. He never had a bedroom for his own. We hear him telling at 14 years old that he's sitting listening to the prophet of God and he watches a miracle before his eyes. A girl gets her sight and it did something to him. As a young man, he travels on a motorcycle and he almost says it with that something inside of him. a 500 bike shaved heads. He has an accident and he rolls and when he finds himself, he gets up and he doesn't have a scratch on him because God was watching over him. He sent him through many experiences because God had a ting that he was going to sound out. Hebrews chapter 11 says it like this. By faith the the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believe not. when she had received the spies with peace. And what shall I say more? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Bay, and of Samson and Jeffi, and of David also, and Samuel of the prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained the promises, and stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, and out of weaknesses were made strong. lacks valued in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. Others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings. Yay, moreover of bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned, were saw a sunder, were tempted, were slain with a sword. They wandered about in sheep skins and in goat skins, being destituted and afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and in mountains and dens and caves of the earth. And these all I cannot imagine the responsibility as Paul is writing this down. He's getting one chapter in the in the Bible to memorialize these people's lives. &gt;&gt; That's what it was. And these all having obtained a good report received not the promise. God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect. &gt;&gt; Many years ago, 1986, Brother Biscll read this text and it changed my life. Wherefore, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, &gt;&gt; and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run. &gt;&gt; You're left with the responsibility. Now, &gt;&gt; let us run. &gt;&gt; Our prophet tells us that nobody has the same fingerprint. Nobody has the same eye that you have. Every one of us, nobody can take our place. &gt;&gt; I can't do what you can do. &gt;&gt; You can't do what I can do. None of us can be what brother Bisl was. And neither we do we want to be a carnal impersonation of him. &gt;&gt; But we want the same fire. &gt;&gt; We want that fire that's burning inside of us. &gt;&gt; That it's more than a quote. It's more than a sermon. &gt;&gt; It's more than a song. &gt;&gt; It's a personal revelation. It's a personal experience with Almighty God. &gt;&gt; He's our personal bridegroom. &gt;&gt; We want that just not for oursel, but we want it for our family. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your excuse would be this morning for lagging back. Lay it aside. &gt;&gt; Lay it aside. There's nothing worth staying here for. &gt;&gt; I've been hurt. Move on. &gt;&gt; I've been in danger. Move on. &gt;&gt; Things have went bad for me. Move on. Five and a half years ago, I I came here in January and I'd been having some test run and just before Brother Tom picked me up, I got a call from the doctors. that I had cancer. I found it interesting that brother Biscll came to our local home church and brother Charlie Mitchell had had cancer in his left lung about the size of a fist. I knew knew I knew brother Charlie all my life but a real man real man of faith. Brother Biscllow came and they interviewed him at a at a television broadcast. The week before, Brother Andrew, the week before they had did a a governor's uh advertisement. It was a 302 advertisement for the government for the governor. It took them an hour to put a 30 second piece together. Brother Biscll and Brother Charlie sat down and did a a a testimony. I believe that's about a half an hour long. They never took a break. &gt;&gt; And the producer said, "We we we have a hard time believing that you just did this." And we had the governor last week and it took us an hour to do a 302. And I love Brother Bisco's words. He said, "We were telling the truth. [Applause] I came to this service that evening, five minutes before And I'd already laid out the God had already laid out the service that evening I was going to preach on courage. Sister Connie was standing there when we got the call. Ron, you have cancer. And I just took a deep breath. I said, well, God's got this. I walked to this pull pit with brother Ed sitting here and you you guys sitting here and I preached on courage. Today I stand here 5 years later brain cancer, lung cancer, and now they're starting to find clean &gt;&gt; clean scans. [Music] Doctors tell you're going to die and they still tell me I'm going to die. And I just read another book. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was with a doctor the other day and he's a bear of a man and he told me, he said, "Ron, you're a miracle. You don't look like you have cancer." And he said, "You're getting clear scans and that only tells you that the big stuff is not working. You're still on chemo. You're not in a wheelchair. You're not laying in a bed somewhere another. You're going to preach in Canada." And he just sat there with tears running down his eyes. He said, "You're a miracle." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more moments? &gt;&gt; I've got a buddy sitting back here like a horse in a in a tray. He's ready. No matter how long I go, he's gonna go twice as long. So, I'm honored to stand with brother Tim Fry. &gt;&gt; In a special service, Brother Joe, you'll recognize, and I thought I would just take a portion here for a moment. There was a sermon called preach, let us run at your place. And brother Biscoll would come to a certain spot and he would begin to go over names that Satan hated that God used. And we talk about John Wesley that he would ride on horseback 15 miles a day. He would travel 250,000 miles. He spoke 42,000 sermons. He died at 88 years old and he wrote every one of his sermons down. A man named William Kerry was a great foreign mission. Brother Murphy, you'll appreciate this. He translated the Bible into 42 different languages. He not only did that but he created dictionaries a man that I love a man named Carter Peter Cartwright and I remember when brother Biscll rehearsed this story he did it with quite an effort and quite a joy. Brother Brandham had mentioned him in the greatest battle ever fought and he'd went into a certain town and in this certain town there was a bully there and he was cleaning an old building that was abandoned. He was cleaning it up, cleaning the windows and cleaning the the lights over and he was up on a ladder and the bully comes in and says, "You'll not have a meeting in this town unless you whip me first." Well, Peter Cartwright just simply says, "I'll do that next." He gets down off of the ladder, rolls his sleeves up, and whips the town bully. History tells us that the town bully became the pastor of that church. Peter Cartright was also a politician and he ran in politics because he found out they were corrupt. They still are. But he ran against a man named Abraham Lincoln. And then in those days they would they would go from one square to another square in every town and and they'd give their speeches and people would come and and Peter Cartright was early and his competitor was at the next town giving a speech and he was talking about this Peter Cartright and if he could ever meet him he'd whip him on the spot. So Peter Cartwright spoke up. Do you know do you know Peter Cartwright? No, I've never met him. He said I'm Peter Cartwright. Said if if you don't come down here and whip me, you're a liar. And this whole audience will know you're a liar. So the man came down not realizing what Peter Cartright was capable of. And he whipped him. Peter Cartright just whipped him and thrashed him. remember he's a preacher. And when he got done, there was a river just across the road. And he announced to the folks, he said, "Now that I've whipped him, I'm going to baptize him." And took him across took him across the street and baptized him. He personally baptized 12,000 people. Brother Biscllow would rem mention George Whitefield, Jonathan Gford, Buddy Robinson, Brother Brother Tim and myself have preached in some of th those places. Buddy Robinson would be the man that would he would travel two two million miles. He would have a 100,000 conversions and he would preach 33,000 sermons. He would talk about Evan Roberts, Morai Ham, Billy Graham, Paul Ryder who produced the song Only Belief. He would talk about Charles Feny that 97% of his converts held. He was in Rochester, New York. Brother Brandon will talk about when Finey preached the power of God would be so great till 5 miles away men would drop their lunch pales and give their heart to God. The police didn't have nothing to do in that town because of the convergence that was going on and they became known as the barbershop quartets. All of these run the race. And I remember the charge that was given at the end of the service. What will you do? I'd say if we would stop today and rehearse all the milestones that brother Biscll accomplished. We would leave business out. we leave personal life out. I'd say he's in God's Hall of Fame today. &gt;&gt; If we took the time this evening to allow every one of us to give a personal story, I'd say every one of us have a personal story. I think the most unique thing about brother Ed is he made you feel like you were the greatest person in the world while you was talking to him. &gt;&gt; That's the mark of a great man. I was with him in one meeting and we had finished the meeting, Brother Ken. And we were walking down the steps and there was just hundreds of people. And he said, "Brother Ron, let's shake as many hands as we can shake." He said, "They may not remember anything that we preach, but we they will remember our handshake." I thought that was such phenomenal words of wisdom. Maybe you're missing revival in your life. Maybe you're missing in a personal experience in your life. But brother Biscoll's greatest goal was that every one of us, every one of us can have this same Jesus Christ living on the inside of us. &gt;&gt; You see, if God has a plan and he has a purpose for brother Ed's life, he's got a purpose for your life. &gt;&gt; He's got a purpose. He made you. You said, "Well, Brother Ron, but I'm not a preacher." But you can do a certain work. I'm not a singer, but you can do a certain work. &gt;&gt; We have brother Dioa here, one of the greatest preachers that ever lived. Influenced by Brother Biscoff. All of us were touched by that. As I would close this morning, I'd like to just say this to you. Don't let this life, this ministry pass you by and not be touched by it. We can sit here today and understand what brother Bisll was remembered for. We'll never forget it. You'll hear brother Tom preach and every service he'll bring you a part of brother Ed. You'll hear brother Murphy preach and every sermon that he preach will be inspired and he will bring you a part of brother Biscll. I saved you for the last. Every time you hear brother Michael preach, you see he's a straight shooter. You'll not only hear brother Biscll through him, you'll see brother Biscll through him. The DNA genes are strong. As human beings, we're all wanting to hear these words from God. But I believe for my part of this meeting today, I'd like to say, Brother Ed Biscll, well done. &gt;&gt; Can we say it together today? &gt;&gt; Well done. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Applause] just to change your posture just a moment. Won't you stand? Let's just go to prayer just for a moment and ask God's grace upon this portion of the service today. Father, we bow before your throne of grace and we want to say thanks &gt;&gt; for all your many blessings to us. We want to thank you for lives that have went before us. For lives that we remember, the life of brother Bisco, Lord, that ran the race before us. We are all indebted today &gt;&gt; for his life, his sacrifice, his love for you, and is sharing it with so many others. Lord, we're indebted to Calvary and what you did for us where you gave your life for us and you were the supreme example. And we love you, Lord. And we want to express our love to you today. We want to thank you Lord for this church, his family, Lord, its pastors that labor here for you. And we just ask Lord that you would give courage and strength and help. Oh God may that your spirit just be with them giving them comfort in the days ahead and strength as they go forward in your name. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats. I want to begin today by saying to Sister Ruth, to Sister Linda, Sister Marilyn, Sister Joanne, and to this great family, and to this host of friends that our hearts are deeply moved with you in this time of loss. it. It's a husband, a father, a grandfather, a spiritual leader that has finished his course and stepped into his reward. And we cannot really measure the weight of such a passing. For brother Biscll was more than a man. He was a father in the faith to countless souls. He was a steady hand in the ministry. He was a true general in the army of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Ron Spencer told me that as he heard the news of his passing that he just wept all night. And I just tell you, my emotions were heartfelt, too. But really, I just sat stunned. Stunned because an era has passed and with it a responsibility is now laid on our shoulders. And to you, Sister Ruth, who stayed faithfully by his side through long years of labor. Your strength, your devotion, magnified his ministry. You are not only his companion, but a part of the very testimony of his life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to you, Sister Linda, Sister Marilyn, Sister Joanne, you shared your father with the world. &gt;&gt; And the world was richer for it, and his steady words, his faith, and his example will live on through you. And to you, brother Tom Ray, who now bears the mantle of pastoring, and to you, Brother Michael Ray, who follows as a grandson in the line of faith. May you feel both the burden and the blessing of carrying forward this great legacy. Just as Elisha once picked up Elijah's mantle, so too, the ministry is continuing in your hands. The scripture assures us that precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. And again he says, "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them." Brother Biscoll's voice is silent here, but his works are still speaking. &gt;&gt; His testimony still stands. &gt;&gt; His influence still marches on in you, in this church. and his countless lives that he touched across the nations. And I want you to know that we we take this moment and we sorrow with you. But not as those who have no hope. &gt;&gt; But we know the trumpet will sound and we'll be reunited. And until then, &gt;&gt; may the God of all comfort strengthen you. And may the legacy of brother Ed's faith continue to shine through your lives. And I say God bless you all. And as I begin today, my thoughts go, how do you even measure a loss like this? It is a loss that reaches far beyond these walls. It is actually felt around the world. And and when we try to put it into words, every word it just feels too small. our language falters. You know, there's nothing that really seems adequate to capture the depth, the weight of memory or the gratitude that we feel for life that was so greatly lived. Today, we honor a mighty man whose course is now finished, whose crown is sure. Brother Biscll has joined that great cloud of witnesses and and and his voice now rests. But his influence echoes on. His shoes can't be filled. But the trail he blazed is still before us. His fire, his burden, his faith remains as a charge to us who are yet still running this race. &gt;&gt; And today we stand in the shadow of a great absence. A mighty general, a soldier of the cross has gone on. a pioneer of the message, a witness of truth, and the gap in our ranks is undeniable. It leaves us with hard questions. Where are we in time? &gt;&gt; Where do we go from here? Who will rise to carry the banner that he so faithfully bore? And and here's the obvious truth. His shoes can't be filled &gt;&gt; yet through his voice. Though his voice is now stealed on this side of eternity, the echo of it still remains and will be forever engraved in our hearts &gt;&gt; because he imparted something to us of eternal quality. &gt;&gt; The fire in that he ignited in many is still burns. And his burden for the gospel now seemed to rest on our shoulders. And I think it's a shared burden today. The the the trail that he blazed it calls for us to walk in it with the same faith and the courage that he showed. The scripture in Hebrews 13:7 reminds us, "Remember them which have the rule over you that have spoken to you the word of God whose faith follow consern considering the end of their conversation." And this is our charge today to remember. It's what we're doing here in this service to remember, to reflect, and to follow. And when we look at brother Biscll's end, what do we see? Not regret, but reward. Not failure, but fruitfulness. &gt;&gt; Not silence, but a legacy that speaks. And today I I find myself echoing the cry of King Joash at the bedside of Elisha. And his cry has become my own cry in this moment. And from this scripture is what I long to impart to his family, to ministers that are here, fellow ministers and friends, and even to the bride of Christ around the world. For when Joash, the king of Israel, came to Elisha's bedside as he was dying, he fell on him and wept, crying, "Oh my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof." And it is from here that I want to take my text because truly a great man has departed from us. A spiritual father, a man of direction, a warrior of the word. &gt;&gt; He was in his time, you know, a the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof. Not because he rode with armies, but because he walked with God. And this is, you know, these words that Joash would use that Elisha actually would use concerning Elijah when and his departed. This wasn't just flattery. It was a profound recognition of the true strength, defense, and the power of Israel. You see, in the ancient world, the chariots and horsemen were the most powerful weapons of warfare. They were the tanks of the battlefield. They represented strength and swiftness and and national security. So when Joash called Elisha the the chariot and the horsemen of Israel, he was saying, "You, Elisha, are the real power behind Israel. You are more than an army. You are our defense." You see, it wasn't Israel's horses and chariots that gave it power, but it was the prophetic presence of God in his servant. &gt;&gt; Elisha wasn't a general. He didn't fight in the Israel's army, but through his prayers, the miracles, his access to God's voice, he was the spiritual force that defended the nation. He discerned the enemy's movements. He struck armies blind. He opened the eyes of his servant to angelic host. And he showed that there were angels of fire and horses of fire and that God was on their side and that they were more than enough. &gt;&gt; You see, his intercession and authority, it brought deliverance to Israel more than any natural weapon. And oh God, I say to Jay, we need some spiritual fathers. &gt;&gt; Fathers who can discern and withstand the antichrist. That is replacing the spirit with formality and with rituals and replacing the word with vain philosophies who turn truth into fables. And like a chariot steered by the skilled hands, Elisha was a a guiding force. And the king would look to him in times of natural distress for strategy, for assurance, and for supernatural intervention. And when Elisha was about to die, Joash wept. Not just because a man was dying, but because a nation was losing its eyes, its ears, its spiritual commander. And now my words shift not to the mighty man of God who has been recently taken home, but to us who remain. His course is finished. &gt;&gt; His crown is sure, &gt;&gt; but what about us? &gt;&gt; What will we do with the mantle that has fallen at our feet? &gt;&gt; For surely you know that much has been passed on. It certainly wasn't taken to the grave with him. It was passed on in the lives of many of you men and women here today. And if there was ever a time for men and boys to rise to the challenge, it is now. Cuz we don't just need males. We need men of God. We don't just need providers. We need fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need men who will stand in the gap. Men who will take responsibility, men who will sound the trumpet with clarity. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said in the book of Ezekiel, "And I sought for a man." I want you to listen to these words. Let them be immortalized on your life today. I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge then stand in the gap before me in the land. This was the words of a prophet. And God was speaking through him. And he says, "I sought for a man." &gt;&gt; Did you hear that? A man, &gt;&gt; not a wimp, &gt;&gt; not a coward, &gt;&gt; not a boy in a man's body, but a man. A man forged by conviction, tempered by the word, anchored in righteousness, unashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'll tell you, God ain't searching for for crowds and programs and somebody's committee. He's searching for a man, &gt;&gt; strong man, men of courage, men with a vision, &gt;&gt; not grown infants, but men. Men in the faith, men of conviction, men with courage who will take up the hedge and stand in the gap. Ezekiel was calling for this someone to make up the hedge. &gt;&gt; A hedge was a wall of defense. And when it was broken, the enemy could could rush in. And this is what fathers are. They're walls of defense. They are protectors of the next generation. They are intercessors for their family and for the church. And when we lose fathers, We lose vision. When fatherhood is absent, the trumpet begins to sound, an uncertain sound, and soldiers then scatter, not knowing which way to go. Without fathers to steady the ranks, many will turn their backs to the battle, or worse, they'll lay down their weapons in surrender. God said, "I need a man. &gt;&gt; I need a man to make up the hedge. someone to repair the breach, to fill the gap, to stand like a wall of intercession, of righteousness and courage between the people and destruction. Well, it takes strength to build. It takes sacrifice to repair. It takes a man of God to stand when others are running. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, this is no time to retreat. &gt;&gt; This is no hour to hesitate. This is a moment for men to rise, to make up the hedge, to stand where the wall is broken, to hold the line &gt;&gt; until Christ returns. And if there ever was an hour for men of righteousness to step forward, men who will not bow, men who will not burn out, but men who will not compromise. It is now that we need men to step forward, &gt;&gt; fill in the gap. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul said &gt;&gt; as he commanded us and this was a command. Watch ye and I'm going to take some of these words. Watch ye stand in the faith. Quit ye like men. Be strong. &gt;&gt; Men of faith, men of vision, men who don't quit, men of strength and integrity. Look at the Paul Paul's admonition where he says he says watch ye you know men like brother Biscoll they were the watchmen of the night they were watchmen up on the walls who warned of the coming dangers who guided others in their battle. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in Matthew 26 he said watch and pray that you enter not into temptation. Peter would say, "Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, as a ruined lion, walketh about seeking those whom he may devour." &gt;&gt; You see, a sleeping watchman endangers the whole city, &gt;&gt; and a sleeping father leaves his home defenseless. &gt;&gt; And the first call is, "Wake up. &gt;&gt; Come to attention. Watch. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be observant. Be diligent. Be involved. &gt;&gt; Stand fast in the faith. &gt;&gt; To stand faith means hold the line. &gt;&gt; Refuse to retreat. Anchor yourself on solid ground. &gt;&gt; Philippians said, you know, Paul said in Philippians, stand fast in one spirit, one mind, striving together for the faith of the gospel. Ephesians 6 says, "Haven't done all to stand. &gt;&gt; Stand therefore." &gt;&gt; Amen. That means don't bend when when the culture pressures you. &gt;&gt; Don't shift when whims of doctrines blow. &gt;&gt; Plant your feet on the word of God and say, "I will not be moved from this solid foundation." And then he says, "Quit ye like men." &gt;&gt; And this is an old phrase meaning act like men. Conduct yourself with courage. Rise to manhood. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Don't shrink." Here's what he's saying. Don't shrink. Don't cower. Don't act like children. Be men. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be fathers who nurture. Be protectors who shield. Be warriors who fight. &gt;&gt; Be priests who pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is exactly what Ezekiel was crying for. A man to stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; It's not an hour for hesitation. This is no season for retreat. &gt;&gt; You see, heaven is calling for men of courage, men with conviction, men with faith to stand forward and take their place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we lose fathers and fatherhood, and I'm talking about real men of God now, uh we lose something invaluable. We we lose our our vision. Without fathers, the trumpet of the spirit begins to sound with uncertain notes, uncertain sounds, and the word becomes muffled and and the direction becomes blurred and and the church becomes confused about which way to march. That's right. &gt;&gt; And instead of advancing, there are too many that are retreating. Instead of facing the enemy head on, some are turning their backs and running with fear, while others are laying down their weapons and surrender. Too complacent, too lukewarm, not fervent in spirit. You see, a father's presence brings clarity. A father's voice, a father's voice steadies the ranks. And when fathers fall silent, sons stumble. And when trumpets lose their sound, soldiers scatter. &gt;&gt; And when real men of faith no longer stand, then the line of battle is broken. &gt;&gt; Elisha cried these same words over Elijah at his rapture. And now Joash will use them and say them over Elisha repeat repeat repeating the same word because he carried the same spirit. And he was showing that this phrase was used to acknowledge a prophet's heavenly worth, their unseen but supreme role in the nation. These men would stand between heaven and earth. men anointed not just with words but with a divine commission. &gt;&gt; And I just want to say brother Biscll was a father. &gt;&gt; He was more than a preacher. &gt;&gt; He was a father. &gt;&gt; And Paul wrote and and and he said in Corinthians, he said, "No, you have 10,000 instructors in Christ, yet you have not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I have begotten you through the gospel. &gt;&gt; That was brother Ed. &gt;&gt; He was a father in the faith. &gt;&gt; He was a spiritual patriarch &gt;&gt; to us all. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was he he would mentor with grace. He strengthened with wisdom. He encouraged us with with a unshakable vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. He kept his eyes on the mission to get the message into the hearts and the and the hands of the people of God. That was his goal. That was his vision. That was the driving force. Get the message. Get this word in their hands. Let it then get in their hearts. Then it will transform lives and then there therefore transform a world. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you about this man. He wasn't interested in building his own kingdom. He didn't gather men to himself. &gt;&gt; He pointed them to Christ &gt;&gt; and he did his very best everywhere he went. When he left, it wasn't his sermons he left. It wasn't his tapes. &gt;&gt; It wasn't his It wasn't him that he tried to multiply and increase. No sir, he he kept his eyes on one mission. His his eye was single. get this message into the hands and the hearts of the people. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't gather men to himself. He pointed them to Christ. He did his best to equip and release them into harvest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His zeal for the truth was unmatched and his passion was contagious and his legacy immeasurable. Amen. &gt;&gt; And these are not just mere words. &gt;&gt; They're words that I pinned from the Holy Spirit and speak to you today. &gt;&gt; Through his life, the message was translated into hundreds of languages. &gt;&gt; He wasn't just content &gt;&gt; for to stay with these four walls. That's right. &gt;&gt; It wasn't about building a kingdom here. &gt;&gt; It was about God's kingdom, &gt;&gt; reaching everyone. He Heard the call that he would have a people out of every nation from tribe and people. He He lived that. He believed that. He wanted you to hear it and experience this living God for yourself. And that was his legacy as his true his for truth was unmatched. He wasn't just a man of ideas. He was a man of impact. &gt;&gt; He'd get an idea. He'd get a catch a vision of something like the hub as you were talking about and start out with a kiosk and and and and then talk to the different one. You're not getting it. You're not getting what I You're not getting it. &gt;&gt; I want this where all the world, anybody can read it in their language. &gt;&gt; Anybody can receive this. He was a man of impact. And when Joash cried out to Elisha, "My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof," he was declaring, "You're our strength. You're our defender, our guide, our hope. You're the one who has bore the weight of the battles. You You're the one who's carried us further than what our strength could ever have done. And this isn't just the cry for a prophet or for a pastor. It is the cry we should utter for every true father. Let me talk about fathers just for a moment. You see, a father in the home is not just a provider of bread. He is a guardian of purpose, &gt;&gt; the builder of confidence, the chariot that carries his family through the battlefield of life. And like a chariot, he carries the weight, the weight of prayer, provision, protection, and discipline. Like a horseman, he he will charge ahead, leading by example with courage and stability and clarity. And when a father is present and engaged, his children can ride on his strength. His home is not left just to drift. It's driven with a purpose. He and no doubt mother too are are the first preacher that is his children here. the first protector they trust, the first counselor they can fight in. And then there are spiritual fathers, the horsemen of the church and the chariots, the tanks of the battle. A spiritual father is like one like uh Elisha. He hears from God. He speaks the word. He he guides others in their calling. And he's not he's not interested in followers for himself. But what he's interested in is raising sons. equipping soldiers &gt;&gt; for the battle. And he doesn't carry swords and shields. He He carries intercession and revelation. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't lead the charge and to natural war, but in spiritual realms. We're talking about spiritual fathers, &gt;&gt; binding devils, breaking strongholds, guiding the army of the Lord. And I want to tell you, you've had a father in this church. Brother Biscllow was a leader, one who led revival, as a word got into our hands as as a message would become available and the weight of me of the message came upon that era and we went from the surface to to the depths of God. And the message burned in his like fire in his bones and he couldn't be quiet about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had a passion that drove him and there was a flame of fire that burned within him. And let me tell you, it wasn't contained within him. He set everybody else around him on fire, too. &gt;&gt; He inspired ministers &gt;&gt; and others to spread the message, to do their part. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, when a man like that is gone, you feel it. &gt;&gt; You feel the void. Because you're not just losing a preacher, you're losing a pillar, &gt;&gt; a strategist, a voice that helped to shape your life. And just like Elisha stood between Israel and defeat, fathers stand between their children and chaos, between the church and deception, between the young and destruction. They are the intercessors, coverings, visionaries, gatekeepers. You see, a father may not always be in the spotlight, but when he's gone, the cry goes out from thy father, my father, the chariot of Israel, the horsemen thereof. &gt;&gt; Because why? Because you realize he carried you more than you knew. &gt;&gt; He fought battles you never saw. He bore burdens and silence. He brought you further than you could have gone on your own. &gt;&gt; And the failure of fathers, whether through absence, disengagement, abandonment of responsibility, or spiritual negligence, it has devastating effects on both individual lives and even on the fabric of society. The moral decay is because of the lack of fathers. Real men. &gt;&gt; We need real men. &gt;&gt; We need fathers, real men of God. We need them not to be passive, &gt;&gt; but we we need them to be engaged and active and standing in the gap for our family. We need men in this church, men around the world that'll be fathers, &gt;&gt; stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; The Bible, history, and modern study, it all confirms this. It is a very sobering truth. When fathers fail, the foundation of nations weakens. &gt;&gt; And here's a breakdown. Let me just take just for a moment and just break down the dangers of a nation or society that they face. And as I do, let me be clear in speaking today about fathers. I I'm not at all trying to minimize the role of women and mothers. Their place is vital, irreplaceable, and honored by God. Where would we be if it wouldn't be for wonderful godly women in our church, &gt;&gt; in our lives, in our families? &gt;&gt; Women like Sister Ruth Biscll who stood gallantly beside her man and labored with him. &gt;&gt; And she too stands as an example of godliness. And I I just pray God continue to comfort you and bless you today &gt;&gt; for your godly life and example and what you have given to the Lord because you've given much the family as we go back to this thought of fatherhood of why we're here today though we're here to remember a father a great man of God. And it is right, it's only right to emphasize the strength and the vision that fathers bring. Even as we fully recognize how essential mothers are in God's design, the family is the building block of any society. The fathers are the pillars of that foundation. The scripture upon which our message hinges is found in Malachi 4:6. And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. And the this this verse even shows us how critical that fathers are to God's plan. You see, it it shows that when the hearts of the fathers are rightly turned toward their children in love, in guidance and nurture, in in spiritual leadership, that there is a blessing, stability and life. But when fathers turn away from their home, when they neglect their responsibility to protect and to nurture, when they withhold their presence and their love, the result is not blessing, but it's a curse. &gt;&gt; And a father's absence leaves a vacuum. His neglect breaks that hedge of protection we talked about around the family. The heart of a child that should have been strengthened by love instead becomes wounded by neglect. &gt;&gt; And when enough fathers abandon their role, this curse just spreads. And it's not just in one home, but it's in then you find it in an entire society that becomes corrupted because fathers let down on their responsibility. &gt;&gt; Malachi though gives us hope. He says God in promises a restoration, a turning of hearts that when fathers return to their God-given roles, when children's hearts are restored to their fathers, even then the curse is broken and the blessings can flow again. &gt;&gt; But without fathers, families become fractured. Children grow up without discipline, without identity or spiritual guidance. marriages and will they will lack stability and leadership and a broken home al often becomes the seedbed of broken communities. And let me tell you when fathers are absent or disengaged children will struggle with self where they will they will struggle with self-worth and with identity. They'll seek belonging in gangs, ideologies, and addictions. They they'll lack that emotional resilience and discipline. You see, a father gives a child a name. It gives him affirmation. He sets boundaries and without that confusion, confusion reigns. And this Sodom world has produced a generation of lost men who don't know their identity. &gt;&gt; And this is especially true of young men who either withdraw into, you know, hiding in their dark rooms many times on the dark web, spending their hours, you know, gaming and senseless nonsense and wasting their lives. or or either they will they will do that or they'll lash out in aggression. And it's all stemming from an inward cry, where is my father? And numerous studies have confirmed that the fatherless is directly connected to increased rates of juvenile delinquency, higher likelihood of incarceration, greater prevalence of violence and rebellion. Proverbs 13 said, "He that spareth his rod hateth his son, but he that loveth him chastises him times." And without fathers to discipline and direct, the conscience of a generation becomes uncon uncultivated and unrestrained and it brings about a moral decline and a spiritual decline. You see, fathers are meant to be priests of the home. &gt;&gt; They are to guide their families in truth. &gt;&gt; They are to lead them in righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. When when they abandon this role, children grow up with no reverence for God, no fear of God. Amen. And homes will lack prayer and and the word and worship. And the church then becomes weakened trying to compensate for what should have been taught at home. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, you see fathers, you know, remind they pass to you the stories of the past generation. The the it gives you a sense of heritage. in the book of Judges said that there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. &gt;&gt; Well, how did this happen? How does an entire generation forget the God who parted the sea, &gt;&gt; who thundered on Mount Si? &gt;&gt; How do they forget a God who made walls to fall and giants to flee? How do they forget a god like that? &gt;&gt; It happens when men when fathers quit telling the stories. &gt;&gt; When testimonies grow silent, when faith, you see, that's when faith begins to die. We must have the testimonies of the fathers. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the memories of God's power are no longer spoken, then miracles become a myth. &gt;&gt; And revelation turns to religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just quote to you from a special friend of mine, Brother Benjamin Puit of Hardy, Arkansas. We're no relation. We, you know, he's not his family wouldn't horse thieves because they spell the name the same. So, brother Benjamin Puit wrote this and I want to say it because I couldn't say it better and because it was a heartfelt tribute that I want to bring to you just from the one of millions from around the world that would love to express their appreciation today if they were stood in my shoes. But he shared the impact of this ministry and he said what a what a profound influence brother Biscll had on my generation from sermons like idols crafted from the message Rahab's secret &gt;&gt; and he said my favorite the value of the flaw &gt;&gt; to the massive amount of work he did to spread the message here and overseas he will be greatly missed by all of us. He will be forever the young man in the checkered shirt, a witness to his generation that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Well done, faithful servant. Welcome home. &gt;&gt; You see, we need fathers though who testify. nearly three and a half, four hours. The last I would say probably the last convention sermon brother preached. He preached in my church at the dedication and for nearly four hours we sat spellbound as he described that moment as I sat on a log. &gt;&gt; And he shared with us the change, what had impacted his life, what had given him vision, what had given him the drive, what had given him the passion. And I'll tell you, we need fathers who testify. Men who have a testimony &gt;&gt; that they too met God &gt;&gt; that they're not even testifying of another generation, but they can bring it right out into their own life. I met God and he changed me &gt;&gt; and you too can have this change. &gt;&gt; We need fathers, natural and spiritual, who open their mouths and declare, "Let me tell you what God did for me. Let me tell you how he healed. Let me tell you how he saved. Let me tell you how he delivers. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you when the fire fell and the word came alive and that day that heaven opened to me, &gt;&gt; not a drag doctrine, &gt;&gt; not borrowed phrases, &gt;&gt; but a living testimony of a living Christ. &gt;&gt; That was the power of brother Ed Biscll. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One of his greatest values to this generation was not just his knowledge of the message, &gt;&gt; but the life that was poured out of his testimonies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he spoke, you didn't just hear about the word. &gt;&gt; You felt its weight. You tasted of his freshness. &gt;&gt; You You burned with his fire. &gt;&gt; He didn't speak as a man. Recall in history. He spoke as a man who had walked in it, bled in it, prayed in it, and seen the supernatural hand of God move again and again. And he reminded us that God doesn't just reveal truth. He demonstrates it. &gt;&gt; And he taught us that when revelation touches the heart, it becomes more than information to us. It it becomes a a an ignition. It ignites our faith. It puts a a fire in our lives. &gt;&gt; Brother Biscom believed and proved that revelation revelation was not just to sit cold on a shelf. &gt;&gt; It was meant to burn in the heart, &gt;&gt; to empower the church, &gt;&gt; to drive men to their knees, to raise up sons and daughters who will carry the to the torch forward. He taught us that truth isn't fully known until it's lived. &gt;&gt; That the word comes with power, not just to inform us, but to transform us. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't come with a lecture. He came as a man anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Anointed, sent forth by God, empowered by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I tell you today, don't let the stories die. If we don't tell them, if we don't recount the wonders, if we don't stir the remembrance of what God has done in this generation, there will be another generation who will rise, who knows not the Lord nor his mighty works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I say, but not on our watch. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, let fathers arise. Let the testimonies of God's goodness flow. Amen. Let the next generation hear the stories, not of a dead religion, but of a living God who changes and transforms lives. That you can never be the same again. Once that fire has touched your heart, tell him how he saved you. Tell him how he healed you. Tell him how he delivered you. Tell him how he revealed himself in this hour. Don't be ashamed of the gospel of Christ. It is the power of God into salvation. &gt;&gt; And in doing so, you'll pass the flame &gt;&gt; and you'll keep the fire burning. &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 3, you can read it. It gives a terrifying picture of a nation under judgment. The mighty men are removed. The children becomes rulers. People oppressed by each others. Youth rise up against their elders. And this is what happens when fatherhood is lost. Both will literally and symbolically you know the the nation becomes disordered, disrespected, dis destabilized. And when spiritual fathers fail to mentor, I'm talking to you. They fail to dis you know to disciple to raise up son when when the church lacks visionary leadership. The the pews become just full of desperate souls and pulpits empty of real men of visions. And the next generation don't know how to fight. &gt;&gt; They don't know how to serve. &gt;&gt; They don't know how to lead. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And this is what Paul said. You have 10,000 instructors, but not many fathers. &gt;&gt; You see, instructors teach doctrine, &gt;&gt; but fathers reproduce destiny. &gt;&gt; Without fathers, the church becomes an orphanage. &gt;&gt; Without direction, Proverbs 29 said, "Where there is no vision, the people perish or they they, you know, they cast off restraint." When fathers fail, there's no more long-term vision, no standard of behavior. There's no model of manhood, no fear of consequences. And you know what the result of it? A sodom world, &gt;&gt; confused masculinity, sexual chaos, cultural decay. That's right. &gt;&gt; But the good news is &gt;&gt; God's going to have some real men in this day. &gt;&gt; God is still in the business of restoring the hearts of the fathers to the children of God at raising up raising up natural fathers who will take back their homes. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about with your fist or you being a bully. I'm talking about on your knees. &gt;&gt; There's where real strength is. We need spiritual fathers who will dis who will disciple the next generation. We need prophetic voices who will cry out in the wilderness and say, "Prepare the way of the Lord." Because, friend, we are later than this day. We are sooner to the end than we've ever been. &gt;&gt; We're closer now than ever. Brothers and sisters, a true father is heaven's gift to the generation. He's more than a man. He's a chariot, a horseman, a voice, a shield. He's a conduit of blessings where the power of God can flow. So when we lose a father in the faith, let's not just merely weep and shed a few tears. &gt;&gt; Let's remember their faith. &gt;&gt; Let's consider their end. &gt;&gt; Carry their fire. The Bible said, "Mark the perfect man and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace." &gt;&gt; Let me take a few moments and go back to the story of Joash. like Elisha. Let's compare that just a moment with our precious brother Biscll. This man placed his hands upon the hands of younger men, sons in the faith, steady in their aim, strengthening their grip, guiding their fire. The Bible said that he in he instructed Joash to take a bow, put an arrow in the bow, &gt;&gt; put your hand upon the bow. And then Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands. Now in the realm of business and life, many stand today right here in this church, right here in this congregation, right here in this family. Many of you are successful men and women, but not without knowing where your aim was first aligned. to his daughters, to his son-in-laws, to his grandchildren, to those he mentored. You didn't get here alone. &gt;&gt; He put his hands over your hands. &gt;&gt; And like Elisha with the king steadying your grip, calming your nerves, helping you pull back the bolstering of destiny. When your vision was uncertain, he gave you direction. &gt;&gt; When your hands trembled with inexperience, his were steady with wisdom. When you question your calling or your capacity, he reminded you of the target. He showed you how to hit and to make sure you didn't miss the mark. And let's be honest, real honest. Now, the business acumen, the abilities, the work ethics, the unshakable confidence, the the the quiet discernment that many of you carry today. It was imparted by him. &gt;&gt; He didn't just give you advice. He gave you himself. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the businessmen, the leaders, the entrepreneurs, the visionaries you are today because he didn't just believe in you. He invested in you. &gt;&gt; And and you see that's legacy. That's fatherhood. That's the strength of the of a chariot and leadership of a horseman. And now you must not just carry his teachings, but you must carry his fingerprints on every arrow that you launch. And to you children of God today here assembled and around the world, I tell you, he showed us how to aim the arrow of the word straight. &gt;&gt; Straight and true &gt;&gt; toward deliverance, toward healing, toward restoration, toward victory. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And he stood behind us when we doubted. And he stared at us when we when we trembled. And and he told us, "Shoot. &gt;&gt; Don't be complacent. &gt;&gt; Don't be idle. &gt;&gt; Put an arrow in your bow and drive back and shoot it." &gt;&gt; He taught us to believe in the power of the revealed word and a faithful God. That's the things he passed on to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He stood behind us when we wasn't sure we could do it. &gt;&gt; When our hands trembled, when our confidence faltered, he was there. His faith stronger than our fear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he didn't take the bow from our hands. &gt;&gt; He placed his hands over ours. &gt;&gt; He didn't aim for us. He aimed with us. And when we hesitated, when we questioned if the arrow would fly or even if we were even worthy to hold the bow, he would just simply say, "Shoot." &gt;&gt; And that one word carried power, not because of its volume, but because of the authority. &gt;&gt; He believed in the arrow because it was the word. &gt;&gt; And he believed in the spirit that gave it flight. And he believed in us because he knew the one who had called us. &gt;&gt; And he taught us not to trust in our own ability, but in the power of the revealed word and the faithful of a covenant keeping God. &gt;&gt; And he taught us that when the word is revealed, it must be released, not held back, huh, not analyzed to death, &gt;&gt; but loosed into the battlefield with prophetic purpose. He taught us that arrows wasn't made for quivers. &gt;&gt; They were made to fly. &gt;&gt; And he's showed us how to fly them straight. &gt;&gt; Amen. We didn't just walk away with some instruction. We walked away with an impartation. &gt;&gt; His steady hand still rest on us. His voice still echoes in our spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now we have to aim boldly. We must stand firmly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And with all faith shoot again &gt;&gt; because he showed us how &gt;&gt; everywhere he went. He put arrows in the hands of believers. libraries of of books, tapes, the message hub to go into every language, millions of dollars poured into missions. He preached it in the jungles. He risked his life behind the iron curtain. He was arrested in China &gt;&gt; for what? For what reason? &gt;&gt; What was it? What was his criminal act of putting arrows of deliverance in the hands of God's elect? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it was. It was the arrow of deliverance. The arrow. The message is what is needed for the rapture. He put it in your hands. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Open the window &gt;&gt; eastward." Huh? Our eyes was ever on the coming of the Lord. If we missed that target, &gt;&gt; we have missed everything. And he opened it and Elisha said, "Shoot." And he shot. And he said, "The arrow of the Lord's deliverance." You see, that arrow had a name. It was victory deliverance. &gt;&gt; That that arrow had a target. Wasn't just shot. It had a target. The enemy strongholds. That arrow had a source. The revealed word of God. As I've said, he taught us not to keep it in the quiver. And he also taught us not to fire wildly. &gt;&gt; He taught us to aim with revelation and to shoot with faith, knowing that what leaves our hands under God's direction will hit the mark. And we are who we are today in business, in ministry, in life because he placed his hand over ours. And he helped us to release the arrow of the Lord's deliverance. And he taught us that victory is not just a feeling, it's a declaration. And sometimes all it all it takes is a man of faith to stand right behind you and say, "Shoot, &gt;&gt; release it. &gt;&gt; Take the message. Go with it." And you'll discover you had deliverance in your hand the whole time because this message is the arrow of deliverance. &gt;&gt; It'll deliver the sick. It'll deliver the lost. It'll deliver the dying. It is the arrow of God's deliverance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the story don't end there. Elisha told the king, "Take the arrows and strike the ground." That was to symbolize total defeat of the enemy. You know the story. He took arrows, struck three times, and the prophet was angry and he said, "Thou should have smitten five or six times." &gt;&gt; Thou you would have smitten Syria until thou had consumed it. And this man who has gone on before us, I want to tell you friends, he didn't live a a life of hard half-hearted faith. When he struck, he struck hard. &gt;&gt; And he struck often. And he stuck with a purpose. &gt;&gt; Not for partial victory, &gt;&gt; but for total triumph. &gt;&gt; And now the bow is in our hands. And and the arrows of deliverance are now ours is in our possession. And we should not strike timidly. &gt;&gt; We got to we must not be content with just partial victories. &gt;&gt; We got to carry this legacy by taking this message to its final destination. &gt;&gt; The rapturing of the bride and the final defeat of the enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; His body may rest, but I'll tell you, his influence marches on in the pulpits that he birthed, in the churches he established, in the voices that he helped steady, and in the truth he championed. So let it be said of him like it was of Elisha. He's the real strength of the nation, spiritual chariot, a mighty horseman. So, let us honor his memory today. And I just want to say, leave these thoughts with you. Let's just not do it with just mere tears, &gt;&gt; but with bold obedience, with the arrows in our hands, and and with a fire in our heart, let us strike the let us strike the ground, saints. Strike again and again and again. What do you say, Brother Tim? I I struck and and I didn't achieve it and I struck again and I didn't achieve it. I tell you, God's a God of one chances, two chances, three chances. Come on, keep on striking. You try. I tried to serve the Lord once and I failed and I tried to serve him and I failed and I tried. Strike again. Strike again. Strike again till your enemy is defeated. You can overcome anything. Drugs, alcohol, tobacco, sex, every kind of demon there is in the world. You are called to be an overcomer in this age. You are not leaving out of here a defeated church. You are leaving here a triumphant church. &gt;&gt; Strike again. &gt;&gt; Until the enemy is no more. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. We struck before and we saw revivals. We felt the fire. But too often we have stopped short. We've settled for a season of victory when what God wants is total deliverance. &gt;&gt; We rejoiced in a man of God and a move of God, but we haven't carried it to completion. &gt;&gt; We must finish this. Amen. &gt;&gt; We struck the ground three times when we should have struck it more. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said, "And the man of God was wroth with him. Thou should have smitten five or six times. Then thou would have smitten Syria." You see, the tragedy, the real tragedy wasn't in starting. It was stopping too soon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't rest. &gt;&gt; We got something to finish. &gt;&gt; We got a battle to win. &gt;&gt; There's a rapture that must be that we must carry be carried toward. There is a resurrection that is dependent on you. You're the last runners in the race. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we must strike again and again and again and again until the enemy is no more. Until death itself is defeated &gt;&gt; and the dead in Christ rise. &gt;&gt; We're in that day. &gt;&gt; Strike again. &gt;&gt; Not just a dent, not just a delay, but destruction, completion, finality. We're a generation that must break the cycle. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham told us again, and I could read the whole quote, but you know it where the cycle of revival and death has never failed. Every generation would start with fire with passion and after a little while it &gt;&gt; we get a desire you know to refine the message to make it platable for everybody &gt;&gt; and we lose the real vision &gt;&gt; and the real purpose. Every movement has started out that way &gt;&gt; and they lost it because they wanted to refine it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Make it better. &gt;&gt; You can't make it better. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you. I'll tell you what. You know, every ever every ever every age has went with the cycle of revival and death. It has never failed. &gt;&gt; But I say, "Oh, God, don't let that be our story, too. Let us be one that breaks the cycle. &gt;&gt; The history will show it. A fire falls, a people rises, altars are built, churches, and then slowly declines creeps in and the passion will fade and the purity drifts and the vision dims. I'll tell you again, we must break the cycle. We are not called to repeat past awakenings and then let the fire go out and sit then upon the ashes of memories of the past revival. No sir, we are called to finish this. We are to call. We are called to strike again and again. Not with lukewarmness. We are not Leodosans. We are the bride, the elect, the chosen, the called, the anointed. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are called to carry the cho the torch forward until this fire leads to a rapture, not relapse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And no, it's not the time to watch the flame. It's the time to become the flame, &gt;&gt; to be the light in this time of darkness. &gt;&gt; And there must be men rise. Men with passion, with purpose, with vision. Not casual men, not men of convenience, not comfortable men, &gt;&gt; but men who burn. &gt;&gt; Men who build. Men who break through. Men who are not just spectators, but soldiers. &gt;&gt; Not just consumers, but deliverers. Not Not just sons, but fathers raising up the next wave of warriors. It ain't the time for just symbolic swings of the sword and fancy moves and whatever. That ain't the time. It's the time for decisive strikes of obedience until the enemy is shattered, &gt;&gt; totally shattered and the kingdom of God is revealed in power. &gt;&gt; We can talk about this flame and we can look at this flame. We can talk about how it burned brightly. It's time for you to burn. It's time for you to be the flame. It's time for you to be on fire. It's time for you to have a passion and a drive within your life. I must finish this. I can overcome. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't care what vices hold you. I don't care what sin has beset you. I don't care what it is. You can overcome because an arrow of deliverance has been put in your hands. &gt;&gt; We have not been called to defeat. We have been called to victory. &gt;&gt; So I say, let the sons who were trained by the fathers now become the fathers to the next sons. Let the hands of once trembled, now strike with boldness. &gt;&gt; Let the arrows of deliverance be fired again until strongholds fall until chains break until silence turns to song. Let let me tell you again, don't stop and don't look back and don't strike once and expect to be enough. Strike again and again and again and again [Applause] until your enemy is no more. [Music] &gt;&gt; And may this generation be the generation that finishes what others began. &gt;&gt; This is a call for God called men. God's not calling for polished professionals. &gt;&gt; He's not calling for platform performers. &gt;&gt; He's want real true men of God. &gt;&gt; Men with backbone, men with a burden, men with boldness, men who are sure of their calling, who aren't shaken by the trends. &gt;&gt; They're not listening to the applause of the world. They're not worried about the fear of rejection. that he's calling for men to rise up with a holy boldness and preach the word. &gt;&gt; My God, if there ever was a time that the word needs to be preached is now. &gt;&gt; And I say preach it. &gt;&gt; Preach it in your life. Let it be your testimony on your job, in school, wherever you are. Let it be preached. Preach it &gt;&gt; with passion. Preach it because you're called. Preach it because God handed you an arrow &gt;&gt; of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Preach it. Preach heaven high and hell hot with fire in your bones and truth in your mouth. Not men of ego &gt;&gt; and insecurity. &gt;&gt; Heaven help us. &gt;&gt; We have had enough kingdom builders. &gt;&gt; We don't need more men preaching from their complexes. Too many are preaching in their pulpit from their complexes. &gt;&gt; Nursing their wounds, &gt;&gt; masking their insecurities with pulpits and microphones. We don't need that. &gt;&gt; That's what it we do not need that. We need men &gt;&gt; of God, not men obsessed with recognition &gt;&gt; fighting for who sits on the right or who sits on the left. You know Jesus silenced that spirit among his disciples and we must silence that in the ministry today. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not about you or me. &gt;&gt; It's not about how great I am. It's how great he is. &gt;&gt; It's not getting you in love with me. It's getting you in love with him. That's what it's about. &gt;&gt; It's not about you, your kingdom, your domain. Amen. &gt;&gt; Like John the Baptist, let's be like him who when he told he was told they come to him, you know, he's provokers. They come and said, you know, that man Jesus that you baptized, you he's gaining more followers than you. He, you know, he's baptizing even more than you. And you know, John said these words that I wish every preacher could learn. &gt;&gt; A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven. &gt;&gt; And that's the spirit we need in this hour. man who knows that every ounce of influence, every drop of anointing, every door that has been opened for them is a gift from God. &gt;&gt; It is not the prize of ambition. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where there's no jealousy, no rivalry. You know, we we need men who can rejoice when others succeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need men that that when is it said Saul has slain his thousands &gt;&gt; but David his tens of thousands. &gt;&gt; We need real men who don't flinch at another man's victories. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They don't shrink in the shadow of another's anointing. They praise God that the kingdom is advancing. No matter who is the one swinging the sword, we're not in competition. We are in and under a divine commission. &gt;&gt; We need men who are settled, who are sure in their calling. Men who don't need to be the loudest voice, &gt;&gt; but who carries the clearest message. Men who are not building platforms for themselves, &gt;&gt; but altars for God. &gt;&gt; Men who are comfortable with their own identity &gt;&gt; and sure of their mission and they're fearless in their obedience. &gt;&gt; We need fathers, &gt;&gt; not just preachers. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need men who will nurture the sons, who will raise up others, who will multiply themselves in spirit and character. &gt;&gt; Men who protect, who stand in the gap, &gt;&gt; who say not on my watch. &gt;&gt; When the enemy comes for their home or comes for their church or comes for the truth, they stand in the gap. Not on my watch. You see, the the world is falling a apart because righteous men are silent. &gt;&gt; Evil advances when good men retreat. &gt;&gt; We need men who will stand. Men who are unashshamed of the gospel, who are uncompromising in truth, who who are unshaken by pressure, &gt;&gt; men who love righteousness and hate evil, men who will cry aloud and spare not. Men who will preach, repent. &gt;&gt; Why are we preaching repent? Cuz the world needs to repent. &gt;&gt; Man would needs to repent need to turn to God for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Now, God ain't calling celebrities. &gt;&gt; He's calling servants. &gt;&gt; He's calling fathers. &gt;&gt; He's calling watchmen. &gt;&gt; He's calling firebaptized men full of the Holy Ghost to carry the burden of the word to this last generation. &gt;&gt; They are the heartbeat of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; So, I say, rise up, men of God. I say to you preachers here, preach like there's no tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Preach as if the rapture is today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do everything you can to get everyone saved. &gt;&gt; You on your jobs at work, you say, "Well, this person is persecuting me." Do what you can do to take them to heaven with you. &gt;&gt; Don't condemn them to hell. Take them to heaven with you. Amen. Fight like a warrior. Love like a father. Stand like a pillar in a crumbling world. &gt;&gt; Don't just strike once, twice, half-heartedly. Joash had a bow. He had the arrow of deliverance in his hand. He had a prophet by his side. He had a window of opportunity. But when it came time to strike, he tapped. Three lazy, halfhearted strikes. Elisha was angry, not because he was disobedient, because he struck, but not with passion. &gt;&gt; He followed the command, but his heart wasn't in it. He was lukewarm, mechanical, going through the motions. &gt;&gt; He had access to total victory, but he lacked the zeal. &gt;&gt; His reluctant effort ensured only partial success. You see, he just did enough to say, "I tried." but not enough to bring the enemy to his knees. &gt;&gt; He struck, but he didn't strike like a man who believed that the the arrow was from God. Come on. That's right. &gt;&gt; If he'd have really realized these are the arrow of deliverance and this is my enemy, buddy, he would have given up. But you see what be what should have been a total deliverance became just a temporary delay and the enemy would come and he just had partial victories. And we're living in a day where too many are doing exactly what Joash did. They've been handed the arrow of deliverance, truth, authority, calling, anointing, and they barely move. And instead of striking the ground in faith, they're sitting on the couch in comfort. Instead of waring in prayer, they war on video games, &gt;&gt; consoles. Instead of building altars, they're building profiles. &gt;&gt; We were seeing a generation that has lost their way. Those that should have been be men are forever babies. &gt;&gt; We're watching a generation of grown infants, &gt;&gt; boys and men's bodies, &gt;&gt; lost in a fantasy world. &gt;&gt; Disconnected from reality. &gt;&gt; Where are the men? &gt;&gt; Amen. You You don't have much time. &gt;&gt; Where are men? You don't have time to waste. &gt;&gt; Where are men who will become fathers? &gt;&gt; Amen. Where are Where are those sons who will become fathers? Where are fathers then that will become warriors? &gt;&gt; God's not looking for Joash's. He's looking for David's. &gt;&gt; He We don't need a bunch of timid kings with polished armors who who flinch at the prophet's voice. We need We need men like David. Men who don't flinch at the battle line. Men who don't ask for permission to believe. Men who don't who who don't run away from the enemy, but they run toward their giants. &gt;&gt; Amen. And say, "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine &gt;&gt; that he should defy the armies of the living God?" &gt;&gt; That wasn't arrogance. That was a holy defiance. This young man was so filled with the faith in a big God. &gt;&gt; A God that was bigger than a Goliath. &gt;&gt; I want to know. I want you to see see something right here. You got to see your God is a big God. &gt;&gt; Your problem may be big. It may be called a Goliath. It may be a giant, but it ain't as big as your God. Your God is bigger than any of your problems. It's bigger than that situation in your life. Come on now. Amen. And if all you got is a sling in your hand, you got the name of Jesus to throw at it. Let it go. &gt;&gt; We need men like David who can't stomach the silence of cowards anymore. &gt;&gt; Men who are not afraid to bleed, to lead, to believe again. &gt;&gt; We need men like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego &gt;&gt; who will stand when everyone else is bowing. men who would defy the king's command rather than compromise on their convictions. &gt;&gt; These men didn't negotiate with the flames. They didn't even try to escape the flames or the fire. They said, "Our God &gt;&gt; is able to deliver us, &gt;&gt; but even if he doesn't, &gt;&gt; we will not bow." And that is the backbone, the courage, the kind of fearless resolve that this hour demands of us all. &gt;&gt; Men who will not flinch under pressure, but men who will burn before they bow. This is the hour for righteous men to rise. For the battle lines are drawn, &gt;&gt; giants are taunting, &gt;&gt; idols are rising, and the furnace is getting hotter, seven times hotter, combining the heat of every age. And even as that fire is burning hotter and hotter and hotter, so is the fire in our bones. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got a fire in our bones that is hotter than the fire of the furnace. And this is the hour for Davids to rise, for shamgars to take their their ox go to realize that they are called, anointed and placed for this rapture hour. &gt;&gt; This is the hour for Shadrachs to stand, for men of conviction to fear God more than they fear culture. &gt;&gt; I'm sick of men trying to be liked. That's right. &gt;&gt; We need men that are ready &gt;&gt; to be lit on fire by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Be a gentleman. Brother Biscllow was a gentleman. Be tender with your family. Certainly be kind. Be humble. Be wise. &gt;&gt; But don't be soft in spirit. &gt;&gt; Don't be weak in your conviction. Don't be afraid to raise your voice for righteousness, &gt;&gt; to draw your sword of truth &gt;&gt; and to strike the ground &gt;&gt; until every stronghold is shattered, &gt;&gt; totally shattered, &gt;&gt; we need men. And I'm talking to you now. I'm talking to you young men. &gt;&gt; We need men. Some of you, some of you boys are 40 and 50. &gt;&gt; I didn't make a mistake. We need men &gt;&gt; who will put the controller down &gt;&gt; and pick up the cross. [Applause] We need men that are turned off the screen and turn back to the scripture &gt;&gt; and hear the message. &gt;&gt; We need to leave apathy and step into authority. &gt;&gt; And I am urging you as a congregation, as his family, as his children, as his friends, as your fellow ministers to strike with all you've got. Amen. &gt;&gt; If brother Misco taught us anything, &gt;&gt; it's that half-hearted faith produces half deliverance. &gt;&gt; And now the mantle falls. The bow is in our hands. The word has been revealed. And the time is now &gt;&gt; to strike your enemy &gt;&gt; again &gt;&gt; and again &gt;&gt; and again &gt;&gt; until the enemy is no more. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the chariot and the horsemen of Israel are gone, then someone must rise. &gt;&gt; So I say it's not the job of one man. &gt;&gt; So it's the job of many. Let fathers rise again in the home, in the pulpit, &gt;&gt; in the streets, &gt;&gt; and in the prayer closet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when fathers stand, nations are protected. When fathers lead, generations are preserved. And when fathers speak, the enemy is silenced. &gt;&gt; And if the chariot is gone, if the horsemen had passed on, then I'm asking, who then will step forward? Elisha cried these words over Elijah when he went up and he caught the mantel that failed. Joash would repeat these words over Elisha, but he failed to strike the ground with full force. So I'm asking you, what will we do? Will we break this cycle of revival and death? Will this message die with his elders? Or will there be men of God that are God called, Godanointed, bloodwash, spiritfilled men &gt;&gt; who will strike the enemy until we gain that high ground of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Let us not repeat Joash's mistake. &gt;&gt; Let us rise with Elisha's resolve. &gt;&gt; Let the mantle of fatherhood, let both natural and spiritual, let it fall on us. I say to you, pick up your bow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Take the arrows of deliverance. &gt;&gt; It's been on your wall as decorations too long. &gt;&gt; Strike the ground again and again until the enemy is no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I close, Psalms 37 says, "Mark the perfect man and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace." And I say, brother Biscll, his hand was not tragedy. It was peace. &gt;&gt; It was a life well-lived, a faith wellkept. Oh, as we repeat these words, as we think of what it said in Revelation, that blessed are they that die in the Lord, that they may rest in their labors, and their works do follow them. Brother Biscll's influence marches on. His words walk behind us, walk behind him like a procession of light. His life has left a path that we can follow. So I say this, brother Bisll, go and rest. Go rest for a little while. Brother Bisll, join the fellowship of the saints. those of Paul, Wesley, Luther, Brother Brham, and countless of others who have longed for this day. But I say, Brother Biscll, if you can hear me, please don't rest too long because the trumpet will sound. The Lord shall descend &gt;&gt; and you will rise not in a theophony this time but in a glorified body reunited with the living saints to finish the mystery and fulfill the promise. &gt;&gt; And I conclude with this prayer the last prayer of the Bible. Even so come Lord Jesus come. [Applause] [Music] Amen. Mom, that's the kind of service dad want. &gt;&gt; Maybe long for some, but I think Brother Tim's paying brother Biscoll back. We were down in in in Louisiana. It was a five-hour meeting. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, a lot of you aren't maybe used to it, but this is our life. One day I struck &gt;&gt; and I've never been the same before &gt;&gt; and I've been striking and striking and striking. &gt;&gt; Amen. And those demons try to come back, I strike again. &gt;&gt; Try to take my children, I strike again. Try to get this church, I'd strike again. How many's with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the kind of service, brother Ed, if if God would let you look over the portals of heaven. We're rejoicing &gt;&gt; because we're not a bunch of wimps, brother Fzen. We are men of God that have stood the test of time and we shall not give up. &gt;&gt; Amen. This truth is still marching on. &gt;&gt; We aren't wimps, brother Tim. We'll keep striking. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who wants to strike today? &gt;&gt; Amen. We say, "Well, this is a service." Brother Donaldson, God bless you. I was just passing the secretary when I heard she says, "Andrew Donaldson's coming." I said, "You got to be kidding me." I told him, "Tell me he's going to preach next Sunday. He still got on a plane. I This This is marvelous." Brother Dioa, his dear son, but I've loved so many Israel so many years. And God bless you, Brother Neville, flying this all the way from Washington DC going to get on a plane at 4 in the morning to be with us. I think you heard the word today. &gt;&gt; I I think there's something that was burning in our hearts. And brother Benny Perry, God bless you. God bless you, brother Green. God bless all the ministers. Why don't you just lift up your hands so the people see you here? Brother Andrew, God bless you. Amen. Well, some call us a little bit fanatical. Well, we used to sing this whole course while you're standing. And I think we have a last song. Mike, do we have a last song? Family got a last song. All right. We used to sing this old old song.

Thank you for your support, David. Thank you for coming all the way, Lesie. It means so so much to us all to make this something of great tribute to a man that I have adored all my life and one great day he'll be standing at heaven's portal and we'll stand together as a family of God. What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see. Why don't we just rise stand? It's a service never to forget. Brother Ron, Brother Tim, never to forget. A great tribute to a great man of God. I know we can all say we've been affected some way. Heavenly Father, so often it is said it's our loss but heaven's gain. But what a great gain that was that day. His mom was sitting there and those four little gas. He went into that that other dimension. How sweet, how lovely it was. And do you see friends that have gathered here this morning, different ones in different capacities? He was a gentleman, a man of God, a father of fathers, a husband of husbands, pastor of pastors, a friend of friends. And so Lord, as we cherish these words that we've heard today and and different ones, Lord, maybe a little long, but it'll be okay. I know you'll you'll speak to every heart. And I just pray that you will pour out a blessing upon all that have been a part of this great day for us. Would you go with us and may your presence abide with us and may this memory of this great man never be lost from us. May we all go in peace and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your blessing upon each life. We ask for the glory of God in Jesus name. Amen. Well, that's what dad wanted. He just wanted a service, not a memorial, not a just a gathering of talk and chatter. Ron, thank you. Just just great great that you were a part this morning. And mom, thank you for sharing, Dad. That's so true. women and girls, you've you've given us a part of your father that you could have had, but we have been the beneficiaries of a great man of God. So, God be with you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
