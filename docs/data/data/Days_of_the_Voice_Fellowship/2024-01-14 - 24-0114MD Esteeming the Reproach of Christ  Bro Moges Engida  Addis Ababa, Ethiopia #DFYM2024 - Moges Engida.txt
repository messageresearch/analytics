today is a full product of the message of the hour no Pentecostalism by denomination no anglicanism no if you you know if you came from your religion sometimes you carry those things over but for him he was empty and God brought the message and filled so if if you think that this message has no power first hear him and then you can tell us whether this message has no power praise the Lord amen and I'm a witness so let us uh sing A Chorus as we invite him there's a song in Amharic and we used to sing it when we were still living in Ethiopia it says that means God is so good so I'd like all of

how can a real Born Again message [Music] believer desire to go into a club this is not to please our flesh our flesh is doing this because of what is in our heart and this is life changing while you are dancing over your Devils brother Timothy told us the right place to dance the right place to dance is on top of the devil's head hallelujah amen not in a club on top of the devil's head in the right atmosphere in a in place of in the presence of God in your place of Deliverance that's why Miriam took a tambourine and she began singing and rejoicing and dancing because she had crossed over so now that's where we dancing because everything we are hearing is taking us over on the other side and the Egyptians will been seeing we will see them no more we have crossed over we on the other sideen it's the year of the next phase you our next phase you are making a decision also to go on over ask your neighbor are you making that decision to go on over to cross over to the next phase hallelujah it's the year of the next phase because we have decided we have made the right decision we decided to esteem the cause of Christ the reproach oh my that's what Moses decided to do right and what happened they cross over they cross over hallelujah hallelujah oh my pastor mgus God bless you this is before the whole world I want to tell you it's going to be the next phase for you also in the ministry Hallelujah he told me he has just told me and he looked at me and said you gave me small time he did not finish the devil very well today he did not preach he was just just trying to show the devil what he can do with him praise God Amen and to those of you who want to hear him more tell your pastor to contact me hallelujah hallelujah and then I'm sure Pastor M will be happy he's a very busy man but I'm sure he'll be happy to visit the butam says in the message Revelation 4 he says leave your sermons let your sermon be lived and it is the voice of God that will bring reproach to them that rejected if there was a man of God is that man or woman leave your sermons don't try to preach them if you are not called to be a preacher you get all mixed up and how and messed up you will get people Tangled Up you will just re them and yourself too just leave your sermon the preacher like Pastor mgus is called to preach his and to leave it to if you can't leave it then you you stop preaching but you are supposed to leave your sermons and the reason why I read that the pr the sermon he preached today he has lived it he has lived like I told you yesterday he had a great vision he's a very able man very intelligent you know he very good education he had many aspirations but he made a choice he made a decision to serve God and so that's leave someone praise the name of the Lord amen and and uh I was I was talking to him some years ago if a lot terries we would love to hear her testimony and maybe in the next youth convention we will put a slot because many of you have questions how can I get married how can I find my lifetime partner they have a very good testimony on how God led him to his wife we were just very few maybe 15 at the time or 20 25 and there were no Believers in the church uh that were ready to get married to him and there were no Believers that he was ready to get married to but we preach in the message under no circumstance should a Believer Mar an unbeliever now most of you young people take that as a rule as a law and you're offended but when it came time to preach that in the church in Ethiopia I was very cautious I knew if I have to preach anything I would have to have full confidence that God will make it come to pass or I will be threatening my entire Ministry there because people will no longer believe the message I knew we in the planting season so I went in my study room and began praying I said God I know that this is what your Prophet says and I believe it but sincerely in the whole of Ethiopia in the whole of Ethiopia there's 25 Believers and how can I stand before them tell them no circumstance should I believe a and unbeliever they will ask me realistically tell us we I'm not compatible to the other one and these are the only Believers here so how what what do you want me to do I had no answers I was faced with a choice to either compromise the word or preach it as easy it was very difficult I think that was the hardest someone I prepared [Music] for I was very emotional but anyhow I came and preached it and I preached faith I told believe God God is able to give you a wife the prophet and I said the prophet says no circumstance should I believe and then I was talking about I think Abraham and I said how he had believed God and when God gave him his only son you know he went down there and he had made up his mind it's all I got but I'm going to kill him because you know I I believe God whatever he says I will do so as Abraham took his knife to kill his son then L and behold the voice told him abrah Abraham don't do that and when he looked on the side so alarm and then I gave another example I said Adam God said it's not good for a man to live alone and here he was alone and sad and he did not even know that why he was alone but God knew because he knew he needed a wife rather if you're not married and you are in in the age of marriage don't deceive us that you are happy God said is not good so it is not good for you to be single when you are ready for marriage so God said so not me and that's why he said to Adam and so when what happened God put Adam to sleep and when Adam woke up Eve was already standing there so when when Eve turned when Adam turned he saw her and he saying B of my bornes of My Flesh she shall be called a woman and so and Pastor morus was interpreting that service and he told me I think within that service or afterwards Hallelujah my wife is somewhere my wife is a Believer my wife is already born and she's somewhere and one day I'm going to lift up my eyes I'm going to turn my side and I will see her listen when he heard the word he decided he did not instead feel bad and they begin to judge and to question and begin he believed it without question and he gave a prophecy over his life and he declared it and in our first wedding in Ethiopia our first of the first sister who believe a group of Kenyans came and that Sunday their pastor our precious brother wck preached that Sunday service and as I came pastoras was here interpreting but everybody was crying and praying after the service and I came on this pull pit where the pastor was and and and I was you know I was also praying and so when I lifted up my eyes I began to speak to the people some some people were on the altar praying and crying tears falling down they were all messy and Pastor was also messy I love that messed up situation miracles happen in that atmosphere not when you out there debating and and questioning believe the word if they call you a fanatic stop be it and he raised up his head and when he turned his eyes the first person person he looked at was Sister M Pastor morus come to the office he told me Hallelujah I said what do you mean Hallelujah I said what do you mean he say today pastor turned I raised up my head I turned my head and I saw [Applause] her hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord I said are you sure he said I'm sure I gave him a booklet 100 Pages brother Becket arranged those courts of brother on courtship and marriage I told him let us not discuss this matter until after you finish this book 100 Pages he read it all in the shortest time possible and he came back to me he said I've finished it and I said you still believe that's the decision he said yes I turned my head and I saw her when you have a revelation no one can change you and then after that you know he prayed and prayed and prayed and told me you just wasting my time I've already I said have you prayed enough he said yes we went I think I was with my wife I don't know whether she's here we went and met pastor wck and he he gave us a green light did you hear what I said he did not begin shopping for her contact stop shopping for brothers contacts and sister's contacts you're talking to 10 sisters and at the end of the day you are Maring another one may God forgive you and if you have been doing that stop it immediately you're supposed to talk to a sister her or her father has given permission we believe that in the message we don't believe in dating we don't believe in dating we believe in courtship Pastor is a very good example of that and was a very highend class good job where are the brothers from Nairobi can you raise up your hand the brothers the brothers all these ones feared her that's the truth highend crass good job good car good Saturday but when the man who came out of the presence of God he just collected her with e he collected with e rather be in the presence of God that's how you will find your wife sister M some don't remember you come they see you and some are streaming for the first time they need to see you also on the camera praise the name of God I wish you'd be able to tell this testimony by yourself but time
