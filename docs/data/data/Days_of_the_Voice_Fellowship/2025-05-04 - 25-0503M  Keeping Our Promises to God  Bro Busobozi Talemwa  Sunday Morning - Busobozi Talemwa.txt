I just have a a few announcements but before we do that I think we can just read the scripture first then we Uh we are reading out of the book of Ecclesiastes chapter 5 and um we'll read verses four in to six in inclusive. 4 to6. Excuse me. We're reading in the name of the Lord. Suffer not. Sorry, I think I'm looking at the wrong verse. We're beginning from verses four. When thou voest a vow unto God, defund not to pay it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which thou hast vowed. [Music] Can we say amen to that? Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin, neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error. Whatever should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands, Amen. God bless you. You may be seated, please. Uh, first of all, I'd like to um I think these ones came in late. I'd like to recognize the presence of Joshua's siblings. Where are you? Can you stand? Can you all stand? Please join me to welcome them over there. God [Music] bless to have you fellowshipping with us this morning. God bless you. You may be seated. Amen. There. Their parents I think in Kungu and um so um it's good to have them in fellowship. Um, also there is sister Joyce. Sister Joyce, I know you had someone that wanted to give their life to the Lord. You're still praying for them. Where's Joyce? Ah, all right. Over here. God bless you for a while. I've been looking for you each service asking where sister Joyce, but I'm happy to see you today. God bless you. Amen. And also there's a brother David who has been uh lost for a while. Nice to see you, brother David. We are even waiting for your family to see them for the first time. Amen. Amen. Is the Lord good? Has he been good to you this week? Amen. Nice to see different ones. Um, you know, those who are coming for the first time, brother Omnet, I'm happy to see you dressed as an elder. God bless you, sir. God bless you. Nice to see you. Amen. Amen. I mean, I could mention one by one. I'm happy to see sister back there. Always always I'm so happy to see you in church and I'm so happy to see each and every one of you. Turn to your neighbor, tell them God bless you. You're welcome to the house of God. Amen. Amen. Um it's been a while without traveling uh for some time. Uh those of you who know me, I um I've actually some people were shocked to hear that, you know, I'm a pastor because they know me on a mission field, you know. So even when we started this church, I was traveling to Ethiopia quite often. Sometimes I would be gone for two months. And I remember brother Martin at the time was the person song leading and then ministering. And then we had a few brothers come along and others and we appreciate you know we appreciate the uh the ministry that God has joined to um you know to DVF. There is a reason why God does that. He puts um he provides where there is need. He knows what we don't know. So he knows my weaknesses as a pastor. So he would give me other men and women to be um to cover up and be the strength. And my absence I realize from the church is my weakness because you know I miss you and then you also miss me. Uh but all in all whatever we want to do is for the glory of God. I was supposed to be away on Easter. I was actually supposed to be in Australia because brother Gary had asked me to go take Easter meetings for you. Uh but unfortunately the visa for Australia took very long and so I could not make that trip. Uh but incidentally as soon as we had postponed the trip then pastor called and he said that he wanted us to go and be with him in Kenya. We by the way had a very good meetings there. Wonderful time of fellowship with the believers in in Kenya and we went with several brothers and his wife but I was about to say brother she used to travel with brother but this time uh is is very busy with his own family. So we are not able to travel but also brother polycup and who else? Just lift up your hand if yes who is that? Oh brother Dixon. Um and also brother Daniel. Brother Daniel. Is that is that all? Yeah. Oh also brother Josh. Nana Josh and brother praise. I remember praise. What is brother praise? We're going to praise. H okay. I couldn't see. Uh brother was uh obstructing. So um we traveled with those to Kenya and also with pastor Kaith from Jamaica and we shared the meetings there and it was a good time. It's a a blessing to serve the bride of Christ no matter where it is. So, uh, my visa for Australia finally came through and, um, it's unfortunate for you, for us that I'm going to leave for a while, but it's fortunate for them because we shall be preaching to them for a while. Um, I was just looking at most of the flights that come out of Africa I think Australia is the farthest destination uh from here is is farther than UK then um you know most of Europe and the US and um you know Canada it's a little farther away. Uh so I was thinking it's quite and I'm explaining this for you to understand. It does. It is logically impossible for for me to just go away for a weekend going to such a farther [Music] distance after spending so much and then you just go for three four days is practically not [Music] worth. So I'll be away for the entire month of May. And I'm also not actually going to Australia only. We are I'm going to have about 10 services in Australia. Australia. I'll visit Brother Gary for the first weekend. He's really my main host and then I'll be also going out into the country several other churches. Uh so for a total of about 9 to 10 services. So it's a working trip. I'm not going to relax. I'm going to uh preach this message. Um then from there, Australia, I will also go to Singapore. Singapore. Singapore is a country about five five to six hours away from Australia. So I'll also be there for a weekend and then I will return home. I'll be back next month. Uh but that is a short trip compared to the others I've taken because I've I've been away for two months. But it things are different now. God has given us a lot of brothers that can be able to minister to us and um you will I'm sure you're going to be blessed with the different uh ministries. Um I remember I used to travel and uh I have to get like I have a friend of mine brother Bate and others I would asking them to come and fill my place but things are different now we have brother Martin he'll be ministering to you we have brother Julius some people don't know brother Julius stand up stand up and face the people with That's brother Julius. We'll be ministering to you. Um we have um uh brother Emmanuel. Stand up. Brother Emanuel. Some people don't know him. This brother, you have never heard him minister. Uh but I've we posted one of his clips or one of his preaching on the on the group and it was really a blessing. Actually, brother took an entire sermon which really blessed us here. This brother miners in he will also minister I think one of the Wednesdays. We have brother Daniel. Brother Daniel, can you stand? Yeah. Look, look behind if you don't know him. right there. Brother Shem, how many were blessed by brother Shem's ministry? Hallelujah. Uh, he has a special ministry. Trust me, I cannot say that unless if I have seen it to be he will take a service or two. So, um, and then I think I've forgotten several. Yeah, brother poly. Yeah, he's uh he has an interesting ministry also growing and I'm sure that um uh these young brothers will stand with the uh other more experienced brothers and brother Joel. Where's brother Joel? Joel. Some people don't know you. So just Yeah. Brother Joel and brother Marvin here. Amen. Amen. So these brothers, I'm sure I've forgotten someone, but all these brothers are all from the house. So they will minister to us in my absence. Let us stand with them. Let us support them and um and you know, let us attend church. There are some service there are some churches where the pastor can't even announce he's going to be away. because he knows if he tries the church will be empty that's when everybody will plan to go to visit grandmother because pastor is not allowed we don't come to church for pastor we come to church because of the message because of the lord and so please always uh stand behind these brethren and the others who are going to be you know brothers and going to be ministering in the other department. I mean like Sunday school teachers, the media department, music department, singers. We have a lot of brethren really serving and I usually call all of them ministers because they're ministering in the temple. We we we so much appreciative all the sacrifices everyone is doing for the glory of the Lord. Also, I'd like you to remember Oh, before I leave that, will I send your greetings? Amen. Amen. Amen. Uh I will now send them when I know you have given them to me. And uh also I I would like you to pray for two things. Number one, we are looking for another venue for the fellowship in um the current one we have is at is this is the uh hall the main hall but it is in a little bit inconvenient because their times are strict. There's already a church for shipping there on Sunday mornings. So, we can only do Sunday uh evening. We need to find a place where we can have a Sunday morning service and other services as well. Would you pray for that please? Whether the Lord will provide also we shall be able to find a suitable place. Um also uh we are preparing a mega crusade. Um it's going to actually I was I'll just give you a little bit of uh what we are planning. We are planning to have about 50 young people and young does not mean age. You can be 50 no problem. But we want young because they can be able to move and evangelize, invite people. So we we are planning to go there and do a mega crusade with about 50 young [Music] people and um you know it's a bit different the way we want to do it. The budget will be big but I don't some of these things are not exclusive to Pentecostals. Why do they do crusades? The way they do them, the way they do them, yet they don't have a message. We have a message. So we are we are supposed to do more than even what they're doing. So this is what we are currently planning. And I just begin to prepare yourself. Who was registering the names? Brother Dan was. So if you are interested to participate in that, please see brother Dan and he will put you on the list. But I warn you, if you don't go to him, we will put you on the list anyhow and we shall tell you please these are the days. So you volunteer and go before we put you on the list brothers and sisters. Yeah. This is not exclusive to brothers. Amen. Amen. So, are we ready for the word? Amen. It's already midday, so I know I usually preach up to 120. Uh, but just in case I go a little overboard, uh, bear with me. Amen. Amen. So I'm going to uh speak on a very interesting uh subject. Keeping our promises to God. When you vow a vow unto God, define not to pay it. God has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you have vowed. Better is it that thou should not vow than thou should vow and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin. Amen. Don't tell an angel it was an error. Meaning an angel will come and will ask you what about what you promised God and you will say oh I made a mistake. Don't do that. So God will require you to pay the vows you have made to to keep the promises you have made. Praise the Lord. Now I want us to begin this looking at God and his word. And I'll do a little bit of quoting in this service in the message in the church of the living God. God is worth no more than his word. And if his word is no good, then he is no good. Now I if I can't put no confidence in what you say, you are no good. But you are just as good as your word is. this what I'm what we are going to talk about today. Can I have a little more sound? What we're going to talk about today is um let me call it Christian living. How are we expected to be uh as Christians, as believers? Are we not supposed to have a difference between us and the world? Are we supposed to tell lies every now and then? You find many believers don't have fear to tell lies. A lie as simple as I'll come and see you tomorrow and they will not come and they will not call to let you know that they are sorry they were not able to. They tell you, "Well, I I I will help you and they will not help you." And they not come back again to let you know why they were not able to help. You understand what I'm talking about? You know, they pledge on funerals. Many people do that on weddings. Go back and look at how many weddings you have pledged to and how much of that pledge you fulfilled. You see, when you pledge to a brother, you are pledging unto the Lord. So, if you do not fulfill your pledge, you have lied. You've not kept your promise. You are a liar and you are a fool according to the word. Praise the name of the Lord. So you see try to begin making inventory. Do you fulfill your pledges? We have land fund. When you in your heart pledged to the Lord and Lord if you do this I am going to give this mercy. Lord just try me. Can God fulfill his promise? Did you fulfill your promise? Did you keep your vow before God? Well, of course, no one knows your vow. But God knows your vow. Praise the name of the Lord. And so today, I'm the angel. Don't tell me it was an error. I am here to remind you. Whatever vow you make, oh God, if you give me this child, I am going to do this for you. You know, many times in our prayers, we make this vow, especially when our back is against the wall and you really need God to come, not just an encouragement, but you need something to you pushed to make a vow. Oh God in your desperation. Many times we make vows in desperation or in expectation. Then you tell God just try to do this thing for me. Give me this job. I will not miss any. I'll give my first fruit. I give my tithe. I will be faithful. I will live right. I will do this and that. Did you keep your vows? We are talking about keeping our promises to God. And don't be so quiet if the word is cutting you. Let it cut you while you are shouting anywhere. So he says, if I can't put no confidence in what you say, you are no good. But you are just as good as your word is. And God is just as good as his word is. And I as a Christian believer, I believe that this Bible is inspired. You believe that? And it is written by the Holy Spirit and it is infallible word of God. And God is under obligation to his word. to the believer that will accept his word. God is under obligation to his word and any word is a seed if you accept it in your heart by faith and you believe it and confess it, God will bring it to pass. Amen. So whatever God has said and you accept it by faith in your heart and you believe it in your heart and you confess it on your mouth, God will bring it to pass because God keeps his word. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was. So the word is the word is God. Oh praise praise God. This means whatever God says that is him. Revelation 19:13. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of God. Amen. So what is the name of the lamb of [Music] God? Come on now. First John said, "In the beginning was the what? the word and the word was with and the word was and then here he says his name is called the word of God. So if you want to see God, believe the word. If you want to believe God, believe the word of God. The word of God is equals to God. That's why the Bible says his word is forever settled in It cannot fall to the ground. If God says you will be blessed, it cannot be changed. If God says tomorrow, you are going to be a millionaire. That nothing in the world can change. Even if it looks like it cannot be, God's word is always truth and his word always happen. Amen. Why? Because a word is a thought expressed. Before you think something, before you say something, what do you do? You think it is a thought before you say it. Okay. Now in the message making a way the prophet says now before it can be be a word it has to be a thought for a word is a thought expressed. God in his mind perceived these things and then they were in his mind. Then he spoke them. And they are as good as finished when God speak. Hallelujah because he is infallible and he can do nothing else. He only does what he thought and what he thought is what he speaks. You know when you look at parliament Some of you who love watching those parliament when they're debating the South African parliament is is really very funny. the South African Parliament. I saw several I've seen several clips and and you know these politicians and you know one comes up and says something and he says something and the speaker you know calls him to order or maybe someone else comes and complains oh no how can he call me that and then the speaker says oh my my friend withdraw the watch so wedraw and if he refuses to withdraw the words, he will be thrown out of the party. Listen to me. The man has to come on the podium and say, "Okay, speaker." Right honorable speaker, I withdraw. But you already said it. But because it was not good, you have to withdraw. But God cannot withdraw anything he say. Whatever he says he has already sought it. Sometimes you can speak words and it will damage it will cause damage to the people. Sometimes even we as preachers you know you don't expect preachers to be perfect. Yes. A preacher is a man of God the anointing everything is perfect. And that is true. When he's under the anointing, everything is fine. But sometimes, you know, as a human being, he may say something which did not come from the anointing and it may not be completely good. It may hurt you. You may feel bad. How can he say that? Especially you know we are going to have a lot of brothers preaching here and some of them are young in the ministry. You find that you know words like that can come through. What are you going to do? Are you going to walk away? You must understand this is a human being. He is not infallible but God is infallible. Praise the name of the Lord. Man is fallible but God is in. Are you are you are you hearing me? What I'm trying to say that we as human beings many times we will speak words and these words many times we will withdraw them because I shouldn't have said [Music] that how many have ever been you know including me I've been there and then he says something and I shouldn't have said that but there's already gone and hurt somebody, you will go to them and say, "Well, I never meant that." They will say, "But you say that so you can't unsay it." But you see, we we are men and many times that will happen. And that's okay because we are human beings. Are you following me? But God, his word is invalid. He thinks before he speaks and his thought is perfect. So if God has ever told you anything, don't worry. He will never change it. You can Amen. Put your life on. Oh hallelujah. Amen. You know we can study many books. We can read many books. Sometimes those books contain theories, someone with theory. You know, you read it and read it and then afterwards you get a bachelor's degree, you get a master's degree, you get a PhD, you know, oh, you are educated, but that simply means you're full of many [Music] theories. But those things are valid. That is why brethren, we must always put our life to something that is infallible. That does not mean you should not go to school. Go to school and learn the fible things so you can know how others think and then you can know how to live among. Are you following me? But your life when it oh my God when it comes to your soul you can never bless it on those things. Amen. You can only bless your soul on something that is eternal something that is perfect on something that is unchangeable on something that is permanent. And the word of God is permanent. The word of God is infallible. Whatever he say is perfect. Before he said it, it was perfect. After he said it, he cannot revive. He cannot have first edition. His word is only first edition. Without it, it settles it. And that's why I believe it. Whatever he says, he cannot change. That's why we are a wordbased church. We are not a man based church. We are not followers of men. We are not a cult. We are following God because his word is permanent. He says, "Yeah, let every man's word be alive. and my word be the truth. So then God is attitude follow me closely. If God saves saved sinners back there on the basis of accepting the burnt [Music] offering the sacrifice provided he has got to do the same thing today. or he did wrong when he took the first man by. If God healed a sick back there upon the basis of the shed blood of an animal, upon the basis of the atonement, God has to do the same thing today. Oh, he was wrong when he healed the first person. You can't change. We as human beings, we grow. We mature. We find better [Music] things. We talk better things. We wear better things. The other time I was I was back home and you know uh put up my pictures and And they were showing me my pictures. You know when I was like a how would I have dressed this for sure? Actually the court I was not dressing it. It was dressing me if you look at that picture. But what happened at that time I thought I was the best. I thought I was dressed better than everybody else. But I don't know how others looked at [Music] me. But you see, now I am better than I used to be. And I can tell you I am still changing. Hallelujah. My hairstyle is changing. That's why some some brothers, you know, they get all stuck on people's way they do the hair. The brother gets offended or brother. Sometimes you have to understand this is a young person growing. Allow them a chance to grow into the grace of Christ that they will understand. The things I used to do, I do them. Because even you are not the same way you used to be. Amen. There was a time I used to wear a big cross because I I did not know better. I used to see a bishop wearing a big cross is a crucifix. So when I came into the message, I found it difficult to leave it. I even read in the message where they asked brother, is it wrong to put a crucifix like in your car or something? He said, I don't see a problem. I said, you see, I can also wear a because brother said a crucifix is a sign of of the of of the crucification of Jesus. And so we remember Calvary. You get a point at the time as I can also wear the cross. I can wear the cross. And if you come to dick on me how worldly I am, I will explain it away with a [Music] quote. You find people who like you know dressing all the jewelry. putting this here, putting this here, necklace, this that let me tell you, you need to leave these people to grow. And I'm preaching what I'm I am understanding what I'm talking about. We do not believe in legalism. Do this, do that, do this. That has never saved anybody. What saves us is the grace of Jesus. Listen, that comes by the word. You know what? If that this person, this woman, this boy, this girl gets in contact with this world, this word will do the same thing in their life that he did in my life that he did in your life. Brethren, we ought to say, "Amen." You know, I can't wear that cross anymore. The things I used to do, I deserve no more. It is okay for you. It's all right by me. But my revelation is higher. I've grown higher in knowledge. I've grown higher in revelation. I've gone higher in understanding. And now the way I speak, the way I dress, the way I present myself is not the way I used to do it. There was a time, I used to wear a short. Yes. Yes. A short and when brothers would come to me say, "Believers, I'm not supposed to wear shirts." I pulled out a picture where the Bam was hunting in South Africa. And he had a short. So what are you talking about? And no brother here says shorts are women's underwear and under garments. A man that does that is a now I understand that I can't wear a short and go to a supermarket. My revelation is higher. My understanding is higher. I can't even wear a short and be in my house. I can only do that in the bedroom if I want. Imagine my children seeing me and all my hair. You're traumatizing your children. Let me tell you but if you it's okay by you as a brother of this belief of the word I can only know which level you are [Music] at I can understand brother don't worry I can understand there is some maturity you need to get to amen you're my other but I will tell you this I have outgrown that I have I I am higher in revelation are you hearing what I'm saying if you as a sister can now say you know as long as it does not go it goes below the [Music] knee and then you wear a dress which is just and then when you sit the skirt comes up. But when you stand it, we will know where you have reached in. Where you are in your Christian world, we will know you are a baby in Jesus Christ. You are not an [Music] unbeliever. You are a believer who is still very young. You still need to grow. But let me tell you, when you grow, no one will tell you those things are. You must receive a revelation. You throw them away. You begin putting on a real dress, a real scar because you have a real revelation. You know who you are. You are a woman, not a baby girl. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, we need to grow. So we see here then says we as human beings, we grow, we mature, we find better things, we talk of better things, we wear better clothing. We drive a better automo if I can get that I would drive it and people the brother has come. But when you grow, you're like, "That's for children. That's for young people. You don't want that. You you you want something more official, something which you you get the point?" So you see, we we will drive a better car. There are some of you, my mother was talking to me yesterday. She was saying, "I want to sell this car. I want to drive a better car now." I said, "What's wrong with this one? This one is very small. I'm ready to sacrifice and and I sacrifice more money and get a better whereby to her as I age 50 and above, she feels she has passed a certain thing. You get a point. This is all right because we are human beings. We are progressing. And and while I'm on that, let me put in the the last nail. We must allow people to progress naturally, spiritually, naturally. You see not you know what laws do, they force someone to be who they are not and they become hypocrite. That's why in our churches we are filled with many hypocrites. And this is different. Why I'm talking about is different. In the Pentecostals, they say it's okay. Here we are saying it is not okay. There is a way a believer must dress. A believer should not be that, should not be that, should not be that. We know. But we are saying we are not going to force anyone to be that you must mature and grow and progress into that revelation. So DVF we must be mature. Amen. where it says well a woman as long as she doesn't cut her hair she can keep it anyway as long as she has not carried and she shouldn't look like the world who has the measurement for what doesn't look like the world I will tell you what it is it is the level of your spiritual maturity [Music] Hey, if you brother, sister or rather your sister, if you go in the saloon and you make those kind of worldly hairstyles, if you shows me your level of immaturity, I will not judge you, but I will help you by praying with you and by preaching you some more. But adventure when you mature, you will reach a moment and say enough of these styles. I want to look more natural. I want to look like a a real good woman filled with the Holy Ghost, not just some kind of rec. You know they will have those hairstyles where you know part of their eyes closed in and you know when they come to talk to you with all the long nails and then you wonder why do you keep pushing the hair? Why don't you leave it there? is just some way of swag. [Music] Believers are supposed to be different. We are supposed to have a character of Christ. But if that's the level where you are sisters, don't make that young sister. Let her grow into it. I will tell you what you can do. Create an atmosphere for her to grow for her to progress the atmosphere. Love, love, love, love, love covers a mountain of sin. That's even why God loves us. When God loves us, he corrects us, but he loves. He doesn't weep us, but he loves us. Come on dear. Don't you think this is better? Don't you think this is better? And then you like, I want this. You say, "It's all right." And then you come back again. Why do you think about this? And then one day you like, I see him. I see him. I don't even say that's my beloved and is but one. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And then he says but God cannot progress in that way. We progress but God does not progress because he was perfect to begin with and perfection cannot progress anymore. Are you still progressing which means you're not perfect? None of us is perfect. We are progressing but God is not. That's why we do not need our perfection to make it. If it is by our perfection, all of us would go to hell because I will assure you we progress until we die. Even when a rapture come, we will still be progressing. But I'll tell you, brother, what is going to get us in is his perfection. Why? Because that never changes an inch. And when you receive it in your heart, you become perfection and then you begin hating these other things. So he was perfect to begin with. until perfection cannot progress anymore. It's already perfection. Amen. So you don't have to say God doesn't have to say well this is a different age. You've got a better thought now. If it is then he cannot be God. Regardless of the change of ages is the unchanging God. So if he is God but he spoke back there he has to stay with it now because he was perfect there but he's perfect now you see then he can't progress what I mean he can't end better things what we are preaching is not a new gospel. Listen, listen, listen. The message of the hour or the end time message of God is not a new gospel is not even a better gospel than what others are preaching. That is so then it is a force because what God had in the beginning you can't have something better. What he had in the beginning is what he would have today what he will have forever. It is the others that left that original gospel. Amen. What we are preaching we call the end time message the same old time gospel that Paul preached that Peter preached preached is the same one we are preaching the others departed that's why Malachi 4 is speaking about a restorer Elijah the prophet he will stand the hearts of the children back to the father. What we are preaching to you is not some new idea, some new revelation. It is a real old time gospel that has been restored back in our generation. Amen. The Catholics left it. The Anglicans left it. The goals left it. God in our generation has sent a prophet with a message, not a different one, but his message is a message of restoration to tell us go back to the Bible. Go back to what Paul, that's why Paul said, I have laid a foundation. Paul laid a foundation. And he said, "The foundation which I have laid is Christ. No man can lay another." And then he said, "Oh, but every man's work shall be tested with fire." And then he said if any man preach any other go there is not another but there are some who come men who captain unaware they come and try to pervert this gospel. But he said if any man even if it is earth even if it's an angel from heaven if he come and preach another gospel let him be cast which means The gospel which Paul preached and the apostles is the same one we are preaching today. But there are many who are cast because they left it. They left one god. They preached three gods. They left baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. They use father, son, holy ghost. They have no revelation. They have left the way it was done. But I thank God. There are groups of people all over the world. By the way, all over the world that have been restored, we are one of [Applause] those. Hallelujah. God's first thought was perfect. It is his thought that was expressed in his word. It cannot improve. It cannot progress. It is simply perfect. Amen. Tell your neighbor is simply perfect. Now we have been talking about the thought of God. Because you may wonder how does this connect with us keeping the [Music] promises? Why should we even keep the promises? We are in perfect human beings. Uhhuh. I want you to see the connection. Now after understanding who God then you have to understand who you are. Praise the name of the Lord. In the harvest, we are his attributes. So what was the thought of God expressed? The [Music] word not. So are you following me? Be actively involved. I'm happy to say you know his thought is his word. Right. What what is his word? Where is his word? Is his word something or somebody? Did someone get it? Is his word something or somebody? Is his word the words in this Bible? If it it only stops there, then you will fail to understand God. Then you will see God only as a piece of [Music] information. Are you following me? Please keep your thoughts together with me. God is not a piece of information. Oh my. Get ready for this. Let me read this portion for you. Who could tell how uh who could tell God how to make things? In the beginning when there was just he alone and if we had eternal life there is only one form of eternal life and that is God. God. So if we have eternal life, do we have eternal life? In the book of John, he says, I give them eternal life. So we have eternal life. Oh, I'm so excited by that. I have eternal life in me. And he says if we have eternal life, we were with God right then. Please don't don't lean on your table. You will not understand. sit on the edge of your seat because you will miss something. Listen, he says if we have eternal life now, now now we were with God right then. And then he says a part of God. So which means the logos has a part. We are a part of him. We came from Jesus said I came from God. I go back to God. Meaning he was God and he was man. He was a part of God. Don't be confused. What Jesus was, you are. Hallelujah. That's why he's our brother. He's the first born. I'm the second. Amen. I am a part of God. We are his attributes. We are now his attributes. Where is somebody give me? All right. Look here. Church, come brother. You you work in water. Come. Read. What is this? How do they call that one? Composition. Okay. What does composition mean? Interpret it means what? The things which are contained in the water. Red number one, sodium, sodium, potassium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron and chloride. So these are the compositions. God bless you that he has read. These are the things that make this world. Amen. Now these are attributes. You got it. Now it is it is a part of this attributes of this water. Okay. How many elements do we have in our [Music] body? Scientists rescue us here. Seven. Number one, there are 17. Uhhuh. Okay. Can we can we talk about some of them? Speak it out loud everybody if you water. Zinc zincion. We even have iron in our body. All right. That's amazing. Potassium. Potassium. Oxygen. Listen, those things, don't miss this. Don't miss. Listen, those things which make up our body is our body. Are you hearing now? There are attributes that make up our body. But those same attribute that make up our body also is the same thing which is in the soil. All those attributes that are in our body that make up our body are in the ground. That is why when they bury someone in the ground after so many years they will not find anything. Where will it go? It has gone back where it came from. Are you getting it? Now is the same thing like this attribute that make up the water is is the water attributes is equal to water. Now is saying here we are attributes of God. Amen. Amen. Amen. We come from God. We go back to God. He's not talking about the flesh. He's talking about the soul. Our soul is an attribute of God. That's where we came from. That's where we are going. You have that soul in you. You are a part of God. Logos has a part. Oh my my my my my. So we are his attributes and we are talking about our souls. Oh my my my knows that song prepare to sing it afterwards. You can kill my body but my soul. Amen. If you know that song, prepare to sing it. Wonderful song. And because in the beginning was the word and a word is a thought express. Uhhuh. We are now coming back to eat. A word is a thought of God. Express. So we are in his thought. Then we are expressed into word and we become what we are. Sit on the seat of your age on the edge of your seat rather. Listen carefully. Hear the word we were a thought. And then God said, "Let there be man in our image." And there was man in the image of which is God. He's not talking about the flesh. He's talking about what is on the inside. Now man in the image of God fell. He came in flesh. He fell from the glory of God. Not listen. Oh my. Listen. He fell from the glory of God, not from the image of God. [Music] Fallen man is still in the image of God but not in the glory of the image. That is why the message has to be preached. The word has to be preached. What is the purpose? Hunting for the lost attributes. We cannot know because serpent seed came in and there was a mixer. So we don't know whether everyone is an attribute but there's something that God has as a weapon to hand every attribute that was in God before the foundation of the world. Look at it this way. If God is a magnet, he has this big magnet which he will use to take everywhere. This magnet will only attract those pieces, those attributes that make up the magnet. Are you hearing me? Now, let me tell you, we are the thoughts of God. How did we come to be by the spoken word? But we have been lost and we have been from the glory of God down. So what God is doing, he sent his word again. He sent his word again. That's why I'm preaching right now. As I am preaching, whoever has a part of God in them, Whoever is an attribute of God, they will fill the pool. They feel they will hear the name. Why? Because whatever I'm talking about is what makes up your soul. You will feel the fire on the inside. Why? Because whatever you are hearing is connecting to what is in there. Let me tell you, brother, sister, you may be a drunkard. You may be in a bar. Amen. I don't care where you may be. You may be in a prostitute, prostitute house. You may be whatever it is, smoker. I don't care if you were an attribute of God. When a word comes, I told you, you will hear your name. You will hear your name and you will say that's why you are shouting. What is that? An attribute of God. Hallelujah. Amen. We are hearing our names. We are filling the pool. We are getting a connection. Amen. If you don't know what we talking about, stay alone for a while. Amen. Stay in church for a while. You will soon fill the pool. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why he sends his word. His word is coming to do well to call all the attributes of God. That's why we have to be born again. Not by our mother. born again by the spoken word. We have to have a word bath. Amen. A word. That's why when you go in this denomination, the word they have is mixed. So you go and get confused. That's why people just end up only dozing. Even if you're a seed and you go in those formal religious organization, you will not fool the pool. Why? The word is a mal. It's mixed. Have you ever taken wheat which is mixed with [Music] swallowing it is a problem. As you swallow, but when you take just wheat, it's just so soft. You feel nice. So many of you when you're buying wheat, you want to be sure about the supplier. Is it mixed what is original? That is why it matters where you attend church if you attend church where the word is preached and there is no pool change your church even if it is here because you may be serpent seed and you don't feel the pool but maybe When you go to Anglican, you will feel the pool when you go back. I'm enjoying this church. Or when you go among some of our friends, then they begin this. This is my church. This is my church. Then you feel the pool. But the bride, by the way, this is not about our church about it's about the world. So the bride is pulled by the what? Amen. Not by how many people in the church, not by how the good the preacher is dressed, but by the quality of the word. I'm sorry. The way I'm speaking is only reflecting my experience. Is only reflecting my experience because I've been in some of those denominations and I remember how I used to be. I remember they would bring a song, you want to begin singing. The best you can do is to tap your feet because you don't want to offend others. If you begin saying hallelujah, you will see. Thank God. He redeemed us and he restored us back again to the original where we can dance and have liberty of the spirit but where we cannot do the worldly dances where we we have found a balance. is the word that guides us, not a church manual. Okay, let's go back here. And because in the beginning was the word and a word is a thought expressed. So we were his thoughts that expressed into the word and become what we are. That's the reason our names may be not what we have now. That's the reason why our names maybe not the names we have now but our names our real names here is not talking about the name you're called by now he's talking about your identity. Hallelujah. Amen. Elijah. Elijah come here. Hallelujah. Stop there. Elijah. Did you see that? Is the power of calling a name. Amen. But the names he's talking about now is not Elijah. Uh-uh. He's is talking about some a name. I can call by reading the word, by preaching the word. And everyone whose names is there, they will respond. Amen. The names, our names were put on the lamb's book of life. Amen. Before the foundation of the world. And if it wasn't there, then it will never be there. I'm so glad my name is there. My name is on the book. Your name is on the book because you were there before the foundation. And Jesus come to redeem he came to redeem all those whose names on that book. He know them. Hallelujah. He didn't come to convince somebody. He didn't come to explain to somebody. Let me tell you, I don't believe what I believe because Amen. I received an explanation. I was not talking to this. Somehow somewhere I heard my name being called and I am here in response. When I say I am here, I'm not meaning this place. I am meaning the word. I am in the word. Why? I heard my name being called. We are the word made flesh today. Now remember, we are not the word. This is in questions and answers. Did we just say we are the word? And then the prophet of God says we are not the word. Put the quote there. We are not the word. Can we say amen? But we are the word. Can you also say amen? Pastor, I don't understand it. Who told you you have to? He said only believe. Brother, get a quote quickly. Jesus was not God. Can we say amen? Some people are like doubting. But he was God. Can you say amen? Many have got it now. He was a man yet he was God. He could cry and yet he could raise a dead. He could cry for a man being dead and raise him back again. He was Jehovah Gyra. He was Jehovah Rafa. He was Jehovah. He was Jehovah. All go with me. He was Jehovah and yet he was a man. He owned the earth and made the earth and had not a place to lay his head. That's what I'm talking about. Jesus was not God. That he was a man 100% human. But also Jesus was God. That he was God himself, the creator of heaven and earth. Listen to me. God is not flesh and blood. God is a spirit. And he the spirit which gives life was in Jesus. Amen. As a man, he cried when his friend died. But as God, he called Lazarus. As a man, he slept and he was tired. as God. He said, "Peace, be still." You have to understand Jesus was 100% man, 100% God. If you can't understand it, you can't understand yourself. Why? Because because there is a part in me that is the eternal God. There is a part in me that is the Jehovah, the creator of heaven and earth. The one that gives life that part in me is eternal. He says I give them eternal life. That part in me brother sister but also amen with me there is another body. this body which is a sinful body which is a tired body a weary body a very bad body it always gets in my way this body is also here so I am a man in this body with with a body but also I am God in this body an attribute of God in this body okay wait for the beautiful part Jesus as a when he died. Oh, praise God. God never died. The spirit which was in him left and then Jesus as a man was on the cross praying father why have you forsaken me? Because the father is God and he cannot die. Hallelujah. Yes sir. Listen listen. But on the third day on the third day that spirit came back again. Hallelujah. Amen. Came back again. And rose Jesus from the grave. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother, sister, it's the same thing with us. Amen. We who were dead in a when his spirit came by his word, we rose from the dead. And even when the Bible says that if that same spirit which was Jesus Christ on the day if it dwells in you if it dwells in you he will quicken your mortal body your human body he will quicken it and one day we are going to walk. people will see us but with a body which is like his. Amen. These are scriptures and we shall be like him immortal. We will be able to appear and disappear. Come on. You have to rejoice and hallelujah. Amen. It may be said we should reflect the attributes of our origin. Our life, our words, our way of life. This is the ultimate purpose of the word so that we might become the word. Now the Bible says when you vow unto God, do not fail to pay it. God has no pleasure in food. Because fools are not his attributes. His attributes are him. So if you are an attribute of God, you're going to have a mind like that of God. You're not a fool. A fool is serpent seed. Psalms 14. One, the fool has said in his heart, there is no God. They don't believe in the existence of God. The Bible says they are corrupt. They have done abominable works. There is none that doeth good. They don't believe. But a believer is not a fool. Hebrews 11:6. Without faith, it is impossible to please God. For he that cometh to God must believe. Everybody say must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek. A fool does not regard God as God. So you will come to God and say God give me this and I'll do this and then when God gives it to you like it's not you gave it to me. with my own strength because you don't believe in God. But the wise, they will honor and believe God is not a man. They will keep their promises. Shall we have some examples of the wise? Amen. Hannah, I don't have time to read the whole thing. I'll read what I can. She vowed to give a son to the Lord. to service unto the Lord. If God will give her a child, when someone was born, she took him to the temple and dedicated him to God as promised. Hannah was wise. I wish I had time to read everything, but it will take a long time. What you do? Go and read for chapter one, you know, you will see in her in the bitterness of her soul when she prayed to God and we vowed a vow and she said, "Lord of us, if you will indeed look on my affliction and your handmade and remember me and not forget your handmmaid, but will give unto thy handmade a child, then I will give him unto the Lord. all the days of his life there shall no raza come upon his head. And when the Bible says when she weed him, she took him up with her with three bulocks. She gave she gave more than she promised when you said, "God, do this for me. I'll take my time." And then you bring 10 person me. I've already paid my tithe. What are they collecting now? I already promised my part. Don't be rigid with God. She she she she she gave with three bulocks, one air of flour, and a bottle of wine. [Music] And she brought for them to have the Lord supper and brought him unto the house of the Lord in the child was young. And they slew a bulock and brought the child to Eddie. And she said, "Oh my Lord, as thy soul liveth, my Lord, I am the woman that stood by thee, praying unto the Lord, for this child I pray, and the Lord has given me my petition, which I asked of him." She remembered the Lord and she didn't say, "Now give me back my child." She left the child there. When you give an offering unto the Lord, you don't have to remember it is yours. Uh brethren, if you you would have given me time, I would have said things which should have helped us. I'm not going to preach for about five weeks. So would you stay with me for a few more moments? When you promise God and you give him something, it doesn't have to be money. Don't think in terms of money, it it might be your strength, your knowledge, your ingenuity, your gift, something that you you can give to the Lord, your children, whatever it is. and you've given it to the Lord. Don't come back and demand it. Is the Lord is the Lord is. Hallelujah. It's the Lord [Music] is. You might bring a piano. You might bring it's not yours anymore. As long as you made a vow, keep it. It is the Lord is I am broke now. Brother Shem the which I have told you I've changed my mind. Did you buy it? Did the church collect for it? Please give it to me. You become tough because you are now poor. Brethren, keep your promises that you make to God. God is not a man. God is looking for his attributes. One, a person, a man, a woman who will be like God. Keep your word. Jacob after his vision at Bethl, Jacob vowed that if God protected him, he would worship the Lord and give a tenth of oil. Years later, Jacob returns to build an God honors those who remember and fulfill their vow after even many years. [Music] And vowed a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me. Remember he was going back home and he was fearing his brother. But now if God will keep me in this way that I go and he will give me bread to eat and ramen to put on so that I can come to my father's house in peace. Then shall the Lord be my God. This one did not promise a child. This one did not promise a child like Hana. This one, Amen, promised to serve the Lord. Then the Lord shall be my God. And this stone which I have set for a Peter shall be God's house. And of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give a 10. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Pray. Praise the Lord. Let's see the fulfillment of the promise. And God said unto Jacob. Genesis 35, arise, go to Bessa. Ah, this is the angel of the Lord. Now, come back. Remind him of the promise. God does not forget your promises and make thee an altar unto God. The God that appeared unto thee when you you were fleeing from the face of E is thy brother. Then Jacob said unto his house, leave me alone. Now I am prospering. Now he's coming back to me. What is wrong with you? Leave me now. I have a good house. Now everybody wants to leave me alone. Am I your parent? Go back to your home. Listen brother, forget your promise to God, when you didn't have when you were poor when you were young, when you were in bless me. Now it is time to pay back. Then Jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him, "Put away the strange gods that are among you." They had even started worshiping other gods. Brother Shalom, they had started worshiping other God. He forgot his promise. But when the angel of Lord came say, "Please remember your promise." He said, "Please my people, put away your strange God. Be clean and change your garment." You see, brother, when God comes down, you will know you need to change your clothes. Hey, you need to change your clothes. You need to put away a strange goat. Do you know what else you need to do? Listen. And let us arise, go up to Bethl, and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand. Are you hearing me, church? Can I hear amen from sisters? and all their hearings which were in their ears. I did not know it was a strange god. Hallelujah. My sisters. That's why we don't wear them. And they gave unto Jacob the earrings which were in the ears. And Jacob hid them and the oak which was by the And they journeyed and the terror of of of God was upon the cities that were around about them and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob, brethren, can I prophesy to you? If you give away all the strange gods, God will bring the fear of the Lord, the terror of the Lord, upon your enemy that are around about you and they will not be able to attack you. Amen. Give up your strange God. So Jacob came to lose which is in the land of Canaan and Bethl. And he and all the people that were with him and he built there an altar and called a place El Bethl. Because there God appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his father. Jacob kept his promise. Can I give you another one in the book of Judges 11? It speaks about he vowed to offer something as a burnt offering whatever came to him first when he arrives home. If he wins in battle, brethren, are you in a battle? Any battle in your life. God can fight your battle. He will give you strength to go through your battle. He will not give up. I am not speaking idle words. Those are prophetic words. I said you will not give up. You will overcome. Amen. Amen. If you trust in the Lord with all your but remember you vow to God, he will keep his word. Oh God, do something for me to overcome my enemies. If you do, I will do this for you. By the way, those kind of prayers are answered right now. If you're praying for something and is not working, pray like that. Sorry those who are streaming, this portion is for my church. Pray like that. Something you're praying it's not working. Make a promise to God. I don't want others to hear. Make a promise to God. Tell God, do this thing for me. Here is what I want to do. Some of you, you make small promises. You want big things. You are not having good hearts. God give me land and house of my own. I'll give church, land fund 500,000 sheep. He has given you a house and land. If you want big things from God, you should be ready to surrender everything you want and everything you have. When we talk about making promises, remember this is not only physical things. I'm giving a few examples for you to see. Some people were promising physical things. Others were promising spiritual things. But nonetheless, God answered and they were supposed to keep their vow because remember you a son of God an attribute of God. Amen. So Jeff went because of time I will not read that portion but you know when he prayed you know the first when he reached home after winning the battle the first thing that came before him was his beautiful daughter and he cried my [Music] I want you to see. And just came to Misipe into the house, his house. And all his daughter came to meet him with a timbros and with dancing. Oh daddy, you are back. Oh daddy, you have defeated your enemy. And she was his only child. beside her. He had neither son nor daughter. And it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his glory. And he said, "Alas, my daughter, thou has brought me very low, and you are one of them that trouble me. For I have opened my mouth unto the Lord. and I cannot go back. Do you see that kind of heart? He didn't say God. Surely you understand, brother. When you open your mouth to pray and you promise God anything, fulfill it regardless of what it takes. And this teaches us don't promise what you know in the integrity of your heart you cannot do. [Music] He promised anything the first thing and God said that's what you have said. All right. He made him overcome and now his child comes. God did not require this child. There is no scripture which says God has ever required human sacrifice. This was a man for when he sacrificed his daughter. He was a man fulfilling his vow to God, not God requiring human sacrifice. Are you hearing me? So be sure when you promise, promise what you are able to do. Praise the name of the Lord. Oh, this reminds me. Shem was saying, "Oh, when I was going to die and then I promised God things you told us, brother." I don't remember all the all your promises, but that's a good one for you [Music] today. David, David vowed not to rest until he found a dwelling place for the Lord. Though David wasn't allowed to build a temple, he gathered materials and he made plans and his son Solomon completed that. But you will see that David fulfilled his promise. He didn't say you have rejected me. He kept on doing what he wanted. He never rested until the Lord had a house. Paul made another vow which included shaving his head and abstaining from certain things. Paul fulfilled his vows. I wish I had time to go into the details but because of time I'm not rushing. Now I rushed because I wanted to read a story for you. Brother Brana this story is amazing. So brother Bham also made a vow. So this is not only old testament thing, it is even new testament. Can we read the story in the message testimony 1963? He says I made a vow to go a few years ago going out with a full gospel businessman. I said I wouldn't shoot game for somebody else. Game the white people. I think mostly the white people. They have what we call game. Here in Africa, you know, we know hunting. You know, when we go hunting, we are hunting what we are going to eat. We we hunt for meat. But in the west many call it game because it's like a game because they go hunting, shooting, they'll take an animal and kill it and remove the head and put it in the house and many of them won't even use the meat. So really it's like murder if you want to call it that way. So brother Bam was a very good handler. And brother Bham, you know, was doing also like uh he he is now saying he made a promise, a vow that he will not shoot again for Yes. for somebody else or is he shooting or he's killing an animal for someone else? No. Unless it is an emergency. He said, I will not do it. He made that vow. So he says and and and he was with some brothers. They went hunting in the island. They were somewhere about I think three or four. Well, I'll just read them for you. And it's brother Jack Palmer is here. Brother Jack, he was from Georgia. He usually come up here. He was standing here and the night before he said, "Brother Bam, get me a deer." You know, brother Bam was a very good hunter and my just shook because I I had vowed I wouldn't do that four or five years ago because that year I killed 19 head of elk alone just for them businessmen who sit around and talk their business. and I would have to go out and kill their game. And that just didn't seem like it put me in a murder case. But I wouldn't do it. I would take them to where it's at, but I wouldn't shoot it. So I promised God I wouldn't do it. So then I had got I left the place going back starting uh started back down the hill and and the voice spoke to me. Why not walk with me? So as he's in the woods and that voice of God speaks to me, why not walk with me? Okay, I'm going to speak a little bit. I skip and find meat, two full grown phones and a big boy came and something said to me, "There is a deer for brother Evans, one for brother and one for the other Methodist. There is exactly what the Lord has given to you for now. Killed them for them. They can't get away those animals. There is no way for them to. I had a rifle hanging down on my shoulder right there. Praise the name of the Lord. And before they could even go turned around, I would have killed I would have killed three of them. Before they could even move, they was right in my hand. And I thought, "Ah, there they are. Just the three. easy to roll them right down the hill and to them right on on out. And I thought that will be very easy. There is the three then we could go home from there. Take out and get out of the mountains. And as I looked at them there, they were standing looking at me just as quietly about 15 yards. I just stood still and they watched me. I thought, well, there it is. The only thing is just throw your rifle over and they are gone. And then I remembered I promised God. I wouldn't do it. And I remember that I thought no, I can't do it. That isn't right. I promised God that I wouldn't do it. And he says that when you make a promise, you stay with it. God expects you to I thought well just perfect in my hands but yet I promised him I wouldn't do it. I said I said go on mother take your babies and go into the woods. Enjoy yourself. I love this roast. He couldn't kill them. And they come a little closer. Oh, how unusual that is for that dear. And they would look at me and turn their head and me standing there. dressed in red with a rifle standing in my hand and they walked real close. I could feed them out of my arm and they just nosed around there a few moments, turned around, walked on a back a little piece. They stopped come back again. Something kept saying, "They are right in your hand. They are right in your hand. The Lord has put them in your hand. I said, but I promise. I promise that I wouldn't do it. Since then, I thought one time David was led right into the very side where Job was laying. Well, rather King Saul was laying. And Job said to him, said, "The Lord, I'll deliver him into your hand." But he said, "God forbid that I would touch his anointing." And he says, "The prophet, you must wash when you make a promise." And then I said, "I promised God that I wouldn't do it, so I won't." Even as small as a small thing as a dear. Yes. Whatever you promise to God, however small, however, a man is as good as his word. Let me now try to bring this to a close. A man is just as good as his word, musicians can go. You are just as good as your word. I am just as good as my word. If I can't take your word, I want no dealings with you. I want you to be the same to me and you must be the same to God. If you can't keep his word, then I want to know who is God that can keep his word. Brethren, where are the musicians? Please come. Let me say this. Many times as believers, we speak idle words, things we don't mean and we say it now. And remember you are a Christian. Look at me here. Remember you were a believer. And when you give your word, someone should be able to cash it in. Are you hearing me? Those in the back, are you hearing me? Your word must be good enough. Don't give your word if you can't keep it. Your word must be good as yourself. If you give your word and you don't keep it, you are as good as your word. Imagine if God would give us his word and then here prophecy comes. Sorry my children, I made a mistake but next time I'll do better. Who will trust God again? When God gives his word, he keeps it because as good as his word, all his promises We must also who are in the image of God, attributes of God, be able to keep every promise we make to God and to one another. God's word will never fail. It fails then God can fail. Cuz no man is any better than his word. Tell your neighbor you are not better than your [Music] wife. Hey you sisters and brothers who are very good at saying borrow me. I will pay you next week. Are you here today? If you are here, can you say amen? Let me talk to you. Borrow me. I'll pay you next week. When? Next week. On on Friday. Friday morning around there. First of all, you know, on Friday next week, you don't have any expectation to pay. That's a lie. You are lying right there before that brother and that shows who you are. And I want to ask you, are you a fool or you are a child of God or you are an attribute of God? But if you can't pay on Friday, call up the brother. Tell him, "I'm sorry. It looks like I won't be able to pay on. Can we push it ahead? Don't wait for him to call you. But some of you brethren, a brother will call you and call you and call you until you begin even abusing him. What's wrong with this one? And they will call you and you refuse to pick. You refuse to pick up when you borrow the money. I believe of the message. Shame on you, brother, sister. and you wound somebody, you hurt somebody, they will call you, refuse to pick up, then you come to church on Sunday and when it comes time to greeting, if the deacon puts you close to that, can you change me? And then after service, no one will even see. You will take off like a hair because you know you have debts. You should repent today. If any of you have anyone's debt and you refuse to pay, go back and apologize to them. Amen. And I can tell you if you don't have the money to pay, you can promise God also God provide this money. I will do this for you. But with God fulfill he will give you the money. I remember let me tell you this testimony as I'm finishing the pis can play slowly. One time I went to China and I I ministered a few places. I really had a heart to help people. all the funds I was given. I bought a church projector in Mana which actually still even I bought clothes for children and everything. I spent all the money that I was given by friends and brothers love offerings spent all the money. So I came back home with a bag of clothes and so we distributed everything. After that we began suffering seriously seriously. I've told this story to some of you financially suffering seriously. My wife called me. I said, "Dear, there's something wrong. Marry a spiritual woman by the way." And sister, be spiritual to [Music] your dear. The money you bought this thing. Where did you get it? I explain. Did you tithe it before [Music] you? Honestly, it had skipped my mind. I told her I did not right there. We knew why we are suffering. We took hands together without wasting time. God told me, "What should we do?" I said, "For sure." Okay, I don't know. And while I was there, the Holy Ghost came to me and told me pray. So I held my hands. I said, "Let us pray." I repented to God. I repented bitterly. God, I'm sorry. I did not pay tithe out of this. It was not intentional. It is in my heart to do it. But Lord, I don't know how I didn't even have any job at the time. I don't know how. I don't know where. But provide supernatural more fun. And then what I will do, I promise I will take the a portion out of it and pay the tithe I did not pay. Plus, I will pay also tithe of that one. And I promise from today, I'll never default. I will always pay my tithe. [Music] Brethren, we said amen. In a few days, I think about three days, a brother, I don't know who it was at the moment. I was even going to another mission. Just saw on my messages. He sent me a love offering. He said, "Brother B, you the Holy Spirit has instructed me." Those were the specific words. My wife, I'm sure you remember them. has instructed me to send this funds to you. I nearly broke down when I looked at this money. It could pay all the other time pay this time and remain with someone. But the more I was going to remain with was the smallest portion and I had other problems. Immediately the devil told me of course God knows the situation you in paid this life and this will pay in the future. I told him devil get behind. That day the pastor saw me coming with a big envelope. Say pastor this is my tithe your tithe you know when your pastor asks you that he's wondering do you earn this much sometimes we ask cuz we don't want to take tithe from bad you get money in a in dubious means brother Elijah paying 2 million You understand? But I explained pray for me. You don't know how I felt. Ever since then, I've never I've I've kept my vow. Brethren, God is God. God is not a man. We should keep our promises. [Music] Praise [Music] God. There are many more things I might say, but allow me to stop here. I trust that you got something to bless. Amen. Shall we stand? [Music] Where's the song leader? Come, come help me. [Music] Now see [Music] is [Music] [Music] something good. [Music] Oh, I could see. I could see the come. Oh god. [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] Oh my [Music] god. Come on.

Just speak to him for just a moment. If you have something to put right with him, just put it right. He'll give you another chance. He's a God of the first chance, second chance, third chance, fourth chance. He's a marvelous God. He does not forsake his loved ones. He'll not forsake you. He'll remember you. If you can remember to come back before him and tell him how you feel and tell him what you want him to do for you. He's a God who remembers. He's a God who hears. He's a God who understands. He will hear you. He'll give you grace. Amen. He will answer your prayer. Oh, hallelujah. Thank you, loving Jesus. We worship you, Lord.
