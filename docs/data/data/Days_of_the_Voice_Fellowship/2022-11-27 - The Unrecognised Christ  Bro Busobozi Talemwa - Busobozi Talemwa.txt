I'd like to appreciate mother Martin for making the time despite the challenge of the rain this morning appreciate Brother Martin here we appreciate you Brother Martin and your family you are blessing to the body of Christ amen Amina we are taking uh John chapter 1 verse one is in this service today I'd like you to really um put on like brother Barnum would say your spiritual thinking okay um in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God now I would like all of us to read verse 14 together let us start and the Word was made manifest and let us read it again and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so the word was made flesh is so in the beginning was God the word was so what is the word God is the one and verse 14 says and the word was made flesh so remember what is the word now I want you to to to to to read it that way and God katonda was made flesh so in other words Jesus yes was not some other man that came out of nowhere it was the word which was in the beginning with God and now was made flesh God bless so I'm going to speak to you on the subject of the unrecognized Christ on Wednesday brother brother Andrew spoke on recognizing your promises and so the word recognizing is coming again to us today when Jesus was before the birth of Jesus the Jews knew the prophecies about his birth the Jews believed in the Messiah the Jews believe the Messiah would be born and when the Messiah would come he would have several characteristics so they believed in the messiah's coming the prophecy one of the prophets and that is Isaiah in the book of Isaiah chapter 61 and you can turn it there today we are going to read quite a lot of scriptures so if you have your pain and and Bible you can knock those things down and and then go back to eat after retrogenes in verse 1 of 61 of Isaiah the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has set me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that abound tomorrow [Music] is now this prophecy was given by prophet Isaiah before the New Testament that the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the Good Tidings unto the mix and this prophecy was speaking on the coming of Jesus who would have the spirit of God upon him sorry I would actually bind the uh we would actually bring Good Tidings to the make and ramacion he would bind the Brokenhearted Proclaim anybody to the captives this was the ministry of the Messiah if you understand that say Amen now in Isaiah is I want you to look at that prophecy again praise the name of the Lord For unto us a child is born and to us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the vasting Father the Prince of Peace now this prophecy was also given by Isaiah speaking on the coming of the Messiah are you following me you really have to say Amen in this service because if you don't you will does I can assure you know because you need to really put on your spiritual thinking okay this was the Messiah that was for to come on he says his name would be called wonderful the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace praise the name of the Lord now I want you to follow this the Jews had this scripts the Jews believe in the description because the Messiah was supposed to be nothing less than God because you know as I will show you in the Bible in the Book of John Jesus told them the Jews that he was a Son of God yes and they wanted to stun him immediately do you know the reason they gave him um he told them he was a Son of God but they claimed he said he was God because they knew to be a Son of God you had to be God himself are you following me this morning they read this scripture in their temples synagogues for years and years and on the day when Jesus was born all the priests they did not understand that the Messiah was born as a matter of fact only a few understood was one of them was one of them you know and we also find that the the Shepherds you know these were people who were despised the lowest of the people they are the ones who understood and recognize the birth of you see that this do you think they will recognize Christ today the religious men are acceptable not the Bishops back upon the mighty powerful the theologians you don't recognize Christ that way Christ reveals himself to Baby such as so you can be able to recognize Christ now we need to understand that the Word was God to take it into it so God was made flesh this is the most powerful Revelation in the Bible hallelujah amen even Jesus himself he said he's going to build his church on the revelation of Christ because Jesus one day asked his disciple foreign [Music] [Music] foreign and the word was foreign [Music] [Music] God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth is the name of the Lord God is the spirit moyo is like water Purina what is this chichino Mercy how many water amazing one water okay we will find out okay how many disagree it's all right it's okay to disagree do you see this is what is happening the religious world that confusion it is how many water is this if this is how many water is this what's this do you see the confusion the other one will even come one word will come and with red face yes and he will say no don't you have knowledge in your head don't take it yeah it is not one like your finger is that right it is more than one but not foreign but it is the same water where that water is [Music] and that is how the spirit is the Bible says God is a spirit you cannot count the spirit yes but how many is it same experience Hallelujah if that same spirit that raise Christ from the day [Music] [Music] it's not a different spirit it's the same same Spirit one day he came in a pillows one day he came and he says but he is believe in him do you understand that so God is a spirit he is uncountable when do now where do they get that idea that God is if God is a spirit so if if you are saying they are free are you saying we have three Spirits can you count spirits and then another one says no manager they are not free they're ready divided in three parts so is one divided in three parts one spot is so what about God the father in which form is confusion it's the same God who manifested himself in three different forms the Greek word is God changing his form God manifesting himself and you can never count him praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah now foreign foreign [Music] [Music] is a is the spirit but each of them is not the other one Buddhism each of them is that is the idea of God and that's called The Holy Trinity I will show you today from the Bible that is it is up and then there is another Doctrine which says oh you know Jesus is the father he just is the son Jesus is the holy spirit yes yes but if you've got to believe in that neighborhood then you have questions to answer which you can never answer or definitely moves why was Jesus praying in the on the mountains he was praying to who he is so there is something that you need to understand so the Oneness teaching is wrong and that's why they go ahead to baptize in the name of Jesus they actually they call them Jesus only people yes and I find that many Believers of this message actually don't understand that is our Prophet is telling us here but the trinitarians mixed it up and the Oneness people also mixed it up I said God is not one like your finger is one cartoon those two groups got it mixed up I've always had to never get married you can't make it either way brother make sure you put for me these quotes here this is a very sensitive subject now he says he was gone the manifested in a flesh of his creative foreign [Music] that is the same spirit who created everything foreign foreign these are all very wonderful nuggets but okay let's continue but every man in his own order verse 23 Christ the first fruits afterward they that are Christ is at his coming then cometh the end when shall when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put down all Rule and all authority and power for he Jesus must Reign till so there is an end to his reigning till he has put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he has put all things under his feet but when he shall have all things uh when he shall when he says all things are put under him it is Manifest that he is expected which did put all things under him that is in Christ Jesus and when all things shall be subdued unto him the then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all right [Music] [Music] um [Music] God is on do you know foreign if they're going to be banned forever eternity it means they are also going to have eternal life like us who are going to be in heaven foreign [Music] will there be a place for hell what did I wait for today there will be no place it will be a new beginning God with his people hallelujah Amina praise the name of the Lord oh my these are Mysteries we can go deep into them but now today we're dealing with a godhead please and I understand that you're developing a lot of questions foreign people now I mean and I have the Catholic people here the the book called The Facts of our faith and they use the word of Eternal sonship of God backwards they say omana foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he has now come back in the form of the Holy Spirit who is that that's the Son of God that's why the name of Jesus must still be used without the name of Jesus [Music] Hallelujah foreign [Music] it divided himself and he went in different places but in Christ he was there yeah you were in his foreign [Music] praise the name of the Lord the Bible says that you was the fullness of godhead body does it mean heaven was empty God was still in heaven but God was in Jesus Christ in his fullness let me ask you a question to you who I hear can't understand that was Jesus God in the pit of fire foreign [Music] okay so he's got the pill of Fire what about the crowd was it God yeah now you're thinking that's very nice this is the truth now God katonda is a spirit he's not anything visible but the spirit manifests himself invisible thing moving the visible things can pass away big wow but that God invisible remains and he continues manifest himself now God the spirit came down in the field of fire came down in a body yeah [Music] [Music] can you have a name before you were born foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it was in the form of what we we are now which is a body that doesn't have a spirit in it it's a body that's waiting for you Christians style as soon as the life leaves this you go into that body each of us is waiting for us the moment we step out of this we step into that point let me tell you one of these days that's why we say this world is not our home foreign oh hallelujah hallelujah I don't know how many he have ever felt homesick you have never felt homesick you know homesick is like a sickness wherever you just want homes he said I'm gone to prepare our place for you a mansion for everyone it's not a mansion like this one it is Jesus yes hallelujah amen everyone who was born in sin oh yes they bypass their body but Jesus was not born [Music] the Bible says he was born all right he came in that very body yes praise the name that's why you say it remember your guy on the way I am the truth who was Jesus he was the man of life the Bible says [Music] but the second Adam Jesus Adam Adam he came hallelujah amen oh my word revelation is somebody that doesn't have a spirit Christians Hallelujah foreign foreign [Music] Chicago [Music] um hallelujah amen he was in that formed he was forming himself towards flesh before he came into this flesh he did not by passive fear foreign let us read this let's in the message for the paganian church age John 1 1 where it says in the beginning was the word the root from which we get our translation for word is logos which means the thought or concepts it has the double meaning of fault and speech [Music] is a word a thought expressed isn't that wonderful and beautiful John says the concept of God was expressed in Jesus yes how many have got that the concept ually the attribute of God himself his concept his idea everyone his himself was expressed in Jesus yes yeah now Jesus was the express image of the invisible God yes and the Bible says God at any time you know what next I mean has declared him hallelujah amen no man has ever seen God invisible God but Jesus he expressed image of God yes he did not only see Jesus on one day the disciples this is too much and Jesus you never knew that I'm the express image of God I want money until Rich Furniture you don't know come on in the world and I concluded he said if you've seen me you've seen the father I mean Hallelujah amen if you've seen me Philip I love you you've seen the father let me tell you it does not end there they should come out that God had never ends there now we can deflate the express image French fun and yeah she already said one of the invisible Jesus Christ we can tell the people if you've seen me you have seen Christo amen hallelujah amen they don't recognize that's why they can't understand why you dress the way up why you do what you do not understand why you believe what you mean you are the unrecognized Christ like they didn't understand they can't understand we find so many people who can't understand why we are so happy foreign if they can't understand Jesus they can't understand you and if they fail to understand who Jesus was they can't even baptize in the correct way because if you fail to understand who Jesus was you failed to understand the importance of the name of Jesus but it is the name of Jesus connects us to the logos the words that speak to you they are spirits how can they understand when they have not received the revelations foreign immediately come I knew what I was feeling better I was numb it wasn't about the water that's the only Paving the way for me to pronounce the name of Jesus Christ and God is in every place it's going to symbolize death and body and resurrection and when you're baptized you're going to give me a few more minutes foreign foreign are you like me this morning it doesn't matter whether you have any haters let me tell you you have an inheritance in heaven the Bible says we are of God little children that's what the Bible says we are not of our fathers we are of God foreign God in we're reading Hebrews one one God who was Sunday times and in diverse manner speak in times past unto the fathers by the prophets as in this last days spoken unto us by his son logos whom he has appointed here of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his coming and the express image of his pastor and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself pledged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high you know yeah you'll get it enough questions [Music] foreign [Music] and the prophet says in Brackets so God has decided to speak to us through the world that is why today from the New Testament after the death of Jesus we try we do not listen to anybody else will come mighty man of God must be measured by the Son of God by the logos God today is speaking to us by the logos by the word himself by the express image of his person God became expressed in the person of Jesus Christ was the express image of God yes yes again in John 1 14 and the Word was made flesh and daughter Among Us are you hearing me the very substance the very substance you have composition here there is a lot of composition I see so yeah this is all the composition of God praise the name of the Lord God expressed it in the passion of Jesus [Music] Christ a very substance of God was made flesh so Jesus was this bottle without the bottle you don't have the water he contained him there Katie you cannot say s 500 meals and this is the only water that there is and this is only water and this is water alone Mexico and there is no more water even I've covered it is God Catherine was in Christ reconciling the world to him there was more God why do you want um no that's wrong there was more God is you understand there was no another God the world is foreign he was a hundred percent good yes [Music] God was made flesh the great spirit of God unto which no man could approach which no man had seen or could behold he was now tabernacled in the flesh expressing the fullness of God to men no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father who he has declared God who on occasions would manifest his presence by the cloud or by the pill of fire is hard characteristics [Music] foreign foreign amen hallelujah oh my Harmony feel good because of that he revealed God to us such perfect clarity that Johnny could say about him in first John 1 1 3 to 3. that which was from the beginning which we have seen with our eyes unto you that which we have seen on Earth that he may also have fellowship and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ when God was pre-revealed he was manifested in the flesh yeah [Music] Let Us Now quickly go through a few verses here you know Christ means the anointed one Jesus through our body of Flesh was also Christ yes you know he was anointed one it was the anointed one yeah yes and in Luke chapter 2 verse 8. and there we are in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over there they are flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were so afraid and the angels said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy we shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] amen the Angels declared and they say the one who is born yeah wait what the Bible says is Christ the Lord [Music] Christ praise to the Lord the Lord mukama not the Christ Our Lord secrets to um he was the Lord how many lords do we have to remember one Lord this will shock you the Muslims understand God together more than the Christian denomination foreign but we thank God for this message that we have now a full understanding Which is higher than all this denominations [Music] but he can choose to manifest himself in many forms when the Angels Came To The Shepherd Jesus was being born yesterday we told them this is Christ the lord being born this is the Lord he's being born today in the city of Davis when you read the Old Testament he keeps on saying I'm the only savior in the Old Testament in the city today Hallelujah I mean I want to be a Shepherd I want to be like Crystal when Jesus was being baptized yes in Mark 1 9. and it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth and was baptized in in John of John in Jordan and straight away coming up out of the water he saw the heavens opened and the spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from Heaven saying thou at my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased yes [Music] listen interpret this when the woman is opened up at the moment Jesus was baptized yes heavens I imagine there must have been like an answer because all happened recognized there was something happened and her voice came out there wasn't anybody Thou Art my beloved Son we don't know what son means an Express image of God thou are my Express amen is no God himself declared it the angels second Corinthians 5 19. that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself who is speaking here God right so he's saying he's going to send John the message and the Lord oh my goodness and the Lord whom you the Jews are seeking women shall suddenly come to his Temple amen hallelujah the Lord you have been looking for coming to Jerusalem every day who made Moses we need to find out which Temple it was that was a change that the world has never experienced it was it that Isaiah prophesied about what did he say unto us a refract child is born Hallelujah a prince of peace when Jesus came himself he said destroy this temple in one day I will raise it up in three days and they wanted to Stone him because they thought how can you build build a 10.3 days that we have taken 46 years and the Bible says they did not even understand that he was speaking about his own yeah [Music] and Jesus was working yes he told them if you don't believe you will actually Amazon died if you don't believe that I am here before Abraham was I am and one of them said at first they had said you have a demon in you Muslim because the words
