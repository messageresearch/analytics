and as uh brother Timothy BR ministered uh you know something you know was made real in my heart like I should say the speak spoke to me that he along with Brother David would be the speakers for the 2024 and so I I did not hesitate I just told I talked with brother brother Glover and I told him brother Glover I'm sorry but I would like I would like you to allow me have brother Timothy and Brother David and brother Glover graciously accepted but we went out of touch for a while and so I did not cuz I told him we will have you speak on our next come and so but you know things happen so fast and as you saw we announced speakers and he was um you know I invited Brother Joseph [Music] chosi and by the Wayne um we have a few clips from them you will listen to them tomorrow morning I'm not too sure whether my media team is ready with them now so we will have you listen to them in the morning tomorrow so um then I was surprised but the Wayne told me I'm coming with a brother when I come to visit in Africa so it was much later that he told me this brother would be brother Andrew Glover and I I talked to my wife I said I do not know what God is trying to do you see I did not talk about brother Glover I even told by Wayne that I had invited by Glover so I want to say this was not my invitation it was not by the Wayne's invitation like a precious Pastor Sean preached in the morning in the afternoon it is God his invitation and um um I I will speak about brother Dwayne later but when he could not be able to come many things happened and brother Glover also was not able to come um maybe he will feel to talk about it I don't know he had a few health issues and he was not able to come so he told me I am not able to come but I want to say he was not able to come I did not invite him but God made him able to come because God wanted him here today and so why did I say these few words is to make you understand this is beyond me it is beyond us as human beings when God has a plan he will accomplish it no matter what and so you that has come here in this meetings under expectation I want you to believe that God has a table spray and I've listened to a few sermons you preached brother GL an imense blessing you know I was mentored by the by brother Eddie biscow in the ministry and I used to watch a lot of their youth camps and that's where I saw you preach for the first time

amen then we're going to go to Philippians 3 in 2 Corinthians 4 amen I want to say God bless you tonight anden for those of you that don't know me my name is brother Andrew Glover I come from uh I was born raised in Tennessee Tennessee and we've been in Arkansas now for a few months helping a church there and working out of brother Matt Morris's assembly in Black Rock Arkansas amen so tonight we want to bring you greetings from the church there amen amen St Luke 16 in verse number 16 amen I don't have any doctrines to promote I'm just here to promote the messag amen the Bible says the law and the prophets were un John and since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it I love what Jesus says here there is a preaching of the Kingdom but there's also a pressing into to what's being preached now in Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13 amen I want to uh just share a few things with you tonight that's on our heart and been studying and burning on our heart lately Philippians 3 and13 phili Paul here writing he says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before you said verse verse number 13 verse 13 [Music] okay I love what Paul says here there are some things behind us but they're not worthy to go back to as a matter of fact they are to be forgotten and reach forth into the things that are in front of you now watch what Paul says I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number 13 I believe there we will find how a Believer presses Paul Paul again here in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number 13 we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak so a Believer presses by believing what has been spoken in The Same Spirit of faith that it was spoken in in verse number 18 Paul says says this while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal we ask Lord to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may be seated I want to speak to you tonight on this thought pressing by faith into the realities of the Unseen pressing by faith into the realities of the Unseen in 1960 in 1960 brother B preaches a very powerful sermon he calls it the unfailing realities of the Living God in that sermon he is speaking of people receiving the Holy Ghost he says oh how many has received the Holy Ghost Among Us he said now may it revive us to a spot that we'll go to searching and hungering and pulling for the realities of God he said God is a reality now how many believes tonight that God is a reality amen he's not just a figment of our imagination but God is a reality now we know that God is not three persons but there is one Lord manifested in three different offices brother B will say now the Holy Spirit Will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another it'll make each person come into its character see because it's a spirit that lead you it brings and makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subject to its nature he said now the holy spirit makes you live and love to do it how you love to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes [Music] in all how it cleanses you and washes you and puts a desire in you to follow him and a thirst and a Hunger for More of it see you are just bathing yourself he br brings realities another place brother said what we need today is men and women who wants a reality me not a Creed but a reality he said that's what the world needs today is not Creeds and Fashions we need realities in God see the world don't want it the world does not want it the church will not accept it but he is the god of realities now when you think about this pressing the word press means to move or to cause to move into a position of contact with someone or something by exerting a continuous [Music] Force when we speak of this word reality it is the thing that exist in fact having previously only existed in one's mind it is a a reality is something that was in one's mind at one time but is now a fact see now we know that the most powerful force on Earth is God right brother said there's no more powerful force than God and he says one of the doctors told me the other day that the greatest power in the world is not the atomic bomb but it is a Believer who is in contact with his maker see a Believer gets in contact with his maker it will change his attitude it changes his mental it changes his habit it changes his body it changes his nature it changes everything now when a Believer comes in contact with god he has the ability to change that individual let me say science does not have the ability Amen to change an individual into what God desires from you as a Believer brother random in 1949 in in 1949 brother speaking on the subject of Science and he begins to told that there is a natural man and there is a spiritual man he says now the natural man has went into the research from the fall of the natural and what he has done me the natural man has gone into from the fall has gone into research of what he has done and what he has done and how little the spiritual man has progressed in the kingdom of God the natural man is progressing in the Earth by science the spiritual man is to progress in the kingdom of God he said now the natural man has gone out by science he has he has split open an adom he has split open in Adam uhuh he has broken Adam in two and by breaking that in two he has actually moved into more sin and ungodliness he has moved into more sin and ungodliness amen is everybody okay okay he said my friends let's Let the church move up forward let's Let the church move up forward amen you love the Lord amen he said see let's press into the Unseen see the blessings are yours and they are there for you but you've got to press into where those blessings are now brother Brandon will tell us that science has actually has actually blundered until they have moved into realities now brother Brandon will preach a sermon called looking to the Unseen he said now we look at the Unseen we look at the Unseen and believe that those things which are unseen but spoke of by God become realities we believe the things that are unseen but they're spoke of by God they become realities see when a man becomes United with God he begins to believe his word and Things become realities see you can see them and you can know that they are true so whatever God speaks must become a reality but he's got to have somebody who will believe what he has said will become a reality see it's more than just looking at something see we are not here as just ch church members we are here as Believers now brother brandom said all things are possible he said to God he said but all things are possible to you then when you begin to believe God The Impossibles is made realities when God is taken at his word when a Believer begins to believe God the word becomes a reality see it's more than just a man's word it's the infallibility of God's spoken word brother bam said if that could settle in our minds of who said it it is the spoken word he said the thought was expressed in a word now once God expresses his thought and makes it a word he can never take it back if God said you're the bride he can never take it back if he said you're going in the Rapture he can never take it back if he said you're a part of a New Jerusalem he can never take it back it must become a reality you are the reality of God's spoken word somebody spoke it and you believed it and now you are the reality of what God has Tau of you in the age that you're living in you see we are a two-fold being we have an outward man and we have an inward man do you know the outward man he looks by his eyes but the inward man he walks by faith now the outward man is but the inward man is god brother said we look with our eyes but we see with our heart we look with our eyes but we see with our heart we look at the things which are unseen by our heart the things which are seen are temporary the things which are not seen are Eternal do you realize this message said God would send us Elijah the prophet now watch He's not going to turn our eyes he's going to turn our heart because a Believer does not look with our eyes they look with our heart don't you see what this message has done it has turned our heart we are not looking at the word through our eyes we are looking at it from our heart and from our heart we believe God is the savior and from our heart we believe he's a Healer and from our heart we believe are going in the Rapture and these things are becoming realities my goodness Amen to think tonight to think tonight that the time has come for the Believers to go forward brother said we got to work together as one unit we got to get our difference away we got to lay aside our doctrines and we got to press forward we got to press forward listen and we've got to take the promises that God has given us the devil's not going to get out of our way and allow us to take our promises but there are some Believers here who are not sissies we are not cowards we are warriors we are Sons and Daughters of God we have been born from the genes of God we believe God therefore this is time for war it's time for war listen I think I think we have stayed out of our land long enough I think we have stayed away from the promises long enough we are under a Divine commission to possess Divine promises brother said a man that is commissioned of God he only looks upward and onward listen there are some things behind us but the Holy Ghost is in front of us I think it's time to be more than just church members I think it's time to be perseverant Believers you know what perseverance means it means to be persistent [Music] to make a goal brother said we should press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus let me say we're not just pressing we are pressing towards something brother bam said to the complete identification come on church amen we're warriors we're in time message Believers we are not partially restored church members we are not partially restored church members there were four death Messengers who ate the tree down there were four death Messengers who eat the tree down they destroyed the tree but there would be for Life me Messengers that would restore the tree back your complete identification is not in justification it's not in sanctification it's not even in the baptism of the Holy Ghost justification made way for sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost which made way for the word itself to come down into the Perfection of the church we are not just Justified Christians we are not just Sanctified Christians we are not just Holy Ghost F Christians we are the reality of the spoken word bride our complete identification is in the word if it's in the word we can have it if it's in the word it belongs to us then tonight we are PR into the Fulfillment of scriptural promises now I'll say this it's time to go forward it's time to move forward it's time to advance and the only way you can advance in this hour that we're living in is by pressing you say why do you say that because the lid has come off of hell the lid has come off of Hil there are 200,000,000 demons that have been loosed out of the river of Euphrates against this bride I feel like preaching on that point amen can I say something to you can I say something we can number the demons against us brother you have left me we can number the demons against us 200,000,000 demons but we cannot number the Angels that's with us the Apostle Paul said Paul said we have come to Mount Zion where there is an innumerable amount of angels when Paul saw this church of the firstborn come to Mount Zion you can number the demons against her but she cannot number the angels with her then I can say to you tonight there is more with us there is more for us than there is against us if God be for us then who can be against us we are the generation who will possess every promise we will possess healing we will possess deliverance we will possess the Holy Ghost we will possess adoption we will possess Perfection we will possess the rapture we will profess the Millennium we are the generation who will possess amen hallelujah hallelujah we're not just professors we are profess the kingdom of God is going to be preached and men and men are going to press into it now you know what that word presseth means it means to use and apply Force you know what Paul said he said I do not fight as one who is beating the air in other words we're not fighting Flesh and Blood we are fighting spirit and powers and rulers of darkness and wickedness and Corruption and sin our battle is a spiritual battle but if it's a spiritual battle we've got a spiritual weapon if it's a spiritual battle God did did not leave us in this battle without something to fight with come on Church you are the generation who will take the land but there's Giants in the land there's scarecrows in the land there's all kinds of things in the land but there's a sword in your hand what difference does it make what is in the land if there's a sword in your hand amen if there's a giant before you this weekend pick up the sword and cut his head off amen pick up your sword come on Church there was a two-edged sword came into a prophet's hand in Sabino Canyon it was the word of the Lord it was the third pull of his ministry it was the opening of Seven Seals I'm not just to justify church member I am a third po believer I'm not a chicken I'm an eagle I have been born for Heavenly places if I'm going to get there I'm going to have to press out of this Earthly realm into the Heavenly realm see every man he presses into it you don't just casually walk into it you don't just easily walk into it but the Kingdom of Heaven is preached and Men we'll press into it how many knows brother Bron preached a sermon and he called it desperation listen at his prayer he said I want to speak tonight on giving them courage to encourage them to take their god-given rights they have a right to defeat the Devil he is already defeated Glory Hallelujah he's already defeated and he is just bluffing them come on you're fighting a defeated enemy you're fighting a defeated enemy that devil who is standing between you and your future is already defeated that devil who is standing between you and the Holy Ghost is already defeated that devil who is standing between you and yourself he's already defeated let the holy ghost come in this building tonight and Quicken the promise of the word pick up your sword and strike against that devil pick up your sword and fight back against that devil this is the second service we don't have to wait one more second we don't have to wait one more second we can break through right now we can break out of the spere we can break out of the unbelief we can break out of the fear all things are possible to them that believe Hallelujah am so a prophet stood there and he preached the word and he said Lord come get in your word and as I speak your word give them faith for the glory of God [Applause] so a prophet was preaching the word and God was giving him the word to say to defeat the defeated enemy Amen in other words he didn't just tell him who the enemy was he gave him a weapon to kill the enemy oh Church of the Living God can I tell you what that weapon is it's the weapon of Faith come on it's the weapon of Faith you heard it this morning it's not the weapon of feelings it's the weapon of Faith see what Paul said his faith is the substance of things hopeful it's the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear can I tell you what a prophet said he said you testify of the things you do not see oh my amen you don't testify of what you see you testify of what you don't see you have five inner senses and you have five outer senses see taste feel smell here reason memory imagination affection and conscience you have five outer five inner none of them will declare God but there is a super sense which is called the which a prophet called faith and he said faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen we can see the doctor's report but we don't talk about it we can see the wayward child going further in sin come on you say brother Andrew I've got a loved one and they're going away from God and they're own they're own drugs they're drinking alcohol they're living immoral oh they're getting tattoos you can see all those things but what you can't see is more real than what you can so you testify of what you don't see when you're looking at what you do see in other words can I ask you something when did the prodical son start testifying his son was coming home did he start testifying the day that he started on his way home but the minute he left the father's house the father begin to testify he's coming back home they could see the pigs he could see the life he was living but beyond that he could see a promise that would become a reality and for day after day after day he fought against that devil he said your boy is never coming home and one day Hallelujah one day he looked across the hill and here come his son what he had believed he had spoken and it become a reality oh Church of the Living God I say tonight this is a spoken word generation speak the word and believe what you say and watch it become a reality faith is something it's born in you faith is Supernatural faith is something that you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it's there brother Bram said what is Faith it's an unseen Force see it's the holy spirit that brings Faith so faith is the evidence of Things Not Seen the Bible says that Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet I love that as yet he moved with fear and he prepared an ark you know the prophet of God said before he saw one drop of rain before he saw one cloud in the sky he moved with faith in the Amplified Bible that that phrase Things Not Seen translates to events not yet seen oh my don't we have a sermon called events made clear by prophecy in other words as Believers we do not wait for the event to believe the prophecy we believe the prophecy therefore we know the event will take place now come on church we do not wait for the event we believe the prophecy because we know where it's coming from it's coming from God and what he says will never fail what he says he will not take back if God is God then he is a Healer if God is God he's a savior if God is God he's the one who sent this message if God is God he's the god of these meetings he's the God of this Youth Camp he's the god of every preacher on this platform if God is God I believe what he said the Holy Ghost has lit a in my soul and the prophet of God said the Holy Ghost will fan the Flames until it becomes a [Applause] reality I say Satan you don't have enough water to put out this fire you don't have enough wind to stop this fire it's like fire and it's shut up in my bones it's the quickening power it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and it keeps burning it keeps burning till it becomes a reality I'm going to say it I'm going to say it if a prophet said it you can believe it if a prophet said your birth is not your adoption if a prophet said your birth is not your adoption believe a prophet over what a man say if a prophet said that there is going to be an invencible army it's going to come to pass come on Church you know what he said he said a man can live so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with it I'm looking I'm looking at the reality of what a prophet spoke [Applause] Hallelujah you are the reality you are the reality you say I'm the reality well we are under the order of MDC amen we're under the order of MDC can I say what the prophet said he said we see he promised it in the Bible we believe it are y'all ready for this soul body and spirit how is that possible because the Holy Ghost is a reality that comes into you and you don't bring it subject to your nature the holy ghost brings you subject to his and the Holy Ghost believes the word I feel good I feel like preaching the Holy Ghost believes this message the Holy Ghost believes what a prophet said the Holy Ghost backs up what brother brandom said can I tell you something can I tell you something this world you're living in is the only place that does not believe what a prophet T it's the only place can you prove that when brother bram's first daughter Sharon rose right went on the glory brother random went and be on the curtain of time and he said there was Sharon Rose and he said I asked ask her what are you doing here she said I'm waiting on Billy brother said I begin to look around he said he said there were all kinds of people there but they were young there was no old age and his little girl looked at him and said Daddy don't you remember what you Tau on immortality come on Church she was a baby brother when she died she never sat in any sermons he preached on immortality but there was a seed in her soul and when she Ste beyond the curtain of time she stepped into the reality of what her Daddy had taught Oh Glory well there's a bride on the earth tonight you don't have to wait till she dies to step into the reality but right here in Uganda the Holy Ghost is here you can step into the reality of what a prophet T you can step into the water you can step into the third pool you can step in the bride's Revival you can step in the seventh seal it's time to move but into reality we'll believe it with our soul our body and our spirit hallelujah hallelujah God is immutable it's impossible for God to [Music] [Applause] lie you say preacher what are you talking about in hell they believe what brother Ram talk because they got kicked out of too many of his meetings but in this Earth is the only place that people refuse to believe what a prophet talk can I say this but I am a believer from my soul so I believe even when I can't see I believe even when I cannot feel see I believe even when it don't make sense because I am a believer do you know there's three kinds of believers do you know there's three kinds of Believers brother R said in every Church there's a Believer unbeliever and a real and a m believer I bring something to you there's three kinds of Believers in every [Applause] believer you have a body you have a spirit and you have a soul don't me prove it to you your body is flesh and your flesh is a byproduct of an affair of your adulterous paren your flesh is an unbeliever it's your flesh that don't want to go to church it's your flesh that don't want to sing it's your flesh that don't want to pray it's your flesh that don't want to worship because it's an unbeliever but you move a little bit deeper and you got a spirit your spirit is a make believer if everything's going good your spirit is real high but when something goes wrong your spirit drops and your spirit begins to say things that your soul don't agree with your spirit begins to say I cannot make it and your flesh says that's right you don't need to go to church but why are you here tonight why are you here tonight because underneath that flesh underneath that Spirit there is a soul and the soul is the real you and the Soul believes God when I'm on the mountain I'm a Child of God when I'm in the Valley I'm a Child of God when I'm sick I'm a Child of God when I'm well I'm a Child of God when I'm rich I'm a Child of God when I'm broke I'm a Child of God I believe God from my soul Hallelujah I believe him I believe him in the good times Sean I believe him in the bad times brotheri I believe him when the sun is shining I believe him when the clouds are forming I am a believer Hallelujah am glory to God yes we're Believers hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah therefore we preach the word because we believe we sing because we believe we worship because we believe when our flesh does not want to when our spirit is too low our soul says yes Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen so they so Faith cometh Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God said he sent anointed preachers to preach the word and you received it now can I say this we have been taught that we get what we expect can I say this I believe that works for God as well brother brandom said as you receive the word you become the word pick up the sword and cut that devil's head as you believe the word as you receive the word you become the word can I say this tonight that's why you're still standing it's not because of a Preacher not because of a gift not because of a song but because you are a word born believer I might as well just say it amen Amen brother Ram said as the word Goes Forth receive it and be ready receive the word and be ready ready for what ready for the manifestation of the results that the word brings you heard it this morning if you're a Christian you are the result of the word that God said yes sir now I might as well just say it we're living in a time where prayer request become testimonies in the same service hallelujah amen in the same service not a year later not a month later not a week later the same service you know why because we are believers Hallelujah if the word says I'm Healed I will turn a prayer request in and I will say pray for me I'm not feeling well but when I hear the word say he was H he was wounded for my transgression he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him when I hear the word I receive the word and my sickness become subject to the word hallelujah amen if you got sin in your life hear the word of the Lord amen come on church it's more than a sermon it's more than a book it's more than a t it's reality now either we believe the word or we do not and Jesus last commission preach the gospel cast out devils in my name lay hands on the Seck and they shall they shall recover you know what the pro of God said he said the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out of the devil now can I can I take my Liberty is that okay amen we're living in a day and time where people are trying to shut preachers down and put a tape player in the pit well if I was the devil I would want to shut up the ministry too because For the First Time underneath this message preachers finally have something to say we're not just running we're running with a message and it's the king's message and there's so much Authority in this message it's the scepter of the king that we can tell the devil get out of my way get out of my way get out of my way you know what I say I say Satan get out of my way I'm going on with Jesus I'm going on with a message I'm going on to a complete identification I'm going in the Rapture the power of Satan is in the hands of preachers to break that's a quote he said Lord you give us the divine power to break the power of Satan over this life somebody say this with me Satan power over not in this life I am lost the power of Satan over this life not in this life amen yes sir can I say this to you the devil is not in you he's hanging over you amen because he knows that you are a part of a Joshua generation he knows if there is a Joshua there's got to be a Caleb if there's a Joshua there's got to be a Caleb come on Joshua was the the end time leader Caleb was a type of the end time generation this message is our Joshua we are calebs and the devil knows if he can oppress us he can stop us can I say this to you there is a difference in Demon oppression and demon possession possession means he has got you oppression means he's trying to get [Applause] you if the devil has possessed you he's already got you but if he's oppressing you he's trying to get you you know what the devil says he says I'm going to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you I'm going to get you you know what I say you should have got me when you had a chance if the devil was going to get you he would have done got you [Applause] but he does not have the ability to get you because God already got you he got you from before the foundation of the world Glory Hallelujah will me prove it to you by the message the prophet of God said I didn't give my heart to God at a younger age because the spirit hung over me a spirit didn't get him it hung over him you know why that Spirit hangs over you is because that Spirit does not want you to go out yonder and fully believe the word because that devil knows if you believe what has been spoken it will become a [Applause] reality but the prophet of

Andrew how in the world do I water the word with praise how in the world do I have a breakthrough are you ready it's one simple little word amen [Applause] now that was too simple but it's very powerful amen Jesus is the amen of God the amen stands for prevailing promise it stands for Authority when you say Amen you seal the promise of God in and seal the devil's doubt [Applause] when you hear the word you believe the word you say Amen to the word and that word becomes a reality amen now yes now either we believe it or not either we believe it or not either we believe this message or we don't but I believe this message is the word of of the Lord in the name of the Lord to the prophet of the Lord bringing to us the word of faith can I say this we are not is this okay we are not waiting for something to come to take us to our complete identification a prophet preached the entirety of the word when he closed the seals he said I have now introduced to you the all in all he is now here I must decrease and he must increase can I say what a prophet said he said my Ministry is different from the pastor or the Evangelist he said my Ministry is to declare him he's here I stay here tonight and I say to you in the name of the Lord by the word of the Lord from the prophet of the Lord he is here he's here right now he's here in power he's here in Authority I say Satan in the name of Jesus Christ take your hands off of God's Property I adure Thee thou unbelieving devil thou demon of hindrances I adure Thee in the name of Jesus Christ give away to the name of Jesus Christ

symbols we're going to the reality come on now there is a symbol but then there is a reality the symbol is good but until it's interpreted it leaves doors open for [Applause] confusion can I have a few more minutes if there was no light in this building and there was absolutely no way to see and I stepped off the platform in the darkness and I started walking and I tripped I kept on walking I come back and I tripped again I said brother Sean what am I tripping over and said well I think it's a speaker uh uh mic okay I said brother bu what do you think it is he said I think it's a chair I said okay I said uh now we have two opinions on one object what's going to reveal it there is a man here who can turn on the light and when the light comes on the light does not change the object it only reveals [Applause] it denominations were stumbling over the promises of God but in the the evening time it shall be light and light will strike the Sy will strike the symbol and will bring a revelation listen you know it's there but you don't know what it is until a prophet reveals it brother B says this tonight in closing he said Lord because of your appearing before us it made the People Press Beyond every circumstance to get up here not down here get up to believe that this is the hour that their sins will be forgiven them and they will be free from this not on Hallelujah as I close tonight I invited a very special person to come to the meeting tonight and he's here can I introduce you to him is that okay he's called the dissolver of all doubt [Applause] why go another minute in this Youth Camp with a doubt in your heart Why Live Another Minute doubting God he's here Joshua 40 years later entered the Promised Land as the great military General when he come up against his enemies they had walled into a place there was no way for him to get to them but by faith he looked at the Unseen because God gave Moses a promise while they were yet in Egypt did I read that right they were still in leay say I mean they were still in Egypt but God already gave them a promise I give you all of Palestine generation of the upright there has been a Joshua Among Us and a Moses Among Us and he said the land is yours I was two3 of the way there I was two3 to the journey uh brother brandom seen a vision of a map of Palestine he said I was two way two parts of the journey but there was another part there which was a third part which was a third pull you know what he said he said that's where all the promises lay for the beli we're not going back to the first and second pool that was the permissive will of God but there is a perfect pool it's called the third pool and there is where all the promises L by faith Joshua saw the walls of Jericho laying flat on the ground why he seen the inv ible one and when people here tonight that's sinful in your heart he said I don't mean you live in adultery or you get drunk sin is unbelief but when you look at the chief Captain the world will lay flat at your feet and will shake away every fed of sin away from you ding days will be over so Joshua he's going along one day you know what he's got sword he's got a sword and as he's walking brother he runs into a man and brother he draws his sword it's brother trust correct yeah he draws his sword and he says are you for us are against us the man spoke back and said I am the captain of the host of the Lord I'm feeling too good now I'm the captain of the host of the Lord he hasn't even made it to the walls of Jericho yet but the prophet of God said when he met the captain
