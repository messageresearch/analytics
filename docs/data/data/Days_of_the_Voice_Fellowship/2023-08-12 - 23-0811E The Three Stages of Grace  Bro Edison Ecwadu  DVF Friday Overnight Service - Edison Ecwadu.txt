Jesus himself leading these children Lord father we cannot do anything without you or God but we can do all things through you who strengthens us we are weak but Thou Art strong father we just give ourselves away tonight and we ask for your presence to come down long even as we said in your water where two or three are gathered your name you're in the Middle East father we are fully persuaded that you are here Lord and you are here to bless us father and to speak to us but I just want to commit myself to your hands Lord knowing that I'm just a man full of sin came to the world speaking lies unborn in iniquity and I pray that father may you have mercy upon me that bladder was shared at Calvary Lord may it come and bless me Lord from all sin and I pray that father may you circumcise my lips my mind and father and I may get out of the way but father you come down and speak to your children according to the desires of their hearts or God there is nothing good that I have for them but father I know that which you have Lord for them that you knew before the foundation of the world was laid speak that unto their hearts Lord father as they step aside now let the Holy Ghost come and take over granted father and have preeminence in the service and one rebuke the enemy everything that contradicts with your word every action that is not in line with your word father want to rebuke and cast the enemy get out of this place in the name of Jesus father may you have your way let your will be done in Jesus precious name we pray and believe amen blessed be the name of the Lord I'm called brother I am your brother in Christ as I stand here tonight request that you pray for me and pray with me that God will lead me to speak something that will help you praise the Lord I don't want to come here and speak my mind because if I speak my mind it will poison your soul praise the Lord but if the spirit comes to take control I believe at the end of this service you'll be blessed blessed be the name of the Lord are without wasting your mantras to read the book of Ephesians turn with me to the book of Ephesians chapter 2. verses 1 following I'm going to speak for just a few minutes and we see what the Lord has for us tonight Ephesians chapter 2 verses 1 reads and he I knew has he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wearing in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now walketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in time past in the last of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and where by Nature the children of Wrath even us others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we're dead in sin hath quickened us together with Christ Jesus by Grace you are saved father we thank you we have radio wide and your art says that the letter kills but your spirit gives life father we pray come and interpret these scriptures we do not know we don't have understanding of the word but father you are your own interpreter we do not want to put our mind in your word but father you come down and interpret your word unto us that father we shall be edified we bless on him we thank you granted father in Jesus name we pray and believe amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord I thank God for these uh wonderful a privilege that uh God has given me to stand before you tonight just to speak a few words that will a few words of encouragement I have not come with something new tonight praise the Lord I have come with that which you already know and just to add on a letter as the spirit of the Lord leads us blessed be the name of the Lord I want to begin with a testimony uh concerning my life uh the uh the biggest miracle that God can do to a man is the Salvation of his soul praise the Lord if not because of Christ I don't know how and where I would be tonight praise the Lord I believe each one of us has got that kind of testimony of how the Lord abandoned the 99 and came looking for you one ship it is because of the grace of God and I thank God that tonight I can stand boldly in his presence not because I am a strong man but because Christ in me is strong Hallelujah I thank God that we are all standing and I'm also standing because Christ stood at Calvary and that's why I am standing the Bible says he became us that we may become him he took up the nature of sin that you may take up his righteousness Hallelujah Christ went to Calvary on your behalf and that is why there is now no more condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus those who walk not after the will of the flesh Hallelujah I believe we are the children of the spirit led by the Spirit by the grace of God tonight I'm going to talk about Grace the three stages of Grace praise the Lord I'm going to talk about the three stages of Grace now Grace didn't just begin today Grace never begun when you got saved Hallelujah Grace did not start when you heard the word grace started way back even before the world was formed Hallelujah there are three things that God did one God had his four knowledge now sometimes I ask a question have you ever asked yourself that what was there before Genesis 1. have you ever thought that what has been there what was there before Genesis 1 before God said let there be light Let There Be have you ever bothered to think that what was there before God spoke Hallelujah now God had his thoughts easy for our knowledge and in the forward knowledge of God God saw everything all throughout the seven Church ages blessed be the name of the Lord and I want to tell you according to God's foreign knowledge he saw you and that is why you're here because God had seen you back there you never knew you were going to be here tonight but you are here because God had seen you back there in his foreign knowledge and therefore after God had his foreign knowledge he started ordaining things in accordance to his for our knowledge and that's why God ordained everything there is Hallelujah and according to God's poor knowledge your ordained Grace to be in the place blessed be the name of the Lord because God was not ignorant that there was going to be the fall of Man God in his foreign knowledge so time all throughout the ages until where we are now and everything has to work according to God's for our knowledge and God's ordination whatever you see taking place now wherever it takes place God saw it before and therefore God had a preparation God had prepared a plan for whatever we see going on now and therefore that's why God cannot fail because God has already prepared away before there was even one single problem God prepared a way of Escape God prepared healing before there was one disease on Earth God prepared Victory before there was one demon to try you Hallelujah in Gods for our knowledge God knew that you would not thrive in the law and that's why he brought Grace blessed be the name of the Lord you could not attain righteousness through the law so according to God's for our knowledge he had ordained Grace to be and at God's appointed time Grace came at our time Hallelujah because we could only overcome through Grace now I'm going to talk about the three stages of Grace one is justification blessed be the name of the Lord you love the Lord now justification is when God called you let's talk a little about the three things now God the Bible says somewhere that he ordained he chose us in him before the foundation of the world was laid God ordained you a son or daughter before anything was created that means god knew you before anything God had known you and therefore he had ordained you to be a son and the good news is there is nothing the devil can do about it blessed be the name of the Lord if God has ordained you if God ordained you a son or daughter then the devil has been shut out I'll tell you it doesn't matter what the Devil Makes You Do Hallelujah iricate change God's program God's plan about your life why because you are a son and a daughter of God I want to just bring a simple example if I am a father and I have a child at home another child is very rebellious that's the one to do what I tell him when I try to rebuke him too many does the same thing does that mean that that child is not my child Hallelujah now because the tempter is still here with us because we are still in flesh brother sister the devil is going to try to make you do things that are contrary to the word of God but God has had a way of Grace to bring you back to his what and therefore the devil is defeated why because Grace has prevailed blessed be the name of the Lord now the three stages of Grace not everyone can be able to go through them Hallelujah there are a special category of people who are ordained to complete the race there is a special category of people who are going to go through all the three stages but some will not go through all now remember uh uh in the book of Exodus when the children of Israel left Egypt that was their justification God was calling them out of the world of Egypt Hallelujah and it was a very big congregation very many people moved out of Egypt and they walked there when they saw the goodness of the Lord never again the pillar of fire leading them at night people saw the goodness of God and they moved all things and that's how the church is tonight many are called but few are chosen many people today come to Salvation so many come as a group by [Music] as well you seek Miracles the word of God being Vindicated and everyone is a Christian Hallelujah wait to the time of sanctification when they get to the Wilderness Hallelujah that is where the true seed of God is sin the Bible tells us not all of them cross the Wilderness because of their unbelief God made them to move rotate in the wilderness praise the Lord God had to sieve his own cartoon and I want to tell you out of the multitude of people who left Egypt [Music] is that amen that does not mean that it is not possible it means that there are people whoever who are going to make it I mean it's trials difficult times that the devil presents to you but I want to tell you tonight there is a people who are going to overcome Amina God cannot prepare a heaven in vain that means there is a special category of people who are going to inherit it is [Music] hallelujah amen there is nothing everybody can do about it there is nothing the devil can do there's even nothing even myself Hallelujah I mean I can't do anything else because I cannot refuse to be because [Music] glory to God we all have parents foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I am a Son of God and I don't even need to struggle to convince you say it again if you don't believe suit yourself but one thing I know I am a Son of God I Come From Heaven and I'm going back there is no number of demons [Music] I have just come but I want to tell you as a matter of fact I'm going back I'm going back home and I have to go back home that's where I come from my heart desires to be there hallelujah amen it may be aggressed house [Music] even if I'm staying in a flat here but I want to be comfortable until I get back to that house that is my origin that's where I come from do you know where you come from foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that means you come from heaven hallelujah hallelujah do you love the Lord God to wonder in the beginning and the Bible tells us that God put his seed in you yeah do you have the seed of God if you have the seed of God then you rejoice when I say that because you know what I'm talking about Hallelujah God in the beginning [Music] that is blessed be the name of the Lord now I got you were mingled in the world because of the fall of Man you straight away you got lost you deviated Hallelujah but because God can never failure [Music] he came looking for you yeah not because you were perfect I want to tell you not because you were good some of us I don't think there is anybody I can compare with myself generally Uganda sometimes when I walk out there where were you I get scared I don't want to go back there hallelujah hallelujah glasses [Music] [Music] yes I always kept in a special place they are only picks when visitors Hallelujah I mean so our glasses are special things so you are a special thing you wear a glass not actually you were you are a glass something very special precious in the eyes [Music] you were thrown in the rubbish something very special but has been abandoned rubbish then Christ came Christianity also a special thing that has been ignored Hallelujah that was your justification the Bible says God did not look at the Times that you were still living in sins every city not as close to that chapter blessed be the name of the Lord do not allow the enemy to haunt you down because of your past life Hallelujah man that chapter has been closed and that's the good news tonight do not be discouraged the devil can tell you that is this one also you are rebuking people are drinking alcohol you used to drinking smokers you have said I used to organize and that means I'm overcoming Hallelujah sanctification what washes us teaching foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] but they were in church Hallelujah over whether you have the seed of God in you or not Hallelujah I mean but remember I can give some guidance if you have the seed of God in you then you are receptive when the one of God is being spoken why because it is part of you [Music] foreign uh that's why I had to burn out the old nature now inefficiency to one says trespassing sins [Music] what does quickening means giving life something which was dead bringing it back to life now the Bible says and you has he quickened [Music] do you love the Lord [Music] now he says and you has he quickens that means there was a seed of God inside of you there was something Desiring there was a thirst that you didn't know how to fulfillment that first has been there all the way and you see people are trying to fulfill that fast [Music] as a child of God you try to fulfill it when you are still in the world you are trying to quench The Thirst of God you are trying to quench it by Sleeping with women you were trying to quench that fast you tried it could not work you tried women it could not work you tried drinking it could not foreign until you met part of that verse and I want to tell you when you had the word you didn't ask questions why right part of the word the word of God part of the world which God had put inside of you made part of it and when the word spoke part of the word that word Hallelujah and therefore he didn't struggle to believe when you met the real world of God part of that city which was in here when you met it I want to tell you there was no compromise It just fits together why because it is something that God had in the beginning Hallelujah so when the gospel was [Music] the seed which was Desiring for the rain [Music] wrong number we didn't just be foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we belong to you Hallelujah the Bible says they left us back to them because they were a lot of us hallelujah man the ones who left Jesus they never belong to Jesus you know when Jesus was performing Miracles doing all kinds of good things people followed him there was a fish and bread to be eaten they were following up to the deserts when Jesus started preaching yes he said if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood you don't have life that was hard indeed I want to tell you they ran away but those who just became [Music] I want to tell you church if you're a child of God [Music] [Music] they say I am going back to our yeah he runs away he just hangs around when Mommy service because he has nowhere to go out this is home one away who runs from church to church [Music] you say they hate me from this church I don't know how Pastor is talking about it when it talks about youth who sneak with the girls I know it's fine talk about me even brother they like quoting even brother when God could show him somebody's life [Music] because the word of God doesn't just come to pump for you foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] it is the seed of God walking in you the word of God molding the divine nature the character of Christ when you believed you believed with a carnal mind the carnal nature now the Bible tells us that let this man which was in Christ be in you where do you get that mind of Christ [Music] it is the word of God which is in you molding the character of Christ Hallelujah now we should come to church and the more the word of God the more the world Listen gets far away is the word of God is the one molding the characters the character of Christ things will fall down am I talking to someone here there are things that you used to do that you right now as I speak you can't remember the last time you did them Hallelujah I mean when you stop and think when last did I tell a lie you can't even remember it fell away the word of God to listen to mourning the character of Christ and it has the power to transform Hallelujah now that is what sanctifies us and God calls that is your justification and now he brings you to church the world is working the character of Christ and you get Sanctified Hallelujah God cleanses you sacrifices hallelujah hallelujah don't be worried Brothers you may not have the Holy Ghost now you are on your way to the promised salvation is a process it's not something that happens in one day we'll get the Holy Ghost in one day two weeks God deals with us as individuals not as a group singer amen Amina foreign hallelujah hallelujah there has to be a power of transformation there has to be something whatever transforms not the burns the desire of sin a church you know money you can be in church you believe the word when it's being preached you say Amen because in your heart you are convinced that it is Hallelujah I mean then what should we do korechi you're listening to the word in your heart you know it is foreign [Music] [Music] Hallelujah now that's why God but they were Christians foreign did the Judas inherit the Kingdom you died oh he can't of course but Judas went and performed the Miracles and that's why do not be happy when you pray for somebody Peter [Music] actually deny the Christo without the Holy Ghost praise the Lord the apostles before the Holy Ghost they came to Jesus now tell us who is great among us and that's what happens that's what happens when ministers don't have the Holy ghosts Pastor you tell us now who is great among us if you weigh our ministry without the Holy Ghost Hallelujah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] God will give you foreign no I can't Jesus said these fellas here they are bragging that they are ministers [Music] these guys cannot do anything he didn't tell them the secrets but Jesus Saturday and I want to tell you Pentecost when the Holy Ghost things were different Hallelujah you are struggling now [Music] but you struggle while on the way to the promises these are not news we are all struggling foreign including myself we are all struggling but let's struggle I strive while on the way so when the Holocaust came out of Pentacles on the streets now to face persecution that's why I'm saying you can't face persecution without the holy ghosts hey am I speaking to human beings you can't face persecution and that's why we've got to go through all the three stages don't don't accept to stop in the wilderness [Music] [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord who was saying he was saying two laws are struggling within him when he wants to do Christ truth is when that's wrong Hallelujah and struggle foreign [Music] you know what Jesus what God told him he said my grace is sufficient brother sister the grace of God is sufficient for you blessed be the name of the Lord if the grace of God is sufficient for you then you would say Amen to that Joe again though foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] it doesn't matter how slow it may be so much before the Rapture takes place you will be perfect amazing why because foreign [Music] foreign you see the Laburnum says maybe I should chip this is the greatest gift that God has ever sent to the world is Jesus Christ the greatest gift that God sent to the Bible says in the Book of John chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was God [Music] put on flesh and dwelt among us [Music] because Bible students know that was Jesus Christ now the greatest gift that God has ever sent to the world foreign what it comes with your salvation it comes with your Victory it comes with your healing God's word has everything I don't care what you want now the word of God is able to provide it because Jesus was a full package with everything that's what the Bible says that this sign shall follow them that believes blessed with the name of the Lord in my name now whatever you want put it in Mark 16. as long as you believe then you have everything now I say the full package [Music] for example you know there's a very big mango tree [Music] branches Goku if you break that egg you are going to find a liquid Hallelujah but inside that liquid their legs for chicken [Music] feathers intestines but that does not mean that it's not there is Amina blessed in the name of the Lord whatever you want is in the word of God it is here you may not see it that doesn't mean that's not there Hallelujah your Victory he's in this seat is [Music] foreign what do you want to find it in the world if you want a job don't come and ask me go to the world your job is written if you want Victory don't come and tell me you may say brother pray for me I will pray for you but there is no guarantee my prayer is going to make your voice you have Victory is in the word because it is a seed you may not see it Hallelujah but when it is then it is going to germinate again and then you see everything I will remember the gym that you wanted it is now seen why because he has found fertile ground in your eyes foreign are we there if you abide in me and my word abides you shall ask for anything he didn't say you shall ask for simple things [Music] he says whatsoever he shall you desire When you pray believe it is one [Music] I am of no help to you why watch because personal I'm also fighting you are fighting I'm also fighters God has given us the weapon cartoon if you can't shoot the enemies one of these days you're going to die aim you've got to aim and shoot for yourself [Music] so God is very just he gave all of us weapons so if you keep yours in the closet one of these days Naruto [Music] [Music] the war is in your head right now so how do you fight that God has given us the weapon and that is why your Victory lies may the Lord bless you father father we thank you foreign [Music] not the enemy the devil Stan will not take it away from us granted father to a dad Lord Jesus I want to pray for the leadership of this church Lord Jesus continue to keep him protect him and provide for him Grant him more revelation of this message they pray for the Believers entire congregations still struggling with unbelief and yet they desire to work with you Lord Jesus give them the ability to live for you [Music] set them free now Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ahead of me and with me foreign [Music] may the Lord bless you as the pastor comes [Music] thank you amen and we can you play that song you were playing you know I this song was just coming to me as a brother was ministering and I I wasn't quite making out what it is and then I had the brother play again I was like oh yeah that's this song It Is Well with My Soul that's because I have a friend in Jesus thank you for the word it was very time [Music] amen God bless you come on [Music] this again so as we just sing a few songs and as we are going to prayer now as we just invite the presence of God under the presence of the conviction that we have received by the preaching of the word the desire that the Holy Spirit [Music] [Music] my way [Music] Sorrows like sea [Music] why [Music] thou has done me to say it is it is where we my son [Music] with My Soul [Music] he is [Music] thank you let these places [Music] I understand is [Music] now meetings [Music] [Music] [Music] all these Glory as though [Music] oh his name is [Music] amen ities [Music] me please [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] boys [Music] foreign [Music] I've tried most everything and I'm happy now to say there is nothing like religion in the good old-fashioned way I am working in the all-time way I want the world to know that I'd rather be an old-time Christian than anything [Music] I know I'd rather Christianity [Music] Christianity [Music] [Music] everywhere [Music] because [Music] [Music] I know [Music] there is [Music] Highway dating everywhere I go [Music] hey man there's nothing like being an all-time Christian can you say Amen to that hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen shall we sing that I don't know whether we can sing that let's try it see if you can sing that have you been beneath the fountain have you been beneath the fountain but if you can
