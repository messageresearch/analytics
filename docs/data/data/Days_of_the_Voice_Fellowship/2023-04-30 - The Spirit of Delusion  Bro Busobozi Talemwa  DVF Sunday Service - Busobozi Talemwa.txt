we shall speak to and as your people will be praying to that those words will sink into their eyes we are asking these things in the name of Jesus Amen I mean amen amen I'd like to now invite you to take your Bibles with me we go to the book of second Thessalonians foreign [Music] [Music] foreign okay so uh so this morning I'll show a few slides brother Marvin do you have those slides ready is it working fine um so I I think I will be talking about a few things I'm not I am I'm not intending to preach too long and today I'll just be dealing with something little very important though let us read the verses 9 to verses 12. reading the name of the Lord even him who's coming is after the working of Saturn with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but hard pleasure in unrighteousness foreign [Music] [Music] praise the name of the Lord amen you may be seated this morning so um I would like to thank God for our musicians becoming better and better by the day I'm telling you days of the voice Fellowship we keep going forward if you're going to be back it is up to you for us we are heading forward Amina amen our media department is also going forward and if you want to if you feel you you have uh the ability to help him please go and meet him it will be better if you meet him than for him to come and ask you serving the lord in any capacity needs a lot of commitment Madonna and there is nothing let me tell you there is nothing better than serving the lord tell your neighbor there is [Music] foreign Hallelujah amen now you are starting Hallelujah hallelujah amen glory to God so today I hope you will love me after the service I'm going to speak on something which affects most of us especially the younger generation the younger people the younger people really most of my summons if you've been following me really can help a lot of young people and I'm not saying it does not help the other ones but I trust that you to be of help now I want to speak on the spirit of delusion you see the spirit of delusion is a very cunning spirit is a very stubborn Spirit you see if I try to look into the dictionary to try and find the meaning of the word foreign foreign Ty held despite the in court travertable evidence to the contrary occurring especially in mental conditions a beliefs that someone holds and is convinced this is true despite here he says they incontrovertible you know they despite the the explanations you tell him this is white he is what he thinks is right you will show him evidence you will show him evidence infallible evidence you will prove to him Beyond reasonable that was what you are telling him is what I know is what is Right Church truth now that is the spirit and it's uh called delusion and mostly it is in mental cases Obama oh I am Trump I'm the president of America oh I am 70.7 and you can't convince him otherwise jump for you to talk to him you need to salute to him now it's a condition it's a mental condition you know according to um medicine according to the Bible Bible is a spirit is a spirit for you and it's called delusion not everyone gets this listen listen church not everyone gets the spirit of delusions but those who get the spirit of the illusion get it this way God gives you the truth hallelujah man but when you say the truth you do not get to appreciate it so it comes only after rejecting the truth and that's why Believers of the word all over the world I love us of the truth you must always be a lover of the truth and I say what is the truth Jesus Christ is the true yes sugar mashima he said I am the way I am the truth no man can come to the father Jesus yes he's not here physically where is Jesus is not a textbook we have a lot of books that people call us textbooks or reference books or something like that those of you who have gone to University a lot of reference books this one here is more than just a reference this one is the book foreign [Applause] and Beyond this one there is the name of the Lord Hallelujah now this word is what we believe us believe and anyone who doesn't believe this I think you need to bring it down a little bit it's vibrating anyone who doesn't bring anyone who doesn't believe this word God will accept certain spirits to come and attack them and these spirits will be very strong that you can almost not break them it's called illusion people will start believing lies they will not actually know that they are believing lies that's what I want to prove to you this morning but the devil has tried to bring and you will see actually by the end of the service there are so many people deceived and they almost can't believe it is from the God of this evil age the spirit of delusion is of the devil there was now working in the children of disobedience at the beginning they are disobedient to the true word of God that's right they are disobedient to the true word of God the word of God is the Bible says when any man comes to God first you must believe that he is a rewarder of all those are diligently Seekers to follow whatever he tells you believe whatever he tells us don't come to go to the bed don't come to God to give him your opinion you don't come to God to suggest to him so what do you think you should do what do you think he should have done but when you come to God he wants you to submit to everyone [Music] just cause a disbelief contention and their questions meant to desire knowledge but whoever needs knowledge of wisdom the Bible says God gives it if you have a clean heart if you have an opinion God will answer all your questions but when you come and you don't understand a few things together [Music] am I talking to someone here you are going to heaven again on the blessings that you believe the whole world I may not understand everything here I tell you this I believe everything is what you don't understand there's a problem there's a there's a question I have on the godhead I have believed it foreign who what was that voice yeah and yet Jesus is gone yes the voice of the father okay okay if Jesus was it was God why was he praying wasn't praying to he to the father so that means I hope some of you are not scratching your hands fully understood I learned more but when I read more let me tell you you were expected to get deeper and deeper and deeper every day in Christ again they the sin which cannot be forgiveness refusing to believe the world but the Bible says they that are born of God now soon I want to say that God is someone came out of a question that my daughter asked me Elizabeth came I don't know where she got the question from Elizabeth but she came and asked me why do some people use tattoos on their body base some of these people are deluded and I want you to say that God is a master artist God loves arts and you see he made many creatures he met every creature in their own kinds and every creature was supposed to bring forth of its own kinds of because they've crossed the line it is it is very fearful brother give me give me this slideshow let us show the people a few things here because our nature our nature bring forth the image foreign [Music] people saw me with an elephant and I said are you sure it is a world anymore we are supposed to live above all the creation we are supposed to be with them all these creatures why is it like the way it is and he has deceived the human race instead of believing the word of God give me the slightest brother hallelujah amen I hope everybody can see that now let us look at this slide number two in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth [Music] everything in the Earth all right where are them are the slaves brother foreign [Music] [Music] there are more [Music] foreign before he created heaven yeah hey there are many more things you don't know one one but don't scratch your head believe what is given to you and believe it without doubting so in the beginning God he created heaven for us we are just a little bit Katie fatally cartoon of the creation of God everything in heaven is just a part of God is creation there is much more than what beats they are singing foreign go to the previous slide go to the previous look at those eyes look at the Blue Eyes the White Face he painted the picture of Jesus that is so foreign watch it and that doesn't mean that you're not going to Prosperity some people think that if you're a Believer you sit on your gifts that's why I believe even if you have a gift of singing I sincerely believe you can actually record your music or several recording a music war and let it Bless the people if you have a gift don't just be there and everybody write your songs record them send it out sell it if you want this what is wrong with that foreign foreign are you looking at it look at all those spots wherever I am did you know that those sports are rhyming actually look at it again God knows how many sports because foreign and and and and you cannot reproduce it is and when that animal looks at you and sorry work to know his eyes detailed you're not able to see at night it has night vision it's ears it can run and someone who could do faster than any other okay it's beauty is foreign God is understanding the knowledge this thing has abilities no man can replicate when it wants to eat and pull it's whatever but yet now you can't see how long his tongue is all in that small creature lava this creature strongly is able to change its color choose a color depending on its environment it is what it needs to be able to leave there's so much I can talk about this give me the next see this lizard it is he ended up by saying and it is a beautiful one this is a beautiful piece now let me help you to appreciate it look at its eyes the way it is look at the Donkey Pastor what are you trying to do today we are trying to uh admire God is beautiful [Music] if you get it look at the next one what is this horse huh very beautiful it has a very nice hoof by the way it wasn't sure but it has a very nice all right next slide hallelujah amen look at this team very beautiful in the sight of God look at his sleep level two more very red to me very amazing about the eyes give me the next slide look at these birds oh my God I've seen people trying to mimic this bad going on those wrong things and they try to work some of them they fall down you didn't call that a flower on its eyes it's a flower put by God naturally look at his hair very beautiful I hope there are not people here who are Desiring to be like that so we don't want to tell him that's what the devil does the devil takes nature tries to confuse him making people be disease not even to mimic one another each of us is different I'm coming I'm coming see the next see that beautiful one there are some women who like mimicking news but this is nature God gave it a long amount not for turkey but for eating look at the hair level 250 brother hope we don't copy this fashion this is a natural fashion this bad does not have a saloon where it goes and says this is yellow and black it is give me that next Slide Man is in the image of God almost Genesis 1 25. and God made the Beast of the earth yes after his kind the animals and cattle after their kind name and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his comments and God so that it was good um everything I've shown and then when God finished then the Bible says let us make money in our image after our likeness what's going to be in the image foreign [Music] mine Mormont will be the best designer and we are just going to be designed after the image of God for the likeness of God so God created man in his own image in the image of much see this hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I said hallelujah hallelujah is in the image is in the nature of God we were created what his image that means we are the best singer of his what is the best form ation [Laughter] is foreign Yani [Music] the Bible says no you are fearfully and wonderfully made only came peace I told you why she died the way you were made you're fearful and wonderfully married you're beautiful you are amazing you're wonderful you are in the sight of God's sugar cartoon when he sees you the way he met you he says it is because I think the black man is the most handsome hahaha now to those of you in the U.S watching this you just have to relax handsome yeah some black men who are we are thinking I wish God made me like white now they are they are saying ah pasta that's why people bleach they feel they are not looking good God is a god of heart is a god of variety there is no Beauty in one color that's why it creates blacks [Music] and that's why we have different races we all came from Adams how come we have different colors it's because of where we live and also what we eat but I believe it is foreign foreign foreign and but I said well I laughed but well nasaka she's proud because she's light I changed and I'm proud because I'm darker and he must be happy because you are black any other person tells you you are better in a different way the spirit of delusion to try and deceive and tell you who come you are ugly or in a big job foreign you want to die no some women have less hair on their head is all right and I said the same thing the prophet says it is better for me shared the nature of God had you in his mind when he was creating you the way sister be happy you know a woman is not supposed to cut her hair did you know if she cuts are here there is no oh there is no uh joy that is Sun before God if you want him to be like somebody else and I'm going to show you what the devil is trying to do you find this beautiful woman very beautiful woman beautiful skin dressed very well and to those of you who don't know this is beautiful here beautiful nose you're going to foreign the other picture you find a very good black brother brother yes you are going to a good black brother like this one no no give me the next one he wants to marry this sister what is wrong with you I have a problem the devil is trying to delude the reason you are doing it because you think you have beautiful children are you saying you are not beautiful another black sister you can't have a black children is rushing to come God bless you come come on come on come sir look at this black guy this is a black bread and raised in Africa foreign [Music] praise the name of the Lord if you're white and you want black you are trying to be deceived listen give me the next slide Bridge Financial see what Adam is doing do you see a similarity there with what is makeup doing okay the spirit of delusion to try and deceive women can't tell them they are not beautiful and tell them I should look like other creatures say this beautiful supposedly beautiful woman trying to mimic the spirit of a cat deceiving the women in our generation do I have believers who are saying I was posing for Rich sinking um I'm just doing art I'm appreciating [Music] if you want to appreciate nature and take a picture don't become a cat don't a foreign [Music] [Music] from that day you should you should be called names even they do these things because they feel their cats they live among cards if you come to them and tell them she will go to court this one called me a Humanity foreign foreign some people people and I've been asked this question many times is there a fashion that every believer should do [Music] no I don't believe there is a uniform fashion secret is here the only scripture is it now you are telling me telling us we should appreciate nature together [Music] now the question is a young man I was within Zimbabwe I thought he had put some stuff foreign foreign keep your hair and very much like yours yes be yourself better Charlie be you better don't copy somebody else don't copy the Fashions of the world so you could be after others you understand what I'm saying be yourself that is okay some people naturally they they have a bald head body and they love teachings you're not the message foreign and Naturally Speaking they love cutting it naturally they like having nothing so they try to embed that in the message so when a brother raises to feel [Music] they want to be like foreign [Music] there's a balance you have to strike give me the next slide see this one now what do you see God has naturally created a monkey with its own lipsticks and you find women to go and want to be like monkeys get their lips I even don't know the men that matter these kind of videos how they think yeah foreign now you might not like it but if the word says it if the word shows us the way and we are following the World Series God has gathered nature let me put it this way there are even some things what do you need to we don't need the word the Bible the words to tell us what I'm preaching today that's why I'm not even reading too much scriptures the Bible says doesn't even nature itself teach you foreign go back to the last one go back to it go back together yes now see this one and you find boys rushing to love girls and then you expect a woman with those kind of things to raise your children in the fear of God you are also deceived you think you will have the family that he wants to whatever is inspiring she's trying to copy this and you will find that the spirit of this it might even be the one ruling look at the next the next one I'm seeing my time is up so let me let me try to wind up now look at this laughs are you here you say what is that pasta It's just shoes this is not just shoes whoever made it and whoever buys it has a at the speed of delusions to try and copy the other one is not good enough you should have feet like like the hoofs over of a horse so they will buy these ones and they will begin walking foreign foreign I I had to put this picture so you can be confused let me ask what is that what is this you see others yeah this is a snake right actually this is a man with a tattoo very very nice looking but we are not called to take up those kind of to mimic something so why that's why the Bible does not allow people to use tattoos but that was the Lord rejecting the truth and then they go for this they are not happy with what God has made them everybody that's your answer that's why they do tattoos because they are deluded Satan to want what they are not and you find out everywhere you may not have tattoos but if you don't appreciate yourself you are not different from a man that is everyone um and then the devil will give you all up standing now but if you take God this way there's something that the father has not planted in you come he will approach it out I bet you could jump if it's a sickness that is making you tiny God and God Alone even if the sin is making you fat and then you go and see yourself this is show all these younger man is about to get married I will not get tired who told you that the white are the one who are beautiful amen Brothers amen Brothers a a good man will look for character not skin color or massage Pastor when you're preaching to us you are telling us that we should not look for beauty [Laughter] lies in the hands of the beholders [Music] sister and when they come for you when the white ones will not take them away [Music] hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord give me the next slide next slide have you seen that what's the difference is the similarities you find a woman trying to mimic an ego you find them with all those longer nails like what you see there see God gave an eagle such Nails in order for it to get its praise you don't need actually sister with those kind of nails you can't even eat if you eat you can easily become sick I wonder how they even keep hygiene with us and the devil is destroying a generation I say we as Believers of this world let us stay above these Spirits for we cannot be overtaken by them praise the name of the Lord living a life you can now decide what general they want to be somebody it comes from what we have been saying how can a good understanding man or massage to believe they are a woman how can a sober woman what God intended for them and you find them listen church because I'm reaching my climax when we get done with this getting posters foreign foreign [Music] when I was in South Africa I told the people you see because in South Africa they're like almost in the US but in Uganda we think yeah we are still okay but let me tell you we are not okay there is absence they themselves why watch because this is their Heritage before the bread comes down they're going to take the take over the whole world um they're the ones with the money sister foreign [Music] he is he is interested to pervert their minds even in school children their mind will become perverted in our society that's why he told women to wear trousers so that they can think their men you thought in the beginning it was a style because there is a wrong speed behind it started by saying women have rights and then finally they say yeah is the spirit of delusion and it's the Looting the whole generation listen to me no one will survive okay that have the mark of Christ is the only thing that will make us the spirit of delusion mankind you can now decide whether they are a cow a monkey a donkey a lizard or something [Music] um someone saying for me I've discovered that since I was born I'm feeling uh like a monkey I feel pretty from beginning with today I am registering in the government as a man again [Music] you think I'm joking it is already in the world it's a strong delusion is imagine terrorism I'm going to nail this properly Generations as long as they have consented so whether we are married or not um you have no rights kissing a man a woman who is not your husband or wife you have no rights sleeping with someone else's wife because whoever is not yet married wife or husband someone else is theirs and if you are the one don't marry them the Bible says to you young men and women if you burn boom what's up that is the Bible solution Bible that's why Rwanda married foreign [Music] no brother this is the word so you find a pasta that's why you hear the stories that's why here days of the voice sisters alone you have no business we believe in Holiness it is not the same tomorrow you will build our society [Music] think about marriage think about foreign I don't believe that they're just chicken I don't believe that but Pastor you're not married that we should take the word the way it is [Music] the Bible says I don't believe that kind of thing two mature adults can decide to do anything else tell somebody that's alive you see they say anybody can believe whatever they like as long as they believe it they are right no that's a lie baptism baptizing babies he's alive no matter how many people do it baptizing babies I say this is for there is only one baptism of water um now the Bible says any other thing is a lie of the devil Guru all right I have two more slides now okay of two scriptures Romans 1 21. because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither we are thankful but became vain in their own imaginations and their foolish Hearts heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools [Music] [Music] the professor they profess to be wise and the Bible says they became fools brother foreign and they begin you know you know it's all right to have those nails [Music] they profess to be wise but they became full Neighbors you see why am I preaching this because we have a responsibility to tell you these things it's a it's a responsibility given to us by God the spirit of delusions taking over mothers and and people are becoming fools and it says their foolish Hearts was taken away imagination could take here is what it is Lord we have sinned all night and taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word is there you are with faith believing that God would fulfill his word faith would put some there singer yeah I want to finish with this church Hallelujah man we are believers we are like Peter throwing a pet I said we are believers tell somebody Hallelujah if we believe I tell your neighbor I'm a Believer don't worry just keep it wrong and when Peter had what Jesus said he said we have been cast because if there was no fish God would have put fish there who can do all things the Bible says I am fearful I can do do you know if there is no jobs for you God can make you create some jobs even for others the God of this message he specializes he is not looking for possibilities to accomplish what he is saying he is looking for believers those who believe what he says it is now time [Applause] while I'm speaking that I'm having many Revelations which I can't even imagine Hallelujah it is time rather begin playing something come on musicians which is time Church you know our vision of course welcome to be accomplished if you stick in the world which I said in the beginning if you stick in the naturals is going to be natural enough because the God of this message what he has done for others he can do for you what is impossible that man cannot do it that's why we are believers amen even what what is so
