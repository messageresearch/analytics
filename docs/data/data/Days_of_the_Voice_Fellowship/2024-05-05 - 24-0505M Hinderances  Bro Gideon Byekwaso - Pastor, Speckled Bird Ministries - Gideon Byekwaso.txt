amen [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen you may be seated praise the lord well I want to greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen how many are happy this morning well if you're not happy you're in the wrong place amen I'm sure Pastor Gideon you can see the smiles on the people's you know when when the Elder is in the camp all the children are always happy amen uh this precious message uh came in Uganda in the early 80s and uh there's been men of God who have held this message very many of them we cannot enumerate all of them that God has used over the years but there's been different Generations there is the first fast Generations uh We've hosted people like Pastor I here where are part of that first generation of the people that go got this message and started spreading it and God used them mightly Pastor Gideon I if I'm wrong he will correct me I think he's from the second generation uh after the first then came from the second brother sh can you please correct the error the the echo so he uh comes from the second generation uh of the ministers and uh we come from maybe the third or the fourth I don't know but I think we come after his generation so to us he's an elder I personally did not come directly to the message through his ministry but by proxy have come out of his ministry because they ministered before us I remember there was a time the first time I saw brother Gideon I was inana my my pastor used these words he said there is a brother coming because I was from the Anglican church and I was leaving with a bishop so he told me there is a brother coming if it was like in your church he would have been our Bishop so I was expectant brother when I was when he mentioned that and when he came I was disappointed the reason why I was disappointed he did not have the big gown in the angc church they used to have big big guns the big Rings he did not have a big ring he did not have a big gown but when he started preaching I noticed why the my pastor had said that and so um I was immensely blessed at that time I think I was uh had just believ the message then and so we are so honored this morning to have a precious Pastor Gideon uh that has come to be with us and encourage us uh it is a sacrifice on his part because as you know he just lost his associate and actually this week earlier he told me he had gone to he just arrived late last night so I mean you can imagine the sacrifice and so I want you to put in your 100% uh because God has something for us this morning uh God has used our brother in a mighty way um I think I I would be justified to say it publicly that he has the biggest church of the message Ina and and we know in the message we do not really count numbers but the reason I said that is to look at the eort the sacrifice the labors that he has put in over the over the years and so when he comes just know all that labor experience wisdom anointing you are going to be a partaker of amen so without wasting more time I'll just um ask you to stand and uh we sing a little chorus as we are preparing ourselves to invite amen once again we are honored may God bless you so when I came to cala the the very first person I met [Music] met was Pastor Gideon and um at that time we were not too sure what the Lord wanted us to do we want we knew but we were not too sure but I know one thing that if you want access if you want access the seed to Ser for that is hor and if God has honored a man in a city and I want access in the city that City then I'm going to honor the man that God has given us and he encouraged me he said you go and start we are behind you and I'm so honored because of that so feel free Pastor Gideon to rebuke to teach to uh to instruct whichever the holy spirit will lead you amen I'd like us to sing a little chorus you're worthy of it and if you can just close your eyes and in your heart ask the Lord to speak to you worth all [Music] you are worthy of it [Music] all for from you are all things to you are all things you deserve the glory lift up your hands tell him now you are worthy of it all [Music] you are worthy of it all Hallelujah yes Lord Jesus from from you are all do you are all things you deserve the glory oh lift up your voice one more time tell him now you are worthy of it all you are are the of it all for from you are all things bless you do you are all [Music] things you are [Music] to you are all you deserve the [Music] glory amen let us pray loving kind Heavenly Father we humbly approach your throne of Mercy we ask you to forgive all our sins and all our trespasses and make us acceptable in your sight we have come to receive help from you in every aspect and in every dimension of our life for we are helpless without so Lord may you have mercy and meet our needs and speak to our hearts and lift us up in the up in the spirit causing us to be in the positions that you have called us to be in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savor amen praise [Music] God you may be seated I greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ I feel good to be here I feel at home and I believe I'm not a stranger yeah although some of your faces are new to me but not all and brothera will not find it hard to interpret uh I came with a few people my wife I'll ask you my wife to stand that is my wife then I came with my daughter Grace Grace she's a daughter of my elder brother then I came with Quinton qu brother Quinton I saw him sing I think online and and of course I didn't come with Becky but I know her so I'm happy to find her around uh as the pastor has mentioned uh from way day yeah I I had a trip in Wednesday or Thursday Thursday sometimes I get so tired even my mind gets so tired so exhausted so we went to BU how many know where is it is in Masa some part of mas greater Massacre so and again we went deep inside in the remote they PL coffee and bananas in the same Plantation so we came back yesterday night we have been uh was invited by a Pentecostal Church uh who also invited their some of their close pastors I introduced to them the message one major basic doctrine that I had to handle was baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and it goes with godhead and they all excitedly received it so uh they want more they are very hungry people what I learned is that even among denominations there are some real genuine Christians they love God with all their heart but only they have not made the truth that's what I realized so uh Pastor Talma thank you very much for the invitation and for those kind words that you have spoken about me as you introduced me thank you very much may the Lord bless you so much and truly is consistent with his words when he came to start a church in C he told me he believes that God has given me a blessing in this city and he needed to um honor me and respect me for that and he has repeated it here and I believe God is sharing the blessing with him mean to him uh I can see how uh Dynamic this ministry is and how it's growing very fast you can see already the blessing of the Lord upon this ministry and I believe it's growing into Great Heights well we were friends before even before he started here even when he was ministering in Ethiopia I think I'm one of the very few Elders that invited to to preach there to preach in his church in Ethiopia that is before he relocated back here his wife is my daughter yeah she's she's in that category I have a number of daughters I have a number of daughters Believers and she's one of them just like Becky so uh I'm just at home this is my church amen uh as he mentioned that uh I I rank in the second Elder generation I believe it is true uh either second or third amen yes but the Lord has given me Grace and I've been serving him and we have done a few things here and there and by the grace of God we have influenced the nation with the gospel yesterday as I was preaching among those P Pentecostal people I was shocked to find a number some of them already had heard about my Ministry one of the pastors told me he was following my preaching on radio even before he accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and and one of the young people actually the pastor uh the pastor son who was who was in the doing the instruments he told me I I've I've been watch I have some clips of yours yeah on YouTube I've been following you so I realized the grace of God so uh by the grace of God uh we have put some little uh contribution uh to this nation influencing it with a message I'm saying little because there is a lot that is undone there are many who have not even heard about this place we pray for the grace of God to us and for the generation for you people to come and take over for amen as the put it you learned of the tragedy that befil us losing the my assistant pastor he was more than that we started the ministry history together and we moved together a very composed solid man in character and in the knowledge of the word and but the Lord took him home but God does no mistakes he knows the why he had to go at this time I remember that time I put on my status WhatsApp that he has left me when I needed him most but that is a human being God knows why he had to go so that is just the other week so my church still is in the process of mourning and and healing yes last Sunday I was to be here but that was crazy because that's the same week we buried him we bu him on Monday on Sunday it was a funeral service on Monday we bued him the following Sunday not being with a church it was bad it would look as if it will look bad but more than that I had a vis who came to comfort us a pastor who had come all the way from Kenya and I could not leave him alone and in that condition that atmosph so I I realized even very late had already advertised that I was going to be here I called him and I apologized I really I really took time apologizing and I thank God he understood me and he granted me the permission and I asked him to ask you for apology which I believe he did so thank you very much for understanding and accommodating uh me in that aspect amen so even now after this service I run very fast Sister Sister Rebecca I'm sorry I will not be able to to stay behind to have some lunch around because of that reason I feel that church there needs uh comforting comforting amen do you love God Amen God bless you all uh you can stand now for the reading of the word I'm not going to speak uh for long I believe and I'm going to speak something very simple yes a simple sermon from a tired man and I pray you'll bear with me let us read from the book of second Timothy 2:3 you are there already thank you for being that quick amen thou therefore endure hardness hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that worth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier catch the word entanglement and then we can also read Galatians 5 verse1 to S stand first therefore in the Liberty wherein Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with a yoke of bondage behold I po say unto you that if he be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing for I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a data to do the whole law Christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision neither circumcision ath anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love ye did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth for [Music] may the Lord add blessing to the to the reading of his word we may be SE I want to take a subject that I'll call him hindrances yeah hindrances things which hinder I think that's what they call it something like I preach this sermon in and that's how they were putting it amen I will introduce it with a few quotes here he said you'll be given two signs he said you will be given two sides as was the prophet Moses he said one side will be that you will detect diseases through your hand when the people contact you well you'll be able to tell them what disease they have through a supernatural discernment and then said if you'll be sincere then it will come to pass that you will tell the people the secret the secrets of their hearts and the things that they've done in life that might have hindered their healing and so [Music] forth look at that word hindered their healing now who was speaking this I believe many of you know but we have a lot of new people who may not know all the details and the history of the [Music] message so this is the Angel of the Lord when when he met brother Bram in the cave to give him a commission to take the ministry of Divine [Applause] Healing around the world this angel had been speaking to him from childhood from when he was 3 years old amen h i don't I will not go into details but he spoke to him again when he was seven remember when he was seated at a popular tree and then that wind came and and blowing into the branches he turned there a voice spoke from there said never drink Never Smoke never defile your body in any way for when you grow older there's a great work for you to do he heard the voice very well he ran home Hally but and mother thought maybe had been beaten by a snake and but brother for him he knew what had happened said mother man spoke to me in that tree his words were very clear he told me this this this this he said I will never pass by that tree by that tree again and the same voice that spoke to him the same voice that spoke to him when he was 3 years old and also now on Ohio River when he was baptizing his first converts that when he reached the 17th person that that great light appeared the the pillow fire the star in Broad day light you see a light that outshines the sun is a very strong light and then came from there as John the Baptist was sent for around the first coming of Jesus Christ your Min for second coming but all through you know he had met a lot uh of uh reactions to that voice and to that Supernatural that followed him some people told him it was Satan some people told him it was God and he was wondering if it is certain how come it's keeping me from doing wrong and how come whatever he tells me comes to pass and the time came I said I want to know clearly perfectly the purpose of my life and then he went to seek God he told his wife have this money I'm going to seek God I'm seeking an answer from God if he does not answer me I will not come back you know what how you will decide thereafter you was so desperate and determined to seek God for that answer or not come back I think it's good good for us to seek God that way with such a determination and we mean business and when he while he was there in that cave I think he didn't spend there two days I think he prayed through the day and through the night and toward morning he had someone walking a very heavy set being and he turned to see the person and when he turned to see he saw that pill of fire as we have it you know it and then the man spoke say fear not my angel sent from the presence of the Lord now he says that was the first time for him to see the person of that voice because before he was hearing the voice but I never seen the person but when he saw when he had the voice fear not that was a familiar [Music] voice the same voice that I started speaking to him when he was three and again seven and again on a on a high river and now he's seeing the very person of the voice so he the one who spoke to him words and more but our focus is on these words you be given two signs as was prophet Moses amen you will detect the diseases through your right hand it would be good to go into details of that gift how it operated but since since it is not the subject and we don't have much time we shall not go into and he said then you'll be able to tell them what diseases they have through a supernatural discernment and if you'll be sincere then will come to pass that will tell the people the secrets of their hearts that is a second sign and the things that they have done in life that might have hindered their healing we are talking about hindrances here is healing hindered a supernatural gift may be there the word will is there promising you healing and even you have the fa the person praying for you has Faith but there are some things You' have done in life that are hinder hindering the healing that however much you pray how much you can be Anointed The Devil feels he has a legal right to stay there because there are things you have done that brought him into your life the things you did that opened the Fortress because as Believers we are living under Fortress we are living under protection but you can do some things and you open that Fortress and the devil enters and takes over and when he has taken over he feels he has the right to stay there only confession when you confess and repent of that thing confess that wrong under the blood of Jesus Christ the devil has no any right anym to stay there he will live so brother BR by the gift of God no no matter he was very successful in healing he could even see why that devil is there and why he's not leaving and then when he reveals it to you the very thing you know you know what you did you know when you did maybe it is it's even haunting you but you keep suppressing and covering but you know it and it tells you what you did you know it is God and then as you confess and then he prays very easily the devil lives praise God so hinderance of healing I'm just backing my subject and another quote here did you ever see a grain of corn planted in the ground and let a stick fall over it it will grow crooked any Vine anything that grows up will because something has hindered it it's a good seed perfect seed but something is hindering you so it grows CR something has hindered that's what the matter with our Pentacost of faith today we've let too many things Hinder e the faith that we have taught the Holy Spirit that's been living in us we've let too many things looking at somebody else hinderance another quote all right come lady this was in the line of De everybody real reverent look here what's the cause of see there are there is several things can do it but you know if you go to the doctor and he would examine your ears he would say now here the for instance he says the nve in the eardrum is dead well doctor what killed the ner I don't know the only thing I know is what I can see but I know the nve itself is dead in the in other words you can't hear because the n is dead is not passing the sound to reach the eard Dr that's what the matter with you that's why you don't you don't hear well what killed the N I don't know why did it kill all over Why didn't it kill it all over its body like if there is a transparent band around my hand can see through that maybe you have a transparent cover on your hand you cannot see it the eyes can go through it and you don't see it because the eyes can go through transparent because it is transparent my hand uh my hand would turn black and blue and swell up well the doctor might come and say now the circulation stopped in in here he will see the blood come and when he reaches here it can't pass so the hand this side is swen and even turn col because there is something holding amen if it's transparent I can't see it I don't know he he may I don't know he may say I don't know he can't feel it that's the only thing that anyone can work on is what you can see feel of some of the senses will declare will declare well now here is what it is is the devil you see why he's calling it a transparent band because the devil a doctor cannot see a demon a demon will come and hold there a doctor will not see it but its effect will be [Music] seen he will see that the blood cannot pass but what is hindering it he will not see amen that's why Divine Healing works much better than medical healing because sicknesses behind sickness is is the devil and the devil canot and the doctors cannot see the demon but for us we can see when we see there is a sickness we know there is a devil there and we have power and authority amen when we pray that demon goes amen and then when it lives then where it is holding that place now is free here here is what it is it's the devil now Jesus said it was and you you believe him speaking in the Bible terms said well the de Spirit come out of the man he couldn't hear the de Spirit the doctor the doct the doctor can't tell why the N is dead why it's why it's a demon sitting there yeah it's it's cut off the hearing of the ear now if I wanted my hand to rece receive life again is to lose this transparent band yeah it has to be removed if it's not if if nature is not hindered why it will function all right if nature is not I believe this helps us even when we are praying for the sick oh when we praying for cases and circumstances we must know that we're not fighting and wrestling against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers the devil can come and get a grip of your husband he can take a grip of your mother of your father of your school teacher of your wife they be they behave you know un reason they become complicated and for you now you you set your arrows against this person this is a very evil man he hats me doesn't me I don't want to come where he is but it is not him that child is not the one but there is a transparent B There is a spirit you cannot see it with natur your eyes but it's the one influencing the stess is manifesting so we must know the things amen so if nature is not hindered why it will function all right is that right well the transparent band has got everything cut off and so nature can't function move the might not be well right then but it will get well give it a chance and if the devil is gone out the man can hear that now becomes active again and the Bible said it was a spirit when the deaf and dumb Spirit went out of the of the man speak and hear Jesus gave us power over every principality every Power Of Darkness as a Believer you have power over the devil and the devil knows that you have the power over him just like a robber knows that police has power over him he able the robber is able to see a police officer and there that one is they will flee they run away he's able to look at the BGE he's able to look at the uniform even you spiritually you are dressed different spiritually the is able to see you and he knows the kingdom you represent the demon said Paul we know so Paul was known in hell we know Jesus we know but who are you those people we not born again but for you you are born again the demon will say that girl I know I know that girl I know that boy I know hell knows you so when you tell a demon live it will live praise be the name of you see now hindrance the ear is not hearing because and now is being hindered a demon is sitting there the heart is not functioning well because the demon is Hing I will not forget h a certain case in our church excuse me it sounds funny but you just excuse me is for illustration a certain aged man came to the pulit he says in his testimony that one time he was suffering from diabetes he went to some other Christians they prayed for him he got he but there is a member on his body that remained kicked off disabled and that was his manhood so one Sunday he comes in the prayer line I didn't know what he was suffering sometimes I ask people what they suffering from sometimes I don't so I prayed for him and he went he said at night when he was sleeping here is the point he saw himself passing urine as you know men do it and then he saw a snake this is the point now he saw a snake come through the urine come out and then when he woke up he was now okay his man that had been off for long now it was okay exactly fitting with what we are studying here so that snake is so is the one which was somewhere holding now any organ of your body that's what happens when the devil enters there holding and disables it and hinders it from functioning maybe the eyes maybe the nose is not smelling because the snake is there a demon is there but we have power over that we have power over that demon with prayer the devil will go the snake will go and when it goes you will be free that is Divine Healing sometimes you take time to realize because if the place has been held for long and it's been paralyzed for now the band is been Los it may remain in that condition that part that place there may remain paralyzed for some before it realizes life again but for you now because you feel still you not functioning the way you start doubting the prophet told us when you doubt he said your faith cast that demon out but your unbelief will call it back so remain believing no matter how long it takes you say when the pastor prayed for me that this case will settle no matter how painful I'm feeling no matter how much I'm feeling I believe I was healed his St some heal maintain your faith you will maintain your Liberty even your salvation you get it by believing and by confessing praise be the name of now hindrances can happen to us in many ways praise be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah now as a Believer let us look at uh you are what you are as a child of God [Music] do you know you are a daughter of God do you know you are a son of God yes you are brother if you have accepted Jesus Christ as your lord and Savor you believe and you're trusting your life for for its salvation on him you have eternal life you are a child of God it doesn't matter how long you take not feeling it not realizing it praise be the name of the Lord because sometimes it takes long you are still battling with a flesh and sometimes you don't feel like yourself it is not by feeling Jesus never ask anybody do you feel it he said Do You Believe do you believe you're a child of God if you believe so then you are a child of God praise be the name of Lord and the seed of God is in you and the seed of God is in you if you're a child of God the seed of God is in if you're a child of God of eternal life is there if you believe if you're a child of God in you there is a SE there is a power there is a potential that can get you out of the amen because you are a child of God the of God is in yous whatsoever is born of God it overcomes the world Maybe the time you are being oppressed you are being oppressed and even some habits are still disturbing you you have not yet got overcoming power I want to encourage you don't lose [Applause] hope you are a child of God the seed in you the seed in you you should continue confessing and even believing hallelujah amen you will get Victory the victory you think that you must reach amen now if you a child of God what does it mean here is a simple formula that you know very well that if you're a child of God it means you are a god do you believe that to be a child of God is to be an offspring of God and the child of is amen a child of a cow is a cow what about a child of God he's a god he's a God Amen no wonder you called a Christian Jesus said I am the two Vines you are the branches what is the branch of a mango a mango if I bring you a branch of mang and say what is this say that's a mang isn't that right so if you're a branch of Jesus Jesus is a vine and a branch then what are you you are a little Jesus little Christ you are Christ you are a Christian no wonder Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them they can they can impersonate gifts they impersonate healing they can impersonate this and that but because they are not a seed of God because they are not a seed of God they have not received the seed of God what is the seed of God the seed of God is the word of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and the Very word that God said in the beginning be let there be let there be and other seeds came from that word in other words this one here came from the word the seed of this was produced by the word no wonder you can look at a plant and you see the Bible because this is an offspring of amen but at the end of it all God himself he gave birth to himself he gave birth to himself in Adam Son of God now child gives birth to you that's right amen that's right your child gives birth to you because your child is your seed isn't it now if they giving birth they are multiplying you now Adam was a child of God he had to give birth his children was to bring forth God's children that were in The Book of Life he was to produce that but he failed to do so because he fell and what he produced was hybrid said every person born on Earth be the pop of Rome the bishop W he said he born he was born between Satan and E because that meeting in the in the garden between Satan and EV it it created a formula he the word of God I breed it with unbelief with wisdom evil wisdom a little of that hybrid the word of God it changed the original formula it made a formula and through that formula we come into the world that's why every man born between sat and Eve no wonder you born a sinner brother God has does not condemn him for being a sinner but he will any for remaining a sinner put away for him to be born again why you must be born again because the original birth has a problem therefore it has to be repeated the right way the original way you you were to be born by the one by the word brother said Jesus was that se that if was to bring forth if was to bring forth Jesus and then Jesus would bring forth you and me but she failed why she failed Mary did hallelujah amen because Mary when the word was spoken to her said uhhuh just tell me a bit a little how is it going to happen it will happen like this the power of the most high will overshadow you now you have received the word now spoken to you the word receive it now the power come you Quicken that and there a child will be formed and she yes I see Amen Let It Be unto me according to your word she believe the word pated word of God and that word formed baby do you know that's one of the greatest Mysteries that have been revealed to us by Malachi no wonder the Bible is a new book to us the world is saying hail Mary Mother of God how can a human being give birth to God remember we were to be Redeemed by a spotl blood perfect spotless stainless BL because if you're watching a d cross in water can it be clean so a blood of a sinner can it cleanse a sin so every human race I mean every human being since the fall in Eden the blood the human blood line was contaminated and in the noral bath mother contributes and father contributes and you find a child bearing the traits of the all the traits of the father because they both contribute mother contributes egg and father contributes seed and then a child is if Mary contributed an egg that would pass the contamination of the human race of the Fallen adamic blood blood so she was not to contribute anything this Redeemer was to be spotless stainless pure blood so what happened amen the word of God that was spoken to her created an egg and created a seed and the Egg and the seed formed reacted brought for a child who is the mother of the word who is the father of the SE the word Jesus Christ was the word made flesh praise be the name of the Lord and that's how we were to be born also we were to be born by the world but now we were Bound by the lust of the flesh no wonder we come into the world with an evil nature that's why we must be born again you see when David Fell you remember what he did but when he was repenting in Psalms 51 he said beh behold I was s in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceived me she conceived me David was not born out of adultery no he was born under the family father and mother Mar people but he says I was SE in iniquity and in sin I was conceived that's the very reason why we must be born again so when Jesus came here he was that perfect SE fully from the word an offspring of the word Jesus was an offspring of the word so he was the word in flesh praise be the name of the Lord he was the word and in him was eternal life praise God that's why he said no man can take away my life I have power to lay down and I have power to have I received on my father in this law the law of life that is in me I'm a never die person never die hallelujah amen never V never die never I have power to let down to re destroy this [Applause] Temple break it in days it again because the fourth day canot find me in can't geten amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah no man spoke like that no man ever SP like that no man will ever speak like that only Jesus could speak like that because in him was life in him is immortality hallelujah amen oh the great men and women have been defeated by death but here is a mar here is a March to the Grave Hallelujah I cannot die he could not he could walk on the water he could defy every law of nature because he was an offspring of super he could defy the law of nature water turn water into he could multiply bread and F tens of thousands of people hallelujah he has all the power to him belongs all the glory that's why every knee must bow and every tongue must conf that Jesus is in him is eternal life oh hallelujah hallelujah glory be to and you happen to know you a child of God you are a child of God you born of that incorruptable and Jesus Christ he SP three and a half years showing that seed in the hearts of these men and these women three and a half years sowing sowing sowing pure pure word of God hallu and finally he told them if a grain of seed if a grain of wheat Falls not in the ground and die it remains alone but when it falls in the ground and it dies then it can bring forth many after its kind Hallelujah because here was one man was that with that quality with that quality he had his friends around Peter James John Matthew Mary Susan many of those he wanted to see them having the same quality he knew the only way it can happen he becomes in them the life that was in him was to come into them and water the seed the word said that they have received hallelu says the Holy Spirit which was in Eden it was there to water the seed that God had spoken So Adam came forth from the seed and after being quickened by the holy spirit amen now Jesus The Original Seed is here the second Adam and brother you see in every seed there is that heart of a seed like look at Ma he has that heart there he said that is the G of life that is the gem of life if that thing that heart is eaten by some insect if you bu that seed it will never come up so Jesus Christ amen in him was the Holy Spirit the very G of life his friends he has given them the seed he has given them the seed but that seed it must be water a seed without water it cannot germinate praise God the holy spirit is the water that quickens the sea praise be the name of the Lord to Quicken it to all that is in it so when Jesus died at the cross that seed bust wi and the water came out and on the door Pentecost that water Came Upon them and it watered that seed amen am and they were quickened amen and when they moved out it was like Jesus in multiplication it was Jesus in multiplication silver God I have none silver and God I have none but what I have I give you the name of Jesus rise and and they turned the world upside down that was Jesus the original perfect seed multipli that is what God wants God wants to be surrounded by men and to be surrounded by men and women who are nothing but a multiplication of Jesus he that believeth in me the works that I do shall do them great works that is what we need that's what it means to be Christian and when that original Church fell God promised I will restore I restore and what has he done in the restoration he has sent a faithful messenger faithful to his word a mouthpiece of [Applause] God the mouthpiece of God God could not use a theologian God could not use just a it's not by flesh and blood but a prophet is a mouthpiece of God Amen In Those Old Times in the king's palaces the Queens would be kept and protected and served with UNS men who have no seed they keep that Queen they keep her for her husband that's a prophet a prophet is a un he cannot pass his own seed but his faithful to keep the bride for the seed of the husband but theologians they have their own SE to pass that's why the Bible calls her a great hot and she has daot those are the denominational churches their wombs is not clean it's not pure it does not receive seed of man but this women they keep receiving SE from different men you ask them where does it say that Mary went to heaven with without dying they say it was said by Pope Pas in 6 they have a child of [Music] and a child of another pop and a child of another Po and pcal denominations are no different and the anglicans and the Baptists and all but for us we don't have the seed of William Bram the seed we have is the seed of Jesus Christ the prophet is a mouth peace Isaiah didn't have a piece of his a seat of his own when he said a virgin conce if you ask him what do you mean how can it be has never happened he would tell you I also don't know but what I know that the same spirit that always inspires he the one who Moved My T say so a prophet is a mouth of God so in this age God out to send a mouthpiece and through that mouthpiece he passed his seed and it is pure no wonder the angel had to protect him from childhood Never Smoke never drink defile your body because when you grow older there's a special work for you to do you're going to be a you're going to be housing to house God to speak through your lips and then brother brah said do you see what he said in Isaiah 96 he say that the son is born to the son is given us and the government shall be upon his shoulders his Shall be Called wonderful celor the Mighty God the Prince of Peace the Everlasting father you see the Garment the Garment will be upon his shoulders the Garment of this son shall be upon his shoulders and who is his shoulders the bride you are the body of Jesus Christ he is the head you are the body and the strongest part of a human being is shoulders so the strongest part of God is on Earth I mean on Earth the strongest part of God on Earth is the bride Hallelujah his government his strength is you the Garment shall be upon his [Music] fake government we are the government F government we are the [Applause] government in Kenya there is a tribe that tribe they very proud very proud they know themselves there was a time they was going to go through was likely to go through and man I'm told when they would enter taxi or a bus they will tell you get get up that the government May SE the government has arrived get off the government May now even us hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah whever we reach when we reach everything must give way the government to go through fake government we are the government hallelujah hallelujah find them rting they are putting pals up the government we are the government government has arrived tell every demon government give for the government give for the government we are the government the B the government of Jesus will be on our shoulders and we are his shoulders we are his body no he us whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you lose on Earth shall be lose in heaven brother said Al the the claims it although the claims you know the theot she says she has the keys to open to lose and to bind but she is coping what does not belong to her there are two people who own that position that when you bind it is bound Heaven binds and when you lose it Heaven loses because your God is government down here amen I'm told in Cong there was some it was a war or some family and then there was a Pentecostal church that took days of fasting and pray and message people were their neighbors and they wer praying and fasting and go told the Pentecostals go tell those people prophecy broke up and those people to pray for when they pray they are the ones here if my people called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face behold I will hear from Heaven There are people who pray and God will hear his the problem you don't pray you must know that you are the ones who and heaven will [Applause] happen brother said brother Bram said he said the body operates by the head imagine if my head was flesh and my body was concrete if the head tells it move it the information cannot go through because they're not the same so how can Jesus be the head of the he cannot those denominations they hear what their says what the pass is what they follow but there are people in the land they don't care who you are whether you are Bishop whether you're Pastor whether you're overseer you canot you can only convince them when you saw them the word they ask you where is it in the word Hallelujah because Jesus is their husband and Jesus is the word those are the people to whom he is head and His Garment is upon those shoulders so brother brah said because head the same material with body if head is flesh body is concrete they cannot coordinate so there must be a body which is flesh of the flesh the head is flesh the body is flesh same material the body is word and the head is W the body is W the head is wor we are a worthy church amen amen hallelujah and then he said he said do you see why I have been so zous so kind and the WhatsApp and the Facebook Facebook and those soul short videos that they throw for you all the time on Facebook Facebook and they dirty and they're filthy and you keep your eyes on them throughout the night and you find some young people here doing no one is dozing here I'm giving an example you find them doing on because they didn't sleep the whole night they watching those D things they don't want that they

children of Israel these guys thought they can also survive where these on survived that was a trap for them and as they follow them they drone there every one of them perish there brother sister it

of that's where they were but God got them planting the vine and where to plant it it was God's Vine precious Vine but that precious Vine it was in the furnace of and in that vine there was a Moses there was a Joshua there was a David there was a there was there was a Paul there was a Peter and there was aam even there was Jesus because Jesus had to be born through that V all of it were there all those potentials all those attributes were under that furnace of it had to be gotten out and be taken to the rightful ground in other words in you there is resurrection there is life there is eternal life there is healing that is raising the dead there is such a power that can create another world it is all in you but it may be under some fruit of Master [Music] hindering you hindering the word from manifesting Psalms 8 verse 8 thou Hast brought a vine out out of Egypt thou has cast out the Heathen and planted [Music] it that vine the rightful place for it was Canan not Egypt so for you you a child of God in you you have received the seed of God the word of God incorruptable but if you plant it if you if you place it in [Music] Egypt and it tramped it under the fruit of sin and football sports social media you are ever there you obsessed and possessed something precious a in Egypt hallelujah hallelujah if they stayed in Egypt Elijah could not come up amen even Jesus would not be born in Egypt even this salvation we enjoying could not come out amen now in Fon 1 ver 6 that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the knowledge by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus amen the same words which I want us to see here by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you every good word in them there was Moses there was Joshua there was David There Was Elijah there was Jesus there was Paul there was Peter brother there was the Bible all of it was buried there there was Resurrection it was in them there was the Mah it was in all the good things were in them but they were in the wrong place every good thing us every good that is in you the word you have receive can create another world it is a seed that will get you out of the ground if you are buried there and if the Rapture comes and you're still alive will give you a glorified body change the seed you have there in that word it can raise the dead make creers to walk raise the dead can create another world when brother br spoke those squir into existence he didn't call them from where they were hiding he created them from his word the squ which were not born by father by mother they were not born young and then had a chance to grow they never ate any food on Earth he spoke it and and shot it and took it home and ate it why because he's a child of God the child of God is a creator that se word that was in him in you and me that means we can create another world what can what can speak a squirrel what can speak a squirrel speak trees can speak grass can speak fish can speak crocodile can speak another word now that is in you but it can be hindered that those potentials those attributes that it will not be seen what we need today is not pray for more power you got enough power to make a new Earth what you need is Faith to use that power what you need is to control that life and live such a Godly life that when you ask God anything you know we have confidence in God of that we know that if we keep his Commandments he will withhold no good thing from us if we walk with him God working with us the power is there but you need one is life a Godly life is anac to your faith ungodly life a sinful life is an obstacle to Faith because as you come to pray the devil floods you the things you've been doing the things so you lose confidence but for you to create another world you don't need another Power you it shall not come from Heaven it's in you what you need is the faith and the good [Music] life living the life of the world now the first thing before we can have faith we've got to have some foundation for Faith there's got to be something behind it this is from the message the fundamental foundation for faith if you got to have if you have faith you need a foundation fundamental one now here is the foundation the foundation where you you can lay the faith where you can stand and move mountains do you ever think of those things along those lines we are human beings and what made us human beings what made us different from anything else us the human beings no matter what state a man is in he's yet a Son of God no matter how sinful he is how far away he is he is a fallen son but yet he's a son God is his Creator God is his maker God God has bought him with a price he he may never reconcile himself to that he may never accept it it may never do him any good but yet he's a son and she's a daughter of God how many human beings are here say Amen you blessed you're the human being to be a human being means you are a child of God so we are Fallen children of God but for us now God has brought us back but the other human beings they also sons of God they may never reconcile themselves they never come back to that position they lost it and they will never come back to but for you you child of God who lost it as AAL son but you came back Hallelujah hallelu that's a fundamental Foundation now God when he made m in in the beginning he made him Superior to anything he gave him the the jurdic of everything on Earth to control everything he controlled the animal life he controlled the for Life the fishes of the sea he controll the winds he controlled the plant life he controlled everything man was made as a as a secondary God on Earth he was given the power to control things all elements of the earth that was Adam that was was given these great powers but then the power that he was given to make to make himself is where he fell Adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wild life he would obey him he could speak to the waters that what it was everything obey Adam now that is the beginning of man that's why God G him power over everything of the earth now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his listen man suffered from amnesia does no longer know what he is man suffered from Amnesia he lost his identity you remember the story of the EET it was still an eego perfect ego like all Eagles that fly the the skies but this one had lost the conscious of it so that is man uhhuh after losing this is how this this is Whata caused you to lose it after losing his relationship and friendship and fellowship with the father then he lost that and all all his great channels became clogged up and he couldn't get through he lost relationship fellow and friendship God wants you to be his friend like he said about Abraham can can I do anything down here without

do in his neighborhood God wants you to be his friend a friend like that and man relationship friendship relationship and fellowship God wants fellowship with you that's why you should not be all the time taken by a phone or by computer or by education or by work taken possessed obsessed mind taken even good things that you think are Essentials in life when they take you overtake you and you have

is a friend he needs your attention he needs your time he needs your fellowship amen that's what man lost when you lose friendship grieve not the spirit of God grieve not if you have a friend who always hurts you and offends you you start avoiding him so the Holy Spirit must not be hurt and offended and grieved by your conduct all the time you are smoking him with dat things that you that you watch that you hear that you speak that you do so he keeps getting offended all the time until he avoids you about Jesus he said Jesus said this is is my beloved Son in whom I'm well placed Hallelujah

through a prophetic utterance and admonished us Lord to repent and come back to our first place Lord everyone who is here today that had left their first place maybe cooled off a bit went back into

desire Lord I commit these people into your hands father Lord may you go with them as they will go and bless them Lord and continue helping them to overcome their [Music] hindrances that we will all together serve you better bless the giving that we are going to give now as we want to hor and bless the man of God everyone that will give bless them Father and may you give them an understanding that I will be able to give generously Grant it Lord may your presence continue on with us and bless our our brother Pastor Gideon that you have used today and may you continue G giving him [Music] strength as he lab us for you and travels wherever he goes Lord that you'll give him strength in his body and in his spirit and in his resolve to serve you and we also pray that you'll comfort him and the church during their time of grief at this time lord we just give you praise and we thank you for this service in Jesus name the Lord bless you we we will just uh prepare now to give our our love offering our pastor had to rush because they have another service at at [Music] Z but uh we can surely say that God has spoken to us amen how many can say God has spoken to me amen what you heard were not words of a man but we words of God and so we should take it serious really take it serious whatever we need to take out of the way we need to take it out of the way see young people there's a lot of potentials that you have a lot of potentials um a lot of things in us that the devil is hindering and you see let me tell you sometimes even those little things that you do or you are addicted to or attached to they may not necessarily take you to hell but they will hinder the purpose and will of God for your life here on Earth and you will not leave your purpose and you will answer for it because there is a time when we will all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ so we really need to take out all the hinderances and serve God with all our hearts and take out what is out in us a sinful life is obstacle to your faith and if you have no faith you can please God and if you can't please God you cannot receive certain times even prayers that things maybe for healing salvation whatever is it is that you need so we really need to watch [Music] that may God help us to do that is that your microphone work praise the Lord amen we're going to give an offering a pastor didn't even stay to have lunch so I'm requesting us to give generously because I know they they might break Branch somewhere to have lunch or something so I pray that we give generously so that you can be enough to take care of their L is that 100% amen amen and also today you notice where is Brother Martin you know sometimes the Holy Spirit nudges me to do things uh like today power was fine but you know spoke with Brother Martin and he too was being moved by the Holy Spirit on the said that shall we as shall we need a generator I said Brother Martin we will need a generator we need it stand by shall we get only the generator or also the fewer I said everything make everything stand by because we we will need it I was convinced we will need it and so when Brother Martin went to our Treasurer to get funds uh brother Joel called and asked I don't think we will need the generator because it's a lot of money whenever we have a generator it costs us 100,000 I told him uh we will need it brother and we indeed needed it we indeed needed it but because it was not ours maybe it is old it did not work as we would have wanted it to work so church we need a generator now I was speaking with one of the Deacons and I was encouraged to do what I want to do today there is a lot of things here that I've been deeping going down into my own Pockets to do most of the musical instruments the media department and these are millions of money speakers this and that and because of that it denies you of blessings since we started contributing for our land fund weekly how many can raise up their hand and God has supernaturally opened Financial doors since I started committed giving in a committed way how many here can say that okay now I'd like two or three people who have serious testimonies on the doors the financial doors God has opened since we started this I'd like you to come up here quickly and testify so that the others can know what God can do serious testimonies please come come here and give the testimony brother Isaac are we still streaming yeah this is good yes God bless you Church yeah for me the Lord has done a lot financi I needed money over [Music] 1.7 cing for some things and money mysteriously came it was not from my pocket no one had to lend me but money was coming I thank God for that this young man I know of his testimony how many read that testimony on WhatsApp that W I think it was Wednesday service he has been given to the land right out of the little he had practically giving out of no out of nothing the little he has and before we came to the service on Wednesday he came to me he had a need he's um trying to run certain things and he needed um how much the last amount you needed 700,000 690,000 and he told me Pastor I am stuck I have nowhere else I can I told him brother I wish you know me I don't have problems with M if I have it I give but I don't know but I would but I told him if God would open a door for you and you get 400,000 I'll give you the rest I'll sacrifice another place and I'll give you the rest and I spoke it jokingly like that and the brother came here in the service the need was for that that same day and it is a very serious need we're not speaking it because the time is not yet but at the right time we will tell you the and and and um as um we came in the service some of you were in the service you remember how God came down and visit us and encouraged us and even I remember there were words like um if you even if you need money Remember by the way I was preaching that I wasn't even having you in mind at that moment but he took it he seized it for himself and as soon as he went back home someone called him he said God spoke to me and said take this amount of money and send it to someone who needs it urgently and God brought him in his mind and the money was on that brother's account from another District he sent it to him when this one has not even called it to ask for how much money exactly what I told him if God will provide that so he came to me and he said God has provided his now what is yours where is it I had to look for it God is God God provides you see a principal God bless [Music] you God bless you CH I felt really I had to testify it's been long since I left I lost my job um I was working for an American Cancer societies and even some were some died because of so since then I've just been there I don't say that I I got a job now but we started giving F in Fe yeah and had many trials I was going through this and but I started giving I knew God would do something for I really trusted in God and I knew he would do it so one of like who had started giving money what weeks I was talking to my former I did not tell him I need money told me I'm going to give you for I just looked at him I was like thank you but I Contin doubting I was like not given me what to do that I'm going to be doing this and this and that you're going to be giving me month praise God for that me I told God I want a land I needed a l and I told him as I'm paying for this need to question that by June I need my [Music] land made it now I have my land and in I believe I'm more bless bless God bless you Sister she had told me of her need some time back and we were praying but praying alone in terms of things of money is not enough pray but give says give and ye shall receive and God gave her land when she didn't even have the money one last testimony last one bless you church I also want to thank God he provided for me some like when I finished my first when I to at my first graduation I had done a certificate in level I need to do a DI I but at the same moment the school introduced level three so I was like I would I would never Lev so because it was a lot of money now me whenever I was praying I was praying go to give me money and complete level two so God provided money at the end of last year so because level three was not was was very expensive and ever since they brought it no one has even joined like the minimum to do was like 12 million so no one was were thinking about it now I was but but I was saving money for tution okay it was Mone to to to to finish level so when when now when I when I was saving thaty it was still not enough so when they introduced the church land fund I remember Pastor I was preaching about sewing I got the Revelation to se so I got all the money that was on my account I put it in my group when I told Pastor he told me you are going to get I was like no he said he didn't say you're going to get he said said God is going to make you study I was like what so by I think a few like one month ago and they actually I was after setting it was sound after setting it someone I don't receive calls but I don't know how I don't know how I received this and someone's like hello this is this is this and this from from Dixon you you qualify to get a scholarship well when you go in the what they needed like the performance I don't qualify but I qualified and I'm among the few and I'm now studing Hallelujah brother Dixon is an electrical engineer anyone who is building you can use his Services they're studying it's a Canadian kind of course it's called PE yes very I think there is an there's an Arab who put an institution Ina and he called ITA what international po Technic yes they put up that course and they partner with PS so it's a very sophisticated course and it's an inter on International level so this scholarship is talking about it is a huge thing and and if he qualifies he can work anywhere in the world but he took because what he had was not enough what he needed he decided to S it in the ministry and God also opened the channel we are not talking we don't talk about betting this is not betting give this you get this what are saying is if you serve God faithfully and you take care of his business he will take care of your business he that is faithful in little is also faithful in much but if you say what I have is little and your team leader calls you brother what how much you even God will you know take you that God bless you brother go and finish your course and after that get a powerful job in Jesus name Hallelujah you see friends we are at a foundation the elders come and has encouraged us and he has encouraged us to he's told us that God will use us but for for God to use us we need to walk in the footsteps of those that walked before us when you hear brother brother gide the testimony of brother Gideon Ministry how they started and how poor they were but if you see now a church of several hundred people a Ministry with an impact of you know throughout the whole country and poor people that he started with are the ones that supported that Ministry not from you understand what I'm saying the people C the vision the pastor may have the vision but people have to cat the vision and if we are all into the same vision it's not pastor's Ministry or church ministry it is our ministry if we are convinced we must be concerned and God will prosper us together as a team as families as a church amen and so I was speaking with the Deacon and I told me Pastor you need to stop doing this you need to stop taking money out of your pocket and taking the whole burden 100% when we have needs in the church let us bring it to the people let us teach them how to give so that God can bless them it is very easy to Pastor a church when people are blessed financially but when people are poor in the church it is a headache it's a problem this one Pastor I don't have transport Pastor my child is sick in Africa a pastor is the father of very many and one of the reasons is because we don't teach our people to give we always believe someone will come believe a miracle will come and knock us the responsibility is yours the government is where where on our shoulders on P's shoulders the church shoulders we can look at it that many different directions but also in this way God is counting on us to accomplish his work on Earth amen so I will not repeat that so from today hence forth whenever we have a need in the church for the church I will always bring it to you and we will always look for that money so that God can bless us together so before we start giving I I needed to say this um we need to look for uh the money for the generator for the past uh for the past how long one month two about three months how has been going off during we've been blessed the whole time where here power was never going but something is happening I I heard there changes in and things this may be the new normal we need a generator and that generator the brother told me 2.2 million uh it's um I am which brand brother okay well the brother is very ver with the technical things we have confidence in his decisions those so but we need also long wire and a generator and that will cost 2.2 million so um I was thinking should we take from the land fund I said no we are not going to take money [Music] from we want us to we them when we already in the place we are moving you how much we have where's brother assistant chairman where is he he's out how much did we collect today this week we are still going down let us come out of there even the prophecy came out we should go back to our first love not only spiritually also physically and our Ze for the things of God don't give you are in which church don't have church everybody doesn't have but where does this come from it comes from those who don't if you in this church and faithfully and you don't have food at home I want you to come and see me there is another problem which we need to remove but let me assure you this you can't serve God impossible possible things that they are so bad that you can't serve God you have the problem is with your Revelation but the ones with Revelation the little they have they give give it for the work of to go for and then God Rec in they told have several testimonies here several testimonies not given this is our blessing it is our opportunity to serve God to get out of this bad situation if you want to get out of a bad situ use the things God gives you to serve him amen every Christian here we expect every week so that after the service we just send it to the [Music] pastor to okay those with who want to send by mobile money they are going to read the number God bless you M10 is 0785 M10 is 0785 48 can read okay 0785 48 48 29 29 45 45 we repeat it 0785 8 85 48 29 that's the MTN it brings I think your then the
