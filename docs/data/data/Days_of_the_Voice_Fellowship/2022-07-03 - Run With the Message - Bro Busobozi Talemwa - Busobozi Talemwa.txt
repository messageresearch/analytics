[Music] and uh verses 19. just be attentive and hear what we will be reading so i think the projector has they have an issue there but i can my screen here is working so we are reading second samuel chapter 18 verse 19 and we are reading in the name of the lord then said ahim as the son of zadok let me now run and bear the king's tidings the king tidings how that the lord has avenged him of his enemies i think we should read verse by verse [Music] listen carefully this morning requesting uh job uh senator you ready a and so ahimas was requesting him to go and check the tidings the news of what had happened there on the battlefield are you following this morning and job said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the king's son is dead became go tell the king what thou has seen and because she bowed himself into job and reigned father we ask that you will come and bless us this morning take control of this service from this time to the end of the day and may we all be touched in jesus name to our visitors this morning did you ever get involved here we have no law one or two not taker but love we have no book but the bible the truth we have no membership but we only have fellowship they truly never men are true and everybody is welcome to fellowship with us we believe that the blood of jesus christ washes and cleanses us from all sin glad that you made it this morning i first spoke on this message uh i think about um 12 years ago and then the only time i found that it was documented was in 18th of october 2013. [Music] you know and this is a very uh touching message for me whenever i preach it again and we are not done with the subject we were talking about and those who missed the second part of it please look it up on the podcast what is your religion and we tell them we do not have any religions and then others wanted to know what what our religious affiliation was and we told them we do not have any either christians what he is not the catholic of the bible but i am the catholic of the bible and i believe you are too errant well i'm a pentecostal pentecostal pentecostal because i believe in pentecostal i won't that would be are you not a baptist baptist because i am healing remember the true original baptism baptized in the bible is the one that will baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ in much water [Music] [Music] the faith of our original pentecostal father and i want to announce to you this morning that man already came home 50 years on the left now again but he left the message what is the message the message is that revelation which takes us back to the revelation of the bible praying a man god needs to use a man not his church in our generation god has used a man people always receive the man around tobacco no need never not all the time similarly she says does god stop using men directly always use this man whether some believe [Music] that will be those to run with that big denominations and they have no message to preach and i want us to look at it here in the type with the story of the king and absolutely the king david kabaka dawudi reached that time and now we have to come when his sons grew but even and each of them wanted to be a king next after him but we know little money it was only uh solomon that was to be the king after him so then [Music] and [Music] not even your family members never remember your family not even the outsiders hallelujah amen you are planted on a road well simply you are planted to strength that's why we say that jesus is our solid rock red light so when you enter the people can move us up i am [Music] amen hallelujah amen and [Music] job naga by yo abu it's a job you're my chief captain you're going to do me the way i'm sending you to god okay and fight on my behalf but for my son i so if it is possible please save him and the heart of david was like that of god why didn't that work at all the bible says god is laughing and it's not willing that ener should perish god [Music] is them again if you are seated this morning in this place let me tell you i do not know when see many people but if the lord carries some of you will go by the way of the graves some of you young when someone says that you feel like as if it will never happen but that's a reality of life i have no fear of going to hell seek again i'm again hell is not my portion i am not helping [Music] is [Music] amen you can the group of of day of uh uh job straight towards the tree yet to canada and uh there was like something that held it category would be charged quite and absolutely was squeezed between those two absolutely [Music] simply finished off absolutely and job and absolutely and then after the days of absalom there was a big tumor nobody in that wall oh a big shout oh [Music] the way i brought it ingredients i was just excited like as well organic not actually no money that the king's son is denting vain him of his enemies come here let me go and tell the king how are these enemies arranged [Music] it will [Music] oh because if you lose the beginning you let me go [Music] bowed himself to job now and they said all right let me go on and he ran [Music] this is an obligation we have had people put it through in our generation who have come and said god called them again [Music] we have today say no let me [Music] why do you run without a message there is a little uh some men who came preaching at the second house [Music] who do m the bible says they should come to the lord that he knows god dried in the fire they should come to the lord but he will come and get ourselves for them when you receive the message of your day [Music] so they they speak like angels they live like devils a man of god leaves the pulpit and then he goes to a process prophet zima and when you talk to them they say don't judge me tell them where you are go hey why do you have a well literally this makes me feel

verse 23. he says but let me go let me run let me run america and he said to him now you've heard many times people saying i will not say god never called you. but wait a moment who called kush who sent him animoto and then he told look at it verse 23. [Music] both of them were sent to run bon diver but one of them naomi never had a message he literally never backer and he was not actually supposed to run from the to begin with attending if you decide to go to god and pray well please give me a second wife your number is it your will no no i'm like is it is it your will oh god it's real now who have come and said god spoke and he even gave me a sign yeah when i dreamed that dream with a name of the second wife i even saw a phone number m and [Music] [Music] are you telling me that all these churches with women leading them are wrong hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord small things why are you preaching no small small things let me tell you there is no smaller one big word is [Music] it's the same today hallelujah amen let us follow this story and so ahima started running and the bible says i must rant by the way of the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there was no any problem and those are the ones you say if you have a problem but what do you know because it means you are you're having a cast if you are you don't have money it means you have a curse if you have management god has blessed yourself hallelujah he said i shall not be [Applause] the running of the foremost is like the writing of athens [Music] the watchman is the preacher he saw another and he was able to judge mullah but god negatively never judged yet but nonetheless did you know that many times what you see all about it's actually what god says but god keeps quiet the running of this foreign the way is running like the running of arguments i believe argent was running with trustless i can see the miniska never ever ep surely i can tell that i'm 10 take a day this isn't that young man with a girlfriend yeah it is not married here [Music] god [Music] [Music] he way because we have failed your car they are fair for a car even if it's a pentagon you will know this one is not yet running with the message you will know oh man hallelujah amen and then we had the brotherhood which was not happy with one another praise the name of the lord come here he's running sitting outside crossed legs can step where they are not supposed to step is running as he's taking some alcohol in malaria one is i know he's a good man my name is but uh nah yay let us see him coming but he has good news and then when he arrived what happened meanwhile i like him as cold i came as an alcohol before he arrived where the king was he was already and he said unto the king come on the shouting about kanye don't shout to me without a message all you do well he fell down now what on the earth now what happened is [Music] and the king said [Applause] oh wrestling style what do you have to teach you already know that the world does not happen if you are a believer you don't have something the world doesn't have they cannot see the difference at work i can't see the difference between you and others so why are you running you could do that run with that run with a message we have a message taking her one of these days after all the people some of these people i don't know we are thinking we are committed will look and [Music] so give me money give me money press same thing oh don't forgive me over tomorrow give me love from quran i don't give a give me riches give me a wife come and give me my children [Music] for where i am [Music] it was finished he didn't have any motives oh i remember the scripture that says many will come unto me didn't we [Applause] [Music] souls and the reason is because they never heard the message they ran but without a message [Music] but the king was still patient same question the enemies tell me [Music] was much moved here quite welcome look let me tell you we are looking for people with a message which will remove people which will move souls where you have been a sinner oh [Music] witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the scene which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the rest that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and the finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him and you are the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god [Music] some questions here this morning let us run okay you see we are compassed with a great crowd of witnesses did you know there are many around us this morning church oh my god my is [Music] what way tree which suddenly which that so easily beset us aside later this morning let [Music] okay hallelujah amen oh my tell somebody else for the hour to do who are we looking at i need to do to know thee send a prophet god send the prophet to my nephew [Music] [Applause] hallelujah i if you have a dollar and i say is this a good dollar and you look at it and it would have to look pretty much like a real dollar or you wouldn't believe it so it will have to be a real good imitation [Music] and if jesus said that the two spirits in the last days that would be so close to you it would deceive the very election yes religious people now remember now there are there ain't nothing out there in them old cold for more outside it's talking about those kind of religions they have just a form of but these two spirits are a real spirits it would be so close to you it would receive the video like somebody i've told you before yes i want to ask you this morning jesus said if it is what does it mean it is [Music] it will [Music] listen which you receive because you have rejected the truth after it has been presented [Music] the genuine holy spirit the mark of the butch you hear in the bible one of my bible is that water baptism occupation is mandated for every christian christianity and also you hear that you must hear first and believe by your own self having had that then the bible says finally again you'll be baptized i will never tease it without water and there is going to be a group of people that's going to be marked for destiny and there's going to be a people marked for their eternal destiny in [Music] in other words i could also read that scripture vice versa in the [Music] because if they dare cry [Music] [Music] [Music] time never get out when you meet dwight then they go back home never die i'm not going to eat beans rather sorry sisters are waiting for you everytime [Music] prophet sister will not be that you will not eat the beans you should fight the meat on you oh someone should bring me over here but you should not eat beans it's inspiring but it has no effect unless you apply the principles of the world let's god bless you brother i mean they stay home to listen to some kind of radio program or a television program oh and it says the american people they want to be entertained i want to say the ugandan people all the people they want to be entertained by new media they get a preacher this is not a good entertainer oh they don't want him of the gospel [Music] ah and i asked especially you were baptized think we and i even have

wearing ropes this is your god father this was the priest and i said praise the lord but i said that's not me which proof do i have the bible you are [Music] how can such a baby make such a decision i

them i was raised by them by the way for 13 years of my life replace the bible this is not a book of references this is the absolute change whatever it says have meant to it therefore where did they get the good fathers [Music] where they get child baptisms [Music] in the name of this is the doctrine of our children of your church it means it is antichrist [Music] the child doesn't like this kind
