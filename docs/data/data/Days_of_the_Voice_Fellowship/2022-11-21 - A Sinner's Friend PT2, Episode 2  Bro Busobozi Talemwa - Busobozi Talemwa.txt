========================================

[Music] [Music] hallelujah amen we shall live on this Earth so we noticed this together that is [Music] human flesh foreign [Music] he went to the Jews revealed himself but to the Gentiles [Music] at you foreign foreign [Music] potential we are back in the days of lots but let me tell you Charles they saw the blood of the building but you Remember The Young and the old men who wanted the angels for lasciviousness the only thing that held the fire of God of course we know that Lord really God is friendship with the Lord because as the result of Abraham with whom he had a confidence is no longer worthy of God foreign [Music] foreign enough [Applause] [Music] but how can you do that when you can't evangelize Jesus is still the same yes the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count blackness but as long suffering to us were not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance God is concerning his promise hallelujah amen Heaven is going to fulfill it again are you satisfied that this is where were you some men count slackness no God is Not delaying listen some of them may never read the Bible but you are their Bible we're almost foreign [Music] foreign [Music] you can live a life worthy of the Gospel you say that oh these days there are no more virgins sit down there are many young ladies that will not defy themselves because I was one of them and there are many more you two can do it why do you say I've lost it oh he's okay I was already in the world don't you worry brother because you lost it because you never did it in the first place now stand your ground as a Believer and prove to the devil you can live a life the devil will tell you no I made you do it last time I'll make you do it again you will look at him too much time last time I didn't know who I am but now I know I am a son of God [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord let me give you a few samples here and then I'll I'll quit now I want I want us to look we looked at this briefly on on Sunday but I want us to go through it for just a moment Luke 7 3 6. and let's try to be a bit fast I'll be able to complete this now and then one of the Pharisees desired that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the for his house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind his weeping um At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment foreign [Music] and so he invites Jesus he didn't wash his feet then he comes a woman with an alabaster box of ointment I mean foreign she was a prostitute Himalaya and she's coming close to the master yes Jesus yes the Holy One with her prostitution you might say with hospitals and she begins to touch his feet and closing her eyes don't think that she would have got tears out of her eyes without closing them I wanted to imagine that scene a prostitute no doubt she was dressed like one another crazy and she came with this perfume was so you know luxurious and it comes on the feet of Jesus and begins to close foreign [Music] and began to caress Jesus as sacral's eyes produced here this was not a spiritual sight what is Jesus Christ if it was like in our generation the news at 10 or massage A Man Called Jesus and you wouldn't doubt those news foreign foreign and the tears and wiped them with a hair overhead and kissed his feet um it was only the tears and the hair cutting cutting again but even without feet full of makeup [Music] we also understand oh my God foreign would have known that which kind of woman what man of woman this is the touch is Jesus knew yes when Jesus told you he knew you yes don't worry about the opinion of anybody he will serve you regardless of what anybody amen he will serve me of anybody's thoughts I am on my way to heaven because he served me amen praise the name of the Lord Jesus answering say down to him yes the one old 500 Pence and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly gave them both forgive them both tell me that for which of them will love him most and Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom it was he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly charged and they and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon Says doubt this woman I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with hairs of her head thou gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil that is not annoying but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment wherever I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is given the same life as little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they started meet with him and they got to say with him thereof themselves who is he this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman by sins as thy faith has saved thee go in peace and Jesus was trying to show yesterday that this woman is sins we are too much and she appreciated Christ more let me tell you Church if we have a church people that have truly met God be having been Sinners during worship you will not find a statement you will not find people just there singing for singing you will find people worshiping Jesus you'll find people lifting up their house without his interest is with the sinners do we have some Pharisees here one of America do we have some Sinners here she wasn't caring what them Pharisees was saying I entered the spirit and I began dancing the sister will see me look at me having a full of myself let me tell you we're not a former church we believe in dancing and shouting and praising Hallelujah because we don't care what the Pharisees are saying foreign hallelujah amen did Jesus draw back his feet and say you must not do that yes she was right in order yesterday now you'll understand some of these things he held perfectly still yes she was writing order um wiped them with only with the only Glory she had in us I remember when I was a young boy from school my uniform was always shipping in a school the next time I found myself I was on the floor and that happened several times [Music] without tears of repentance to them with the glory the only God she had her hair's feet she was washing I didn't know what she was doing after a while she raises I don't know what she looks around oh did someone say anything yes yes oh later on he made his remarks I can see Simon I can see his face turn red in the best morning music he's sharp still and he got released doing something natural color he will look at you [Music] in the face [Music] and then white with Rich I can hear him these programs interrupted you know what kind of woman that is you're standing before he thought it would hurt his reputation is made when he is in the presence of seeing us yes Jesus's reputation yes he is not hurt by Sinners yes it is made in the presence praise the name of the Lord and you notice when I keep on saying Sinners I'm quoting here washing his feet she raises up you are the court brother here I wish you had put it for the people to follow me here now she raises everything she had now was there hanging down the top of the of it bro yes sir all for Jesus [Music] Joe [Music] yeah on his feet for everything she had a glory Ambassador was in the box of spikenon she powered it upon his feet she bowed it on his feet praise the name of the Lord quickly go to the Book of John I want to try and finish in a few moments if you follow me now closely together let us read quickly uh John 8 2 and early in the morning he he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and told them and the scribes and the Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they have said to her in the Middle East they say unto him Master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what says Thou this they say tempting him that they might have to accuse him but Jesus scooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground and as though he had them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you led him first cast a stone at her Pastor you're defending a sinner [Music] telling us let him that has never done it and again I'm not on the ground and they which had it being convicted by their own conscience Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the middle down when Jesus had lifted up himself and so none yes where are those then accusers she said no man Lord neither do I condemn them go then he didn't stop there so yeah come out he said go come again and say no more seeing a friend when you met Jesus the things he used to do you do them Hallelujah man you sing such a song the things I used to do I do them the things I used to do I do them no more the things I used to do I do them no more it was a great day when I was born again and I read this quote and conclude with this the grace were promised in the Garden of Eden series amen you know a prostitute is the one who goes with the the man that are not his husband together A New Beginning you may be here this morning yes sir you may be a drunk after all Jesus things may be acceptable [Music] you don't have to do it it's not expedient for us to do them right so he may be and you were drunkard I may be a gambler even be a murderer hey foreign maybe on on the streaming Jesus is a friend of Cena yes you might be here even while I'm preaching this your wife is feeling happy yes what it means to you you might be an impure wife yes you know you are an impure wife you must be the finalists oh you wouldn't be a discharge this morning Grace hey Jesus will make a way for you if you just accept it Adam had to be willing to accept it I was in Ethiopian one day with brother Paul remember myself and you know we were reaching out we always randomly reached out to people and met them um so when I met this young man the Holy Spirit began to reveal to me things about his life and things which were so nasty tough and so I [Music] and I I told I told him I said I don't remember he's I don't remember his name I got his name I asked him his name I told him I told him his name I said young man do you know that God knows your life there is nothing hidden before he said what do you mean are you God or something I said no I'm not I'm not a city but I am his servant and if God reveals to me things about your life are you willing to accept it he said if it is the truth Allah are you willing to accept Christ as yourself telling him the story of his life and it was very difficult you know especially when you you deserve something and then somebody can say no and then they make an issue out of it God gave me Grace but then as I as I spoke to him and I began to show him how he was a perfect and how he doesn't want it that he has people that are pushing him into this kind of life and at that moment he broke down I'm in your car and tear started coming out of his eyes Okay and the more details that I had given him the Holy Spirit he realized even myself I realized that God is real I would like to but I've spoken to my whatever my friend and I I don't think I can they've been there for me they've done ABCD I'm sorry Adam had to be willing to accept it Adam yeah and then we met a prostitute and I've told you this story before she she was on her business and we spoke to her a wife passport is trying to introduce herself and do business with us everything I always had a partner with me and so and I never want to go alone anyways and so this prostitute was dark 9 p.m [Music] Ethiopia and so she introduced herself and was willing to the business yeah [Music] I did not recognize that immediately but my brother did he told me what it was because my brother had been in the world [Music] he had more experience so I told him he started the conversation we make an appointment in a room our room and we invited the sister over here and to interpret for us and also be a witness and so we pray should we please we were we had invited another woman foreign foreign friends you don't know the joy I had nothing in the name of our Lord let me tell you friends that lady will never be the same oh yeah he says Adam had to be willing to accept it that's all you got to do accept it you can't overcome anything on your own Christ is your friends send this message only for you to be able to have an opportunity you would be a fool to turn it down don't turn it down and always give Grace an opportunity [Music] but I do mistakes he says don't just take this care but you know tell God you're sorry come back and come on back Oh Come Away cause you cannot continue working like that's the way to do it don't you think you are cast of forever as long as
