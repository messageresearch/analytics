were undone we had no hope but your goodness has been running after us is like a Rivers because we were a part of you from the very beginning Lord what can we say but we love you because you first loved it and you purchase our Salvation on calvaries no Lord you went The Last Mile and now Lord we will also take the last mile for you it's a relationship I love we can't understand I love the world tonight we have come in your presence yet again Lord we are not doing this as a religious Act [Music] oh yeah get in your presence because we want to fellowship with you we want to have some time with you oh sometime with the King just a king but the King of Kings Lord how I understand that a wife would want to spend their time with their husbands a friend would like to spend time with a friend um but Lord you're more than a husband you are more than a friend Lord we want to spend time with you today and I pray Lord that you will come and minister to us through the preaching of your world may we be encouraged be brought closer to thee today at the end of this meeting I mean I'd like us to go to the world once again if you can take your Bibles we're reading from a second I know that we we had was speaking on the message of the hour on Sunday and this today I want us to continue the same subject and so this will be like a part foreign [Music] and I think I feel that is a little or a few things that I need to continue addressing and I'm president so that we can come into the Perfection I wonder of Jesus Christ [Music] so we are reading out of second Peter we are reading that scripture once again or maybe for for our reading tonight we can take a different scripture together we will read two scriptures before we get seated is Galatians Chapter 2 and then Acts chapter 16. together is Galatians Chapter 2 verses 20. and it is reading this way I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me gravity Christo yes [Music] [Music] I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness cometh by the law then Christ is dead in vain is [Music] also also read the Acts of the Apostles to me chapter 16 is just about three verses from verses 30. and here in my uh Bible I have a subtitle the only condition of Salvation uh foreign [Music] maybe for the whole to be able to get the whole perspective let us begin from verse 25 and then we can read up to verse 33. if that's okay and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and prisoners had them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bands were loosed and The Keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been had been fled um but Paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here [Music] then he called for for a light and sprung in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas and brought them out and said SARS what must I do to be saved I mean and they said prioritizes come to church every Sunday be baptized repentance and after you finish that cut your hair a certain way and videos okay was that what he said are you following the scripture get back there again today and they said it's very amazing let's first look at again and so he brought them out in case you missed it he brought them out and says worst what must I do to be saved me away [Music] and they say I'm tempted to speak other things let me read what it says and thou shalt be saved and thy house Amina is that a man and they spoken to him the word of the Lord and to all that were in his house and they took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized and when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in God with all his house now amen Amina I would like to speak to the Lord for just a moment just pray together with me Lord Jesus once again we are coming before you go the subject that I want to speak on Lord I pray that you will guide me on what I will say what I will speak father check my thoughts at this time I surrender all myself and all of me and I pray that you will use me now also my brother who is May this time be a time of blessing for each of us for your people have come from near and fast and their desire is to hear from you foreign once again I want I'd like to greet you in the name of Jesus Christ foreign so I'm happy to see Dixon he uh was able to make it back today from Ginger themselves Ginger and also I'm happy to see every one of you I said God bless you tell your neighbor God bless amen Amina so I'm speaking on the the subject is still the same brother Isaac it's the message of the hour but maybe this time you will Struck it or put in Brackets or whatever you want to do legalism um foreign I don't know if that is the correct or perfect interpretation legalism or let me put this to the excessive adherence to law or or formula over again [Music] and so um remember that we are our theme is taken out of second Peter chapter 1 verse 12. Peter said where if I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things the things that they had earlier on spoken of we spoke of them he says though you know them and be established in the present truth so I mean we don't always preach to you because you don't know what I'm going to preach to you about we don't always preach because we are preaching new things you know one person may say why do we have to go to church each time why don't we just go to church once and that's it we go Friday we go Wednesday we go Sunday we go even other days really are we learning new things there's no new things in the Bible Bible the same things that you have that you have had are the same things you keep hearing um but you see what is done in the process is as you you continue here to get established in the present truth the establishing is not a work that can take place in a day or an even foreign is is uh he says that if faith comes by hearing is that sister praise God bless you you're welcome back and hearing the word of God how are you going to be established in Christ hearing repeatedly it establishes your faith in the present room what is the present truth the present truth is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and foreign [Music] [Music] because it has been returned or restored back to us the people of the end times the Bible has never changed the message did not change the Bible actually the message is the Bible the Bible because you see when God sends a prophet he doesn't send a prophet to introduce something new that woman sends a prophet to restore the people back to God so now we've read from Galatians and I would like to rehearse these two scriptures once again and then we will take it on foreign [Music] and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God um [Music] [Applause] but it was the life of Jesus Christ he calls it I now live in the flesh I live by the faith foreign [Music] [Music] I want you to uh and I'm going a little bit slower because I wanted to really catch this if there was a remedy situations without Jesus Christ he did not need to die if there was something that could be done you could restore a man back to God Jesus didn't have to die yes but the reason why he died was because there was absolutely nothing that could be done mankind to restore their relationship back to God you see there are many things the law was right here because the law made them to do what God intended for them the law could not bring a perfect restoration of the children of God back to God had a temporal kind of effect the Lord did not perfect to do the job and so I can say that the law was a shadow of something else that would come and bring the real things that can be able to restore the broken relationship are you hearing me and that and the law that was a shadow of Grace let me tell you grace everything the law was saying but what was the law telling the children of Israel Jesus Christ came yes Christian when he came he died on the cross and when he died on the cross then Paul says hallelujah he said I'm crucified with Christ and nevertheless I live yet not I since Christ leave us in me and that life amen he says that the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God foreign [Applause] so what do we need to do in order to be safe Acts chapter 16. we've had the story everyone of how this man is how they were released from prison and when they were released from prison the story you've already read it out for you foreign what must I do and and this man and so they answered him let us read it again together on the Lord Jesus Christ let us read it I can tell your neighbor and they said on the Lord Jesus yes Christo I mean and you will be saved your house praise the name of the Lord now is this the gospel yes or no [Music] is this the gospel do you realize that what is preached in most of Christendom um the gospel Angeli is believed on the Lord Jesus Christ believe you want me to say more um yes Crystal now let me surprise you we have a lot of people that are in churches but don't actually believe no they they're doing the religious things the Catholics they follow the laws of Catholicism they are doing everything their religion tells them as long as they tell them will you shout or you speak in tongues they do it and they are fine they're safe and even in our message we have what we can also say if you do this on this and if you did all this then you you were bright you are going to The Rapture you know so every religion every you know religion even those who are not Christians they have their own set of rules but if you did this you are going to heaven foreign Jesus looked at him he said he was you speak well you've done all you're not requested but in other words you yourself no now what you might still avoid in your heart because otherwise he couldn't have come to Jesus Christ he realized salvation Christ was not in the Deeds of the law Christopher but here he was hallelujah amen disciples asked a question this man the prison guard he asked a question [Applause] to the disciples what must I do to be saved and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ foreign foreign so here Katie Jesus looks at him he says you don't need me when to tell you the law they wait against but there is here he didn't quote anything he Jesus yes you spoke to him he said go now sell everything you have to understand give the money to the poor Sinners you couldn't find that anywhere foreign am I communicating to some of you what Jesus spoke to this man yes he could not find it nowhere what was it it was Jesus Christ it's the same thing as this man was told the thing was not what Jesus was saying the thing was because Jesus said yes the man would have been saved the Bible says the man who went away because he had a great possessions now listen to me when you come to Jesus Christ the only thing you need to do foreign [Music] get salvation because of what you did amen what you do should come out of the abundance of your faith in him [Applause] praise the name of the Lord it is so sad that the Church of Jesus Christ even after the death of Jesus Christ yes we can actually we should actually cons we should we can actually attain eternal life by our Deeds this is from Gabriel's instruction today it says Hear Me That saith the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the Homeland the message [Music] describes as the message he says [Music] because you are a member of a certain Church I'm not going to the Rapture because you're a member of dvf okay no none of us is going to make it that way you are going to The Rapture only on one bus okay genuinely believed on the Lord Jesus Christ the message has come to call us out on his system organizations it is the word of God that is the message that has always been the message of energy community [Applause] maybe another day I'll talk about a Calvinism but tonight I'm talking about armenianism and I would like us to concentrate on that yeah which is legalism believe in the Lord Jesus Christ foreign so let us begin with one here from the message Jehovah Jireh and the prophet says what we need today is back to the real message because he calls the real message God said salvation yeah he calls it there he calls it the old time the real plane God sends salvation of Pentecost he says now some of you when you hear the message the reason why I'm talking the subjects many people have misunderstood what this message is many of you thought that the message is maybe a new church a new religion a new idea a new whatever time I'm done with this subject we all understand what the message is why we are not going to attend the church in the Catholic Church while we are here so we need to understand those things you see then he says now we find out that this dispensation then it lasted on that legalistic dispensation [Music] the real Royal seed come [Music] um then he taken all the legalism upon himself and he paid the price of redemption and God is church is bad we don't do that to be safe and Paul told him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is this your Prophet saying these words if he's your Prophet if it's our Prophet Say Amen [Music] and brother says when a sinner comes to the Lord he's not talking about a Believer who has been a Believer for a while some people actually thought that the message was hard the message what if that we frustrated the seed of God but he said when a sinner comes to the Lord we don't treat them like Paul did when the Philippian Jailer said what must I do to be said Paul said to him foreign she already knows that information in other words we need to preach Faith believe in the Lord Jesus Christ he says not come join our congregation again come stand up before the church that wasn't it Jehovah and this is a very nice story and he calls it he says the Bible is a Love Letter Bible we absolutely and we believe in the grace we believe in life are you are you is that not right from the moment I met her has always been loved I think if I was not married I would not have preached this because Hallelujah I mean praise the name of the Lord and he says when I get ready to go overseas everything I'm reading here I'm quoting but I'm actually talking about myself when I get ready to go overseas I don't reach over here and get her see my dear Mrs Thou shalt not have any more husbands Thou shalt not make I we do not do it foreign that's the way we that's the way the Christians that's the way we have tried to make sure yeah it's in our minds even you yourself with Jesus like that until it does not yield any fruit because you always think oh he's a big God somewhere and he's waiting for you to do a mystery he will stick because his wife waiting for him to not answer your questions [Applause] their prayers are not answered from today hey church is not supposed to be that way it's supposed to be a love affairs between you and Jesus hallelujah amen oh praise God make your own salvation oh my God he says then we kneel down we pray and that's what I always do with my wife when I'm going to leave listen I have never gone for any trip asking my wife to pray for me and I did not know that even brother did it and then she asked God to help me she stays home take care of the babies and I go to work for the Lord I haven't been home but just a little bit in 15 years he says in 15 years he's been home in just a little bit and that's how it has been with me the last 10 years of my marriage just saying just staying a young woman staying home meeting the public trying to do her part name a real lovely woman is my wife Hallelujah man if there is one man who is really proud of their wives oh wow if I am one of them she's a real lovely woman was also proud of his way and if you have one you can be proud of them you who have not yet married they should be ready to marry somebody who you you should must be to be proud someone that you are proud you know they're doing everything they're doing because they love him foreign let me tell you that's not how you treat a woman and even God doesn't treat his woman like that he's a woman we are his wife he treats us with love confidence he has confidence [Music] is a vote of confidence you cannot put your love on a woman that you have no confidence if you do some people try that some people try that because of one reason someone want me not to say this but I will say because of the figure eight or whatever it is come on yeah I don't know what to sound to say that now and that these men are saying because of figure eight and you marry her then later on or when you realize you can't have confidence put your confidence I said dear I give you my words you want to take me out I do I believe she would forgive me but brother you would die in my tracks before I done working in fact I love her too much don't marry somebody I love her too much [Applause] [Music] foreign women these days are very wise they can't track you know they can't go now yeah you've done the bad stuff and then you tell her because because she had confidence and if that is the way it is let me foreign and then we bring them here tell us what you did how did you do it how many times you what can I do now please none of us is the husband of anybody Jesus Christ is our husband yes Christian is the husband to the church is a priest that can be touched by the feelings of their information today I don't know how they call it in the Catholics who knows it could change penitence okay my son what have you done the person they are repenting to is even worse than them and even in our churches Jesus Christ Jesus Christ faithful and Justice I understand there are times and situations but I understand is only Jesus Christ can wash away my foreign foreign [Music] hallelujah hallelujah foreign interview even when you come to pray don't make it hard for him you are speaking things you can't understand some people by the way when you are praying I don't understand because you are the brother and say oh Jesus you ought to say oh Jesus can you have your own relationship with Jesus whereby a woman would write a husband and a woman would the man would read between the lines easy for Jesus to figure you out yes oh this one this one is in this morning that's why he says he knows how do you even provide it because he understands it data but some of you who don't have a relationship with you just meet a girl or a boy out there you are new to one another no relationships but if you've been together for a while you know I just need to if my wife wrote me a text I will read it you wouldn't understand the thing but I will understand because I've been without foreign [Music] it says that's the way that's the way you know this love book of God of God again it is so complicated to people because you are not in love with Christ you say it contradicts itself foreign [Music] foreign that's not it that's not the basis of Fellowship is not what you do that matters because they don't understand the concept God wants to have a relationship with his children let all our works out of the abundance sometimes I've walked at home and my wife gave me a glass of juice other times cartoon [Music] they want to rely on other people's experience with their God it doesn't work here in first thess 5 19 it says quench not the spirit people here it's not our works that count before God when people hear that they develop the attitude that we can do whatever we want to do is listen to what he says here in the message thy loving kindness away from God see that friend away from God um she is seeing a friend he's talking to seeing a friend away from God that is away from God little woman you realize that you are trying to quench that fast that God give to you to thrust after him and you're quenching it with the devil's Pleasures Moses forsook Egypt to be foreign [Music] of course the bad ones make it clear together put you on some distant looking things let your hair grow out and wash your face you know you walk around with a pack of cigarettes in your pocket when no time you know staying home and watching television washing your account Sunday instead of spend time at Sunday school Sunday you will go to here um that is toxic you're married but you never agree you are married but you always do things that are contrast but it is why we have a lot of divorces today men and women divorce each day those who have been together for very many hours because their relationships they don't pay attention to it and God it says French not the spirit the more you keep going out there you know he says when you are excuse me when you are doing the devil's Pleasures quenching the spirit imagine how the Holy Spirit must look at you David is [Music] something
