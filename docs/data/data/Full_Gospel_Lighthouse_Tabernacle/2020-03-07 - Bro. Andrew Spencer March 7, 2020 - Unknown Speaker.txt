hey man hey man God bless each and every one of you for coming to the house of the Lord to Satan and I'll let you have your seats just for a moment this evening before we go into the word this evening we would like to express our love to each and every one of you and to just just stand here and say thank you we say thank you to you as a body and we say thank you to those around the world at this time we appreciate every prayer we appreciate every word of encouragement we appreciate you as a body of believers standing against this enemy that has come against us we left this church service last Sunday not knowing what we were getting ready to face but we left here saying that joy was coming in the morning and the devil was sure upset he was sure upset about that and we're so so thankful to be on the winning side and we're here to do service for our king and to report for duty and to do what He has called us to do he didn't call us to back up give up turn around but we're here to fight because that's what we as believers do we believe this this past Monday we brother on brother on was he was starting to having some vicious the vision issues on on the weekend and and he made those things known unto us but we didn't know whether that was just part of the process or what not so we didn't know what we're facing but on Monday this is how I knew that your pastor was was something was wrong as we went and we had some points on Monday morning but when brother Ron did not want to go to work with me I knew something was wrong and so we took him to the to the eye doctor and then they took him to UVA and they did an MRI and they found they found that night that brother on had a brother on had a cancer in the brain and a tumor about the size of your fist is what I understand and so they were able to remove that yesterday and we're just thankful that God has anointed man in this day to work on God's servant and he has certainly blessed him with some of the best doctors that there is the best oncologists that there is in the area to take care of these things and that's exactly what we as a body have prayed about we've asked that God would anoint men women to work on him and I'd like to just show you a clip or a picture of our pastor just this evening if that's okay that right there's a champion outright there's a champion oh man what a pastor we have what a pastor we have I don't know about you but I'm not done with him yet I'm not done with him yet and we are expecting nothing but full victory in this you know why there were people all around the world that we're praying and we can't thank them enough you as a church body can't thank them enough if you would see the prayers and the prayer chains of believers and non-believers that were praying for for our pastor it would blow your mind they'd just blow your mind and so that's why last evening last evening our pastor come out of brain surgery and he would blow you away he was giving us advice he was preaching to us just coming out of brain surgery now I get a tow ache and sometimes I don't want to talk to nobody but here our pastor has given us advice and making us laugh and and one of the things they told him that his hands were a little bit puffy and so they said that that comes from from laying on your laying on your stomach for six hours and he said well that's better than laying on your backside for eternity [Applause] I'm thankful for a man of God like brother on and tonight tonight we we felt this way I myself and brother on we felt this way earlier in the week tonight we wanted to have a service of worship and the service of prayer but you know good and well I'm I'm not just going to let you get off with without giving the devil a black eye that's my duty and I like going I enjoy giving the enemy a black eye so if you wouldn't mind standing with me this evening listening that song the power of your love amen as we get ready to go to the word if you have your Bibles you can make your way to to Isaiah chapter 43 as we sing this song tonight the power of your love and that's what we want tinnitus is the Lord to come and wrap us in his arms Lord Lord I come to you who let my heart be change I come to you will let my heart be change Rainer both flowing from the grave laughs in [Music] Oh Lord I've come to know the weaknesses I see in me who will be stripped away by the power of your love Oh Hey [Applause] only go let your love rain Oh [Music] me order all me to your side and hours of light beam and I will soar with you your spirit leads me all in the power of your love [Music] Lord and fail my eyes let me see you face to face and knowledge of your love and surely in [Music] we're not face [Music] every day by the power of your love Oh [Music] Hey holy ghost Oh dad you loser [Music] - Robbie - your slaw [Music] [Music] receive your spirit leads me oh you're that's what we want tonight is the power of his love to surround us won't you lift your hands to the God of heaven and as we go over these scriptures tonight I'm asking that the Holy Ghost would anoint each and every one of you that he would anoint these scriptures they're already anointed but he would anoint you to grab ahold of these scriptures and start speaking the things that look impossible and watch them come to pass grab ahold of your neighbors hand let's join our hearts together in Christian love just now Father we come to you there's none like you and Lord Jesus we are prepared to go to battle father and you've give us nothing better than your word to go to battle with Lord for were reminded that when you came to earth that when Satan was there tempting you and tormenting you you didn't use your power you used your word and father that as we as believers that's what we take we take the promises of God that we believe in we take the things that that will defeat in it's the weapon where it will defeat Satan anytime anyplace anywhere and we realize father tonight that we're standing against the time but we know that Giants will fall I believe there's David sitting all over this building tonight and I pray father that you would anoint that gift that lays on the inside of them to speak the things of God I pray father as we go over these things there's a bride around the world that is watching I pray father that they would they would join us tonight in prayer join us in this battle we're perplexed on every son we're not we're not cast down we know that we're gonna come out on the winning side father tonight as I would go over the Word of God I pray the buzzards the buzzards had seemed to be circling this place may the Eagles rise and may they start beating down these buzzards may as we as a body of Christ start feeding these buzzards of cancer to the Hawks these demons of torments have to leave they're not welcome here the Father we commit this service to you pray you receive glory and honor from it in the name of Jesus Christ amen have your Bible which aren't over to the Book of Isaiah chapter 43 thank you musicians just for a for a piece of time and then I'll call you back Isaiah chapter 43 and verse 1 I think this is part a God is with us and we will see miracles boudewijn but now thus saith the Lord that created thee Oh Jacob and he that formed thee O Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called thee by thy name thou art mine when thou pass us through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon me for I am the LORD thy God the Holy One of Israel thy Saviour I gave Egypt for thy ransom Ethiopia and Seba for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honourable and I have loved thee therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west may God bless you you may be seated this evening hey ma'am mother Mathews already quoted this but this brother on spoke to us Tuesday morning sent it out to the men of God around the world after finding out that he had brain cancer and needed brain surgery to remove the mass he wrote these words never give up no retreat we are close enough now to spit in his eye and to take his head brother on wrote this note to us yesterday morning at around 5 o'clock in the morning he said on December the 22nd I was asked by the Lord that if you trust me I'll use you like before he didn't ask for money he didn't ask for homes he didn't ask for cars he asked for my life today it is his for God brain tumor cancer is not an issue to his kingdom now to myself this wave seems overwhelmingly this morning but you see he has asked me to step out of the boat saying be not afraid don't fear when the wave goes by and becomes a memory I will be found standing with Jesus who greater could we be asked to stand with God has given me the greatest friends in the entire world to have his generals around me today he had stepped from the throne to take a walk of me maybe a zigzag lightning or however he chose to come he's here we love you all keep my family and my precious wife in your prayers once again Satan has made a challenge only to meet the faith of Jesus alive and well in his bride this is a book of Acts I told Dad I told dad this week I said look when Peter stepped out on the boat he was the only one that stepped out and he walked on water twice but this time the boat is empty the boat is empty and everybody has stepped out [Applause] we're not allowing him to walk alone in this the boats empty and we're walking towards Jesus where Jesus is on his way you as a body of believers are the most powerful people you are the bride of Jesus Christ and you are fortified in the Word of God the Bible tells us that we are ambassadors that we are sons and daughters of God and we know exactly who we are and we know that we we are a people that believe more than God is able but we believe that God will perform his promises the Bible tells us in Isaiah 54 and 16 behold I have created the Smith that blow if the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the waste or to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord Romans 8 and 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things for gospel light house what shall we say to these things what shall we say to these things if God be for us if God be for us if God be for us who can be against us cancer can't be against us demons of hail can't be against us if God is your partner brother Geoffrey you better have big plans proud of Jesus Christ hear me if God be for you who can be against you this battle that we have went through this past week as a body this has not just been an attack on brother wrong he's been the one that's been in the midst of the fire he's been the one and we as a family have watched every every step of this and we have documented it so well that when the the report comes through and when the when the evidence is clear we will report all of these things I have created a book I have started a book from the very beginning of this thing and when when it comes to a close I want to put it on hell's front door it said I got a package to deliver to you we come out on the winning side [Applause] whoo [Applause] you see God does all things well we all we all want the miraculous we want that instantaneous paradox that cannot be explained and even so now we are expecting that we're not doubting that but we know that God has perfected everything in in time and it will be played out exactly but there has been things that have happened this week that you can't explain there have been customers of mine that would that you as as a bride of Jesus Christ that you would never expect to be praying but they're praying be no wires in heaven but we have seen supernatural things I've seen what I would call dope addicts go to prayer I have seen men that you wouldn't expect to go to prayer there have been people that did not know exactly they know me but they didn't know brother ons name and so they knew that your pastor was a pastor and helped in Virginia so it's ok it's ok we'll just go with this so there have been those that did not know exactly brother wrongs of the wrongs name and so they they knew me as being partners in business and different different connections that we have but in all things God gets the glory and so they started looking just to find his name and they started looking pastor out to in Virginia and fell upon top of our sermons and have been listening ever since God does things well this week what I would what I would say is a miracle and then truly this is the miracle my cousin brother Gabriel who is sitting here with us tonight he came on Wednesday night and he came to the he came to the hospital room and we were there and we were listening to brother Donnie and then switched to him to brother Tim's service and just the Spirit of the Lord came down into the hospital room and did a real sovereign work and me and brother Gabriel had to leave for the night and so we were we were leaving and I could just tell that the Spirit of the Lord was was dealing with brother Gabe Roland and so early on Thursday morning he told me he said I need to go see brother on and so he went he went to see brother on and brother Gabriel dedicated his life to our Lord Jesus Christ that's America [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's the real miracle brother Gabriel has made moves even since that time to move here to be a part of this church to transfer his job here to get involved in this church get involved with our youth because he sees the importance of his soul and brother ons words were if God sent me all the way through this for this it was worth it all to God be the glory now the Bible says in Psalms 118 it tells us of his steadfast love that it endures forever verse one will give thanks unto the Lord for he is good because his mercy endureth forever let Israel now say that his mercy endureth forever let the house of Aaron now say that his mercy endureth forever let them now that fear of the Lord say that his mercy endureth forever I called upon the Lord and distress the Lord answered me and set me in a large place the Lord is on my side I will not fear what can man do unto me the Lord taketh my part with them that helped me therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me it is better to trust in the Lord and to put confidence in man it is better to trust in the Lord and to put confidence in Princes all nations can pass me about but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them they come past me about yay they compassed me about but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them they come past me about like bees they are quenched has the fire of thorns for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them thou has thrust sore at me that I might fall but the Lord helped me the Lord is my strength and song and has become my salvation the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacle of the righteous the right hand of the Lord do with valiantly the right hand of the Lord has exalted the right hand of the Lord do with validly I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord these are the words that brother ron spoke that morning in may in in in ohio there at brother Erickson's church when sister martha you remember the clip when sister martha erickson came down in a wheelchair that had Lyme disease and wasn't able to walk for a time and he spoke these words to her say you speak these words three times I shall not die but live I shall not die but live I shall not die but live on that third time the Spirit of the Lord you can see the Spirit of the Lord sweep through that room and she starts dancing and shouting across the building I believed Full Gospel lighthouse our pastor shall not die but live this sickness is not unto death those were the words that were spoken from Jesus to Martha and those same words have been spoken in this season and I want you to know that as a church that this sickness is not unto death I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord the Lord hath chasing me snored but he hath given me over unto death open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou has heard me and aren't become my salvation the stone which the builders refused has become the headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the LORD hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it you tonight are the most powerful people on the face of the earth you're higher than any Congress you're the bride of Jesus Christ and he's placed you in this moment and in this season for such a time as this and no one can take your place no one can take your place all the way from a little child praying over these needs no one can take their place the Bible says in 1st Samuel 12 and 22 for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great namesake because it has pleased the Lord to make you his people the prophet told us in the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church age book now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word right down to the time that he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works that she will be an invincible army he's talking about you tonight you know these things are going to come you know he's going to battle us you know this Full Gospel Light House who have been through so many battles but it does not surprise you that the enemy keeps on attacking us we were talking this just this past week I was speaking with sister Tracy that about she was reminding me of the promise that just happened over about a year or so ago I believe that was about right that the Lord came down in a service and said that he was going to bless this church like never before you recall those things you have seen the Spirit of the Lord come and anoint your young people to rise to a challenge and we have seen miracles in the natural and we have seen miracles in the supernatural and we as a body we were speaking these things that 12 years ago when we as a body of believers were going through the trial of the fire that we there was just a solemn 'no stat was in that war that was in that trial you remember those things but in this trial you know exactly where you're standing at in this trial you can look right you can square your shoulders up with the devil because you know exactly who you are you have matured as a body of believers and you can look the devil in the face and you can say Satan you take your dirty hands off of God's property brother on don't belong to you he belongs to God he belongs to me as a pastor he don't belong to you as another story a statistic he belongs to us you know where you're standing at and you have went to battle like never before and we have watched those Saints you see Satan day is not going to quit battling us until we leave this war until we leave this this dispensation of time but is not going to use cowards there's some people that's afraid to speak because they're afraid that God won't show up but I want you to know that he is jehova shamma he's the Lord that is there he's a God that said that I'll never leave thee and I'll never forsake thee and when you speak those things in the name of Jesus you can expect those things brother Branham said the biggest trouble there is in the church today is a bunch of fear people is always scared and that's of the devil don't be scared be brave you don't have nothing there ain't nothing to be afraid about Church there ain't nothing to be afraid about cancer cancer is nothing to Almighty God sickness is nothing to Almighty God this is a call to prayer tonight this is a call for prayer to you for you to pray for your particles to return this is a call to prayer to pray for your pastor this is a call to prayer to pray for the bride of Jesus Christ this is a call to pray for the impossible things that are stacked up against you but against all odds God gets through don't you be afraid don't be afraid of nothing he said in Hebrews 13 and 5 I will never leave thee nor forsake thee Deuteronomy 31 and 6 be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid for of them for the Lord thy God here it is that doeth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee Joshua 1 and 5 there so not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee some 37 and 23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand i have been young and now am i old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging for bread he is ever merciful and linda 'the and his seed is blessed Hebrews 4 and 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession but we have not a high priest which cannot be touched by the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we were we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in a time of need you remember what brother Donnie preached to you at Labor Day confession there's power in your confession ABC except believe and confess he can't do nothing for you until you confess it to start confessing the things that you're going to see tonight as you're praying I want you to confess the things that you may not see with your eyes but the things that you will see the things that you see by your faith your five senses of see taste feel smell in here they may not see the healing they may not see the miraculous but faith says it's coming faith says it's coming to pass because by His Word it's coming to pass we are believers and believing it's what we do best in moments like this this is when we were called to go to battle jesus said in Matthew seven and seven ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened mark 9 and 23 jesus said unto them if thou canst believe all things are possible to them that believe how many believers we got here tonight all things are possible to you Hebrews 11 and 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him mark 11 and 22 and Jesus answering saying unto them have faith in God that's pretty separated have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain I love that Jesus didn't put no stipulation on who had to ask it but he said whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you I believe Jesus is talking to you tonight I believe Jesus came all the way to help to Virginia to talk to you tonight therefore I say unto you as a body of believers that--what's things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them brother brother said let your faith loose let it loose tonight I want to show you what the devil said that he said on Thursday he was going to destroy him he said all week long he was going to destroy him on Monday he thought he could get you down as a body of believers he thought you could get you down on Tuesday he thought he could get you down but joy came in the morning on Wednesday he thought he could get you down but joy came in the morning on Thursday he thought he could get you down but joy came in the morning on Friday at 7:30 he thought he could get you down but joy came in the morning on Saturday this morning he thought he could get you down but joy come in the morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in the presence of the Lord there's fullness of joy I want to show to you and to the whole world what the devil said was impossible if you can hit the lights for us [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah when you're dealing with the brain you're dealing with a very a very significant part of the body but as the surgery was going on all day yesterday I began to think about the intellect of the brain and I begin to think about the headship and I begin to think about our head chef that has come down in this day that the intellect is now into the body you see Satan said that he would never allow you as a body to walk but you're walking he said as an enemy of God he said that you would never talk but you're talking he tried to put it in your mind that you wouldn't see no more but you're seeing I can't put it no better than this this came from sister Lydia Pruitt Oglesby when she's seen that clip praise our God take that devil there walks the devil stomping mountain mover water Walker more than just an overcomer gospel pre-k's her heart on fire freedom sing and testify there walks a real believer but the Nathan I believe it's about time we sing I am a believer [Applause] [Music] on Friday morning as you can imagine as a son it's quite toast about praying all night trying to get some rest because I know that I had battled to do the next day but yet in my flesh I knew we were in a war so I just spent the night in prayer and at 2:40 in the morning this was the morning of the surgery I woke up to a being in our room to an audible voice and a holy presence in that room and the voice said let's stand I stood to my feet in that moment and I worship the Lord I stood in that holy presence and I said God if you stay if you said for me to stand I'm understand Church I don't think that was just a word for me I think that was a word for you I think that was a word for the body price let's stand let's stand you remember the vision o thou sufferest stand and be healed in the name of Jesus Christ and he came back home Friday morning to tell you let's stand you're gonna go through some battles but you want to stand you got to remember that this is a marathon and every morning you're going to wake up and you want it to stand like never before I'm standing to my feet I'm standing as a son I'm not just standing as a son or on Spencer I'm standing as a son of God Mike was stood to his feet in Daniel 12 Michael was standing the mighty angel stands in revelations 10 and John stands and takes the book and revelations 10 and 8 and we must stand on God's promises every day it's our call to stand as the musicians come the Bible tells us in Ephesians 6 and 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness we have been commissioned to stand to stand against the methods of the devil against this different means as plans and schemes which he uses to deceive and entrap and enslave and to ruin the souls of men were called to stand against it the Bible says in James 4 and 7 submit yourselves therefore to God resists the devil and he will flee from you resist means to withstand the action of the devil to refuse to accept refuse to go along with and we refute him we deny him you see if he could hinder this service he'd hinder it he wants to hinder your prayer life he wants to hinder your walk with God resist the devil and he will flee from you resist the devil and he will flee from you do you realize what that scripture saying to you it is saying that he is a bigger coward than you could ever imagine being resist the devil and he will flee from you the Satan ain't scared of you as a man in the flesh but he is scared of your position that you hold as a son of God resist the devil and he will flee from you you've been called to pray brother Branham said prayer is the key that's the answer prayer changes things murder is the most powerful weapon there was ever put on the control of human beings there's no atomic bomb or no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God did you know that it did do it one time a prophet was sent up to the king in the chamber and said go up and tell him thus saith the Lord he's not coming off the bed he's going to die right there where he's had Isaiah went up and told Hezekiah and I could imagine all the celebrity at the gate the peasants out at the outer courts when they went in and said old prophet of God that would be come out what will become of our King thus saith the Lord he's going to die went out to the soldiers o great prophet what does the Lord say about our King us say if the Lord is going to die and that's what's right the Lord told him that goes on down gets in his little Hut somewhere and back in the wilderness and Hezekiah turned his face to the law and wept bitterly and said lord I beseech you to consider me I walk before you with a perfect heart I need 15 years longer to get my kingdom in condition and prayer changed hezekiah circumstance Hezekiah prayed and he got 15 more years Hezekiah the King knew how to pray when they were in a battle he prayed and 185 thousand Assyrians were destroyed by hailstones by coming from Almighty God I'd say that those were rocks from another world Elysa prayed to God and God directed him to the person who should be the wife to Isaac Jacob prayed to God and God inclined the heart of his irritated brother so that they met him peace and friendship Samson prayed to God and God showed him a well where he quenched his burning thirst and so lived to judge Israel Daniel prayed and God enabled him both to tell Nebuchadnezzar his dream and to give the interpretation of it nehemiah prayed in God inclined the heart of the king of Persia to grant him a leave of absence to visit and rebuild Jerusalem Esther and Mordecai prayed and God defeated the purpose of Haman and saved the Jews from destruction the believers in Jerusalem prayed and God opened the prison doors and set Peter at liberty Paul prayed that the thorn in the flesh might be removed and his prayer brought a large increase of spiritual strength when the thorn perhaps remained and we as believers have watched mountains fall because of prayer we've seen the dead raised because of prayer we've seen product was returned because of prayer we've seen hearts transform because of prayer in my the Flyleaf of my Bible is a name of Gabriel Spencer I'd say prayer works we've seen blind eyes come open we've seen deaf ears come open we've seen cripples walk we've seen brain bleeds come to a halt we've seen barren wounds after 16 years bring forth life we've seen the curse of sin stopped we have seen the miraculous by the way of Prayer and tonight God has called us to pray to pray like never before and so I asked you as a body to come and join us in prayer around this altar tonight and we will see miracles maybe if the brothers could put on that song Healing is here as the people are coming tonight a new that are listening by the way of the Internet join us in prayer tonight is not a night of a I lay me down a latest go to see tonight is a call to prayer I know sometimes when you're praying in public that a lot of times you get nervous because somebody's gonna hear you pray but I want you to pray I want you to pray till you reach God now you ain't got a shower but I want you to pray like never before God hears her prayer coming through the blood and the Prophet said that when you pray in the name of Jesus Christ it's the same as if Jesus himself is asking these things I put these scriptures before you I put these testimonies before you I put these things before you because we serve a living God and we're expecting to live in God to show up and as we sing this song tonight I want you to sing it with all your heart and I want you to open your heart and I want you to believe for the impossible Oh oh hey [Music] and receiving [Music] is he we're stealing [Applause]

blood pressure has seemed to be spiking so we're I'm directing you in prayer I'm not telling you negative things I'm telling you things that that you as a body can change by prayer this is a call to prayer let us pray in the name of Jesus as I pray you pray if you believe whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you shall receive them and you shall have it Almighty God we come to you in the name of the Lord the Lord that is most high father your scripture says blessed is the man that cometh in the name of the Lord blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord that is the language of the bride that is the language of the priesthood o God we stand here tonight as the ranch soon as the redeemed we stand here as a body we stand here as believers father we're in a moment father when we need somebody bigger than ourselves to show up we need a God who in working in our myths we need a way maker we need a promise keeper we need the light in the darkness to show up father you have called us to pray Lord Jesus and this is where we're at we do not real up they're not reluctant in our prayer and we're not backing up in our prayer we're not defeated in a prayer life but we stand here is mighty Conqueror we're persuaded that neither death nor life shall be able to separate us from the things of God principalities can't separate us Cygnus Gates separators principalities and angels and demons and powers can't separate us O God we come to you tonight Lord Jesus we're a body of believers that are looking to you the author and the finisher of our faith the Bible says that our help is in the name of the Lord you told us that you were the God that hears all of our diseases Lord Jesus we stand here father you called us to stand in this hour we look over in the Book of Revelations and we see a mighty angel standing up before I came to this pulpit I asked it that's a mighty angel would wrap his arms around me as a son and lift me hold me up Lord Jesus and I believe that their same being that was in the room that night and said let's stand is in this room tonight and you call their people to stand up in their faith stand up in their prayers stand up in their belief this is a time this is the time to believe like never before and ask like never before but the team has commissioned us as a man of God to believe for the extreme things because he's the god of extreme things he's the god of the miracles he's the God that is a healer Healing comes from You Lord Jesus we've watched miracle after miracle through this whole process Lord and Satan would like to keep us looking down but we're looking up father do the things that you have done we're looking unto you father in this moment Lord our pastor needs a real touch a pastor Lord Jesus his peripherals has not returned yet but father by the word of the Lord we believe father that you said ask and you shall receive father I'm asking father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray that by the way a prayer father by the way of intercession for all there I pray Lord Jesus accompany your holy presence okay and I lift up the name of Ron Spencer and I prayed that the Spirit of the Living God would begin to move Father into that brain Lord and I pray that you would release that sight in the name of Jesus Christ I pray that your releases were if you'll slide he's happy to be alive he's happy to be serving you he's happy to give the devil black eye one more time but while he's here father I believe that you said that we will prosper and be in good health I believe that we can live in that moment I believe that we can live in that spot I believe father his soul has prospered for so many years a father I'm asking in the name of Jesus Christ that you give him back his sight that he can look right into the eyes of the enemy and spit in his eyes and say Satan is that all you got Almighty God we are standing against this flow of kids sir they tell us that melanoma is the fastest growing breed of kids of that there is but we stopped cancer in its tracks in the name of Jesus Christ we say melanoma you got to leave in the name of Jesus Christ we say immunotherapy work like never before in the name of Jesus Christ we agree as a body father that he shall live and not die he shall live and not die he shall live and not now father you have commissioned us to stand you have commissioned us to ask you have commissioned us to believe father there's a body around the world that is standing with us this has been a commission to the body that is some part of the headship and the Prophet said she's not sitting down she's standing to her feet this broad like never before I'd hate to say how many thousands of people have been praying but God your body if they know that name they have been speaking that name Ron Smith sir they've been claiming healing for him they've been claiming the miraculous for him and I pray in the name of Jesus that we would see those Saints Lord you've not forgotten one of those prayers all the way from the littlest child of five years old four years old three years old that knows how to speak has spoke that name and they have been singing the devil don't light no praise it around here we don't care what the devil don't lie we're gonna praise of all of our mind Lord Jesus you have seen every prayer you've seen it in their prayer closet you see when the enemy told them they shouldn't pray that he wasn't gonna come to pass but they broke through and pray that they pressed the battle they went into service for the king they went into their war room because they heard a prophet saying that there's no greater weapon given unto them like prayer and they have been praying they have been asking they have been speaking in tongues they have been moving in the spheres of realms they have been throwing all kinds of mustard seeds at this mountain this is a mountain that is not just standing in front of the Spencer family or in front of Full Gospel lighthouse this is a mountain that is standing in front of the bride of Jesus Christ now God this is my prayer I want every person that's prayed I pray that you pour out a blessing like never before I pray you're filling with the Holy Ghost like never before I pray that you turn on them like never before I pray that you'd Immelman increase from the heavenly slack never before Lord Jesus you're the God that owns the cattle on a Thousand Hills father you see where they're out of their life you're the god you're the God who is here's a God that will be when there is no more Satan when there is no more demons you will still be God but when there is no more sickness we will still be standing father we need you in the South we need to father we have left the boat we have walked out on the water we heard you bidding us to come this said be not afraid it is our and we as the body of Jesus Christ have stepped out on the water unafraid father we're walkin to you if you opt out of it we're gonna walk to I pray you bring us all back into the boat father safely I pray we turn our eyes towards you father the father now I come to you we've asked for a slight back and you're giving it back in Jesus name a father now I come to you on this blood pressure and I pray father you're the God that created the heart you're the God that put the blood through the veins or God I believe this royal blood that's flowing down from Calvary over that body just now have to bring it subject to the Word of God I pray you bring that blood pressure under control if the science can tell us it that because of the blood pressure and all of this that it causes pain and father I pray your Lord even so Lord we begin to pray before service and his pain was an 8 out of 10 and men that were called to pray his pain dropped from a 6 out of 10 now God what I'm asking father that you drop that pain from zero that's nothing too hard for you Lord Jesus there's nothing too hard for you thank God I heard the Prophet say that there's healing in a body doctors can aid doctors can set bones doctors can go in and cut doctors can remove the healing comes from you we've already glorified and magnified the name of heaven there's no name like the name of Jehovah there's no name like I got cut up free are free for the recovery of my pastor I pray amend his body saving this for the human destroy Satan is for that he killed Satanist swore that he'd take his life but God you are the God that is God [Music] I pray you do the work and only you can do we as a body we as the church that's our leadership that's our pastor Lord how many times father has he's been given a vision from the Lord that was so specific for this body of believers and I'd say that if they could raise their hand that they could raise their hand in the natural would say that it was that it was a vision that was meant for me and that leadership told me to do such-and-such and I did it just because I received it in though as a word of the Lord and he came to pass the Father you have given us a vision the Prophet told us every time we look into the word that we have seen a vision Alleluia he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by His stripes Ron Switzer is healed father we just see the vision as a body of believers switches on the television we've seen what's coming to pass father the father they have removed him from the ICU to a step-down unit boy the father raised that you remove him as you see fit father Lord Jesus he has told me personally that until I'm able to stand behind this pulpit that I'm gonna coach you and I'm gonna preach to you and I'm gonna I'm gonna advise you and I'm gonna stand behind you and I'm gonna give every power scripture and every power quote that we can throw at this demon so Satan I want you to hear me loud and clear not water I want you to look at us as the body our heads are hanging high they're not hanging down when you looked upon us and you thought that we were about to say it's over and it looked like we were about to say that it's all God we lifted our head and said a man you thought we were defeated but we lived in our head and said a man and we have come out victorious but how small things have looked things that we thought were so big in daily life had become so small you've made us allow allowed us to realize how precious life is but God standing at this altar is a people that have need they have need of you standing around this alters newborn babes in Christ that need an old-fashioned and the cost of experience they can come here like here every scripture here of a quote and here of a story we're not here to give him head knowledge we're here to lead them to an old-fashioned Holy Ghost revival in their soul and I pray that you give it to him I was speaking to a man today in the West Indies he was testifying to me today about the god of creation that that called his nervousness when he started here in the word of the Lord and it was asking for a Pentecost in his life I told him you don't have to wait you can have that right now my father sitting around this church is people that need an old-fashioned filling of the Holy Ghost and I pray you give it to him in Jesus name father I pray there's those that have need of loved ones to return and I pray that we as we display the token over our household we send the Holy Ghost out to him just now and I pray that you return the prodigal Lord you know where they're at and no other standing offering you go and get them you see those that are afflicted with blood pressure issues and diabetes father I pray you give them perfect health in the name of Jesus father I look out upon a body and the reason why we have called this moment of Prayer is because this people's faith it's higher than it's ever been before Lord I have I have walked into a conference when I stepped in this pulpit I I felt the pulsation of the Holy Ghost and the people's faith to reach out and touch an omnipotent God or all we needs the least but a touch of you I pray father these things we've asked father we ask them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a God you know where the road is going to take us in life you know where we're gonna walk but I pray as David said in Lourdes my footsteps that I might not sleep now lord I I bring to you just now my precious mother who's been a champ God you see the burden that she carries I pray for I pray the angels of the Lord when he came about her for me I pray you strengthen her father I pray you carry her father we as a family father we need that special touch father I pray that you would strengthen us or Jesus I pray father that you administer life peace health confidence for I pray that you stir up our pure minds by the way of remembrance for Jesus I pray the testimony after testimony would come out of this battle father I look out across this congregation Lord Jesus and I see miracles something has happened I look out across his congregation by the way of faith that I look upon a little lady that moved here about a year and a half ago that had a lump in her stomach it started like it great then moved to the size of a lemon moved to his size of a grapefruit in a matter of seconds be removed that grapefruit [Music] Lord Jesus because a daughter of God recognized the power of who she is and the power of the word of God we said here father we brother Healing Touch come across his congregation oh Jesus you see our weary hearts you see those that have asked how much longer how much more do we have to go through how much more do we have to battle how much more do we gotta go through Lord you ain't promised us a flower a bit of ease but you promised to set your grace is sufficient father we don't ask why we ask who Satan has attacked us [Music] but if you are before me who can be against me you promised us that no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper it tells us that there's a weapon that's trying to kill us trying to steal us of a pastor trying to destroy us as a people but it shall not prosper oh god I pray that you would anoint our faith you said that if if we'd have faith in God we would speak to this mountain and it would be moved God I stand here I stand here as a man of God commissioned by the word of the Lord to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you said for me to cast out demons in the name of Jesus Christ you said that all of these signs shall follow them that believe there's a body of believers that are touching their neighbor laying hands on their neighbors and you see father that there's a pillar of fire that's moving in this realm Lord Jesus the night before father we gathered in a room a hospital room and there was a being that was standing in that room and the pillar of fire was visible father Lord and you are telling us that you're going to bring us through you told us to stay and father I pray that this people's faith father would sure like a never-before sword to the heavenlies and grab a hold of the promises that's for me that's for me mama ask me mama that's Midea mama that's me that reflection is me father although Jesus will be careful to serve your praise you glorify the god of now Satan I want you to get ready you're about to lose you're a

that mamba was about to strike that the angel told him if you be more sincere you can bind it we bond it in the name of Jesus Christ you have the power to loosen but I'm not willing to loose this
