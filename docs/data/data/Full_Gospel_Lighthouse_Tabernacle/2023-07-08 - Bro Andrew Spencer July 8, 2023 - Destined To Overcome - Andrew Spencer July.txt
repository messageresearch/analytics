brother Nathan Erickson Brother Ray Erickson's grandson becoming a minister unto us there on Saturday night and we're just looking unto the Lord there and brother Nathan is such a wonderful wonderful brother and powerful powerful preacher and so we're just looking looking under the Lord and excited to have these young men to come and bear the message brother Branham said that they've be coming and they're on their Road and we see that prophecy being fulfilled and and he's been a real friend to me over the years and uh and I've just been real real real friend and so we're looking forward to having him so would want to be remembered next next Saturday also I know it's already been announced in literally a little you rise here tonight and the way we're going we're getting a new baby every weekend and uh so we're gonna build this church one way or another here so so happy to have happy to have little Uriah here and uh me and Dad were talking on the way to church all the all the Angels names were taken so they named in your eyes so they could have called him wormwood but that would have been a little bit different you know so but we're just we're just tickled and uh to have every one of you here tonight let's just go to the Lord in prayer how many has a need that you'd like to make known unto the Lord let's just go to the Lord Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord we recognize the Lord that your presence is is reigning Supreme in this place father for we have come and we've surrendered our own Lord we we stand here and we witness Lord Jesus that the one of the greatest signs a surrender is lifting up our hands and Lord we we dedicate and surrender our life to you like never before we have needs in our life and we surrender everything to the god that is making a way for us and Lord we just ask Lord that you would come tonight Lord your children have gathered here and we're reminded father that in the scriptures that you said that that if there were two or three gathered in my name there you would be in the midst of them now father we know that this one brought a lick of fire and this one brought a lick of fire so we watch as we witness the children of God begin to gather they're gathering around the message of the hour they're gathering around the revealing of the son of man we recognize that it is you that have came and you have come to be minister or two through your body tonight and we would ask Lord that you would just begin to take the word of life and begin to separate it unto our hearts Lord Lord a portion of the scripture father is all that we desire Lord that would be a benefit unto us so that we could be a blessing under the kingdom of God lord we're not here upon our own accord we're not here Lord seeking man's favor or man's Wisdom but we're here seeking favor with the most high God because Lord we don't really care what men say or what men do we simply care about the God of heaven and your desire father upon our life and I ask Lord that these needs that have been lifted up unto you as a sign of surrender that we recognize that you're God I ask Lord that you administer to them tonight and I know that there's many needs here seeking the Holy Ghost many financial and job situations and there's other needs that are here Lord physical needs Lord we just ask Lord that you be God tonight and Lord will be your children you just spoke to you spoke to Moses you said let me be your God let me be your God and you be my Prophet now father you be our God and we'll be your people we love you and appreciate you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in the last book of the Bible over in the Book of Revelations Revelations chapter 3. Revelations chapter 3 and verse 20. Revelations chapter 3 and verse 20 and say Amen when you have it this evening amen behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith under the churches may God bless his word he may be seated here in the presence of the Lord another random said in this message how can I overcome he said overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks he said a lot of people say there is no devil and he said it they say it's just a thought don't you believe that he said there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil and then the same time that you recognize him know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that is in you has already overcome him and by his grace you are more than a match for him amen There's real overcoming when you recognize There's real overcoming when you recognize that the god that is in you is greater than the enemy that is attacking you tonight I would like to speak to you on on a thought just for a few minutes on destined destined to overcome and Jesus said these in John 16 and 33 he said these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I I have overcome the world and that powerful tonight to know that that whatever we face that I our Lord Jesus Christ I have overcome the world it doesn't matter what we stack up against us or what all the odds that might be against us I have overcome the world and Jesus is saying to us in the unbelieving world you're going to have trouble you're going to have you're going to have Sorrows but I want you to be courageous There's real peace in me I want you to be courageous in knowing that I have conquered the world for you I have conquered the world for you isn't that powerful tonight to know that there's nothing that we can come up against there's nothing that we could face that our Lord Jesus Christ hasn't already conquered now brother random said in the mark of the beast he said there's going to be a group a p of people that's going to be marked for Destiny and hell and there's going to be a people that's smart for their Eternal Destiny in heaven and he said those two marks run side by side so we recognize that Jesus would tell us as he's closing out the hours of his ministry here on Earth two thousand years ago he said that that the Antichrist would go about and it would it would it would go out and it would try to deceive the very elect if it was possible so we recognize that the Christ Spirit and the Antichrist spirit that they run so close together but you are a people that have a destiny that is not a destiny unto hell but you have a destiny that is built and you have a destiny that is going to heaven again in the great Shining Light he said it gives us consolation to know this that we don't hold our own destiny god holds our destiny and he has ordained it to be so and there's nothing that will ever interrupt the program of God we are bound to arrive and we recognize that the Holy Ghost is a seal it is a it is a seal of promise when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the Seal of God's covenant upon your life that he has accepted you as your faith in him but it is a seal that is a seal that you are sealed until the day of your Redemption so so Jesus when you receive the Holy Ghost he seals you to your destination it's just like a boxcar that's loaded up and it's it's loaded up and the inspector goes through and he looks over that he he sees everything that it's not rocked out of its place it's not Tipsy Topsy like the rest of the world but it's real settled in there because the inspectors went through it so he puts the seal of approval on it that it's built to go down the road and stand the test of time you see you are that kind of people that God has designed and destined to be a people that is sealed until the day of your Redemption and what a privilege it is tonight to know that you are carrying not the mark of the Antichrist but you are carrying the very Mark of the word of the Lord and it is by the hearing of the ear that you have put your faith into action Hallelujah you are a destined people that's destined for destination and your destiny is not hell remember the Brandon brother Branham on time he was he was in his early Ministries and he was he was speaking and he had a vision while he was in his hotel room that there was a little bitty girl a blonde-headed girl that was that was about yay tall he said and he said he said she was about ye Tony and he said I watched her he said I watched her as she as she was she was destined to be in a car wreck he said and he said a great big black automobile come running down the road and killed her he said but in the vision the angel told me have prayer for that child that this would be bypassed and the angel told him said you're going to hear about this two or three days afterwards he said he come to find out that the very hour that the vision was taking place he said there he said that girl he said that girl barely escaped death at that moment you see what the power of prayer did there there was a Destiny for her to go buy a car wreck but there was an angel that was standing there and said pray for that girl and to think that tonight that the power of prayer changed the very destiny that God had already seen and you don't know necessarily what happened or what come about of those things but you don't realize sometimes that the thing that you're praying about has a generational blessing that is behind it you don't know exactly who that woman was but she wasn't killed in that accident maybe she raised daughters maybe she raped sons that became to begin to preach the very power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ you don't know what happened but there was a generational blessing that could not be stopped by the curse of death I think about my own life tonight how Hell tried to Railroad my life and try to destroy my life but there was a God that was greater than hell that tried to send a train to my tracks and try to run me over and kill me if he would have got a hold of me he'd have stopped my daughters from getting here it's the same way with any of you if hell could have had its way it would have had the whole world because if he could get a son and daughter of God he would have the very power of life in it and if he gave watch you it'd have the whole world but we are a people that are not destined to be the children of Satan but we are destined to be the children of the most high God hail can't railroad you hell can't stop you it's because you're destined to live a life for almighty God Hallelujah I love that when that when we go to reading over in in the in their last in the last book of Mark that that there we see that at the rising of the Sun that Jesus appeared to a woman that was full of mistakes at one time in her life that he appeared unto her and out of the one that he cast seven now and Seven Devils out of and it's amazing that God would show himself to a woman of that stature but she was the very first one that he would show himself alive to there in the garden and you notice that that when when Mary begins to take the message back to her disciples and her brothers and sisters that the Bible said in Mark 16 when she began to witness these things that they believe not you're not amazing but here is the most powerful people on Earth that's been with the Messiah been with the anointed one but they believe not and then Jesus appears to those on the road to Emmaus that they are there they appeared unto them and when they came back to the company they told them of the story of what Jesus had done there and the Bible said and neither they believe thee them but there was a certain hour there was a certain hour that Jesus came and he appeared unto the eleven as they were sitting down there at meat and the Bible said that he'll braided them for their unbelief and their Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after his resurrection or after he was risen I think it's a very powerful thing that Jesus Takes a people that he condemns them for their unbelief he takes them a people who does not believe and then he turns around and because the word of the Lord corrects the error in every single one of our Lives Jesus immediately takes a people that were full of doubt and the people that were full of unbelief any commissions those same people those same people that just just denied him didn't believe what the others had said but he takes a people and he tells them go into all the world and baptize him in my name that these signs shall follow them that believe in my name you'll cast out devils in my name you can take up serpents in my name you can drink any deadly thing and it shall not harm you it's amazing what the very power of the word will do when it takes a hold of a chosen vessel's life now you know what I'm talking about because you're not the same one that you was you see it's amazing what he can do in a matter of a minute he comes and changes their lives from doubters to people raising paralytics from people that are deniers to people that are silencing the crowds of theologians and intellectual Minds from men that are cussers to tongue talkers the ability of the word of God has destined you for greatness you can go to read in Acts chapter 17 you'll find that the Bible declares that these people are those that turned the world upside down you see these were destined to overcome the very powers of hell but you see he didn't choose a perfect people he didn't choose a people that he didn't choose a people that had great names to him he didn't choose people of great little letter uh of intellects of that mind he chose the illiterate he chose the cast down he chose to reject it what did he do he chose a gentile people a pagan worshiper people that were a heathen Nations men that were cut off from God they were without Mercy they were without hope they were idle worshipers and they were on their way to a devil's hail and on their way to a sinner's grave but because the Bible said that he would take a people out of the Gentiles for his namesake he was coming for a people but they denied him but he came and said I'm going to take a people that will honor my name they will respect my name they will give glory to my name that's what William Branham said in the Statue of a perfect man Christ didn't send me to build he didn't send me to build a denomination but he sent me to build individuals to be a Powerhouse under the most high God men that would be Sons and Daughters of almighty God he may not have chose the best of the world but he chose the best in God because he elected you and for ordained you and destined you before the foundation of the world you see that's what God's doing today you were a people that was away from God and people that didn't know God but God is raising up a generation in this hour that will honor his name that will respect his name they know there ain't no other name given amongst men where men should be saved but by the name of Jesus Christ and you are exactly what the son of man is looking for said right you right you see there's a Divine intelligence that's looking out upon the elect and the unelected this generation you look at somebody and you take the word of God in your life you put it upon your lips and you watch that word of God how it's lived out of your life but you take somebody down the road have that same scripture but they can't live it out what is it it's not inspired of him to live out the scripture of that hour but to you that have been ordained to life you have been there is a Divine intelligence that is watching over your life that knows the difference between seed and non-seed how did you get here it's because the gene seed of God who is laying on the inside of your heart you look at you look at what the Bible said in Romans chapter 9 and 11 it tells us that before the children were ever born God loved Jacob and he hated Esau before Esau could do the right things before Jacob could ever make the right choices Jacob loved God loved Jacob because Jacob was a man yeah he wasn't no good yeah he was a shyster yeah he was a yeah he was a he was a bad dude he was full of shenanigans but Jacob had a desire he longed for the birthright and God loves the people that long after the Holy Ghost you see there was something that was there on the inside of Jacob we would say in Psalms 47 that it was a deeper of Psalms 42 that it was a deep that was calling to the Deep on the inside of Jacob that was going into operation why didn't Esau have it on the inside of him it's because God elected Jacob to have it God ordained Jacob to have it when it looked like the more righteous one was Esau when it looked like he was a better man when he looked more religious than anybody else he had a desire Jacob did lied to his father put on the coat of a goat walked in there and got the blessing Hallelujah because he was willing to sell out everything of the world just to get the birthright but you notice he saw he always does the same thing he will sell out his misapottage he'll sell out for a mess of pottage and he'll deny the very Holy Ghost you watch it watch what brother random says here he said the carnal believer today oh as long as I go to church and do what's and do what's right what difference does it make he said that's the Esau group he still makes fun and despises the birthright he doesn't care for it but Jacob loved it and the spiritual man today and the spiritual woman that's elected predestinated of God to come to eternal life if they have to sell everything they got if they got to take their names off of the every Church book in the nation still they want that Birthright it's the only thing that matters to them just get that Birthright that's all no matter how or what level they have to come on if they have to get down at the altar and cry and boohoo if they have to run through the places and go back and make things right and sell what they got or give away everything that they have and become a pilgrim and a stranger it don't matter they want that Birthright that's all they're interested in the birthright now I love this he said but don't you blame them people they can't help it they're predestinated to that they're elected to that don't you blame us when we get excited under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost when we get excited get emotional because the word don't you blame us we're elected to do it [Applause] we're elected to tear Satan's kingdom down we're elected to live this message don't blame us call us holy rollers tell us we lost a mind I don't care what you call them they're seeking that Birthright that means more to them than anything else they're after that Birthright no matter how they have to get it they are ready to get it it doesn't matter what you say about us it doesn't matter if you if you're standing there when Noah's up here and he was sitting there he said well you know what I said God said it's going to rain I better I better go out there and I better start building me an art just in case it does rain no Noah was under the inspiration he was under the inspiration of the word of the Lord and he went out there and started building an ark and people were calling him crazy they called him a Holy Roller but that didn't bother Noah he just kept on building and preaching you say Well they're all after your brother Andrew they say the message is dead and gone they can say what they want to but I'm building this Ark I'm getting in this heart of the Holy Ghost what was it Jacob had a knowledge of the birthright he knew what was laying in the blessings of the birthright you see the transfer of that Birthright to Jacob it meant that that Birthright secured to him who possessed it a superior rank in the family the possession of that Birthright was a double portion of the paternal inheritance in Deuteronomy 21 and 17 it tells us that he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the firstborn is his so you acknowledge the firstborn by giving him a double portion notice What God Says in Numbers chapter 8 and 17 that all the firstborn of the children of Israel they're mine so God has something special for the firstborn there is a certain possession that is for the firstborn and Paul recognized the rights of the firstborn when he was standing there in Hebrews chapter 12 and 22 that you are coming to Mount Zion and under the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn what was Paul recognizing that you were not the second point but you're the first boy you received a kingdom that cannot be shook down what am I saying to you it's your god-given right to the double portion that's why Elisha asked for it that's why Elijah put himself in first place he recognized the power and the rank what did he do Elisha asked for the double portion before he ever seen the miracle you know good and well what you've been asking for what you've been asking for a double portion you've been asking for the Holy Ghost you've been asking for this situation and before you've seen the miracle you begin to ask for the double portion it's your god-given right for the double portion but brother random said in second-handed robe he said there's an if laying in there that if you see me when I go that you'll have this double portion brother random said he said if you chase it down he said there's an if laying in there in Mark chapter 9 and 23 if thou can'tst believe all things are possible to them that believe there's an if in there but we are destined to win the battle oh good lord of Mercy it's your legal possession William Branham said aren't you happy tonight to know that you're baptized in the Church of the firstborn of the Living God that the very same spirit that was in Christ is in the church and you are part of it by the Holy Ghost being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise he said what are you scared about what are you scared about all devils in Hell couldn't shake you why can't they shake you you're the Church of the firstborn you received a kingdom that cannot be shook Hallelujah we know what that word overcome means it means to conquer it means the Vanquish it means to subdue as as to overcome an enemy in the battle it means to get the better off Hallelujah Hallelujah it means to overcome difficulties it means to overcome obstacles it means overflow and it means the surcharge it means to come upon and it means to invade and there is an army of hell that has come against the Church of the Living God but we are here to invade the enemy's camp and take back what is rightfully ours as the elect and Jean seed of God we are facing every devil out of hell you know that when the seals were released that two hundred thousand thousand demons were released out of the river of Euphrates right here in Satan's Eden God's choosing some Overcomers God's choosing a people that are predestinated to life come on somebody you may not look right to the world you may not act like to the world but God chose you right here in Satan's Eden God's Building a body God's putting his very own life in there what did he do he dropped the headship of the knowledge of Jesus Christ right into the body and you know all the way back there in the Garden of Eden that there we know that there will be enmity between the seeds of the woman's seed and the serpent seed and you watch out of every Revival there comes two twins you notice it comes twins out of every Revival Abel and Cain he saw when Jacob Jesus and the Antichrist Jesus and Judas look at the anointed one now and the false anointed one what is it the conflict is continuing through every Revival now you watched right here tonight there's the power of faith that is operating in here at the free moral Familia free moral agency of your soul that you are choosing to believe it's amazing what is happening in this room you don't even feel it you may not even see it but there is a people that is making a choice and what does it do it causes the pillar of fire to circle the building when somebody goes into conflict with the power of Satan and they say amen I believe that what is it we are right here in Satan's Eden but we're not here to be silenced and we're not here to be shut up we're here to put our faith in action and right here in the realm of your soul you are selling your destiny by the power of the word oh come on don't get out of here devil we say what are you doing brother Angel I'm simply preaching a word and if I can preach the word and your faith can be built up to believe that you're destined to overcome every Cancer cell every demonic power every situation what are you doing brother Angel you're working or something no I'm just preaching it down and if I can preach it down it'll preach you up what are you doing brother Andrew I'm simply preaching what William Branham told us to preach but you don't understand how dark it is brother Andrew sure I do sure I do before you ever got here God had a prophet on the scene and told us how dark of a day that we're living in you notice what brother random Mooney begins to address the Church of the Living God in 1964 he begins to address the church he said now notice he said my my New Year's message is to the church elected in Jesus Christ he said not just a church group but the elect the elect Lady of the church Christ bride he said that's who I'm addressing but William Branham goes back in there and he breaks in to the ultimate Old Testament and he goes in there to Isaiah 60 and 1. arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee but notice what William Branham said he said but there is a contrast that is going on it's a mystery of life and darkness verse 2 says and there would be gross darkness that would come upon the land and be upon the people hallelujah hallelujah but the Lord shall arise upon me and His glory shall be seen upon thee what is it we are living right here in the blending of time and the blending of Eternity what is it he said that's my address to the church it's dark out there brother Andrew I know that it's a mixed up world out there I know that but William branham's message to you is Shalom but be of good cheer I have overcome the world he is still Jehovah shalom he is my peace when there is no peace in the world he is my refuge when there is no place to hide in the world he is my everything Hallelujah notice it's powerful he said we're living here in the most chaotic times of Darkness he said that we've ever stood in but yet we're standing in the Most Blessed light that ever did Shine what am I saying to you I'm saying there's a man that's here to turn on the light you see it's dark around here I know it's dark but as a man it's getting dark in my situation it's getting dark to my sickness but there is a man I'm going through layout of seeing it's dark all around me it looks like the world's corrupted more and more every day it's dark but there's a man how can you have peace by I'll tell you how we can have peace it's because surely the Lord will do nothing unless he reveals himself to the secrets and secrets to the prophets foreign you are the most powerful people on the face of the Earth hell's upset every demon in hell is running after you but you're in peace come on somebody you don't get upset at Fox News you don't get upset at CNN what is it it's a message to you shalom Shalom arise and shine don't get your eyes don't see anything don't get your eyes on the world arise let the glory of the Lord rest upon you come on somebody lift your head out of the gutter lift your head out of sickness lift your head out of troubles you're not an Earthbound chicken you're an eagle arise oh let God arise and let his enemies be scattered come on Old sleeper arise and shine come on now a Waco champion Hallelujah he said from an Earthbound sickness he said we're breaking over the horizontal realm it's breaking in between Mortal and immortality he said it's breaking Between Heaven and Earth from an Earthbound sickness to a tri and a troubled world and bringing in The Shining day of immortal life and Immortal body and Immortal Earth that never shall pass away what are you so excited about there's one man I'm counting on it ain't Joe Biden and it ain't Donald Trump it ain't Mr Putin in Russia I'm counting on a man that ain't never lost a battle Shalom Church Shalom arise and shine stop hiding in the darkness stop hiding in that sickness stop hiding in your turmoil oh blessed be the name of the Lord arise and shine you're destined to overcome this message is not riding on William Branham this message is riding on one man all the gospel all the message is riding on one man on one day we're waiting on Sunday because if he don't get up out of the Grave he was simply like everybody else but if he gets up we recognize he's got the power over death and he's got the power over life that's what he's to proved to us that he wasn't only the word but it was the Dynamics in the word he can take a cold dead body laying there in his former condition and he can breathe life into it and say I am he that was dead and I Am Alive forevermore and I have the keys of death and Hell oh come on now where is that Old Slew Foot where is that old Goliath where is that old demon that keeps raising his head come on now don't you walk down that Valley afraid walk down there with peace over you come on Daniel walk into that Lion's Den with peace over your life you'll be able to rise up in the morning and say oh king I said I'd see you in the morning what is it it's peace to the Church of the Living God everybody recognized it they tried to hide him in a tomb they tried to seal it up there with a Roman seal but there's only one seal that can't be broken and it's a seal of the Holy Ghost and Satan cannot break that seal he can try to cover you up with sin he can try to cover you up with lies he can try to cover up your family history of DNA things back there but Easter proved he was great enough to cover all of your sins that's what William Branham said in the message of restoration of laboratory he said what was it he said he said Easter means to restore back to bring it back and he said there that Little Flower clings it's got a right to rise again it's got a right to rise again that's what Easter claims for you today you got a right to rise where the world says I shouldn't be I shouldn't be happy but you got a right to it come on somebody you look at everybody in the world man they are so depressed and shook up their heads hanging low they gotta look at the stock markets they get upset if it's down and get upset if it's high and they didn't buy they're upset but you've got a right to be happy whether it's up or whether it's down come on somebody it's Easter I got a right to rise out of every sickness it's Easter I gotta rise awry I got a right to rise out of calamities it's Easter come on now you gotta right to rise out of your sickness you got a right to rise out of your job situation what are you talking about shalom Shalom what was it it's Easter it's the rising of the sun notice when Jacob Jacob knew there was a blessing with the birthright and when he got on the other side of the river and he's over there wrestling with the angel what was it he said tell me what your name is he said I'm not going to let you go until you bless me because Jacob knew that there was a blessing that was coming with the birthright it may not have seemed like Jacob was blessed but when he got in this conference with an angel and he said I'm not going to let you go till you bless me there's that kind of people that are sitting here tonight Lord I'm not going to let you pass by my way don't you pass me alone don't you leave me where I am I ain't gonna let you go until you bless me what was it the Bible said it was at the breaking of the day that the angel touched Jacob that he was no longer Jacob but he was Israel what is this it is a rising of the sun it's Sunday again oh blessed be the name of the Lord what are you talking about I'm talking about the people that are not a part of this world chaos notice what Paul says here in Colossians 3 when he writes the letter to the Colossians he said If any man or if you then been risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on the things for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God everybody all right when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory now notice he said now mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil can keep a sense in covetness which is idolatry for things for which things seek the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience in the which he also walked sometime when you lived in them but now you are also put off oh no but now ye also put off this anger put off these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one unto another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in the knowledge after the image him that created him now when William Branham preaches images of Christ he stands there he said he said the person that's dealing with sickness he said they're the person that needs attention there the person who needs attention and he said you look at this whole world he said he said you see them he said you see them they're big eyes and a little use he said he said you see them he said the people that need attention is the ones that are sick the sickest ones are the ones that need attention he said but you watch he said what it is he said it's spiritual anemiath that is upon the people he said what it is he said he gets somebody that's anemic that's got low blood he said they need a transfusion he said you watch somebody that's low on blood he said they get tipsy Topsy and they wobble back and forth and you watch people that'll wobble back and forth between faith and doubt what is it they need a blood transfusion that came from Calvary what will it do it'll make you stable in the word it'll make you steadfast in your faith it'll make you unconquered by Traditions it'll make you stand here as a real overcomer but you got to put off the old and you gotta put on the new if you go to studying that out in the Greek it means to put off it means to lay aside it means to lay down it means to cast off but if you go to studying put on it means to be clothed with it means to be clothed in it means to have on it means to be endued it means to be a raid it means to be clothed in what do you do you put off the old you cast off the old that's why Paul was standing there in Hebrews chapter 12 and he said let us therefore lay aside put off lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset us and let us run this race with patience what are you doing the baptism of the Holy Ghost is your wedding garment and you put it on you cast off the old man and you put on the new that's what Jesus said when he was standing there in Luke 24 and 49 he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry you in the city until you be endued with power don't you go nowhere until you're being dude well I'm ready to witness have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed be and do to put on the power what did he say in Romans 13 and 12 that the night is far spent and the day is at hand let us therefore put off cast off the works of darkness and let us put on oh let us put on the arm of light arise and shine for thy light has come but put ye on the Lord Jesus and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust put it off it keeps weighing me down put it off come on somebody you know good and well you can't swim with somebody sitting on your back all day you got you're carrying burdens on your life cast that thing off come on somebody get weighed down by laodicea cast that thing off come on now you're not destined to carry that thing put it off of you depression put it off of you anxiety put it off of you pain in your body put it off of you what am I saying to you put on now come on now Christianity ain't some put on that you just wear it on Sunday come on now put it on on Sunday and take it off on Monday Christianity is a new relationship with a father with a god of Heaven you don't put on Christianity and take it off you put off the old man but you put on the new he don't never wear out he don't ever struggle your own nature struggles within things but the nature of Jesus Christ cannot struggle with sin of this world put it off so you can put it on one of these mornings in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last trip for the trumpeter of shall sound and the dead and Christ shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal shall put on immortality so when the corruptable has put on Icarus and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass a saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory so what am I saying to you that the Dynamics of the groom is being endued with power getting it like that one that's what William Branham said and what shall I do with Jesus he said the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit come on now Jacob you know you're born for it get upset all you want to but you're born for it lie you want to but you're born for it mama says you can have it daddy says you can't have it but you're born for it the world says you can't have it but you're born for it you're built to be an overcomer right here right now I'm talking to a people that is not destined for destruction you're destined to receive the gift of almighty God brother man when he comes to this scripture of Revelations 3 in Ephesian church or in the church age book excuse me he said now what are we to overcome he said that is a normal question to ask here he said but that is not the actual thought of this verse he said it's not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome he said now that is logical for does it matter how much matter much what we are to come overcome as long as we know how we can overcome my brother Andrew I've been struggling real bad lately I've been serving the lord real hard lately and I just I had to go out and do a little bit of sin how am I going to be an overcomer how am I going to be a winner I feel like I go down to the Altar and I get a touch from the Lord but I still can't overcome how do you overcome the same way that Jesus overcome by applying the word of God to every situation come on now how many times have you walked to the altar how many times have I watched young girls and young boys walk to the altar with the same Condition it's because they never received nothing in the first place but if you can ever meet him one time if you can never meet the god that I'm hit You'll Never Walk Away the same way come on now there's no way that Jacob could not talk about his experience after he wrestled it out come on now you can sit there and say well I'm not going to tell nobody about my Holy Ghost let me tell you they'll notice about it they'll there's not a time that anybody didn't recognize that that Jacob had been touched by the angel why because the angel touched the inner part of his thigh that's where the promise is given that's where the covenant's at what did he do he walked different the rest of the days of his life you can say you're going to whisper about it say you're not going to tell nobody about it that's that's sure proof you never got nothing in the first place won't you be ashamed of him won't you be ashamed of your walk don't you be ashamed of your dress don't you be ashamed of how the message makes you talk you have been elected to rise above every situation and the only way they're going to be an overcomer is to live like Jesus lived and when the enemy comes in there when troubles arise take the word of God when sickness is screaming at you take the word of God when hell is turned loose on you take the word of God you have been chosen to rise above every demonic power foreign I'm not strong enough I wish you'd stop saying it I'm not good enough I wish you change your language I don't know if I can be called and I can be elected I wish you change your language because God has deposited a part of himself on the inside of you Abraham you may look like you're too old you may feel like you're too old but God deposited a part of himself on the inside of you that way you know you're going to make it you'll be able to produce an Isaac when Elohim gets done with you come on now you're going to be an overcomer because Elohim deposited a gene seed of God on the inside of you you have the genos of your father that is laying there you see your power is laying right there in the name Jehovah your power is laying right there in the name Jehovah because brother random tells us in the adoption series he said but in Genesis chapter 2 he said when he made man he said I am Jehovah what did it mean that I am the all-existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine he said oh why he gave Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is the father God and he made man to be an amateur God so he isn't self-existence anymore he exists with his family amen Helen Elohim now that is Jehovah Jehovah meaning that the one who exists now with his family so God made man to be predominant over all the Earth stop saying you can't do it because Jehovah said you could stop saying I'm not elect stop saying I'm not qualified Jehovah said you are God made man to be predominant over all of the Earth he was sitting there in a perfect paradise and she still failed she was still deceived but you're standing right here in Satan's Eden and you're overcoming what happened in Portland Oregon when that Maniac come running at him and said I'm gonna make you I'm gonna break every bow every bone in your body what did he do William Brown didn't back off of his promises he stood there and he loved that man he loved that man what was he he was predominant over all the Earth that Maniac could have said one thing he said but tonight William Branham said tonight you're going to Bow over my feet that man hauled off and spit in brother Brandon's face but when there came such a rush of the Holy Ghost he said Satan come out of the man and the man fell on William random's feet there was two police officers there standing there he said ASAP man delivered he said no he worships that thing and as long as you worship your sickness as long as you worship yourself pity party you're going to lay there in the same condition but if you can say Lord help me get up out of my condition break my power of hardness by The Power of Love love overcomes all things love prevails love knows no evil love sees no fault he said when I loved him it's powerful it's powerful and he said I stood there said could you roll them off my feet so I can go back to preaching and he said as I was saying I am the Lord thy God that heals all of thy diseases and he said all of a sudden somebody jumped out a wheelchair somebody jumped out of a God he said what was it he said all them little demons had watched the chief of the tribe of the Demons of Hell they'd seen that God accepted a challenge and the Demons of hailed the tribe of Hell had lost the challenge what was it it was a sign that all hell was conquered if you can conquer this one you can conquer it all and you are here and predominant over everything the Church of the Living God has the power to cast Satan down you are called to defeat the enemy and there is nothing going to stop you no sickness will hold you no depression will restrain you no devil will bind you no power in hell is going to stop you you are elected to bind the mama you are elected to bind that serpent you or a chosen generation a royal priesthood a people that was away from God but a people that is near to God and the word of God is in my mouth and it is powerful you don't know what I've been diagnosed with let me tell you a diagnosis is not a verdict we serve a God that dissolves nodules we serve a God that dissolves tumors we serve a God that can create squirrels we serve a God that can that can cast out Spirits we serve a God that can call down storms we consider a God that can raise up storms we are a people that have believed the report and the whom the arm of the Lord is revealed we believe this message we believe this power I've been diagnosed with a bad sickness you are commissioned to pray your commissioned to lay your hands on the sick your commission to believe come on now arise and shine out your unbelief arise and shock William Branham said never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it never let a negative thought pass through don't let it stop anyhow if it starts to keep your thoughts positive don't think sitting there in that wheelchair that you go you're hopeless and you're helpless you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through don't let it anchor you can't help it from going through your mind but don't let it stop there don't think that kind of negative thought don't let it go through your mind make every word positive and every thought positive again and while I'm praying and speaking I want every person in here to have this in your mind that as soon as your prayer as prayer begins to go for the sick every one of you is going to get up and walk out of here out of the building well don't have nothing else in your mind keep thinking that if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things you cannot get anything from God with a negative thought oh man I'm feeling good up here he that cometh the God must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek them you say well brother Andrew I thought I never could have thought I thought something wrong rethink that thought you're more than a match for Satan Satan's power is a limited he's like a dog on a chain he can only go so far he's got limited access to you you see if you're going to get into certain areas of certain locations you've got to have an access card and Satan does not have access to your soul once you are sealed until the day of your Redemption he can war with your mind he can war with your flesh but he cannot touch the gene seed of God because you're destined to win the battle you're destined to overcome you're destined to be healed you're destined for the Rapture you're destined to be an overcomer I am more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ who lives on the inside of me said he was with me and I believe him he said he'd go for me and I believe him he said he was behind me and I believe him Satan cannot touch one hair of my head I'm destined to win [Applause] come on marriages don't you give up on them you're destined to go through battles you're destined to go through struggles but fight if it's worth having it's worth fighting for you're destined to have it what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying Satan take your dirty hands off of God's Property he may attack you with tumors he may attack you with high blood pressure he may attack you with sugar diabetes he may attack you in your mind but remember he's just a dog on a chain and when God goes to holding them back take your hands [Applause] it can only go so far it can only touch you so much [Applause] the devil ain't got one legal right at all nowhere he's just the Devil he's just a password that's all he's got no legal right to any man that'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ he's whipped he's whipped in sickness he's whipped in disappointments he's whipped in everything he's whipped in death he can't scare me he can't scare you that's all he is a big old shadow he'll burn them I'm closing I'm closing brother random when he goes and preaches how can I overcome he said did you did you understand the arrangements of that scripture that he that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne he said he didn't say on my Throne he said but in my Throne he said a kingdom he said it is a domon a domain and he said he said a king a king it's his domain and he said his domain reaches from eternity to Eternity so I'm saying to you that we're right here at the blending of time and the blending of Eternity this is not Satan's domain you might be in Satan's Eden but this is not Satan's domain you don't have to live under his attacks you don't even have to live under his negative thoughts you don't have to live under his mindset you don't have to live under his criticism that can call you a Holy Roller that can always make fun but if they ever felt like we felt now look a king is not a a King Without a domain and if you do not let him reign in your heart he has no domain but the reason I'm preaching to you there is a domain it shows that there is a kingdom that is here the kingdom of sickness cannot Reign over top of your mortal bodies you're never too old for Divine Healing you're never do hold for a touch from the Lord William Bynum would say how are we going to believe in a Rapture if we can't even believe in Divine Healing he was not saying if you don't get if you get sick and you can't overcome it it does not mean that you're not going to make the Rapture he's saying to you how can you make the Rapture if you don't believe in Divine Healing and if you do believe in Divine Healing I got these old glasses right here and I have to wear them I have to wear contacts but just because I have to wear them does not mean that I don't believe in Divine Healing it just means I'm under a dynamic curse that I'm here I'm living under the fall of Adam but I believe in Divine Healing I believe that I can be healed I believe that all things are possible so I believe that I'm built for the rapture I believe your children can get the Holy Ghost I believe why not let peace reign in your heart [Applause] Hallelujah come on musicians somebody give the priest to almighty God you can live in peace in your kingdom come on Joshua put your foot on the king's head run them out of your cover run them out of your kingdom and show the devil who's boss that's what I'm talking about you're more than a match you're more than a match you're more than a match there's certain things certain things in your family history that are laying there in your DNA that are going to pass down through the lineage of your of your DNA they're just going to be there are things in my family heritage [Music] Family Heritage that I couldn't overcome on my own but there are things laying there in my spiritual DNA [Music] I never lost a battle according to my spiritual DNA there's never been a case too hard according to my spiritual DNA there's not a mountain too high according to my spiritual DNA there's not a valley too low that is according to my spirit your spiritual DNA but if I'm looking at my natural DNA there's a whole lot of things that are going to upset this old man right here that's why you got to put it off so you can put it on how many would say Lord bless me bless me and make me to be the Conqueror that you destined me to be [Music] Hallelujah are you Believers tonight amen why don't we sing that to him tonight we've been made more than conqueror [Music] over commerce in this life foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] we've been made [Music] us [Music] isn't he wonderful aren't you thankful to be

badge of authority [Music] he put on the badge of authority and 600 wasn't enough you were that kind of people you're more than a match for every philistine and every demonic power because well I don't feel like it that's all right that's why but when the spirit of the Lord gets to move and over your life what was the difference between Samson with the anointing without the anointing major difference but you have received a covenant a baptism of the Holy Ghost that is not like Samson's anointing it would come and it would go but the anointing that you have received is an Everlasting Covenant that's why you know you can't go to a devil's hell sure you're gonna get sick sure you're gonna go through troubles but it ain't gonna lead you to death because you already died it's going to lead you to perfect realization Heaven's a real place don't you want to go don't you want to go Heaven's a real place Heaven's a real place you're playing that song before church it's a Highway to
