atmosphere so good to be here with you we certainly love you with all of our hearts and it's any good isn't he so good maybe you could be seated just a moment if I could just take a moment of your time amen I believe there's a sister that's going to be baptized today is that is that correct if you could just put your hand up God bless you God bless you amen amen God bless you amen we're so glad to have the sea breezes with us and amen God bless you thank you amen we're so glad to have you a part of our family here and I certainly love you already and there's more to come so God bless you so good to be here it's a very special day for myself and this is the anniversary of when I was burned and we know what a miracle that took place a few weeks later and for those that don't know the doctors had give up and and they had already said non-responsive for 36 hours and brother miskel had felt led of the Lord to call Sister Con in that I would be the speaker at the next year's camp meeting and the speaker she held onto those words and the Lord had dealt with him in a very early morning God spoke to him what a moment that was and he relayed that to Sister Connie and she would hear many times that no way he could live for God had greater purpose God had greater purpose and they were going to harvest my organs in five hours and and today is an anniversary and we look back on it and brother Tim Pruitt came that weekend and spoke to you God will have a testimony I'm sure when he stepped to the stage that day and myself being non-responsive the devil was whispering in his ears you preached that sermon and he dies it's going to look bad it's going to look bad but God knows how to put his servant in a spot and he's not you know he's not afraid and so because he knows the future and so we're just thankful for that today amen and any good to us my dad's youngest sister her name is Linda is being baptized today and I'm kind of emotional about that and she's she's come back my brother's church is is doing well and and I've just been praying for a blessing and and he's he wanted me to pray for him this morning that God would just be with him and and new faces are showing up there and so we're praying that God would just come on the scene for Amen in a special way and and I know if my dad could look over the stage over the balcony today he'd be a very happy man be a very happy man and his youngest sister Linda and she was always close to us as children and amen want to remember brother Roger's family uh brother Roger lost his brother this week Eddie and uh I want to remember brother Roger's family got a very nice card from Sister Gooden and just thanking everyone for sister pearls passed on Beyond this realm of tears and pray that God would just be with that family and touch them I want to remember brother Jewel I spoke to him yesterday when I got off the phone I just got had a big long cry and so Brother Jules in a very tough spot I want to remember I want to remember him and his family as they're going through that in a special way brother Philip roncali that is going to have open heart surgery on Tuesday and brother Philip is an incredible guy and uh he's a great singer he's probably one of my favorites and if he only knew how great he was his head would be that big but I'm thankful that God don't necessarily let a man know how great he is and so we just love him with all of our hearts if you would remember him in a special way sister Sue is going to UVA this week and they're going to look to see if if the nerve damage that she has is permanent so we want to pray for these things that God would just come on the scene in a special way let's stand to our feet today amen any good to us I want to speak to you today and this is just very dear to my heart on the moment of the miraculous and I have to be very honest with you I believe that we're going to see phenomenal miracles in this service so I want you to look at this in the next little bit as a as a moment and every service is important but there's certain times that a certain gear just kind of slips into place and so I'm looking for it for myself that God would just come and help us brother Donnie Reagan spoke some words about sugar diabetes and a brother was sitting in the audience and he said when brother Donnie said it he felt a warm sensation go over top of him and he was completely healed it was just completely healed and I I spoke to brother Andrew yesterday and just shared some words and and uh I I'll just be honest with you cancer cancer weakens you in today's been I'll be honest with you this morning if I could have called in sick today would have been the day but actually even brother Donnie called me this morning and prayed for me over the phone before I before I came to the pulpit but if I I just told Andrew I said if I could get rid of the sugar diabetes first of all the medicines cost about fifteen hundred dollars a month and I really like to not have to spend that but the ups and the Downs of it it's a it's an uncontrollable thing for me because my pancreas doesn't work at all and so chemo destroyed the pancreas and so I'm praying even as I preached today that I would receive a miracle amen you'll turn with me to Psalms chapter 118 Verse 23. Psalms 118 Verse 23. amen I thought the songs were just perfect today amen glad to have brother Marcus his wife with us today amen and we've adopted brother Marcus so you take care of him Psalms 118 Verse 23. this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes no decision next words this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it you can be seated I'd just like to read some scriptures before I make my opening statements First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 51. behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall we shall all be changed we happen to believe we're living in the day where we're going to see this take place in a moment and a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal put on immortality first Thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 13. but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so also them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout we understand this is going on with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together within the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words Revelations chapter 3 and verse 20. behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh somebody's going to overcome I believe I believe we're one of those to him that overcometh will I grant to set with me in my throne even as I also overcame and then sat down with my father in his throne Revelation chapter 19 and verse 6. and I beheld as if it were the voice of a great multitude as a voice of many Waters have a voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and we're living in this this day and his wife has made herself ready catch that moment Revelations 21 and verse 2. and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with him and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done and I am Alpha and Omega the beginning of the end and I will give unto thee that is The Thirst the Fountain of Water of Life freely and he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son amen amen Luke chapter 1 and verse 30. and the angel said unto her fear not Mary you talking about a moment fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus verse 37. for with God nothing I want you to read this with me for with God nothing shall be impossible come to read the next verse and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word and the angel departed from her thank you sometimes we don't realize it but we're in the moment of a miracle amen It's just sometimes it just happens so simply until there we are we're actually the moment becomes greater than than we can even imagine it happens because it's Sovereign God does it no man can produce that only a man has to just realize that there's a certain time and there's a certain place it's an orchestrated Moment by almighty God and we realize it's a wind of a vision and it's just literally it just takes place and then we're there brother Branham said that Moses stepped and he looked out the window he had become a man that's now being groomed to be pharaoh and he had all of that behind him but he came to that moment that moment would change his life forever he would see those slaves now as not slaves but he would see them as the children of God Ramses would walk to that same window and see incredible opportunities incredible future with with those people and he would see them as slaves he would not see them as God's children Moses knew about had had the same focus and I thought last night was so perfect these two Services lined so perfectly up together but both of them would have a vision or a focus and it would be alike for all of those years but in that Sovereign moment Moses would look out and see something much different and then he would come to a place that he'd been in that Hill Country for all of that time but he would see a bush that was burning and was not consumed it would be a moment that would change history and he would become a one-man invasion he would become a one-man Invasion to the greatest the greatest country with the greatest army with the greatest architect and he knew all of that but after he met God it wasn't intimidating anymore because God was greater than all of that infrastructure all of that Army all of that government because he met somebody that was greater than all of that and we realize that these moments are orchestrated of God we follow a prophet that was a boy that was a if we could say it he was a bootlegger son as a matter of fact being a bootlegger son his daddy had been in trouble even his daddy you talk about orchestration his daddy would change his name and in changing his name he would add letters to where that it would be seven letters God's not so concerned about your trouble he knows he's got a plan he's not concerned about your history of being a bootlegger son so many times we got chapters in our book that we're so ashamed of God doesn't even pay any attention to the stuff as a matter of fact he doesn't pay any attention to your personal feelings and your personal thoughts he's got a plan [Music] he's got a plan and let me just say you're too spoonfuls of brains who can figure out the mind of God oh brother Ron but I'd like to argue with brother Branham try that out really for science think about what you're doing oh but I'd like to argue with you're arguing with God now let me just remind you God from his form said let there be you're talking about a moment and he said let there be and brother Graham said he believed his own word and it began to come into existence that's kind of mind you're arguing with and he wrote the first Bible in the heavens every one of them in order now as I think along these things maybe you saw me writing in my book last night here's my notes for today and I got it right there we got to be sensitive to the moment I heard the voice say get quiet in a service get quiet and I just sit very quietly I just told brother wiggin I was studying on a certain thought and all of a sudden I hear that voice say get quiet and then he began to come like a like a flow you know I think about and the anniversary of being burned it left my lungs extremely scarred to which that I couldn't I couldn't hardly walk up long flights of steps without stopping and pausing I preached by the mystical's median and I fought to be able to do that it would drain my energies we left brother biscals and came to the North Carolina camp brother mystical is standing he's the speaker there at North Carolina brother Joe Greene's now and so he's standing and he's speaking a sermon called bringing order out of Chaos how the world was without form and void and how that it was in such a place and then he would begin to describe how that God begins to mold the Earth and he brings order and I was sitting in the balcony beside a brother Homer and sister Nancy with Connie and I was sitting there and about about three quarters away through the sermon I realized this is my moment and I just stood to my feet and lifted my hands and literally it felt like a power of air began to be compressed down into my lungs and I was energized I don't know how many people were there maybe 1200 people was there but it was my moment are you with me it may be two or three hundred here this morning but it's your moment and as I was sitting there I just began to realize that the god that raised me up was now here to heal my lungs I want to tell you I had infection after infection for that year but after that night after that night God so healed me till I didn't have another lung infection you're talking about a moment even today with cancer in my lungs the doctor said if your lungs wasn't so healthy the doctors testify of that day of that moment of that miracle brother Branham was being was being chauffeured in South Africa and the chauffeur was taking him to the meetings and as he was taking him and he'd been so faithful now they're getting toward the end of the meeting and he said sir is there anything I can do for you he said well I have a friend that hasn't been able to get a prayer card for his little boy he suffers from paralysis in his legs and he can't get out of bed and he said he's just a couple of blocks away and he said well take me there but they're on the way to service brother Brown really wasn't too concerned about being on time and so they go and they walk up some steps and brother Branham walks into the apartment where the man is at with that little boy and he walks in and she walks in he greets the people that was there walks over to the bed and greets the little boy brother Branham didn't pray he'd been agonize before God he he reaches on the floor and he says is this your ball is this your ball yeah yes it is and he thought it out the window and he said go get it and the little boy jumped off of the bed and went and got it [Applause] I've been in some special moments in my life to where that we've seen some phenomenal things whether it's a little girl coming out of a wheelchair brother there was they came and got me out of the car said it's a little girl in a wheelchair I was war wore out and I remember I remember getting out of the going back into the tent meeting they took that little girl by her feet and I began to pray and after a bit I felt her little feet come loose and she said I believe I can walk she ran all over the place [Applause] I think what a difference that a moment makes I think of the morning that I was in my office and I was I was there and the Lord spoke to me to pick up brother Williams boy and carry him and pray for him and I actually told the Lord he won't let me pick him up and he instructed me to do exactly what he told me and I stood in this pulpit and I walked and I walked to that place three different times and he kept nudging me he kept nudging me and when they nudged me that final time I stepped off of the stage and I picked him up you're talking about a generational miracle if it doesn't happen that boy is a that boy's a a boy that's a in a situation to where he he's not going to be able to walk listen it's one thing when they're a small child but when they become a teenager when they become 20 and 30 years old and they're in a wheelchair your life would have been much different but because Jesus came I thought about I thought about this morning of a little lady that says on Tuesday they're going to take the baby because it's it's dead and I just I just looked down at her and and I said let's just Speak Life and we spoke life she didn't have a dead baby when they went in to get the baby that baby was alive you're talking about a God that can that can speak life other man would say when all the saints sitting at that table the wedding supper we'll look across the table to one another won't that be a wonderful time listen these Services these moments that we're in is more important than everything we do in the week what a wonderful time won't that be a wonderful time oh my brother Ron I'm so consumed with this and I'm is it worth it I want to think about what the enemy's offering you to not be there because he knows this is the only space that he can tempt you but listen in this moment overcome so you can sit at that table won't that be a wonderful time I would assure you one thing there won't be one sick person boom we'll just simply sit down they want to make that appointment brother Brandon says I want to make that appointment he's starting a service and he says Jesus is here tonight because Jesus keeps his appointments no matter how you were you he kept his appointments with Jonah in a belly of a well he kept his appointment with Daniel in the Lion's Den he kept his appointment with the children the three Hebrew children in a fiery furnace he kept his appointment with me on a death bed what a statement I truly believe before the church can have a rapture it's got to have rapturing faith we can't even have faith for Divine Healing let alone rapturing faith got to have a faith that'll change and Quicken this body and be taken away I believe the church is on its Road the power of the Living God that men and women will speak the word here and there it'll flash like lightning and a church is coming not some psychologist not some put on not make belief but real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out Church I think what a powerful statement right in that I think what a difference one Glimpse makes just a glimpse just a glimpse you just catch a glimpse and you get so much information in just a glimpse if our nation as a whole could get a glimpse of hell we live in a nation where a hundred churches shut down a month if they could get a glimpse of hell the Weeping The Wailing the gnashing of teeth the nakedness no friends no returning back to normal it's not a place I want to go to but if we could get a glimpse of Heaven we can get a good UPS of Heaven I want you to remember for the believer this is as close to hell as you'll ever get but for the unbeliever this is as close to heaven I found this quote the other day and I thought it was so brother Graham says so if you die or if you live what difference does it make if he comes today or if it comes in a hundred years or a thousand years I'll only rest I'll only rest till my change comes I thought what a powerful statement I believe he must have been standing in Two Worlds at the same time he says how do you feel brother Branham when you're standing there and you and your people coming in different languages and things are you afraid no sir no sir he said so never be afraid because if if he told me so and I believe it's the truth I don't want you to notice what he says if he told me tonight to go to the presidential graveyard and raise up George Washington tomorrow morning I would invite the whole world come and see it done and I'd say bring every critic that you can stand them around to believe the same people are watching I want you to go to this quote bring every critic and stand them around it you're going to see the glory of God that's how much he knew where he was standing get that chair over here where you can sit down and rest a little while he'll be here in just a moment say brother Ron what basis did he have he was just throwing out a a statement about George Washington no I believe George Washington was a Christian and I believe on Resurrection morning he'll rise [Applause] he says I love him and I want you to love him I want you to believe him perfect love cast out all fear and if you love him with the right kind of heart you won't have one Speck of fear whether you can keep his word or not night after night standing on the platform before it gross thousands of people around the world critics sitting there and say it's this or that or the other Witch Doctor standing there trying to throw his spells on you challenge you to duels and things like that never one time I say by the grace of God has one Speck of fear ever hit my heart not one time why he said he would take care of me and I believe him that's right if I get scared I'd run but I tell you when Jesus Christ anoints you you're not made out of running material the Rock of Gibraltar he said not the Rock of Gibraltar but the Rock of Ages you climb up into the Rock of Ages that's God's word and take your position there and stand while the gates of hell is battling against it with a perfect assurance that he who promised it not fail will never fail that's right that's when you're not scared the devil's nothing but a bluff anyhow snorting and blowing all Thunder and no lightning but I tell you the lightning power of the resurrected Jesus Christ puts a reality there that shocks the soul from a debt Slumber of these Earthly bound things into Immortal realms to believe God and take him at his word and call these things which are not as though they were I want to read that again Jesus Christ put such a reality there that shocks the soul from a dead slumber to these Earthly bound things into Immortal Realms you're talking about a mortal a moment to believe God and take him at his word and call those things which are not as though they were we go to doctors sister Connie has been so faithful Connie did not know what I was going to preach today but here's my wife and you know you look at her and she's a queen she's a lady she's an incredible person but she married a guy that would fall 40 feet and they would tell us that I wouldn't walk again and my dad would stand beside my bed and I'll never forget his prayer I am a son of God reminding God of who he was and this is a Son of God and he's got a purpose and in his purpose God you can raise him up tonight and you spoke to me coming down the road that tonight he'll walk out of this Hospital you spoke to me tonight that he'll walk out of this Hospital it was snowing it was icing and God spoke to him in the car brother on I don't believe it I don't care I'm standing on two feet [Applause] you see sometimes our words are not the words of a man literally we cross into another realm when the anointing comes and our words are not the words of a man I believe my father as a minister of the Gospel believing brother Branham was message since 61. I believe that believing this third pull and he stood and said I am a son of God listen when that doctor spoke to me and said You'll Never Walk again my response was immediate you don't know who you're talking to are you with me when I was burned when I was burned there brother Tim Pruitt came and spoke two sermons on on the Hall of of Fame and the other one was was on on on God will have a testimony sister Connie made notes I want you to think about what a what a powerful person she is and she might hurt me later but I was non-responsive in Uva I don't criticize anybody for being in the hospital or staying with their loved ones but this is what she believed God first I had I have taught all of you never let a negative word or thought go through your mind and she took my preaching through all of those years and she got in the car and she drove to these services and not just drove to these Services there was no poor pitiful me she took the words of Tim Pruitt as the words of God and she wrote them down I have them I didn't I'm not going to go to them today but she wrote them down there's no accidents with God has a purpose in all of that and we celebrate the anniversary the devil thought he would destroy us but the scripture says no weapon and sometimes you come in the moments and maybe it listen that scripture may not affect you for a long time and all of a sudden you come into a trial and you take that scripture and say Deva no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper I don't know so much about a Hall of Fame but I do believe I'm one of God's generals so I conduct myself so [Applause] but his second sermon is God will have a testimony and I believe that was a prophecy sometimes I don't think we realize where we're sitting or where we're standing can I just mention a couple of things here I've been in a couple special moments Andrew will you come maybe William if you'll stand beside me here both of your businessmen both of your businessmen I'm going to tell a couple testimonies I'm sorry to keep you standing for a moment but I think you'll like it why am I doing this because he instructed me to do this I just follow my ball I got a good boss I got a really good boss I'm kind of in a moment like when I told you at Ciro's Mary I see Zach but it didn't tell you it would be a church when I see Zach and you were standing you remember that moment you cried and now it's history but that was a moment for you and the rain just literally was blowed your plans up for a wedding but you were supposed to be here and you remember I held that thought from that Vision it'll happen at church and I didn't remind you of it but it will happen at church and I saved it for the moment and and people were sitting all over and I said God I know this is orchestrated with God because in the vision I saw Zach and I saw Mary and I saw it at church not at the river that was a moment so I'm I'm standing I'm standing at Brother Ray Erickson's and Aiden horse walks up and he's he's left brother Jordan you might help me is it Mennonite Amish Mennonite community and he's being what do they call that were they yeah he's been excommunicated he had a business amongst them and that business is almost bankrupt overnight now he said the message of the hour church now he's got a back condition he's in a spot he's got a nice family he's at a spot and I'm praying for him about his back and then I start to pray for him about his business and I just simply asked him I've never ever did this before and I said what's your hobby and he says I've got a greenhouse while the greenhouse is a small Greenhouse it's a small place it's just you remember how big it was six 10 by 20. brother Jordan you need to come up here and help me preach this is for you too yeah you got a business that's be getting ready to be blessed exponentially too and so I'm standing there with Aiden and I asked him I said what's your what's your hobby and he says have a little Greenhouse and we pray for it to be blessed I can't do that God heals his back and then I think he's got five acres five acres yeah [Applause] I'm setting I'm not done I'm setting at a table a couple of years ago at brother Wayne Lawson's house and Ben is going to going to leave the nursing and just do it part-time but he's going to go to that Greenhouse and they're going to do pumpkins you know this is a step of faith and as I'm there I felt the Holy Spirit to pronounce a blessing and he's sitting on the other end of a long table Brother Ray Erickson sitting here by the Wayne is sitting here there's others that are there I think David keckley was there and I just I just begin to speak and as I began to speak to brother Ben the spirit of God drops 40 people in the room the spirit of God drops and brother Ray Erickson begins to speak in tongues we're not ashamed of that that's God's language the spirit of God begins to drop and the Holy Ghost begins to go and and listen there have been a lot of noise with the talk and the chatter and children playing but immediately it becomes hush and the presence of God is just echoing through the place and it was a moment listen just yesterday brother Ben Erickson sent me pictures three of this is the greatest Harvest that's ever that's a he's ever had it's a Monumental year no man can do that I'm in China and I'm in a in a room in a Chinese room in that hotel and all the brothers are there with us brother Glenn gruner his business was in the failed mode and it was it was not doing well and nothing he could do to spark it and as I am as I am as I'm there I'm sitting in the window well the window well I'm sitting literally in the corner in the window well I'm tired I'm exhausted and I feel the presence of the Lord and as I did we prayed for brother Glenn's business and as we prayed for brother Glenn's business brother brother Glenn from that moment cannot keep up with the orders no man can do that I have these two men for a purpose I believe God's getting ready to bless your businesses I can't explain it but just as much as a little boy begin to walk God owns it all he owns the cattle in a thousand hills he's not governed by the economy of America or the economy of the world he owns it all he owns it all I don't know how I don't know when but I want to tell you God is going to bless you [Music] so much until people will be jealous of you but let them be jealous let the Heathen rage you are with partners of almighty God I speak it in the name of the Lord receive it in the name of Jesus Christ giving Glory giving praise brother Ron but that's that's your son that's that's brother William that's the ministry you want a business what you stand to your feet right now while the while the rain has fallen once you just receive it right now [Applause] you may be seated foreign people would walk into the prayer lines with brother Branham and they would feel that warm presence he said no that won't hurt you that won't hurt you that's him that won't hurt you in a moment they would go from a cancer patient to a well patient they'd go from a blind patient to a seeing patient we should think about that can you imagine how much Satan hates this message because it has the same creative power that God exhibited and let there be for Satan he knows us getting ready to come a resurrection and he can put an armed demon at every grave site oh I feel the presence of the Lord he can put an armed demon at every grave site and he can't stop from Dimensions blending Hallelujah Oh Brother on listen it was a woman named Sarah sitting in a tent it had been prophesied for 25 years and now she's 90. no way could she perform the word of the Lord even when she was 65. but God spoke to her there's nothing impossible [Applause] listen that word Had Creative Black Sails inside of it that word was the creativity of God you don't have to figure it out just take him at his word and believe his word and hang on to his word and let his words settlement [Applause] oh did he did he turn her Young boy you're quiet I'm asking you a question I want you to respond did God turn her Young we talk about a caribou we talk about a silver tip grizzly bear we talk about speaking the storm out of existence we talk about all of the third pull Miracles that Saul take place with the prophet listen that same Ministry is still in existence it still existence I'm no Prophet I'm just a believer in this message but this message works I've just spent about 35 minutes telling you this message works I can't explain it I can't explain when it happens I just tell you we've got to stay in an atmosphere where this silver-haired man will turn redheaded again God's not so concerned about the stuff that I'm fighting right now he's going to change this body he's going to change this body and make it young again [Applause] sister Carla's our dear friend her family is very close to us we had children about the same ages and they're very close I knew Carla when you were held four five years old so she's been close to us she's the sister I'm not going to say it put her in our life and we love her with all of our hearts her daughter was playing the organ the other day at a meeting is this okay to tell playing an organ the other day and I was to preach tomorrow morning and I'm sitting in a line of preachers on the front row the meeting is going on brother Wayne Lawson's preaching and I'm sitting there and the Lord speaks to me and said you'll pray for her tonight now this is what you tell her he gave me Specific Instructions and I've learned just do what he said brother Wayne preaches and one I think a sister came up and they braid and then one after another people came up and I'm standing helping helping him pray with other brothers Andrew Glover brought his little boy up because these little boys like Drew or like Wesley and it hasn't attempted to walk yet but he will but he will but he will and I turned around and Amanda had left the organ and by the way she normally plays the piano and so God orchestrated it that she would play the P the organ that night sitting right in front of me and when he speaks to me she's directing Island and Amanda came and brother Wayne Lawson prayed for and I know my instructions and so I just I just stand and brother Wayne prays for her and he prays for her and you know she's she's moved she's moved and if you don't believe in emotions you just get a hold to God one time you'll get emotional and and uh you know I had a preacher one time tell me direct to me in my face said we've got to get the emotions out of it well he's a dry stick [Music] you know I don't know how to get the emotions out of God I married a wife and I like her emotions some of them they're not good but I still like them [Applause] I'm just being honest but I like 99.9 tenths of them and the other tense just to make me better and so I wait I wait until she kind of calms down and I've got her by the hand and I've got her by the hand and now it's my turn and I just begin to pray for her and then I told her exactly what the Lord told me to tell her Ken is okay to tell and I told her the reason that I fought for you the reason I fought for you is God showed me that you were his eternal seed you might be going through a hard time in your life but when it drops inside of you it's the Eternal part that makes the whole difference [Music] she shouted all over that building that's emotion but I'll just tell you I like it [Applause] you know people want to criticize Andrew you know he's just too emotional you know you guys are just too wild so I'm going to give you about five minutes of a piece of my mind [Applause] I want to sing a verse for you without music and I'm not a good singer you don't know like I know what he's done for me you don't know like I know what he's done for me said you don't know like I know what he's done for me what the Lord has done for me I get happy when I think about what he's done for me I did happy when I think about what he's done for me I get happy when I think about what he's done for me what the Lord has done for me it's about to get good you can be seated you see the Lord that spoke to brother Ed biscoll that I would be the speaker next year at the camp meeting not just at the camp meeting but I would be the speaker at the camp meeting brother Ed invited my entire family to that meeting he wanted all of you guys to be there including my mother and father Andrew he didn't have it he didn't have it he was my son but I knew he didn't have it my daughter-in-law was sitting back there they said at the back of the tent and she was screaming during the meetings and brother Tom Ray said does she do that all the time I said she never did it she'd never screamed she does on a regular basis now Hallelujah [Applause] after the meeting we're kind of taking a few days off I'm gonna turn my clock off because I'm not paying no attention to it no way brother Tom Ray's son Joel was in the same spot you was in and I walked through the door because the door foreign I've heard these stories before I'm telling them for a reason because there's some backslid kids here there's some kids that's not where they're at and I want to tell you this can be your moment and so I'm taking your time I'm taking your time to get you in the presence of the Lord there's nothing more important than being here this is not a church of convenience this is not a church where you come to when you feel like it we're getting ready for a Rapture here I don't care what your family name is we're going to be changed here God had given three different times children to Joanne and brother Tom and they couldn't have them and they had a prayer cloth that they had and each time they would go to brother biscoll and brother Briscoe would pray and they would have their child foreign somebody broke into their home and they stole the prayer cloth they didn't know what they stole but I guarantee there was children born they was not expected [Applause] I'm sitting with the youngest that is backslid he's away from God he's just there because I'm there he's there to enjoy a vacation and God orchestrates a moment I go to the door because God told me to go the door and I opened the door and here he comes in flip-flops and hairs just bouncing he comes in I said come on in we go out and sit on the balcony and we're watching planes come into the water I'm watching and I just felt the channel start because I felt that little wind and I start talking to him tell him his life story in detail of where he's at he was changed in that moment never to go back and Not only was he changed there was a prophecy given over top of him in that moment to how blessed he would be like the son of Joseph and how blessed he would be listen he hasn't even reached the top he's recognized as one of the top employees in his company year after year and they keep throwing bonuses on him greater than most of our salary is here why because God said so Ron didn't say so God said so [Applause] we go to dinner that night we walk out you know when somebody says do you want to see some really good hiking boots and so I Walk This Way I go into a place where they've got really good hiking boots I would have had to take a loan to get them but I walked back out and we're just Distributing ourselves up and down the up and down there and I look down in this busy Street and I see brother Tom Ray stop in that stance and my son's standing before him confessing I don't have it I know the god of my Mom and Daddy I know the god of my grandparents but I don't have it I need to know that God in that moment foreign we took one Andrew confession we took one Andrew there and we brought another Andrew home [Music] and for your critic I want to just tell you no emotion it just happened but since that time many refillings and many emotions and many fire so he is the product not the son of Ron Spencer but he's a reproduct of this message I'm going to tell you and make a declaration this message works [Applause] foreign you know they contest the bridge in Jeffersonville say it never happened silly people say silly things on Judgment day you'll know whether it happened or not but I'm sitting at the Ramada Inn on the 10th floor and I'm studying and every time I studied I pull the curtains back to where I could look at that bridge and I think about how a country boy like me is sitting on the 10th floor of the Ramada and I'm studying this message looking at what brother Brown talked about this church loves brother Kelly Hildebrandt well the Kelly Hildebrand is one of the most precious persons there's ever been to me his daughter had went through a lot of things and I just dropped this in she'd been T-boned by a car and she was in a church it's a church of personality and they hadn't prayed for her but she was going to therapy over and over she couldn't she couldn't do any of her housework and they came to a meeting that I was preaching I huh and their pastor had ostracized brother Kelly to the point until his daughter had never heard Kelly preach for years I think what a shame what a shame what a jealous devil I got in the car after the meeting it was cold that night and I see Melody standing in there and I know the story of of her being in that accident and her being in a horrible condition I heard that boy said go pray for her I don't know if she'll let me pray for her I don't know if she'll let me do anything I don't know if she'll rebuke me but I stepped into that into that glass doors and step in and I step right beside wait till their conversation calms down you were there and I wait to the conversation and I said the Lord spoke to me when I was sitting in the front seat of the car go pray for you and she said well no one's did that I'd like that and I began to pray for her let me just say in that moment she became well Brother Kelly's telling me you know that she's come to the spot to where she's going to leave that church of personality and she's going to walk away she's been there a long time she's got two boys she knows that this is going to be a crucial decision she's going to go to her daddy's Church she don't know how's the people's going to look at her she's going to go and she's going to be a part of it and I'm going to tell you now she's been a widow for a couple of years maybe I don't know the exact time and and and and brother Kelly reads me she may not even know this but he reads me what she's going to say at the end of it he says brother Ron do you think that's okay I said it's not only okay and I felt the presence of the Lord I felt the presence of the Lord I said now God will give her a husband and he'll be a prince brother on that you know when I hear that coming forth I Go whoo whoo listen I never I'm either telling you prophecy or I'm telling you a lie when I'm sitting with you at the table either you're the man that will believe me that you're the man in the plane or the voice that's whispered into my ears been deceiving me and you'll have nothing more to do with me after I tell the story or you'll become one of my best friends I stood in the living room with brother Thomas and he said pray for Melissa this I had a vision of you over three years ago a month before cancer and the Lord showed me at the bottom of a pit that you were standing there in the light and I asked you it's are you ready to go home and I told Thomas I said I had a vision of her don't worry she's coming home God's not worried about time he's not worried about your stuff it's the Eternal part it's Eternal pack that's what he's concerned with [Applause] I called brother Kelly in three weeks and I said how are things and he just laughed he said I'll never forget his words so a lot been going on here brother Ron a lot been going on here he said let me catch you up and he said these two words she's engaged I thought I was going to drop the phone I asked him I said tell me that again she's engaged once you get married she's going to get married the weekend after the meeting brother Ron would you stay and be in the be there for the wedding listen my heart's racing 160 miles an hour you drove me 100 miles an hour the other day but my heart was racing I thank God there was no and thank God that's all I got to say just thank God and I wanted you to go so bad he got you got in the car and he took you 120 miles your wife's rebuking you right now it's going to be okay you took preachers that fast she's going to listen my sermon's effective but when you get in that Mercedes in a little bit she's going to talk to you he was not just a good man he's a prince of a man he's one of Matthew's buddies they correspond a lot his name's Kelvin Kelvin had never been married he was a t-shirt guy blue jeans a bowl and a spoon listen Bachelors can live out of a bowl and a spoon he went from a guy being a bachelor to a head of a house with two teenage Sons he lived 10 hours away near his mother and father he had a job I come in for the meeting and I made him it's about all I do is meeting I think it's overwhelming I think it's nice I can't believe what's happened you know so when people ask me about the bridge I have no problem with that bridge let me tell you a story I just told you and if God can bring a prince into her life I have no doubt about a bridge at four o'clock the next morning I feel a presence in the room I wake up listen listen it takes God to wake me up or Mother Nature you know what I'm talking about I feel him in the room and I stand and we're right beside of the Civic Center at a hotel I don't know the name of that hotel I just know that they Park cars underneath of it and I'm really glad brother Kelly doesn't put us there anymore but any Holiday Inn Express well there you are details don't matter too much on that situation but I'm standing watching it's a rainy night and I'm watching people come out of that Civic Center at four o'clock in the morning you know in the city there's everything moving you know and I'm watching people walking through the parking lot all I know he's woke me up now for a reason pay attention and he speaks to me and he said tell Calvin not to not to move those boys but for him to move here you know now the Lord is actually in the business of your life he's in your choices you catching that and so I just say Lord I'm Kelly's friend he's not going to take that from me you're going to have to give me something that he will know that that came from you you're gonna have to give me something though only he knows so I dropped it in my heart so now I've got to wait all day we're around each other we're we're doing different things and I know I got a message and I got to wait for the right time so I walk into the office with brother Kelly and he said would you like to go down and pray with the musicians he said Calvin's playing tonight I said I sure would but before I go down I need to tell you something the Lord woke me up this morning and I told him what I've just told you and brother Kelly drops to the floor just weeping now look at him man I go you got to get yourself together and that's exactly what I told you you got to get yourself together so when I go down it's a circle of musicians and I go to work brother Calvin is come come no he's getting ready to get a life change and so are you and so Kelvin is standing beside of me he's about your height tall handsome good-looking that's the reason I can't grow a beard you know that and so so anyway I got to deliver a message but I can only do it to him so we we pray and brother Kelly is crying after the prayer and they start to dispersing and I just hold his hand and I begin to talk to him and I said you know you know me as Kelly's friend this is the first time you've ever met me yeah that's right yeah probably never heard me preach before yeah that's right I said but the Lord woke me up and I rehearsed the story The Lord woke me up this morning and I was watching and I said you don't have to take this from me as Kelly's friend and I tell him this I said but the Lord I told him if I tell you this as Kelly's friend he'll just take it as Kelly's friend but I asked the Lord for a special thing I've never I've never told that ever again and won't today and I turned to him and I tell him what God speaks to him Hey listen he didn't waste a moment they had their bags packed they had their bags packed to move they were going to move after the wedding next weekend next weekend he was going to move her 10 hours you imagine the effort that was already involved now watch what he does because he takes it as God he walks up the up there and he tells her we're not moving now listen if it comes from the words of a man it's not going to be much but I like to see results those two boys are excelling those two teenage boys are excelling they're excelling they have two children together boys I have two children together and they're doing phenomenal they go from
