========================================

[Music] [Applause] [Music] it's interesting to notice how that that the church tries to attract the attention of the people by buying ropes and dress choirs and bob tears women and painted faces and they think it's a sign like an angel lie like a devil run around all night to dance like and think nothing about it and that's what they think is all right that's beautiful but you see that's false maid that's not the word of god while the true bride attracts the attention of god by keeping his word i notice now let us notice christ they say when i wait a minute what about this beauty you're talking about the bible said in isaiah 53 2 that when jesus come there was no beauty of him that we should is that right there's no beauty if he would have come in the worldly beauty as satan is today the people would have run around him and accepting the way they do the church today they would have believed him receiving as they do satan today certainly they would but he didn't come in that kind of a beauty but he always comes in the beauty of character their christ wasn't a beautiful great strong stout man god doesn't choose that kind i remember one time a prophet went up to to take a king to make a king of jesse's sons to take uh another king's place saw and so jesse brought him out his great big fine boy he said the crown would look right on his head the prophet went to pour the arm on him and said god's refused him and he refused every one of them said he comes a little old stoop shoulder ruddy looking fellow they poured the oil up on him and he said god chose him see if we choose besides god's used by character character there never was a character like jesus christ it lands in him manifests him we see it's true it's not worthy beauty of him that attracts his bride it's is his character the character of the church that jesus looks for not worse big buildings whether it's great denominations where's the big membership he promised to meet with wherever two or three are together together truly that's where the true believer rests his hopes is up on that word of god being vindicated in truth one is choose by his word not a worldly loving fruit they hate that no wonder she is divorced from him because she's missed his revelation and she don't have it he cares not for her the way she acts and doesn't how much of this worldly stuff she has he's looking for her character the character of christ now just a moment now he chooses a bride to reflect his character to which the modern churches of the day certainly misses his his program here a million miles because they deny this to be the truth so how could it be how he's looking for the day for that bride to be formed hebrews 13 8 just exactly like it was like he was it's got to be his same flesh same bone same spirit same everything just exactly built up and them to them become one until the church becomes that they're not one the character of him the word or this age must be molded she must be molded like he is [Music] so [Music] so [Applause] do [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] do

so good to see you again and we love you with all of our hearts and we thank you for being here amen what wonderful singing already that's happened here this morning and what a wonderful sermon last night and i just pitied the guy that followed him and well look what happened so amen he's good to us sydney we certainly love you with all of our hearts and we look forward to the time to where we can shake hands and hug each other's neck again and um but until then we'll just have to keep doing what we're doing and we had a wonderful doctor's reports this week and and uh we just thank the lord for that we'd like to continue to get those kind of reports and it's kind of like going to the dentist and he tells you you have no cavities amen so i'll just keep taking that no cavity situation and so they have doubled our our immunotherapy and chemo and if you just pray that our bodies can continue to tolerate that and do well with it we're at the max level now and so we're killing cancer so that's what we're doing and so we're at a spot now to where they say they'll start begin to reach the brain and get rid of those cells inside of there and so i hope it leaves some good cells amen at least we know we got a brain we got a good heart and we got our brain so somewhere and the lungs look like they're doing really well so we're we're thankful for that amen wanting you to continue to remember brother donnie reagan's daughter uh that she is going through uh she's in the initial stages of finding out that she has stage four liver cancer and so they've entered a port with chemotherapy to begin to just go at that as hard as they can go at it those that know herchee's a little precious little lady and little little bitty girl and so that we just pray we want you just to bind your faith together with them and pray that god would just touch her body and and raise her up and do a supernatural work for her we know that god's greater than cancer and so amen do want you to continue to pray for me that god would just help me until we can ring that bell i i'd like to ring that bell and so amen amen i believe we can and so we got a ways to go but so you just continue to pray for us that god would just help us in all of that and uh and we just thank the lord we're a long way from where we was but we're a long way from where we need to be and so amen but i really enjoy having doctors come in and smile and dance and and and and are really happy that we're one of those numbers that is on the good side of the things and so amen we're not looking to die we're looking to live and so that's what we're thankful for amen amen if you will turn with me in your scriptures this morning to matthew chapter 16 and verse 17 amen we say hello to our friends wherever they might be and amen we certainly love you with all of our hearts and and on sunday mornings i always get a lot of good mornings from all over the world and so we send out those good mornings to them and greet them good to have friends isn't it amen amen matthew chapter 16 and verse 17. and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it now i want you just to notice who's building the church god's taken personal responsibility to build his church he's not going to leave it to a man he's said i will build my church now notice what he said with that when he builds his church and then the strongest part of hell the strongest demons of hell shall not prevail against it amen god bless you as you're seated this morning certainly good to see you in the house of the lord we love you with all of our hearts amen god bless we realize in the scriptures that that there are places to where that god asks what what house will you build me we can look at different spots and not to take a lot of time with it but just to give you a just a drop reference or point reference god's god had had even had even after the garden of eden two boys abel came to worship the lord and abel came by revelation knowing it had to be blood wasn't a huge building that he built but he went to a rock and he offered a sacrifice of a lamb and he pulled it up on that up on that that rock and begin to work up on that rock and the life of that animal began to pour back upon him and god would accept his sacrifice but there was another his brother came and came and he offered up his works and he offered his works and his ability brother branham said it was a beautiful offering he said flowers and fruit and he said he came and he said god refused it because it had to be blood to get back to god if you remember abraham made a worshipping before god and he would he would take and slay the beast because he knew it was blood and he would offer up those beasts and and the pillar of fire would come down and come through the midst of those beasts and walk through the mist and god would speak and he would hear the voice of god speaking to him and he would no doubt come back and reference these things to the people that was around him that he was fellowshipping with god now no doubt they had their their opinions about what he was doing but listen it was abraham and god there was another man that met god and he would have an altar and god would give him instructions this time not to build a church but to build an ark and he would gather the materials some of them seemed inferior to be able to dare be able to put it on a on a stormy ocean or or a stormy waterway it would be inferior wood that most people would throw away but you see god was taking responsibility for the gathering of all of the materials moses would be would be would be told how to build a temple and even in there he would talk about badger skins which would be representatives of you and i the worst animal meanest animal the most cantankerous animal and that would be one of the skins that god would require in his temple it would take an innumerable amount of time to to be able to pull all of the materials together just think about this even some of the materials had to come from places like australia and new zealand all the way to israel sometimes that's mind-boggling when you think about when god starts gathering material are you with me david would would have a desire that he could build god attempt a temple and his desire was that god could have a place to where that that people could turn their face toward and worship the lord he saw that it was a blessing in obed's house he saw that it was a blessing wherever that ark was and he wanted to build god a tabernacle but understand god could not let him do it because david had shed way too much blood and david had sin in his life to which that had blood was now coming back upon him but interesting enough it would be by the grace of god through which even the marriage that solomon came god proves his grace over and over and over again that's what he did for you he proves his grace and mercy to you just when he should have throwed you away he reaches down and grabs a hold of you and picks you up does a supernatural work for you are you with me jesus would make some interesting statements destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it up again they all thought he was talking about solomon's temple there's no way that they could comprehend that he was talking about this temple are you with me now no way because jesus was working his way toward the temple of mankind he wanted to live in your life are you with me now in jesus day he would he would use a statement come follow me and people would leave their houses and leave their homes and their families and they would leave their job for three years and walk with jesus live almost like a nomad almost out in the in the open sky jesus didn't have a house as a matter of fact jesus really didn't have a church to preach in it's man but yet jesus owned it all and there was something about his voice that when he said come follow me it's kind of like when it spoke to you it was something that just said that's real i don't know what it is about it but but i'm leaving my family i'm leaving my home i'm going with this man jesus jesus was an interesting character you see he would go to the temple of solomon's place to where that it would be and they would all be offering their sacrifices but jesus in his humanity in his earthly structure as what we can i just term it today pastor jesus as he's sitting down he's making something interesting today he's not making a door he's not building a table he's pulling together some some twine and it's going to it it's going to be an instrument to which that he's going to use today in his sermon and he comes into the place to which david has had solomon to build and they've had to rework it times again and and over the years and now it's become tradition and there's all kinds of things that's going on and when jesus enters the temple sometimes he does like when he comes into your temple he goes through your temple and he starts swinging that rope and he starts beating the sin out of your life and conquering the demons that's down inside of there and cleans out your alleys and cleans all those things out this is the temple to where i want to live at and satan you can't stay here any longer lust you can't stay here sin you can't stay here temper you can't stay here and so the presence of god just goes through and starts cleaning it kicking over tables and chains going in every kind of direction you've made my father's house a den of thieves it's pastor jesus at work maybe you've had that same thing in your life to where down on the inside of you you're so sick of sin you can't live another day sometimes people say well i'm trying to overcome this or i'm trying to overcome that if you ever hate sin enough you ever get to this spot to where you hate that sin enough so many times people are in love with that thing and they really don't want to overcome it but if you ever come to the spot in your life to where you hate that weakness enough you'll come to a spot to where you'll invite jesus with a platter rope to come and take that thing out and go down through your tin can alley and raise you up to a level like you've never been at before [Applause] now god is not like this now i'll take this one and how you get this one i'll take this one and you'll get this one i'll take this one and you'll get this one that isn't how he does this he predestinated you before the foundation of the world he predestinated you before the foundation of the world you were gods to begin with you with me but you were born in sin and we quote it we quote it just like where the branham did but you were born in sin you were shaping in iniquity you came into this world speaking lies nobody trained you to do that you came from the dna chain but yet god watched over your seat you were a diamond in the rough until even satan thought you were too far in sin why god it got in his great infinite plan why would he ever pick that guy he would bypass people with degrees that you could hang on a wall like a thermometer hollywood looking people people of of old world wealth and god just bypass them i find an amazing grace that may be won out of a family are you with me are you with me our prophet was sent as a bootlegger's son and most of his family would wind up in prison not throwing stones but he was a bootlegger's son are you with me and no doubt satan laughed how can he ever use that boy and then he becomes a boxer and wins all of his fights but many years later in some of the same places that he boxed he'll preach many people become attached to church they get attached to to the to the pull in of millions of more in 44 the programs or the schools or the church entity maybe trying to find a church that will fit me a mentality of a of a recipe of a church that you know that will leave certain scriptures alone maybe it'll be hair scriptures or maybe it'll be these kind of things and and it before long you you've got the same crowd that was at the bar is at the church the same crowd that was at the strip joint was at the church the same crowd that was at the rock concerts at the church are you with me now you just moved from one coliseum to another and you just put on a different outfit come on church a lot of times we want to fall in love with become entangled with the machine of the church the organization of the church we want to become like the pastor we will if we're not careful we'll call me our hair like him and we'll walk like him and talk like him and and we'll do that i hope none of you do none of the above but brother ram said we'll take on the spirit of the church or or the spirit of the pastor but he said we must get to christ we must get to christ don't you love him but the man says oh how we need in jeffersonville tonight thousands of lived voices now let me just explain this the rapture's not going to come back and take your computer it's not going to take your pictures off of the wall it's not going to take any of the saiyans that you've got on the wall god's coming to get you this is a beautiful building there's been phenomenal amount of work done on this building to make it beautiful but let me just say this to you a tornado could take care of this a fire could take care of this and we'd have to rebuild it and go through all that all again but let me just say this god's not going to rapture a building he's coming to rapture human tabernacles that he has chosen by his divine plan he chose you when you couldn't choose yourself [Applause] oh glory to god oh glory to god no you say well brother ron i was looking for god nope you've got that wrong you wasn't looking for god it was god came looking for you you were happy where you was you were happy doing what you were doing the pleasure of sin was incredibly joyful in the season when is a drunk when is a drunk don't like alcohol the next day when he's sick but you can't convince him that he don't like it the night that he's enjoying it are you with me satan drives people to commit idolatry and they're just overwhelmed to be involved in that knowing it's going to cost that's going to come to it everybody's sorry after they get caught everybody's sorry after they get caught and their world has been destroyed by it are you with me brother branham said he said no he said now what's god did for us and this cr us in christ god manifested in the flesh and took his own son up to calvary and there he killed his own son on calvary as a cross to make a covenant with human race and when he did he nailed him to the cross and he and and that dead sacrifice it was pulled out of him the holy spirit into thy hands i commend my spirit blood running down from his side hands and his feet and god pulled out the spirit from him and shoved the body down into the grave and raised it up on the third day and set it on the right hand and sit and sent the rest of the agreement back to the church which is the holy ghost that was upon christ come upon the church and the only way in the world we'll ever be able to make it at the day of the judgment is that for for the same holy spirit that was upon jesus christ will have to dovetail as his wife through the body so the same life that was in him now lives inside of you you know when i read about what's going to be in heaven or what's not going to be in heaven makes me excited because i don't have any problems when it talks about there's not going to be any liars fornicators idolaters blasphemers i'm not that i'm not that i can't hardly walk in a hardy's today and feel comfortable in this world that i live in but go into that world where there's not going to be no sin come on church oh glory i could preach that for a little while the same holy spirit that was upon jesus christ was torn of his body to take the life out of him to shed the blood of remission of sins and god raised up his body and set it up on his throne at the right hand friends if you have received the holy spirit you are sons and daughters of god you are the seed of abraham join ours with him in the kingdom and the same faith that was in abraham is in every believer tonight god by his amazing grace called you out of the slot pens of the world and give you the holy ghost not because you deserved it but because he called you to it unconditionally not because you were good there's nothing bores me any more more than when people start telling me how great they are i went and preached for a man one time that took me out and i'm not going to say a whole lot about it because he might be watching this morning he entertained me all day got me back just to the motel about 40 minutes before i was supposed to leave and go to his church to preach that night and he told me how great he was all day fed me a hot dog with beans on it put cheese on top of it i'll order for you i don't like people ordering for me hey listen i'm real i'm as real as you can get there's certain things i eat and there are certain things i don't eat and if i don't like it i'll start taking that fork and i'll do like titus i'll just push it in a direction make it look like at least i attempted the stuff i eat makes me fat are you with me and he showed me pictures of all of his family and i said what do they do what you know will i will i meet them tonight no none of them serve the lord we're still praying and i began to think we have a church and our family don't want to serve the lord what kind of a ministry do we have i'm going to preach to you it may not be long but i'm going to preach to you if this don't live at home if this don't live at your dinner table if this don't live in your office then don't try your recipe on me well amen anyway hallelujah glory glory glory glory glory now remember god is the one that's done to choosing god is the one that dies the gathering now notice brother branham says in the sumerian church age he says now those who are the royal seed are the elect of god are the predestinated foreknown of god and we're in their mind of god and in his thoughts in the very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in its designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and it took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed blood i'm just told you what you are just as much as god said let there be a son let there be a moon god knew what day you'd be born he pre-planned you he knew how tall you would be what color heritage you'd have what color eyes that you would have and how contankerous you would be and then he gave you a spirit a new spirit and then gave you the holy spirit had to give you a new spirit where he could live with you and then give you the holy spirit where you could overcome the world oh glory to god he said we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed therefore we could be reborn and because we were seed it's the reason you could be quickened so the same word that goes by you and you thought your mother and father would get it and all your family would get it you got it they didn't get it it's because god deposited something in you before the foundation of the world now it's not for you to get snoot knows with it it's for you to praise god that got rich in mercy it's not for you to think i'm better than somebody else but god rich in mercy saw a diamond in the rough and said i choose him i place myself in him because in non-seed there's nothing to quicken let's think about pastor jesus can you give me just a few more minutes this great shepherd now let's just say it like this as as he's a great shepherd he begins to go and gather to his church he said i haven't come to call the righteous to repentance he didn't go to the church world and say okay i'm going to gather you pharisees and sadducees as a matter of fact you find jesus gave them a very rough time but jesus finds himself sitting with the woman at the well and let me just say most churches would not have wanted her in their church most churches wouldn't have wanted her at their church most churches would not have wanted peter that was naked on a boat screaming cursing and jesus said come follow me you know that's probably what made the devil laugh you know for a while i thought he was the messiah but look what he's picking for his church it might make him laugh today at what's the woman that sat at his feet and found her way to the place to where that she could wash his feet no doubt would have not been welcomed in a lot of places but if you remember she was the reason that jesus goes simon thought that he was the reason because simon was going to bring him to make fun of him but jesus seeing what's going to happen this afternoon he comes knowing they're not going to put a robe on me they're not going to wash my feet they're not going to perfume me they're not going to make me welcome but she's going to come she's going to come and because she's a predestinated seed they won't offer her up at the temple they won't offer her the fountain of purity my feet is the only place that she can find forgiveness come on help me preach now help me preach now so many times we come to church and we forget to entertain jesus we'll find our pew and we'll forget to entertain jesus we'll listen to the singing and we'll forget to entertain jesus we'll listen to the sermon and we'll forget to entertain jesus it's our tears not simon that we're wanting to impress i came to this revelation many years ago i examine who i'm trying to impress if i'm trying to impress somebody in the world i don't want no part of it i don't know part of it need a job gotta have friends in the world gotta have business associates in the world but let me just say i'm not headed in the same direction as them this is only a temporary situation don't sell your soul for a temporary situation sometimes you get in a jam in life but don't sell your soul for a temporary situation i gotta have a job and it takes me out into the world and i'm gone and i'm away from my family over and over again don't sell your soul for a temporary situation hey listen i just gave advice i might as well give it this would give it to you tonight someone called me said should i go uh states away and be away from my family i can make more in a month than i can make in a whole year and i just said hey we we sell our soul we sell our family out we put our wife in a spot to have to raise children because we want to gonna make mike more money than than we can think about but we'll see we'll get rid of that money money's only temporal i'm close to your pocketbook now so just hang right on your family's worth fighting for your family's worth fighting for your wife your children you to be as a representative of christ to them let them see you reading your bible let them see you praying you be the example you be the temple of god in your home as the example of jesus christ let god build his church in your home i want that to soak in this woman washes his feet they begin to talk about you know if he knew who she was i'd like to bring it today before i wear out too much but satan says the same thing about you if he knew her past if he knew his past and they come and said on the pew but jesus knows your future it's not your past that he's so interested in he's got a blood that'll take care of your past it's your future that jesus is interested in a lot could be said there so i'm just going to leak jesus just let her wash and she didn't have a bowl of water but she washed with her tears and she didn't have a towel but she dried with her hair and she had all of her money tied up in that perfume that she was getting ready to give and there was people in the room said he could you know if he was a real shepherd or a real pastor he could have done something with that money but he let her open it and the perfume filled the whole room and she began to pour it out and brother branham said she became a mess and she was the perfume was all over and she was washing his feet and perfuming it and it got all in her hair he said you need to get the smell of jesus on you [Applause] i want to think about this just for a moment jesus's table at the end is going to be filled and there's people that have refused to listen to the word and they came to it and they walked away and they came to and i'm not just talking about this day but i'm talking about in every age but he commands them to go out into the street and get the blind the hot the main could we call them the unqualified could we call them us could you say that with me us i know it might be hard to say it but us so i want you to think about just for a moment just as i would come to a wind up here some of brother branham's personal people that you know his ministry gathered in the tens of hundreds of thousands maybe millions but in his personal life he gathered a burp call you know what brother brahma said about burke call he said the meanest man i've ever met in my life that's what he said he says meanest man i've ever met in my life and here god has him to go to burke paul and be hunting with him and lead him to the lord brother branham in his early ministry has a woman that is a dancer and her name is nelly saunders and he's got a friend that's a drunk that didn't get it but he's got a friend that's a drunk and remember nellie saunders comes to the house nellie had came to church and got a work of grace and and then she goes by the the town hall where they were playing the music and she stopped to listen now god didn't give her up and throw it away help me preach i will build my church and nellie saunders walks out and once she gets done at the town hall she says i've sinned i've obama i've did the abomination i i i've uh i'm no way could god handle me now or receive me now and she goes by brother branham and brother brown begins to pray for now this time she really prays through and the demon leaves her life you say well brother ron can you tell me what happened in her life and you know brother brown found that not important god starts to work in your life he'll take care of you what about a girl laying in a room in a bed for nine years and and god would send him to that spot what about congressman up show you see there was testimonies of two books that were all coming together your past life and your future and god sent the blood of jesus christ to come and so cleanse you of your sins that he can live on the inside of you and have a place to build his church could i say this tonight the church is not this building [Applause] the sign is not our church the asphalt that is across the place the barns that we tore down a few days ago brother and i miss those barns well i probably should have put you in there with those snakes and you probably wouldn't have missed them now brother roy have we killed a rattlesnake this year we get rid of the barns we get rid of the rattlesnakes hallelujah sorry to put you on the spot like that but hallelujah i don't like them i don't like spiritual ones and i don't like real ones maybe you need to tear down some barns in your life you hang around me long you'll see that i'll take i have a i look at something well let me just talk about my house that i live in i moved into a hunting cabin didn't a sister nancy all heater kitchen living room together a couple bedrooms it looks a lot different today you never been there it looks a lot different that's what god wants to do with your life are you with me hallelujah that's what he wants to do with your life you started out a cabin property brother ron do you know that person's past i am really not interested in it i've had people want to tell me i want to come and spend all day and talk about my past i'm not interested let me just say i'm not interested in your past but i am interested in your future uh i'd like to give you a preventive thing and then i'm done da vinci painted the lord's supper da vinci is known as one of the greatest painters or scientists or architects of the field amen and he was known for the study of humanity as a matter of fact he took away took actually took corpses apart for decades to be able to figure out how to paint him the best and his last painting or his painting that he was his masterpiece was the lord's supper and so he looked for six months to find the most innocent looking man that he could find to paint jesus and he found this man and he painted jesus after painting jesus he spent six years on painting the disciples and after painting the disciples now he spends almost a year looking for a man that is so evil that he could portray the man judas he went into prisons all over finally in rome there's a man that's getting ready to be put to death and being going to be put to death anyway but he looks so horrible somebody sends a word to da vinci this might be your man and so they bring him and da vinci paints judas from this man's structure and this man set speechless before da vinci's six months and he studies every line in his face and his hair and everything and at the end where he's finally done this man breaks loose from the guard and he comes and grabs da vinci and he says don't you know who i am you met me before and he said no sir i've studied your face for six months and i can tell you for a surety i never met you now here's the greatest painter the greatest artist in the world at that time and judas this man that just has portrayed judas for these six months tells him but i stood as jesus seven years ago i stood as jesus and he just looked at him and he said how far sin has took you now think about this i'm not giving you some story there it is but how far sin takes a person you're going to be a temple for something your friends are a temple of something young people your friends are a temple of something they're representing something yesterday race cars went by us with little markers on the side of their their car and and they're they're in the race across america and i saw sister connie because she now drives me now everywhere i go i beg to drive and she just looks over and smiles but i don't have no stickers on the car and i felt that van lunge and take about a 10 mile per hour and i looked over at her and said have we entered the race many people will color the hair a certain color because of their rock star many people will wear a shirt michael jordan ain't paying you for that baby the dallas cowboys are not paying me to wear their star nor the kansas city chiefs nor the green bay packers i just sometimes pick the hat up cause i like the color if it make me look younger i worked but i don't get paid for that but when jesus came into my life he told me he'd give me eternal life and he made me a promise this world offers you none of that brother brandon made a statement and i end it with this he said if i spent my whole life and then he yet sent me to hell he said i'd serve him all over again he said because it was worth living as the musicians come i want to share this with you young people let me say this to you you want a wife or a husband you can trust because a real christian will get his lazy self out of bed and go to work and will provide for his family and and he'll come home and he'll pray with his children and he'll love his children and it won't be a house of arguing and fussing and abuse and you say well brother ron this is for out there on the internet my husband's an abuser and he beats me and he cusses me and he leave him leave him [Applause] you don't have to live in prison tomorrow leaving well brother i do i have a reason yeah you don't have to live in prison life's too short to live in torment throw your cigarettes away throw your alcohol away throw all that thing stuff the way jesus asked him to come and cleanse your life don't live in that prison house no longer either hallelujah this message lives when people ask you about this message and what you believe just simply look at them and say what i believe lives you don't have to explain to them the trumpets the seals the thunders you don't have to explain none of that just explain my jesus that i serve he lives today glory glory hallelujah hitting it good to us hallelujah i'm sorry i don't have the energies to preach to you longer than i do but i i enjoy giving you the part that i can give you i love you with all of my hearts today and sings my soul my savior god to thee amen then sings my soul my savior [Music] how great [Music] my soul
