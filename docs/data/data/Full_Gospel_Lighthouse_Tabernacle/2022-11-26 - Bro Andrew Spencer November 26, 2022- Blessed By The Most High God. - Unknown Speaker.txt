don't believe Thanksgiving is just a a day it's not just a week but it is from the Christian's heart it's something that goes forth every day is I think a Thanksgiving from a True Heart A Grateful heart into our and to our Heavenly Father who is always for his children and he's so diligent to take care of us day in and day out and he's never asleep on the job but I tell you we're just a blessed people to call him our father and we just want to wish each and every one of you a Happy Thanksgiving and trust you all had a wonderful time with your families and and you didn't eat too much and you won't sleep on me too much or being a turkey comb or anything like that on me tonight and if if I'll be like brother Tim Pruitt said if I'll put you to sleep I'll wake you up so I won't be like brother Tim he'd throw books at you back in the day and and so I won't do that but I try my best not to put you to sleep but we're very thankful to have all of our visitors here this evening and uh I believe the Robinson's here with us amen that's brother Joel Robinson's mother and father may God richly bless you there and we're happy to have you he'll be here in the morning and and uh so we're happy to have him and all of our other visitors here and even uh Eli here it's uh it's a blessing to have Eli if you if you haven't been around Eli it's uh he'll be a real blessing to you I think he's trying his best to get in this Spencer family one way or the other so uh do you sing like your sister okay all right I was gonna say we vote you in already if that's the case so but we certainly brother Eli was able to share some of his testimony with us a couple weeks ago and uh it was it was it was truly a real blessing to us and and the bride there and that portion of the Bride that was there to able to hear that and I believe all of our young people have a very powerful testimony whether they've gone through something or not just to be standing in the middle of laodicea it's a real blessing and I got this note uh just before we come to service this evening I'm not even sure the Family's last name but it was just a little note that came to the church please remember a little Jack he's dealing with a high temperature and he's very sick and wherever they are they're in the middle of a snowstorming and having a hard time getting to the hospital and different things and they're just asking that Jesus would put his foot on the brown of the boat again and and just calm the storm in their life there and I know God's more than able to touch a little Jack tonight and I believe he's more than able to touch each and every one of our lives here tonight and and we're just uh we just want to be remembering little Jack when we go to prayer maybe we'll sing that song mighty you are and then we'll go to prayer and then just go into the word Lord God Almighty we are closing man [Music] the heavens declare your wonders for you are great and do marvelously [Music] for you along

your mercy forever foreign [Music] to our father this evening I know there's many sick that are amongst us or many that would love to be here but let's just go to the father tonight we know that if he went to the centerian and the Centurion went to him with that kind of a faith and he didn't even have to go to his house how much more has believing Sons and Daughters of God fill with his spirit and he come to our house and come to our need let's just go and take these needs before the father Heavenly Father what a privilege it is that we can address you father recognizing that you are Mighty and you are Mighty to be praised and you are mighty to save father and you are here as both healer and as a warrior father to stand up for your children to show to show to the enemy that they are on your side and Lord we recognize that there is no weapon that is formed against us that shall prosper we recognize that every enemy has to Bow before the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we gathered in that name tonight and we recognize Lord that when we entered into your courts with praise and with Thanksgiving in our heart Lord Jesus we recognize that your holy spirit is here and is amongst us tonight to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think and Lord I would ask Lord tonight for a special blessing on every person here father Lord we are very careful to thank you for all the things you've done in our lives Lord we're very careful to praise you Lord and I believe that we are a church that has found a Heart of Worship Lord Jesus but Lord I would ask Lord just a supernatural blessing father Lord more than money could buy more than just more than just a blessing in the physical but father a spiritual blessing that we would return and give thanks unto you father Lord I would ask Lord that you would bring healing to the body today Lord I pray that you would drive out every sickness this this little Jack father that is Sicky little child that's sick in the hospital father I would ask Lord You Let The Healing Virtues Of Christ flow over his body just now Lord every person here that is under the sound of our voice just now I pray father that they would feel the touch of the Master's Hand as you begin to sweep through this audience tonight and as the atmosphere is charged with your presence Lord I would ask Lord that you would have the preeminence here and we'll be careful to serve you Lord let let your servant get out of the way just now as you take the author take the word and Lord let thee author grab the book and begin to describe it to us into an intricate details only the way that you can father Lord I'm your servant and I yield my vessel to you Lord and over to the Dynamics of of the Holy Spirit just now we give way to the Holy Ghost we pray father you be blessed in this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in the Book of Psalms chapter 139. verse 4 and then also Genesis chapter 14. Psalms 139 . amen Psalms 139 and verse 4. for there is not a word in my tongue but Lo O Lord thou knowest it all together thou has beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high and I cannot attain it wither shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into the heavens Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand Lead Me and thy right hand that shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both a light to thee for thou has possessed my Reigns that word Reigns it literally means the kidneys it is it denotes the very inward part of the of the being it it denotes the mind the soul the seat of our desires our affections our passions for thou Hast possessed my inward being that word possessed it means to stand up it means to it means to erect it means to set up right that God has possessed he's owned and he is the one that made the very inward parts of your being he owned them he made them therefore he knows all about you for thou has possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth the right well Genesis Chapter 14 verse 18. at Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord this evening I would like to by the help of the Lord begin to speak to you again on this thought of of Abraham blessed blessed by the most high God we recognize that that in the beginning God was not necessarily God like we would describe him because God has the meaning of an object of worship so in the very beginning we recognize that God was not God as he was but he was Elohim but we recognize for him to be God he has to be worshiped so we recognize that the very first thing that God had created in the beginning God created angels because God loves to be worshiped but we know that he is a self-existing one and we recognize that no matter what name our Lord Jesus Christ would declare himself he alone is a self-existing one each of us this desk is not self-existing this this these chairs or these carpet or this building is not self-existing it cannot go on the in the shape that it is unless a man takes care of it but God is self-existing he doesn't need he doesn't need the help of angels to exist he does not need the help of humanity to exist no matter whether you go by the way of the Grave or by the way of the Rapture God does not need your Humanity to exist God does not need the devil to exist God is the self-existing one that means he's the only one and he is the highest above everything that ever can be and we recognize that God is he's not he's not coming he's not going but he is here he is in this room because we recognize where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them so we recognize that deity is in this building tonight and is manifesting himself in Sons and Daughters of God that have been called by his name that have dressed himself in the power of His Holiness and we recognize that God is here and you are blessed to be able to be called the children of the most high God I'm going to just go through a few things again kind of give you a little bit of review but we recognize that the name El eleon is translated in the Bible the most high God it is hell is shortened from from the form of Elohim which speaks of God's strength Elion therefore is the strongest or the strong one uh or the most high God so we recognize that when we begin to begin to look into the text uh that the Bible interprets that this is to mean that El eleon is the possessor of Heaven and Earth so Elian Knows No Limits he is Elian is the most high God and He Knows No Limits you and I are bound up by limits but God is not bound by limits we are bound by speed limits or we would go as fast as we want to we are bound in humanity or we would fly like the wings of a dove or we would Fly Like an Eagle or we would or we would set our wings and we would go at a different course because you and I have a limits you see there are certain things about certain people that they can say certain things and you see there's a mother that could that that can say a certain thing about you and there are certain things that only people can only certain people can say my mother is the only one that has the ability to be able to make a statement I carried you for nine months my father did not do that so he cannot make that statement she said I've heard her say before I brought you into this world and I can take you out of this world she has the ability to make a statement like that you see it there Joe Biden right now only he has the ability to make a statement that I am the President of the United States in another two or three years somebody else might be able to say it but there are certain ways where people only certain people have the ability to make certain statements and Jesus is the only one that can make certain statements there's been no other God there's been no other Pope there's been no other potentate that's been able to say that I Lay My Life down and I'll raise it up again he is the only one that can say that I am the resurrection and I am the life you destroy this Temple and in three days I raise it back up again he alone is only to make a statement like that because he's always able to back up what he said and if God has said one thing about his children he is more than able he's more than enough he's strong enough to take care of his words he he you see made a promise because he's God and God is immutable he cannot change and he cannot waver if God has thought about you God cannot change his thought about you for the two immutable things cannot be done away with he confirmed it with an oath God is God and he backed up his word while lifting up his hands towards heaven and putting his foot onto the sea and upon the Earth and you as the pillar of Fire have the devil underneath of your feet tonight I know I'm way ahead of myself but I want to say his sons and daughters of God every Cancer is underneath of your feet every diocese is underneath of your feet you are children of the most high God I'll say there's no weapon that is formed against this church that shall prosper he knows no limits you see the authority and the power of the most high God surpasses it goes beyond the Reigns of Nations his Reigns of the most high God goes beyond heaven and it goes beyond the Earth his range goes beyond every Power his range goes beyond every principality his range goes beyond every Angel and it goes beyond every figure of humanity his authority is a most high God and Dominion's Fantasia spend time and distance alike so he alone is done deserving of the title higher than the highest and the champion of champions you see he knows no limits and he knows no bounds he knows no restrictions and every demon power has to be limited under the unlimited God there is no restraint with our God there is no holdbacks with our God I want you to recognize that you as Earthbound people we have limits Upon Us unless we get in a plane we cannot fly unless we get in a rocket we can't go past the Moon but our God man has tried its very best to get past the moon but our God owns past the moon and Beyond every Galaxy Beyond every Star and Beyond every orbit that there is our God is the possessor of Heaven and Earth foreign there is no power there is no power and no one that does not fall under our God's domain and his jurisdiction there's nobody that is out underneath of his law and his actions as almighty God even the Nickelodeon spirit that is going about trying to divide and to conquer the laity is under the power and this jurisdiction of almighty God Judas was under the authority of almighty God he could not kiss the Son of God unless the Son of God would allow him to kiss him the pope cannot have any power unless almighty God gives it to him he can sit there as a viker of Christ and can say and act and try to dispose of the Holy Spirit but only the almighty God is powerful enough to forgive us of our sins the pope you ain't gotta buy your way into heaven you ain't gotta buy your loved ones out of heaven or Out of Hell there is one name and there is one power that has the ability to save you the ability to retain you and the ability to redeem you I believe that you're acquainted with this name and we will not stand for any Pope we will not stand for any fighter but we will stand for Jesus yeah isn't God's Plan of Redemption just truly magnificent to begin to think that the almighty God will become flesh and become deboned and dwell amongst us for the purpose of restoring mankind do we restoring The Fellowship of mankind back with almighty God there is there is notice that God revealed himself to Abraham and in different characteristics of himself he declared or revealed himself to Abraham as the almighty God El shadiyah as the all strong one you see if you're Almighty you are the strongest foreign if you're omnipotent that means you're all powerful and he is the omniscient one and he is the omnipresent one so there is no limit that you can go to in this world as David said in Psalms 139 if I go to the heavens Thou Art there and if I go to hell Thou Art there you see there's no limits to him but notice that he he declared himself as hell Shady eye he declared himself as Jehovah Jireh the Lord who provides he declared himself as Elohim he declared himself as El Elion the most high but notice that Abraham did not receive him as three or four different gods but Abraham recognized that there was only one God that was declaring himself through many different conveys of God's message he was conveying to Abraham of where he was you know there's certain times in your life when you've got peace when you've got peace but he's Jehovah's Hammer to you but you see you see there's sometimes when you need he's Jehovah Shalom if he's if he's your peace but sometimes you need the Lord right there so he declares himself as Jehovah's Shama you see there's sometimes in your life you need a victory and there's sometimes you need a banner that sometimes and God knows how to show up to your need but notice Abraham Abraham didn't recognize the one that was speaking to him as three deities or three Gods but he recognized that it was a same voice the voice behind the voice that was speaking to him at Jehovah Jireh up in Genesis 22. he was Melchizedek what that was the same voice that was speaking to him in Genesis 14. it was the same God that was speaking to him in Genesis 12. it was the same God that was speaking to him in Genesis 17. what was he doing God was taking Abraham through justification sanctification and on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost what was it it was the blessings of almighty God being poured out in the dispensation of Abraham but notice notice that that God would use different names or titles as he would begin to convey his message to his people because there are different characteristics to certain names each of you know what your name means you have a certain day or certain characteristics that go with that name you see the name Andrew means manly and there's one lady that knows that's right and I know that's right there ain't one thing let me go on it I'm preaching about Jehovah not me but every met the character and he gave the name to the animal according to the character that it had and when God would show up and he would declare himself in his seven compound names or his seven redemptives names as we went through of Jehovah Shema Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Nishi Jehovah Shalom Jehovah's Hammer the Jehovah and we recognize that when God would declare himself in those seven compound names it was his it was showing to us as his children his attitude towards his people all the way back there in Eden and all the way from Eden back you see everything everything that is for you is wrapped up in those seven compound names you see those seven compound names is his attitude towards you I say to you he is Jehovah he is your healer he is Jehovah shama he is there he is Jehovah's Shalom he is your I want you to think I really want you to put some thought process into this next statement I'm going to make to you I want you to think about your hardest problem I want you to think about your biggest need can you do that for yourself just for a minute take a take a second while I catch a breath and begin to think about my biggest need my biggest desire every one of you've got a different need foreign there are certain things brother Jerry has need of that maybe I don't have need of I want you to think of it reflect on it just for a moment think how big it is there's some of you that have maybe minuscule needs right now that you are thinking about or is crossing your mind but the Bible tells us he supplies all of our needs you think there's over 250 people that are sitting here tonight there's no way humanly that anybody here could meet all of your needs but there's somebody bigger than the humanity that is in this room now I want you to notice this what brother Brandon says here in Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever he said when you try to confine God to one little denomination or one little action your little you're limiting yourself notice when you try to confine God to to one denomination or to one little action he didn't say you're confining or you're limiting God but you are limiting yourself you see when you try to put God into a box or you try to say God can't do this you're not limiting God because God can't be held in a box you're limiting yourself God covers all places he's everywhere he knows he knows all things he can be anywhere anytime he's all-powerful and if you get to know how great he is then you can know something about his power notice if you can get to know how great he is then you can know something about his power you look at the Universe you look at the stars you look at the trees you can see who God is I'll say Samson was able to know how great God was so he was able to know God in his power I'll say that when David was out there on the backside of that desert he was able to know God so he was able to release and understand God in his power I believe this thing's about to die man I think it is anyway but notice it just be just be ready this thing has limits but God don't you see God has a no risk City restrictions there are certain things or boundaries in humanity or even in Nations that there are we haven't we have no fly zones in America in the Atlantic and in The Possession Pacific there are no-fly zones that Russia keeps bordering up against and flying over our no-fly zones but I want you to know to God there is no no fly zones God can go anywhere you cannot hold him in a jail cell God will get out you cannot hold him in some Creed God will get out you cannot hold him in some idea God will get out he is supreme in power he's Supreme and authority and a supreme in knowledge yes he is ill-eleon the strong one the possessor of Heaven and Earth and he alone has a rights to make such legal decisions and actions towards any foe towards any devil towards any sin towards any power towards any debt Our God has the ability to reach to you you will say well you don't understand how big a deep of a pit that I'm in you don't understand how long my arms my father's arms are I always I always wrote this kid I call his name but he might actually get a hold of this but he was always on a school bus you ever want to get an education you just get on a school bus one time don't let your kids ride a school bus you'll find everything you need to know about life on a school bus but I found out on a school bus that that was this kid on there that he was always talking about how strong his daddy was that he could lift up a car and he could put it over his shoulders we'll come to find out his daddy was a mechanic and he had a lift yes he could put it over his shoulders but you know about kids kids love to brag well you say I say you don't know nothing about my father my father has the ability to lift a 800 pound Abel over top of his head but he didn't know we had a tractor that was able to lift it but then I began to think about it my God owns the cattle on a thousand hills he had the ability to give Samson the power to lift the gates of Gaza and carry it over some 20 some miles my God it's the strong one he has the most high [Applause] notice what David when he sang his song of Deliverance in Psalms 18 you can also read it in second Samuel 22 Psalms 18 and 13 the Lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice in second Samuel 22 it said the most high thundered out his voice hailstones and coals of fire yea he sent out arrows and Scattered them and he sought out Lightnings and discomforted him now notice when you go to studying out every Monarch or every King when a king gets mad or if he if he gets angry and he begins to prepare for war he sends the whole Community into into a state of commotion but here God it gets mad at the enemy that has thrown David into this situation and look what nature did nature begin to shut out and begin to show out the effects of The Sovereign one's displeasure then the channels of the waters were seen and the foundation of the world were discovered at any rebuke O Lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils he sent from above he took me he drew me out on many Waters he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me they prevented me in the day of my Calamity my Calamity but the Lord but Jehovah was my stay he brought me forth also into a large place and he delivered me because he delighted in me I'll say that El Elion has delighted in The Bride of Jesus Christ and he has sets you on this message it is your rock of Revelation foreign I want to say that no matter where no matter where Satan goes he is on God's Property and he's in God's territory there ain't a devil safe in God's jurisdiction there ain't a power there ain't a power that's tried to afflict you this week or try to hinder your life or upset you somebody better turn some air on here there's this place going to take Wings in here I don't know if y'all flying or trying to fly higher because y'all got limits or it's just a little hard on you but I want you to hey God has in the whole territory that it can hold him back and say he's not welcome here there is there is the only thing that can hold God back is your attitude of jealousy to keep God out of your life that's the only thing that'll keep God from moving in your life is a denial to repent of your sins and deny the truth that'll keep God out of your life but if you welcome the almighty if you have a welcoming Spirit if you have an inviting home if you have a place of worship a place where God feels welcome there is no bounds there is no limits to the bedroom there's no limits to the living room there's no limits to the kitchen almighty God wants to cook a turkey with you almighty God wants to wash the dishes with you he is the most high but it can come to the lowest you see when Jesus died at Calvary and paid for you God hung a no trespassing sign over you and said Satan you're not welcome here and as long as the blood is there Satan can't even come close to you he can he can sit around the spirits of your home he can sit out there he can dance and he can try to make you think that you're weak you're not big you're not strong but the only way that you don't stay fortified is if you go out there to the devil but as for me in my house we'll stay right here with our early on notice notice what brother Madam told us he brother Brandon told us in the Sumerian Church age he said every single time he said every single time that he would begin to that he would begin to declare himself throughout the seven Church ages he began to introduce himself as deity he introduced himself to the Church of that day by deity himself he said I want you to notice that every time that he introduces himself to a church age he puts forth something of his deity he said that's the first thing that he tries to make known to the church that's the deity or his deity that is God and I'll say this God ain't shy on letting you know who he is God ain't shout letting Joe Biden know who's in control of Israel is not is not shy on letting the devil know who's his children or not I'll say that right now whether you feel like it or whether you don't feel like it Satan knows if you're a son and daughter of God because of the power that is radiating and pulsating from your life when you go to prayer when you go to talking to almighty God like Hezekiah begin to pray Hezekiah was a man that knew how to pray he prayed and God sent an angel and it destroyed 185 000 Assyrians I'd say Satan realized real quick there was somebody that had an open Channel with their early on When Death come for Hezekiah he prayed one prayer he turned his face to the wall and he asked for 15 more years who was he talking to L Illy on it God ain't shy on letting you know who he is if he would come to every Church age and he would address him he would address he would address the church as one of his deity names that I am he that was which is and which shall come I am the first I am the last I am the almighty God he is not shy on letting anybody know who he is I wonder do you know this God I wonder I'd say that many of you thought this week while you were sitting around your family altar Family Table and you were sitting there and you begin to think about why wouldn't it be nice to have Granddaddy here he's done slip to be on the grave or wouldn't it be nice to have our grandmother here she's done went on beyond the curtain of time but I wonder if you thought wouldn't it be nice if Jesus would sit at this table you see you've got to make some decisions in your life decisions in your business decisions in your family you've got to make him Lord of all I'm trying to declare and I'm trying to tell you how great my God is but you've got to let him he is only as great as you confess him great you see if you don't confess he's the greatest if you don't confess he's the strongest if you don't confess he's the almighty your witness is as strong as your confession but as for me he is my savior he is my redeemer he is my way maker he is my healer he's my doctor he's my lawyer he's my financial advisor he's my real estate agent he's my guidance counselor he is everything he is ill-eleone already it's not you it's me we put my CIA agent away there for a minute some of you get it today but notice when Abraham when Abraham come out of the confusion of Babylon wanted to do he come out he come out of complete confusion up there trying to get high as God that's one number I was trying to do he was trying to build a city that could get as high as God and show that his kingdom so that he was greater than God now notice I want you to think about this that that's where Abraham came from that Abraham was down the hill in the midst of in the midst of the Bible in the midst of unknown gods in the midst of a confusion language notice God ain't the author of confusion but the devil is so you recognize who they got to serving down there they got to Worship in a spirit that would make them think that they could get as high as God was but notice God never spoke to Abraham while he was down there in Mabel it was when Abraham separated himself when Abraham come out to himself then God began to speak to him then he was able to serve him he come out of there of his mother and his father he come out of there with his wife Sarah but notice after the confusion came The Voice you notice where you were at in the midst of your confusion down at a Catholic church but God never talked to you down there but when you got out of it when he got out of that Catholic system or the Nickelodeon system that was trying to conquer your soul and Conquer your life that God began to speak to you you think about this in the ministry of William Branham he declares to us 1196 times he's here there ain't one Pope that's going to say that he's here as he's thinking about himself there ain't one Archbishop that can declare that he's here but there was a prophet that stood in this day and told us he told us he referred to the scripture Hebrews 13 and 8 over 3 100 times declaring that this message was not William Branham but this message was almighty God if he's still the same yesterday and he was able to get Abraham out of confusion he's able to get your children that are stuck in a Sodom and Gomorrah situation and there is a voice that pierces through the darkness there is no power that can hold our young boys back or hold our young girls back when the almighty God gets going after and hunting after his children [Applause] there ain't no sin there ain't no power there ain't no earthly foe that can keep them where they are when God does the calling after his seed Hallelujah foreign Who come out when Abraham this knowledge is too high that I cannot attain it's what David said to think that who came out to Abraham after the battle after he fought for his brother after he was fighting for his Wayward kin that had got out there he got out there and kings came in there and took his own his own brother his his nephew he came in there and took him but notice who came out to Abraham after the battle was over did this wasn't some man but this was none other than the Incarnate Lord Jesus Christ that came out to Abraham after he had fought the Battle for the right motives what did he do he had Fellowship with Melchizedek and one of my favorite quotes William Randolph said he said now you will too now think about this you've been through every battle and it seems like it's been an uphill battle but now you will have fellowship with Melchizedek too and brother bear I'm a good brother I'm going to went home to say he went on to say he said now he said that's people that sit here and say well I don't believe in shouting and I don't believe in speaking in tongues and I don't believe in Divine Healing he said it shows that you never had the victory yet he said but if you ever get a taste of the victory one time you'll believe in Divine Healing you'll believe in shouting you'll believe in emotions he said if you once get a taste of the victory then you'll believe in it oh I believe that there's somebody in the house of God that knows what it's like to sit down and have fellowship with Melchizedek to taste of the victory of the battles to bring back a loved one to bring back to bring back and the fellowship where they're early on their possessor of Heaven and Earth let me say this to you when early on blesses you it doesn't matter what any Earthly King does the king of Sodom said look he said I want you to take all the spoils of this battle he said oh no he said I'm not taking one shoe latch it and I'm not taking one string he said unless you because you'll say that I got rich because of you he said but I have lifted up my hands to the possessor of Heaven and Earth let me ask you some Church of the Living God when almighty God blesses you what else do you need when he blesses you with healing what else do you need when he blesses you with Fancy with fine things and with a nice home what else do you need when ill illian says I am your lord I am your strength I am your exceeding great reward there we go what else do you need tonight young boy what else do you need tonight when he says I'm going to give you the very dynamics of the Holy Spirit you've danced around the mechanics all of your life but what else do you need when almighty God pours out his Dynamics on your life and gives you the same spirit that was on the inside of him you don't need no other power you don't need no other teaching you don't need no other intellect when almighty God pours his life on the inside of you you have been blessed by the almighty God foreign let me tell you you're sitting here tonight and you got breath in your lungs you've been blessed by almighty God if you can lift up your hands you've been blessed by almighty God if you can shout hallelujah you've been blessed by almighty God I don't think there's anybody that should sit here quiet today because you've got breath in your lungs you've got to praise in your lips you've got a God in your soul and there's a Rapture in your future and there ain't no devil in hell that'll stop you from making it what are you afraid about aliens on your side Samson tear down every Philistine David kill every Giant change them batters out and give me that microphone when the alliance on your side he's the biggest business partner that you can ever buy into when ileon's on your side you ain't got to worry about cancer he's stronger he's higher than cancer [Applause] laughs thought it was high in the 1700s they told us that if a man ever went beyond the the miles per hour of 30 miles per hour that they would fly off the Earth thank God we ain't going by that logic anymore what's wrong with your people you're just flying loose you're going over 30 miles an hour you're not even aware of it but you are sitting here and going 660 000 miles per hour right now and you're not even aware of it so it depends on who's looking how fast you're going you recognize that when NASA flies off the Earth that you're leaving they're leaving here at a velocity of 36 000 miles I'd say that they shut up the ideology of the 1700s because man was evolving in their knowledge and you notice brother random told us he said there is a spiritual Evolution he said God created botany life then he created animal life and then he got as high as he would in creation when he created Humanity he but he went on to say he said there is a spiritual Evolution he said it goes from justification under Luther and sanctification under Wesley and so on it is an evolution of almighty God that is taking and building his body by his spirit and now today there is a body on Earth that has evolved by the spirit that is the stature of a perfect man they know who they are they know what he wants done with the word there is now a body in connection with supreme authority that is trained to break into the realm of the most high God now William Branham was a forerunner and he showed us how to do it you remember when brother made him standing there for a little sick girl I believe he's a little sick girl maybe a little boy was standing there and he said he said I by my faith can move that little move that little triangle I can move that little piece right there that little bracelet I said well no man can do that he said but I can do that and they quick only here when he had everybody turned her back to him he began to move that thing he'd roll around in a circle he'd roll it back the other way she said well that's witchcraft he said oh no that's my faith he said if I had enough Faith about myself he said if I needed that little old Barlow knife that I got out there on my dresser he said I could reach down in my pocket and it would be there if I really hadn't eat of it William Branham was a forward Runner that showed us how these things were to be done in the third pool he stood there he was in need of squirrels I don't believe there's anybody sitting here right now that needs a squirrel but there is somebody that needs deliverance from cancer there is somebody that has need of unbelief deliverance from unbelief there is somebody that needs an understanding of godhead and there is somebody a Supreme Being that is in this room right now that has the ability to open up every channel and he's able to push back cancer and open up the godhead and give a revelation and brother Bynum said there is no devil in hell that can stop the Revelation when God wants to give it I'll say God's one to give it to you more than you could ever have need of it [Applause] God's got a people that know how to tap into a channel they don't believe he's just a God that used to but they believe that he is able right now to do what he did back then had he Waldorf that had cancer in her heart and cancer throughout her body told her husband said if I die in this prayer line you take me through that prayer line she died in that prayer line they asked brother random to come over the hair brother Branham laid his hands on Hattie Waldorf went back to preaching Hattie Waldorf got up off of that stretcher and went around testifying of the power of almighty God if he could do it for a Hattie a Waldorf she was in a worse condition than anybody that's sitting here right now if he could do it for Hattie Waldorf what about you that's got cancer written cases cancer of your mind that's something a whole lot worse the cancer of the flesh it's a cancer of the soul that keeps eating he'll put jealousy in you he'll put pride in you he'll put Strife on the inside of you and what is it it's a devil that's jealous of the power of the ministry that's jealous of the music that's jealous of somebody beside you and you got cancer in your soul foreign I think I'd rather have cancer of the flesh than have cancer of the Soul to think that I could get so high and get so jealous of somebody else that I couldn't receive them getting a blessing because I didn't get it it's amazing how many people get so upset when somebody else speaks in tongues or somebody else interprets or somebody else shouts and they didn't Shout I ought to give you the spirit of blessings and gratefulness to show you that God is back in the body again this is a restoration of the days of Pentecost again but if God really cared about me he would give me that blessing do you recognize if you've got the gift of love every gift is below you I think it's amazing I don't know why I'm here but I'm here this is completely off my subject but I think it's amazing that somebody gets so upset about somebody speaking in tongues and they didn't get to and it is the lowest of the gifts in the body I welcome the lowest gift and I welcome the highest gift but the main thing that I want for everyone here is The Giver of the gifts oh yeah go ahead and clap your hands I just patted the devil right on out of here that's right he's got no business in your mind he's got no business in your soul he's got no business in your spirit so Satan get out of the house of God we are a church that's born by the very Breath of God you didn't Inspire us we're inspired by almighty God Satan take your leave thank you this is Almighty God's house this ain't man's house this is God's house this ain't man's doing this is God's doing God won't let your jealousy stand in his way we've been trained to break into a realm of the most high God if John Ryan could tap into it and it could run down through their screaming I'm seeing I'm seeing if he could do it and Georgie Carter could do it lay in nine years 47 pounds had a disease that her uncle raped her with and now she's dealing with TB I'd say if the most high God can go to Georgie Carter the most high God can go to the batons the most high God can go to the freezers [Applause] the most high God can get the congressman upshot he can get to you foreign there might be some times in your life when it seems like the voice of God is silent and it seems like the promise is getting heavy on you but if Melchizedek can come to you once Melchizedek can come to you twice if Melchizedek as a priest every time you walk by a preacher or a priest throughout the scriptures a priest has the ability to lay a blessing on you who laid this blessing on Abraham but the most high God let me say this let me say this if God's got something in your future the most high has already so high he's so tall he's so big and it may look like it's a hundred miles away from you almighty God sees where it's at Sister Sarah Robinsons is coming tomorrow I hope she's saying this but she sings this song There's a promise coming down that Dusty Road foreign I'd say I'd say the blind Bartimaeus in his condition didn't recognize that today was his last day sitting where he was sitting it out I'd say that Abraham awaiting for the promises didn't recognize that this was the last day that I live or look like a hundred year old man but today melchizedek's coming to my household I'm going to feed him communion I'm going to fellowship with him and he's going to change my body if Melchizedek came to your once Abraham Melchizedek can come to you twice [Applause] notice the promise wasn't just Abraham but it was just his seed after him you can go throughout all the Bible and you can find that the promise was to Abraham and his seed after him and the Bible said in Galatians 3 and 29 that if you are Christ then are your Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise let me tell you blessings can only come from somebody higher and if you are Abraham's seed you inherit all the blessings that were promised to Abraham somebody give somebody a high five give them a give God a high a high five himself give God some praise in here you are inheriting the blessings of almighty God if Abraham was promised to change you are promised to change there's something different when Melchizedek comes by your way the atmosphere changes I'll say this the kind of atmosphere brother Dre that is in this building right now will be the atmosphere that'll change our bodies between the morning of the hours of six and nine this whole body will be changed in a twinkling of an eye the atmosphere of Melchizedek is in the body [Applause] the Bible says in Psalms 7 and 17 that I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the Lord most high Psalms 97 and 9 for thou Lord are high above all the Earth Thou Art exalted for him of all God you can name every God that there is you can name Muhammad and our God is exalted above him Muhammad Buddha Confucius Michael Jordan Michael Jackson LeBron James our God is exalted above every God he's bigger than Tom Brady he's bigger than Peyton Manning he's bigger than Donald Trump he's bigger than Joe Biden he's bigger than Putin he's bigger than Newton John who our God is exalted of every God above every God above the god of cancer a God above the god of anxiety above the god of depression our God is exalted above every god of Egypt above every god of depression Our God's bigger than oppression I'm God's bigger than covet I'm God's bigger than the flu Our God's bigger than back pain my God is exalted about every God and Philippians chapter 2 and 9 tells us that God has given him a name that every knee is going to have to bow and every tongue is going to have to confess his name is so high it's lifted above every name foreign he is Jehovah Shalom he is our peace he is Jehovah he is all of these seven compounds name but none of them have the power to save you he would declare himself as the most high he would declare himself as hell Shady are the great one the breasted one as the strength Giver that Abraham what did Abraham need he needed a new body and almighty God was El Sharia to Abraham and he leaned on the bosom of el Shady eye and he drawed out the very power to create Isaac what is he Abraham didn't have the strength you adults know what I'm saying he didn't have the strength Sarah didn't have the power the milk veins have dried up the ability to Bear a child have escaped her but who did they lean on they leaned on El shadiah and when you are leaning on El Shady eye he is stronger than every strong thing in your life it seems like death has got a hold of Abraham but Abraham just leans over on the bosom of el Sharia and he pulls out strength he pulls out a blessing he pulls out the ability to bring life again and in your dead situation you could not bring forth life but you leaned over you didn't have the ability to save yourself Jehovah shama has no saving power in it Jehovah Shalom has no saving power in it but when he came to Mary and he told her that you shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins he is Jehovah savior he is none other than Jesus Christ Psalms 57 and 2 that I will cry unto the god most high unto God that performeth all things for me he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up Salah God shall send forth his mercy and his truth Zephaniah 3 and 17 the Lord my God in the midst of thee is mighty say mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will Joy over thee with singing foreign put it on your refrigerator put it on your iPhone put it on your Android Zephaniah 3 and 17 the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee is mighty he is all-powerful he will save I'm in too big of a mess brother Andrew but he will save and not only will he save he will rejoice over you I think it's amazing when we get excited because God saved us but when God Saves you the Bible has declared that he gets happy and he gets to rejoice in because of his saving power no fear not Abraham I am thy Shield and I am your exceeding great reward if God is your sealed how is the devil ever going to hit you that's your prophet's voice if God is your Shield how's it ever ever going to hit you foreign Devil's got a bow to the name of Jesus I'm going to labor some points right here Muhammad has to bow to the name of Jesus Buddha has to bow to the name of Jesus you look throughout the Old Testament and you see the god of Baal Baal has to Bow before the name of Jesus are you with me every anxiety has to bow to the name of Jesus because Jesus is the only God menopause has to bow to the

every devil that wants to raise its head and say that this message is wrong has to bow to the name of Jesus Christ every devil knows that there is power in this name if the name of Jesus Christ could go by the way of Elizabeth that was carrying a dead baby for six months and when the name of Jesus Christ was mentioned over top of John the Baptist the Bible said that he leaked with joy in Elizabeth's womb and was filled with the Holy Ghost at the very mention of that name witchcraft has to bow at the name of Jesus Christ tables break at the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah every sin has

the name of Jesus bad friends good friends good times bad times everything is subject to the name of Jesus he is ill Elio I don't think you understand what I'm saying to you tonight there is no other way to heaven but by the name of Jesus Christ there is no other life but by Jesus Christ the church at the door the pope ate the door but he says I am the door to the Sheepfold I am everlasting life I'll say this to you he's a rock in the wilderness he's a fire at night he's a cloud by day he's joyful your morning he's beautiful your ashes he is your Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness I want to say to you that Jesus Is My Everything [Applause] he came to be the lowest of laws he is the king of kings he is the Lord of Lord he's above every Power and he's greater than any Earthly father but he was born in a manger he was not afraid to be a war footwashing flunking but he is the highest of the highs I want to say this to you no matter where you are God is your everything he's the answer to your problem he's the answer to your sickness he's the answer to every little question you have in your mind I want to say to you my God knows how to get you out of prison and my God

again and he is the keeper from keeping you from getting on those websites my god is so big you can't wrap a rope around him he is so tall there's no measuring tape that can reach as high as him and his reach is so wide and so so far that there is nowhere that you can hide I am taking every excuse away from the devil tonight if he could go to a finished border and there was Russians standing on one side and finished sitting on the other side yet it didn't stop the power of almighty God even though there may have been Strife between one another it did not stop the power of almighty God from getting this little boy that was dead and been laying there that had been hit by a car and they spent his bones and his legs were sticking out of his pant legs they never did call William Bradham a false prophet because that boy was up on his feet within five minutes time I want to say to you that the same God is in this room and there's no way that you're going to miss a Rapture because you're a gene of God [Applause] will not go down as a liar and somebody that just makes up words God will get you where he needs you to be at anymore the devil's know there's one God even they tremble that little anyway horny woman had been standing out there all night long the do had done set in on her shoulders she didn't know one thing about William Branham all she needed was the god of Elijah throughout the years of being in the message there's been Believers that ran into people that were in the prayer line they didn't know one thing about William Branham but they met the god of William Branham T.L Osborne stood at William branham's at William branham's funeral and said we seen God in this man I'll say that there if we if time tarries that there will be people that come to your funeral and say that I sing God in this man I sing God in that woman what is Christianity it's tabernacling deity all over God all over again Satan knows that he can never reach as high as God can he can hold you with two thousand demons but they ain't powerful enough you can be housed in a cage of hell and it ain't strong enough to keep God from getting you out Legion had been a good person but he got out playing a card game and running around on his wife and it led him to be Unbound and possessed with over 2 000 devils and you think that you can control it I can handle I can handle the gaming I can handle the apps I can handle I can handle these little games that just I just need a little bit of break in my in my break time while I'm at work so I'm just taking I'm taking a little break I'm playing a little game Satan's creeping its way into your soul I ain't against James I enjoy playing games but you better be careful with your time if you'd rather play a game than read your Bible it shows that somebody's sitting on the throne room of your heart that ain't God foreign just one time is all you need you're going to listen to entice in spiritual people brother random said all satan is wanting to do is get you to smoke one cigarette and then he's got you he's wanting you to hear one rock and roll song and he's got you it's the little foxes that destroy the vine but Legion had been bound up he wanted to go back to his family he wanted to go back to good living again he wanted to go back to what it was to be a real good moral person again but every single time that he would let his mind go back to what things were the devil began to beat him and thrash him over and over and over again keep him where he was because Satan knows who's coming you were supposed to have a Thanksgiving week and Hell broke out because Satan knew that God was on your road he'll cause a storm to come up out of the middle of nowhere and he thought man we was with Jesus and we was having the time of our life and all of a sudden I category five hurricane showed up after man but I flipped my world upside down what's going on Satan's trying to stop Legion from being who he really was in the beginning man we have the time of our life and all hell breaks out because hell knows that heaven's coming I think it's amazing that thanksgiving's supposed to be a family time but Satan comes in the the most sacred of times and gets the most disruptive and one of the most sacred things the family I don't have to I don't have to have the gift of knowledge or the gift of discernment to recognize that you sat down at a table I'd say that there was somebody here this week that sat down at a table and you looked across the table and there was somebody that you didn't agree with there was somebody at the table that had a different political view than you had but I think it's amazing that Satan wants to take the thing that is so sacred the closest ties that you have on Earth and Destroy and disrupt all of those things and what did he strip from this Legion I want to destroy from Legion he stripped his home he stripped his God he stripped the real Pride that was on the inside of him that was to be a real human Satan ain't just wanting to destroy your flesh he's wanting to kill your soul he's wanting to kill your sound mind but Legion wanted this Jesus so bad I believe it's in perfect strength perfect weakness brother Brandon said the devil never would have went out there unless Legion pushed his way out there foreign notice the Devils on the inside of Legion recognize that that was El helion that was preaching to him he said thou Son of God the most high what do we have to do with you every devil is subject to the name of Jesus Christ I'm getting ready to close like I got one more thing I want to drive to you remember when brother Brandon was was there in Africa and he was he was watching I believe it was Africa and he was watching this he was watching this guy he was carrying around this Idol and he was packing his Idol and he was supposed to be a Christian but he was packing his Idol right that's something I won't go there but here he is he's supposed to be a Christian and he's packing this Idol and he said what are you packing that artiform it's you Christian he said yeah he said this is just in case that God fails me I think it's amazing that our God carries us we ain't got to carry him and here he is and he begins to tell the story and you know what if you go just type in the word of database you begin to that he said amoyah he said amoyah he said this he said this Idol save my saved my father one time when a lion came out there he said he was getting ready he was getting ready to attack my father he said to my father built a fire and that fire and the fire and he began to worship this this Idol right here and he said in the idol scared away the lion brother said it wasn't that Idol he said it was the fire he said a lion's not scared of that Idol he said the lion was scared of that fire and brother Brandon was standing there and he was watching these he was watching these these Idol packing so-called Christians come to this meeting
