gathered about them that fear the lord and we know that that he's here this evening to minister to our hearts and how many wants to be ministered to tonight amen would you stand with me this evening

hallelujah oh let's just begin to bless the name of jesus just now begin to call on him who knows all of our needs father we come before you just now in spirit and in truth father to worship you lord humbling our hearts lord realizing that we're nothing lord without you lord if it wasn't for you breathing the breath of life upon us o god we'd still be laying in the dirt but father you formed us before time before molecules before the world began lord we were in your mind you know every element of us and you knew what our makeup would be in our characteristics father you know how that some of us would be emotional and some of us would be more more staunch in our ways father but you built us so that we might bring out a certain sound according to the maker lord you birthed this one to that one until you got exactly what you wanted father i look out upon a people and i think about a people across the land that have been birthed by your word i say that you're looking upon a creation and you're getting exactly what you want father not in the natural but in the spiritual father as we rise as we rise up from our own thinkings to begin to take on your thoughts father i pray that you'd go forth into this this body of believers just now and allow the force of the holy ghost to begin to move across your people lord and bring them into the conditions in which we need lord to take a rapture father this message will produce a body change father this word of the lord that we've received is is that father more than a man but it's it's came straight from glory it's risen us past our our day-to-day thinking of religion father but it has risen us father to meet the challenge of the hour and god we give you praise for your releasing of the word father and god tonight we just want to lift up the name of jehovah the one that was the same throughout the old testament is the same right now lord i pray that you would come forth and declare yourself as god tonight lord you know how you changed even my thinking today change the thought for your children lord you know why you've done those things and i just pray that we would begin to see the results lord just even now the effects of the word may not be seen tonight but they will be manifested in eternity father and i pray lord that you would come and show us the things that you have need of in this hour lord we we just begin to bless your name and praise the name of jesus christ lord i pray a special touch on our pastor tonight lord feeble and body and the enemy trying to block the visitation and we just curse the enemy just now and bind him in the name of jesus christ amen if you have your bibles this evening we'll turn over in the book of isaiah chapter 59 if you wouldn't mind turning with us if you have your bibles isaiah chapter 59 and verse 15. thank you isaiah chapter 59 and verse 15. i was studying on a completely different thought this week in about 1047 today the lord just come into the room and i felt like i was going to be swept out of the room and so i'd like to i'd like to preach from this text today of isaiah 59 and 15 by the help of the lord the bible says yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey and the lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness is sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord i also would like to make mention of sister shirley grandma's kin we just welcome her in the presence of the lord happy to have her back here with us and so tonight by the help of the lord i'd like to speak to you on something that god dropped in my heart today as we said on when god dresses when god dresses for war when god dresses for war and look back with me at verse 17 and keep your bibles handy this evening the bible says here for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak according to their deeds according lee will he he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense and verse 18 we see there that even those that that are dwelling in in a more remote or a distant part that even your enemies that you may have even forgotten about god has not forgotten them and those that may seem like they're too far out of your reach not to even be dealt with anymore god is saying i'm going to get them and so basically god is saying to you or saying to the enemy or the adversary he's saying i'm coming for you and i i absolutely love this because i begin to look at these things and in the manner in which god looks at them and not the way that we look at them that that god's conquests are not earthly as we see things so many times but but god has a spiritual warfare and that god is is the god that is fighting our battles for us now the bible says here in romans 12 and 19 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord to me it's an amazing thing to watch when a human being or or a person and even those that call themselves sons and daughters of god begin to take matters into their own hands and and usually it is that it is that southern anger on the inside of you that will drive you to do incredible things and even northern anger will drive you to do incredible things but because of out of revenge because somebody did something to you or said something to you you you're looking for payback you're you're looking to to revenge what has been taking place on your accord and and so many times you watch a parent when when little johnny does something or a little susie down does something sorry if we've got a johnny or susie here tonight i know we got one johnny here but i'm i'm not necessarily calling on brother johnny but you watch when a parent when they when they when their children get into a circumstance that they can't necessarily handle they'll begin to take on matters for their own self and take it into their hands and and us hillbillies down here we begin to say well we got this we got everything in our control we can handle these things but but what what god is telling us is that is that that revenge is mine that what they have done to you is not what they've done to you but what they've done to me and i am the one that i will repay what the enemy's done to you and and so god is telling you don't take what is mine he's telling you you you don't take what is mine and and when you begin to take take away from god and say this is my battle and i'm gonna fight this battle or i'm gonna do this and and i'm gonna do that what you're doing is you're stripping god of his armor i know you don't like those things but when you begin to say well i've got this or i can handle this i can search this i can find this i can do this i can do this by the help of whatsoever what you're doing is you're stripping god of his armor the bible said in isaiah 59 that he put on righteousness as a breastplate that breastplate is designed to defend the breasts from from darts and it is designed to defend the sword of the enemy in the midst of attack that and then it says on and the helmet of salvation upon his head that helmet of salvation is the armor that we know is for the head and when you look at a man of war and you see him standing in the battleground and we're very familiar with these things and we see that the armor is for the headship and it's seen and it is seen by by all those are standing around when you first glance at a war you're you're you're looking at his you're looking at his head and you're looking at that helmet and and you so your focus is on that helmet of salvation and notice it is it is to him alone in which that helmet of salvation belongs to and we look over in in ephesians chapter 6 and we can see when paul begins to grab these things from isaiah 59 he looks over and he puts on the whole arm of god over to the christian and he grabs these things and he tells us that our fight is not against flesh and blood but it's against spiritual wickedness which is in high places and you watch that that warfare is in a position in which you were chosen to be at but that enemy realizes that if it can defeat you in the position that you are to be at if it can defeat you in your position it has got you whipped right there but paul grabs these things and he tells us to put on the helmet of salvation now when you're looking at jesus as as the helmet of salvation and you see that that is only due to him that only he can wear that helmet that only the helmet of salvation belongs to him and you begin to look over in revelations chapter 19 and you begin to see that he is crowned with many crowns and you begin to look at the war at the warfare and you look at the wear that the warrior begins to wear so god is dressing himself in his own armor it goes on to say of the garments of vengeance he clothed himself he clothed himself in the garments of vengeance so he's saying that he is fully ready to execute on all of his people's enemies he's saying i've got this instead of you saying i've got this so he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and it means that he would go forth to vindicate his people and to take vengeance upon his own foes so it is saying that it would not be more or for mere defense that he would be thus armed for battle but you see when god moves forward in battle it is in defense for one purpose and for his people so when we see god dressing for war we know that it's a purpose behind it now god that's don't dress for war for any occasion but god dresses for war for certain situations and god puts on the garments of vengeance when it comes to his children so many times we enjoy fighting our battles we enjoy doing these things but god is telling you i am the one that is going to receive the victory and i'm going to bring it to pass now you'll be able to enjoy the victory you'll be able to enjoy what i'm going to do but don't take it from me oh hallelujah so many times doctors want his victory so many times people want his victory but god says don't take what is rightfully mine you see i'm the one that's going to bring about your deliverance i'm the one that's going to bring about your salvation i'm the one that's going to bring about your healing don't take that from me oh hallelujah the bible says that he clad himself with a zeal as a cloak and when you look at a warrior in battle and what that cloak is it's a loose flowing robe that is fastened around the shoulder and goes through the loin parts and is clasped on the shoulder by a clasp and usually this this this cloak of zeal is purple in color to represent the zeal of vengeance in a warfare and so jesus is saying to us is that i'm wearing the scarlet rope that i am wearing these things in representation of the zeal that i have against the enemy that was back there in the garden that slipped under the walls and he is saying i am wearing this cloak to make sure that i am sowing forth my seal to bring about deliverance and a vengeance to my children the bible said that the seal of the lord hath eaten me up you remember when jesus went there and he began to he began to plot that rope and he began to get angry and he got all upset because what they had turned the house of god into and he told them that they were making his house a den of thieves and he began to take this rope and he began to beat down the money changers and overthrow the tables and the disciples remembered that the seal of the lord's health has e in me up you're talking about a seal but this is not an earthly zeal that people have well i'm going to the house of god and i'm going to do this thing i'm going to bring about victory but this is a godly zeal this is a zeal that can only come from above because there was great religions in the world but they still did not have this eel yes there was zealots in the land but they did not have the zeal of the house of the lord but here the house was standing in front of them with a seal to show that i have come forth to manifest these things you see the more satan labors against us and makes every effort against us to to thwart us to stop us to make us doubt god's promises so much more does god kindle with zeal all satan's efforts will be defeated [Music] all of his efforts how many's fought the enemy this week so god has wanted to tell you that tonight i'm dressing for war not andrew spencer not william borlaphon not josh jones you're dealing with a church has got you back in the natural and in the supernatural we got you back you can lean on us we'll help you i'm looking at some people that'll help me in battle but god is saying to you that i am dressing myself for warfare and when he begins to dress himself there is only one thing that he has in mind and that is complete victory now there's one thing for you and i to get in our mind that we're going to go forth and we're going to conquer but when god says i'm dressing myself he don't just get dressed up for any reason he gets dressed up for his children and he says i'm dressing myself in this hour to show myself as a man of war oh hallelujah the bible says in psalm 68 let god arise and let his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flee before him that smoke is driven away so drive them away as wax melteth before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of god but let the righteous be glad let them rejoice before god yay let them exceedingly rejoice sing unto god sing praises to his name extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name yah and rejoice before him oh he's arising and there's a people that is extolling and rejoicing and praising you're rejoicing the people of god are rejoicing the children of god are rejoicing but the wicked is fleeing the wicked is trembling because god has arisen you see what they have missed they've looked at god throughout the the old testament they looked at god through through the church ages but they missed him and they're calling for zeal they're calling for repentance they're calling for revivals but they miss the awakening of the bride they did not recognize this day and its visitation in this hour and they miss the man of war as he stood up like never before to show i am he messiah is represented as a warrior that is armed at all points and there's nothing that can break his armor you know god's weapon of choice is his word he will never be defeated it'll defeat satan anytime anyplace under any circumstance he'll win your victories it'll win your healing it'll win your deliverances this is god's weapon of choice in exodus chapter 15 when the when they when they when the children of israel had come through come through the red sea and they got out on the other side and they begin to rejoice before the lord moses began to sing a song and verse 3 says the lord is a man of war he is a man he is a man of war the lord is his name you see the object of moses was to show that man had no part in this victory but what was done by the miraculous power of god and therefore all the glory should be resolved to him he is saying the lord is his name jehovah the only true god so he is giving to the children of israel that all the complete existence of his promises is in this man oh hallelujah you remember on the other side of that river moses stood up and told them that it's the lord that's going to fight your battles don't you be afraid of that sea and don't you be afraid of that army i am the lord that will fight your battles and god dressed himself oh hallelujah it was more than a rod that went across that sea it was an angel that went and got so mad he got so mad because the enemy was chasing down he was chasing down god's children i spoke to the lord this morning i said god i don't know what you're chasing down by putting me on this thought but you're chasing down something you're chasing down something i say to you church the angel the lord is mad he's mad at the devil for everything that he's done for her to you and god has arose and he's dressed himself covet 19 has affected your day-to-day activities you no longer worship you no longer walk in the church the same way you walked in but god is mad at the devil god's mad at coven 19 god's madder cancer god's mad at depression and god has dressed himself now after i walked out of my study i went downstairs and i seen that there was some clothing that was laid out for me you know what i did i began to dress myself because i realized that there was a job for me to do now you see i realize what i am to do in this relationship as preacher and he is the real preacher but i recognize my position and all i got to do is get myself out of the way but i gotta dress myself accordingly and god says i'm not coming down here unarmed but i'm dressing myself i'm dressing myself and my vesture is dipped in blood [Applause] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah the bible says in jeremiah 51 and 20 thou art my battle axe and weapons of war for with thee i will break in pieces of nations and with thee will i destroy kingdoms brother meadows brother josh you guys a lot of you human here you're used to swinging an axe but god is saying i'm i'm your battle axe you can swing all you want to in your might but i am the one that when i come crashing down i'm the one that will break the nations i'm the one that'll defeat enemies of hell i'm the one all the glory belongs to him brother branham said you let satan take after a believer and he's got jesus christ on his hands when joshua's standing there by the way of jericho and he's looking how in the world he's going to get on the inside of them walls because he knew that that was his inheritance he knew it belonged to him and he knew that the enemy had moved in there and they were inhabiting his promise and he was standing there and as he was standing there contemplating how in the world am i going to get in here him being a stone mason knowing how much and how thick those walls were he knew every ins and outs about making brick and mortar but there was a one that knew how to break those walls down standing there and joshua looked at him and he had his sworn drawn in his hand he is showing to you that he's already got his word already pulled out and he's ready for battle oh hallelujah what came down in this hour it was a king sword it was the opening of the word and it's ready to take your walls down what happened that sword showed that there was victory coming oh i was speaking to a minister friend this week when this bible came open i remember when it came open i remember when it was closed to me i remember how i felt how i fought the enemies how i fought these things and it seemed like they continuously bore me down but i remember the night that the book came open it was no longer a closed book it was no longer a sword in a sheath but it was a sword that was drawn and when the book came open it was no longer a close book it was an open book and i realized the power of the third pull that it was not just for brother branham but it was for me oh children if you could ever take a look at this sword that it was not just meant for a prophet but it was meant for a people to take you out to pull you out to lift you up the devil has showed up at a good place to get a black eye a bleeding nose and a messed up rib cage tonight because god has dressed himself oh church you can follow your general he's been proven in battle hallelujah we got a five-star general spell j-e-s-u-s placing five stars on him and five stars on us f-a-i-t-h he's never lost a battle hallelujah he conquered death hell and the grave get the devils out of the way he's the great chief captain so the devil easing isn't even in the picture you ain't even there buddy hey man we're living in we live here living in a scientific age and you can't do nothing without getting caught on camera but the devil ain't even in the picture with me and you take a selfie and it ain't fair take a group picture and he ain't there oh hallelujah putting on the whole armor he said now god fortified his army what with himself how you know you're going to win how you know you're going to overcome how you know i got him himself god fortified his army what with himself in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was god doing listen did you ever think what the offices of the church is it's god's dress inside dress an apostle a prophetess here foresee before satan ever gets a hold gets to it it's done been told what is it it's god dressed up in his church these offices is god's dress where and when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelists he didn't say take players but he said what is that that's god's dress where god's presence god's spirit working through man and if that office denies any of his word then it's not god's dressing it's god dressing himself in his church oh help me preach tonight church you didn't realize that when you was getting dressed that god was dressing himself for war you remember you remember when the trap was set there in chicago you remember those 300 that's 300 minister ministerial association had set a trap brother branham had a meeting in a certain room and it was already set up but they moved it around to a different room and brother branham sat down with some brothers and he began to tell them that it's not going to be in that room it's not going to be in that room but it's going to be in this room and this is where this brother is going to sit at and this is where that brother said it's going to sit at and he said it's a trap and these brothers have come against me by my preaching on the serpent seed on the evidence of the holy ghost and water baptism he told them exactly where they'd be setting out and every detail of it and brother branham stood there and laid it out before him put out his bibles sat there and said look brothers all of this comes out of the bible and if one of you come up here and prove me where i was wrong and none of them got out of their seats 70 of them said they was going to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but they was too yelly belly to do it they was too afraid of their meal tickets brother branham said if you can't prove me wrong then get off my back i got those same critics that are listening tonight they're listening to what i'm going to say and try to use it against me and my wife i say to you and i curse that demon of hell get off my back now i know you're listening i know you're listening so hear me i have done led hundreds maybe thousands of the lord jesus christ by this message you bring me one that you brought and maybe i'll listen to you but you can't do it because you are proving yourself to be entired i take my bible and i'll stand in the corner with a in the corner with the devil and you go and you take your theologies and all your ideologies and stand in the corner with the devil and we'll see who comes out walking i know the power of this word i've walked into the corner and i watched god dress himself and show himself as a man of war but i ain't never seen one of these blogs no one of these facebook posts ever win one person to jesus christ [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah you can do all you want to but on rapture morning you can sit there and try to blog all you want to about me and my message but this message is none other than jesus christ and it will lift me up [Applause] get off my back i've stood here for the last three weekends and i've stood here your pastor stood here and we have faced a demonic power that has tried to resist the word of god bad news he lost [Music] you better know where you're standing at when you look in that devil right in the face but you don't have to stay in that condition brother there's grace there's grace there's grace when the assyrians came against israel and surrounded them hezekiah spoke these words in second chronicles 32-7 be strong and courageous and be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him for there be more with us than with him with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the words of hezekiah king of judah i can rest myself in the word of our king he said i'm not going to leave you i'm going to be with you when the three hebrew children when they were in trouble he didn't send an angel down he came down himself psalms 24 and 7 lift up your heads all your gates and be you lift up your everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads all your gates and even lift them up your everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory salah he's the one that's fighting your battles he's the one that's making a way you remember you remember when the prophet stood there and those two girls had been delivered and those two girls that have got to touch and they they there's these two imposters that went around and putting out these pamphlets saying the fbi was going to expose brother branham that night you remember and he stood there and he said no he said don't worry he said i know the fbi personally i said he said i highly doubt that they've got anything to do with divine healing here he said well wherever they say we're so sorry for spreading all the good news oh that's what you're supposed to do that's what the devil wants to keep you from doing and spreading the good news is that right he's trying to keep you from spreading this message and sharing the good news the gospel is the good news but i want to tell you church that the gospel is good news but it's more than just good news that that jesus christ has risen from the grave and he conquered death hell and the grave but i want to tell you the good news today is that he is now risen in bright form to conquer every tomb of denomination every sin and every doubt every flusteration everything he's risen and a bride the good news is the head ship is in the body mother banham goes he goes and takes he goes and takes the platform and he says well they tell me the fbi is here tonight to expose me he said so why don't you come on down here and do it why don't you come on down here and do it he said he told those girls he said now look you have watched god as a healer but you watch god as a warrior you think he's good and healing you watch him when he goes to war when he goes to fighting for his children that's when god shows forth his majesty and his glory when the devil goes to trying to whisper in your ear that you're not god's child then god gets mad and puts on the cloak of vengeance you watch him as a warrior one time have you watched him i watched him a few times and he and every one time walked into that battle and come out with his lips sticking out but i have watched the devil walk out more than a lip sticking out eyes halfway hanging out he said if the fbi's here won't you step out and expose me for being an imposter you said i'm simon the sorcerer why don't you step out and all of a sudden the spirit of the lord began to move and he said no it's not the fbi it's them two backslidden preachers standing up there in that balcony that they devised this plan while they were sitting together he said if i be simonides or sir let god strike me dead but why don't you come down here and take my place and let's see who's right and who's wrong and those men ran out of that building as fast as they could it was a showdown between god and satan and god won god is dressing himself [Applause] psalms 3 and 6 says that i will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about arise o lord and save me o my god for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone and thou has broken the teeth of the ungodly salvation belongeth unto the lord thy the blessing is upon my people y'all thought i was just talking from my own from my own thinking about the devil walking away with a busted up lip david had already told me that that god breaks the teeth of the ungodly if i preach something to you it's either going to be in quote form or bible form but look here now jesus was man and he called himself the son of man he said that was a death blow to the death the devil is high he built himself a kingdom more beautiful than michael's and cain his son wanted to make a more pretty altar all over the fruits and things and god doesn't dwell in that kind of beauty but god to strike the death blow to sin look how he came how he how did he choose to come there was a conference in heaven how are you going how are you going to do it father said the angels father said to the angels he said i'm going to become one of them my law of redemption is a near kinsman and i have to be man myself that's the strike that knocks satan you see they were looking for a general when they were looking for a messiah they were looking for a mighty leader a military genius one that was scientific genius but god gave him a lamb he'd give them a baby what a contrast you think they'd accept that crying child but that's what they needed god gives you according to your needs they got a baby when they was wanting a general but they got a baby meek lowly and god knew they're neat god may not give you what you expect but god will give you exactly what you need you didn't mean he'd need a military genius you needed a baby you needed one to take on the robe of humanity and when jesus came he didn't dress himself in some great splendor but he dressed himself in a robe of humanity he took on the form of humanity to be made like you and i to feel like you and i to understand like you and i placed in a manger in a manure pile an illegitimate name tacked to it and his business was not a carpenter but his business was the father's business that's why when you go and you look at jesus in luke chapter 2 through 42 52 and you see jesus and his mother and his and his father joseph they leave him there they walk off and they leave him and they go about look what they do they go about looking at their kin folk and they look at their acquaintance to find where jesus is mary was denying the very supernatural birth that had taken place in her life by going around and seeking these things but as soon as she got to jesus jesus began to correct the error but could you imagine mary's spot of view losing jesus i'm afraid that too many people have done the same thing they left jesus and they looked everywhere else but back at the place where they left him hallelujah they looked everywhere but the place that they left him and most of the time if you'll go to search and where you left him you left him when you left the word this humanity took on such a robe that he looked like the others he walked and he dressed himself like other humanity but there was so much humanity about him but there was so much deity about him that at 12 years old he could stand there and astonish the doctors and the philosophers and the priests of that day they were looking for a general but god had robed himself in the form of humanity they wanted somebody that they could attach their name to that he's sadducee or his pharisee or he's of this sect of group but he came and he took home a name oh when he came in that name yeah there was other there was other joshuas there was other jehovah saviors there was other jesus's but when he took on this name he came and he took on the name of jesus and he was coming to save his people from their sins there have been other jesuses but there was only one lord jesus christ you can be baptized in the name of jesus but it'll never do you no good but when you take on the lordship of our jesus christ then you take on more than just a man you take on god there ain't no power there ain't no power in being baptized in the name of father son and holy ghost those are just titles but when you take on his name and christian baptism you are identifying that you have died to yourself and you are taking on a name oh hallelujah that name is high above every other name that name will save when no other name will save that name will deliver with no other name whatever he dressed himself in the robe of humanity to go to warfare oh if you look at the man jesus the bible said that they looked at him when he said that he knew abraham and he was but 30 years old and they said how can this man being 50 years old be able to know abraham but he was under such a stress float of the burden of the word of the lord that this humanity was everything that god was needing to destroy sin there'd been other flesh born before but there had never been one that was virgin born and everything that god needed for warfare was dressed in this humanity to defeat sin to defeat sickness to defeat adultery to defeat lasciviousness to defeat malice and strife everything was dressed in this man jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah he said that day at calvary was the death blow to satan's power it ended everything it ended everything but we get so busy we get so caught up and we forget the one that was lifted up he dressed himself in such a way that satan would say charlie surely he can't be the one surely he won't let me hit him like this surely surely if he'd be the son of god he wouldn't let me whip him like this surely if he be the messiah that's been promised he would raise in power and he'd strike back my hand he was so robed and dressed in a weapon of warfare that's satan satan said it can't be him it can't be him he wouldn't let me hang him on a cross if it was really him he wouldn't let me put this crown of thorns on him if it was really him but that day at calvary it ended everything every strike that the devil had coming to it ended everything he had a punch coming from you but that day at calvary jesus took suicide away from you that day at calvary took depression away from you that day at calvary took death away from you so stop allowing that devil to beat you up with an ended thing it's time that you start looking at the devil and say is this the man god's chasing down something tonight and i'm just i'm just stupid enough to follow him for a moment he's chasing down something it's time that you start looking at the thing that has afflicted you and said is this the man that overthrew that overthrew the kingdoms this this thing i i was bothered by that you young people got swag about yourself i don't halfway know the language of 15's and 30 years old i'm 30 couple and i still don't know that 30 year old language but i have heard stuff being being in this youth choir that i ain't ever heard in my life i thought the stuff we had when i was 15 was stupid oh forgive me what is it it's no longer the hip to say cool where you hang up glasses on what do you say now yeah you we can't say cool no more is it chill let's chill let's chill man it's chill but young people have a little bit of swag about themselves you forgive me for this for a moment but it's a time that the children of god get a little bit of swag about themselves and say is this is this the thing that i allowed to torment me in my night seasons yeah go ahead you're the children of god you can have an attitude with the devil because he can't touch one hair of your head you've got a right to have a little bit of swag about yourself well i'm on the battlefield for my lord yeah i'm on the battlefield for my lord well i promise him that i i'd serve him till i die yeah i'm on the battlefield for my lord so i'm ain't gonna let you both me no more it ended everything that day at calvary i understand what it's like to face the tormenting spirit i understand those things i understand that then when you can't even say nothing but everybody around you understands that you're going through something i understand that you're afraid to talk about those things that are so so personal to you but can i encourage you tonight that when you get to that spot that you let god dress himself and begin to pray through you just think just encourage yourself right here and let god dress himself and you would allow you'd allow god to begin to work through that humanity [Music] that the things that have haunted you and just begin to war so deeply in your mind just to let god arise just encourage yourself in the lord brother ron speak to on the fulfillment of taking it back that fulfillment of taking it back is getting everything back it's not allowing those things to stay over there on the other side but it's fulfilling taking it back and when you fulfill getting it back it's no longer taking it back it's saying i got it so you can take back you can take back your right mind you can take back your family you can take back your children you can take back your love you can take back your joy but when you take it back it's no longer out there but you got it are you with me it was like benjamin franklin when electricity hit the bottle he said he had it but he didn't know what he had but the manifestation was brought forth in thomas and edison and he really had it there's been pentecostals that said they had it but you got it oh ah hallelujah won't you stay with me this evening won't you go ahead and thank the lord for getting it i want you to thank the lord for an endy thing then it's already done that it's over hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah sister jenny you come on my heart so strong this evening when i was in my study and i stand there and i was thinking about the ladies of grace in this hour i'm thinking about you and i was thinking about how you torment the devil oh hallelujah that god chose to dress himself in a lady of grace i said i i'm going to win this thing through a vessel called jenny shipley [Applause] oh i'm going to win this thing through a vessel called mary davis i'm going to win this thing to a vessel called sister linda gregor i'm gonna win this thing so since there's hardly no hell i'm dressing myself in the form of humanity oh hallelujah and if i dress myself i'm going to win oh give the lord a handcraft of [Applause] i'm on the grace for my lord [Applause] hallelujah well i'm on a battlefield for my lord oh [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] i was alone in idol i was a sinner too i heard a voice from heaven saying there is work to do so i took my master's man and i joined that heavenly father now [Music] oh [Applause] oh i lost my flagging battle my staff is in my hand i'm taking it to jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] with my lord [Applause] [Music] oh
