and just give it back to the Lord father it's a great privilege that we have to stand before the elect Lord we counted an honor to stand before your people Lord the Bride of this last day father right here in Elkton Virginia and other surrounding areas right here around Virginia Lord and the work that has been established in the hearts and lives of your people Lord God we don't stand here with boastfulness we don't stand here Lord as anything man-made of our own selves but father we stand as your agent tonight God we're we're here to to deliver what you've laid Upon Our Hearts and God we're so thankful that this message works Lord we've seen lives change Lord men and women Lord go in One Direction and this message has come across their path bothering their lives completely changed father in a moment in the twinkling of an eye Lord your your word comes across them and completely redirects their life and Lord we just believe tonight that you're that same kind of God Lord there be maybe some here tonight that are going down the wrong road but father I know that you're able and we just ask that your spirit of Christ will have Liberty to move Lord you see the direction you've given me for the service tonight and possibly for in the morning and well we just want to be very mindful of the spirit be sensitive to the direction you would have us to go in the words you would have us to speak and I will ask Lord tonight that you would anoint these lips to speak only those things that would edify the body and God I would ask that you'll anoint the ears of The Listener Lord that they can look past the veil and hear what the spirit of Christ would have to be said tonight so Lord we ask these things now in Jesus name amen and amen well we certainly honored to be here we greet you in the wonderful name of our Lord and savior I want to thank brother Ron and brother Andrew for having us and having confidence in us it's one thing to invite a man while you're here and and the host Pastor is here but it's another thing to invite a man when they're gone and so we're it just proves the confidence that they have in the gift and we're certainly thankful for that and I want to thank brother Gabe for his hosting of us uh him and Sister Sarah taking us to dinner last night and just spending time with us and sister Connie thank you for the wonderful lunch and everything we just uh we enjoy you as a church body we know that our churches are very similar sister churches if you would say so I know that to me I'm probably not new to you and and a stranger to you but some of you are strangers to me so we're just glad to be here and we just want to turn our attention away just for a little bit tonight to the word and I want to speak to you tonight on Satan can't stop the change and as I begin to prepare for this several weeks back knowing that I had this meeting and this is a big meeting in my eyes preaching for brother Ron Spencer so it was it's big and and the Lord laid us on my heart and brother Wayne Lawson was recently at our church and he preached on the mystery of the change now some of you is listen to that and you stream being see the change for so many years has been a mystery but I want to come behind that tonight and says Satan can't stop this change he's tried year after year age after age and we're still here we're still standing God gave a promise I'm gonna have a body I'm going to have a bride Church we're here let's look here in John 14 and verse 1 tonight as you turn there brother Chris good to see you tonight glad to be here so the Bible says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again notice the promise that we have as a believer I've gone to prepare a place for you it's not like brother Gabe you're building a house but it's not that kind of place that you're building for Sister Sarah and for your future family but he says if I go prepare a place for you I'm going to come again I'm going to receive you to myself that where I am there you may be also and brother Brandon won't tell us as you're standing I want to read this quote he says now that sounds strange in a house he says in a house being of mansions he says but what is it that the time the King James version as a translation every man that had a kingdom a king he had his domain was his see he was called the father and this was called his household the children the children is his domain his house now I want to read here in First Corinthians 15 and verse 50. so as you're turning there just think about God's desires for his bride to be with him as much as you long to be there with him he longs to have you there with him see he wants you in his kingdom he's going to prepare this place and we have a promise that he is gone and we will come soon he will return back First Corinthians 15 and verse 50. now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doeth corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on in corruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall I put on in corruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass to saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where was I seeing o grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin the strength of the law or the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be you steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for so much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord God bless you you can have your seats tonight if I get just a little bit more volume up here so like I said I want to speak to you on Satan cannot stop this change now this is tonight may be a platform for tomorrow morning as I may take this in the two-part series but we find here the Bible would tell us that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God now I know many of you here tonight you've been Christians for a long time you've been Believers for a long time and maybe you've been filled with the Holy Ghost for a long time but just want you to know tonight that your flesh and blood can't inherit the kingdom of God you know the Bible says that corruption cannot inherit incorruption or neither does corruption inherent incorruption but he shows us some Mr we should not all sleep otherwise we're not all going to die we're not all going to go down to the grave but we all shall be changed and the Bible would tell us here for this corruptable must put on incorruption and the word must here means it's a need it has to it behooves us it has to be established as a decree of God for this body of ours to put on immortality then this body has to go through a change and they're like we drove up here brother Mark and we were looking and admiring the beauty of Virginia into changing the colors in the leaves and no matter what size can do size can't stop the change that's going on around us those leaves are going to change colors those leaves are going to fall off and the sap is going to go back into the ground of that tree and there's nothing that man can do there's nothing that science can do can stop that change what am I telling you tonight the Bible says that this flesh that we have that we were born with this place is corruptable but in order to take that body in order to go into the kingdom of God this body's got to be changed and I want to put the devil on notice tonight there ain't nothing that he can do to stop this body from changing we got a promise in the word this evening that where I am you shall be there you look in the mirror and you see all your mistakes you see all your failures but God doesn't see your mistake God sees his word God sees the victory God sees you already there church we shall be changed not maybe not hopefully some of us we you know a lot of times you failed and you make a mistake and you hope God will forgive you no church it don't operate that way God is a giving God a loving God a merciful god and God is here to forgive us God is here he's here to change our bodies so in order for these old vowel corruptable bodies of ours that we were born with for the Bible says in Psalm 51 and verse 5 behold I was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me so notice we were born in sin we were shaped in iniquity you came in a corruptible form but God already saw you in an Incorruptible form and the problem of God will tell us we may speak on this tomorrow you bypassed her theophany when you came here but God sent you a message to bring you back into that theophany body because God wasn't going to leave you in this condition God gave you a word he said I'm going to have a bride and she's going to be with our spot she's going to be without corruption and she's going to fit the mortality of this word she's gonna be immortal and so in order for these bodies to put on incorruption they must be changed and when these bodies are changed then it's going to be brought to pass oh death hold that you scared of many a Believer down Through the Ages oh death you threaten to take him with cancer of that you you threatened to take him with this disease and this Affliction and this war but somebody in the last day is going to stand up and say oh death where's your sting where is your Venom where is your Victory but thanks be to our lord Jesus he gives us the victory through his word see we are that generation we are that generation that is going to look death in the face and say you can't sting me you can't sting me oh my savior's already been stung and he pulled this thing of death out of it you have no power you have no power over my change I've been born again through the spirit of God [Music] [Applause] we are that people is going to say you can't destroy me well some of you need this tonight some of you came in are all depressed because you made a mistake but there's somebody says you can't destroy me that you can't destroy me sickness you can't destroy me failures you can't destroy me my past I'm here to tell you it can't destroy you tonight you've been changed already and you're just waiting for another change we are the people that is going to look at the grave and say you will not triumph over me where's your victory the grave has no picture over the believer oh I will not take part in you grave I'm not going where you are come on Church notice Generations have waited for this moment prophets have waited for this moment they have heard these scriptures they have heard about a change they have preached about it Through the Ages through seven Church ages but now you're here I said now you're here and now Society has finally caught up with us to where now these bodies can be changed now you see all the signs of the time and the prophet of God will say when you look out there and you see the signs out there Israel back in her Homeland oh look up for your Redemption drawers now God is getting ready to come and sweep over and have a change and he's going to bring you with him notice they've anticipated they've anticipated sages Great Men great daughters and and Believers Brothers of uh that we would call in previous ages they have waited and anticipated this change they have waited for the Rapture of the elect but we're the ones oh Church you may think you stumbled into the house of God tonight God brought to you because he's telling you you're one of the ones you didn't just happily happen says walk through the door this message happens to us come into contact with you no there was a sea place on the inside of your heart and that seed had to cross path with this word because this word is going to have an effect on somebody's life it's going to come down there and change their lives here I was a 20-something-year-old man on a drunken and God came down at the middle of the night in my car and said turn your car around oh church I made a change that night and I never looked back if that God can do it to me what can he do for you tonight he can change you he can change your course he can change the direction I'm going to tell you he can not only change that but he can change these bodies I say glory to God tonight I'm waiting for my teeth I'm anticipating my change now we're here just to play Church we're here to be changed because every service is stacking on more word more faith notice 15 and verse 51 I show you a mystery a secret it's been hidden for seven Church ages but in that seventh age all all the mysteries of God should be finished the mystery of your change it took a Vindicated profit to reveal to us the change and notice how many of you read psalms 27 how many great Scholars have read psalms 27 how many great men theologians had read psalms 27 but one placed it as the Rapture message one place it right there in the secret of his Tabernacle he's going to hide me he's going to hide me right there oh church we ain't got to worry about tribulation brother more we got a promise this bride escapes tribulation [Applause] she escapes the Wrath that is coming because why because she's already been changed her thinking has been changed her actions have been changed and I've been beginning ahead of myself but I'm trying to tell you tonight so how many of you here were crew are sinners at one point come on work with me tonight no you wasn't born a cherub he wasn't born a little angel with little wings flying around oh bless God holy holy holy no you were born in sin is shaped and iniquity you needed a God to come and save you you needed a God to come by and change your thinking let me tell you if Satan couldn't stop that tank he ain't gonna stop the next one that's why you're here you're here to be changed you're gonna take on a new body oh well buddy a Celestial body he couldn't stop you then he can't stop us now I say glory to God I say you don't have enough tonight to stop this body now stop this bro we shall be changed we shall be changed they're so corruptable place it's gonna one day step into your mortality oh yeah some of you old people I ain't picking on you but you know how when you get out of that bed and you roll over and you Creek and you pop and you Mo oh oh one day oh I'm going to tell you one day I won't be no more creaking there won't be no more popping ain't gonna be no more moaning no sir we gonna be in a new body oh we're gonna travel like a dog we got a soar through the ages and Satan can't stop I said Satan can't stop it he don't have enough to stop you we will be changed oh Hallelujah tonight Church you may have walked into press thinking oh I'm defeated no your enemy's defeated [Applause] Hallelujah notice this word change it means to exchange one form for another to make different to transform now I don't know about you but when I wake up in the morning I don't want to live in this whole body forever you know man if I had it my way I wouldn't be five foot five I'd be tall dark and handsome but it is what it is I'm short cute and Stumpy hey I got an amen right here yeah but it's to be changed to change forms and the Bible how many of us can add one cubic to a stature oh if we could you'd all done tried oh yeah notice what he says this word transformed here is the Greek word metamorpho and we're going to look at that tomorrow but just briefly that means to change into another form to transfigure to transform and notice now he says in in Romans 12 and verse 1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies notice we got to present these bodies you can't just keep keeping on sinning and going on the way you've been going no you got to present this body as a Living Sacrifice to God the Bible said holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service that's your responsibility let me tell you sometimes you come in the house of God you don't feel like worshiping you don't feel like praising you don't feel like dragging that old body out of the house oh but that's your reasonable service you got to bring this body into subjection to the word and say body you're going to the house of God oh buddy you ain't gonna sit down on the preaching tonight you're gonna stand you're going to Amen to word you're going to worship in spirit and in truth you're going to give God praise because God's done something for you because God's already changed you that's your reasonable service otherwise that's what God expects how to use the believer in Romans 12 and verse 2 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed many more food by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good or what is that is good and acceptable in the perfect will of God notice this word mind here is the faculties of perceiving and understanding those feelings you know it's just not the gray matter because you know what you lose the gray matter the older you get the more forgetful you get some of us get dementia some of us get Alzheimer's and all these things thankfully God ain't dependent upon the gray matter but he says renewing of the Mind renewing of the processes the part of your life the heart that the believer receives with and before these mortal bodies can ever take on immortality the change has to come here your whole attention has to change your whole Direction has to change your own life has to change and not with the Mind mind over matter but your heart has to change and you come subject to the word you come subject to the thoughts of God you come subject to to the messes of the hour and you allow that word to change you to wash over you to bathe over you and to completely rewrite your life [Music] see our minds and our hearts have to be transformed before these bodies are going to be transformed your way of life has to be transformed can I tell you a testimony let me tell you a testimon the power of God there's a brother grew up in the message left a message when he was young maybe 18 somewhere around there this is not the other brother that was used here last month this is another brother and this brother left the message and he started running with the wrong crowd he had a rap sheet that long brother gave Grand Larson theft all these other different things you would have looked at that brother you would have never gave him a chance he got married to this lady she was a practicing atheist sense a small child she said she didn't know what food tastes like until she got saved because she was on drugs ever since she was a little bitty child and we're not talking just marijuana we're talking hardcore methamphetamines and and drugs cocaine things of that nature and we find if I had time for the thought about I would have threw a picture up here but yet one day in the one moment you would have looked at him and said there's no hope there's no way but God doesn't look at your case that way God doesn't look at it God looks at the seed that he put down inside there and God knows when God knows how and God knows exactly the time that that life is going to change oh he had a rap sheet a mile long but God didn't worry about the rap she God already had his name peeing on the book of life and God said I'm coming by your way and when the god comes by your way you can expect the change to take place God came by there and got a hold of his heart and completely changed his life and today he's a deacon in that church and his atheist wife is a Sunday school teacher [Applause] why because God began to change and you may be here tonight why do I believe this why do I receive it ain't you it's God placed something inside of you oh but see before before these bodies are going to be changed your thinking has to change your desires have to change your natures have to change and see where does this change occur right here in the heart so we want to give credit to the mind it just comes down to about the prophet God will say the word comes to the channel of the mind and drops down into the heart and when it drops down to the heart it catches the spirit behind the word and it brings life into the believer that's why you're here tonight see we can no longer think the way the world thinks you're Messiahs you're amateur God you got to think like God oh brother Joe you mean I gotta think like God absolutely got to think like God quit thinking like the world no you got a thing like God you got to think when you speaking in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know without a shadow of a doubt it's going to happen God said I will make all things possible to them that'll believe just believe what he said about you just believe that you are that bride you are without a spot you are without a wrinkle you are without a blemish that's what the word says about you I don't care how I feel I don't care what I look like in the mirror I'm not looking at myself I'm looking at the word and the words already declared this about me see our minds have to be renewed the Bible says here that be transformed by the renewing of the mind of your heart that you may prove what is good except when the perfect will of God see so before these bodies are ever going to be changed our hearts had to be changed why did God send a prophet Malachi 4 tells us behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn change at heart turn that heart from the filth of the world the desires of the Lord and turn it back he says I'll turn the heart of the fathers to the children in the heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the search with a curse see that is precisely when we had to have a Malachi 4. to turn the heart of the elect back to the faith of the fathers amen back to the faith that was once delivered where was it delivered at the upper room come stumbling out like a bunch of drunks you find people they don't want to get drunk how many of you ever got drunk not in the spirit natural all right don't be too proud about it everybody's like and what am I see me he said brother why you act so crazy when you preach why are you act so crazy when you worship because I know where I came from I told my wife when I was out in the world I got drunk I ain't happy about it now but I got drunk and I got on that dance floor and I didn't care what anybody thought about me I was cutting a rug it didn't matter what they thought about it look around take a picture and do what you want every day when I came to God it didn't stop that person it didn't stop my praise it just changed my father in place I don't care what you think about me because I enjoy my Lord I enjoy the presence of a living God I've Been Changed brother my think has been changed hey where you ain't worried about things for Jesus you can sit down as you want to but it's worth serving he's worth dancing for he's worth praising God for and if I could do that for the devil what can I do for God I think what can I do for God don't you sit down on God he's done so much for you he deserves your praise shall didn't grow up in church now I grew up at a house parents that were on drugs separated 20 something years my parents were divorced we went back and forth as kids but God placed something on the inside no matter how much I ran how far I ran how steeped and sin I went God knew there was coming a day God knew there was going to be a moment in a car at 11 30 at night when I was out on a truck he said turn your come on ah made a change I changed the direction of my car I went back to the house and I I knelt beside my bed and I gave my heart to the Lord let me tell you I ain't never been the same I never had one desire to go back to what I was to go back to the alcohol now go back to the women they go back to the parties they go back to that seat now I've been changed and that change took place here but that ain't the only change that God has promised God has promised us we all shall be changed [Applause] we all are going to be changed notice the heart the inner part of a man the soul of a man and the Bible would tell you this word heart is the mind the knowledge to think and the reflection the memory see the mind has to be transformed which is the heart has to be transformed now how many of you like change don't you lie Amen to me like that you know you don't like change there's somebody can I hey can I appreciate y'all tonight Winston Churchill made this statement about change because that's what we're preaching on to improve is to change but to be perfect is to change often and you're like oh great now Jesus told us be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect oh that means I got to change and I got to change often now you young people you're okay with change because every day is a new adventure great Hallelujah we can do it but you owe people no no no no no no no no no well job preached something different change your topic tonight we don't like change the older I get the more I get like my parents you know they they told you that you was worried when you was a kid you're gonna act just like your mom and dad it happens you say the same things you act the same way you have evolved into mama and you have evolved into daddy and you swore I will never change to be that we are here yeah some of you don't shout amen too loud your Mom and Daddy's here but notice we find through each Church age there had to be an element of change from one age Ephesians it changed over then it changed over and then it changed and every change it brought a greater aspect of perfection but where are we at today Church we're in the last days the seventh day the final age there's not another age promise we're not here to be changed into another age or to another messenger or to somebody else no we're here we're expecting our culmination of that change where he told us we're going to meet the Lord in the air that's the change that we're looking for now you know as much as you don't like to change and you don't like this and you don't like that let me tell you the devil don't want you to change tonight he don't want you to change he don't want you to go into the Rapture he don't want you to change some now he's doing everything that he can to keep you from your change news flash you're here he didn't stop you tonight he can't stop you tomorrow he ain't gonna stop you next week he ain't gonna stop us next month if he goes another 10 years we'll still be here we'll still be preaching this word we'll still be worshiping Our God Satan you don't have enough to change to stop this change see change here's a saying about change change is painful now you can say Amen but nothing listen nothing is as painful I stand stuck where you don't belong I hope you look at that nothing you think is tough now if you don't change when we change let me tell you it's going to be painful there's gonna be utter destruction there's going to be chaos but we have been promised we're not going to go down into a tribulation beer God has already foresaw you he says I've already seen that bride she ain't going down in defeat but she's drawing up in Victory she she's over Christian Soldier let me tell you the same bride that went down or they came in preview first is the same bride that's here tonight [Applause] and Satan doesn't like it I said he doesn't like it I believe we all there's another thing about change there's only one constant in life and that has changed yeah I woke up this morning I had about five more hairs on my head I wash my hair I looked at it sink I didn't get in the tub I looked at the sink when you're five foot five you can wash your hair in the sink and I look down there I'm like I'll never get those back on this side you think I'm happy I'm losing my hair absolutely not nor are you happy with those wrinkles nor are you happy with that pain no you should be happy with with the things of Life constantly coming down see change is constant in the order that we get the more we dislike it you know some of them I'm 47 I'm young come on somebody that's 47 around there 50 I'll give you that 60 come on We're Young come on she said come on preach it yeah you know the older you get the more set in your ways you become you don't want to leave the house Walmart forget that we're calling in that order we gonna drive up pick it up leave we don't want to go down those aisles shopping ain't nobody got time for that no no we don't want to leave we get homebody come on guys I got some home bodies up in here but he don't want hey if it wasn't for the grace of God you'd be streaming tonight [Laughter] but we don't like change the whole do you get man change looks ugly but you can't stop it yeah see as we age we find that we dislike it more we get set in our routines we like to get up at a certain time go to bed at a certain eat food at a certain time do this at a certain time do that at a certain in my heaven forbid anybody interrupt that time you want to see somebody turn Jekyll to hide you let them interrupt your routine now I'm preaching the experience because my wife will tell you she's over there quiet right now because she don't want to embarrass me but she's like oh I'm preach it up husband look at her preach it oh I know I got my flaws I don't like my routine being messed up because I'm getting old I don't like change what I'm just honest and I'm the one preaching tonight if you was here you'd be doing the same thing see but when you're young and you're full of life you can handle those changes if you can handle things being thrown at you and you just you're quick to change and change and change you're not set in a routine yet but see change as a young person seems to be a part of your life every day something new something you mold yourself here but when you get past a certain age you're already you're not molding anymore you've already been molded and as we continue down this journey of life I want you to know you're going to experience changes you're going to experience challenges and you're going to experience different trials you're going to experience new blessings kids are going to come ask brother William he's got five of them kids are going to come sometimes whether you like it or not hello we're coming get the booties ready and somebody like whoa I wasn't expecting that but it's change then grandkids come and everybody's like man I wish we just had grandkids and grandkids so much better than kids you can give the grandkids back kids you stuck with until at least 18. but we find here you're going to face these changes and some notice people are going to move in some of you here tonight are going to move out of Elkton Virginia some of you young girls are going to bury some boy from some other Church probably Louisiana because we just got some good people down in Louisiana here we go come on and you're gonna move and it's going to be changed changing that family changing the church there's going to be people move in how many of you are new to this church look at all them come on raise your hand don't be embarrassed man you're new that's change and for some of you old hands has always been here sometimes that can be difficult because now things that were always were ain't always where now they're changing the Dynamics of the church is beginning to change because now there's new personalities now there's different ideas let me tell you I'm preaching we got the same Dynamics and even like Tabernacle there's been an influx of people oh we welcome the chains in one aspect because we know God is getting the people ready for the supernatural but this human body of ours the human mind resists to change because now things are different it ain't always the same Full Gospel Lighthouse that it always was on the hill now the Dynamics have changed now the complexity of the church is changing but I want you to know God ain't done yet God is still God is getting the people ready for a major change this is only the beginning church we got to learn to embrace this change we got to learn to accept this tank and adopt this change but give me the day I'll put the devil on up there's more coming there's more coming there's enough dead churches out there but there's more coming they want the change of the supernatural because it's going to take the supernatural to change these bodies [Applause] you're gonna find people gonna move from City to city state to state join this church move out of this church find a new job how many you like to find a new job at 40. oh thank God I went to the house could you imagine starting over at 47 shoot me in the head no so you'll find a new job or you may lose a job and then you're on a job hunt it's change you'll experience lost you lose a loved one a father a mother a child a church member then you grieve and it's change for God helps us to to understand and to cope with those changes see there's always going to be changes in our lives see many of us if not all of us change is difficult because it was a dude change penetrates your comfort zone well you're comfortable here you're comfortable with your little group of friends and then all of a sudden a new family moves in and they penetrate that friend bubble who let you in my click [Applause] all day it happens you know the chosen series they said get used to different Full Gospel get used to it they're coming they're coming people are ready for a change people are sick and tired of those dead churches out there all they got is word word but there ain't no Supernatural mixing with the word oh we know we believe in the world and we got the word and we're thankful for the word but the letter kill it but the spirit of God is what gives life to that word and makes that word live that's why you can have a display of a Supernatural That's why God can come down and on Wednesday night service and have like a convention style meeting because why because you welcome the change see change disrupts our comforts and we feel like we're out of control we used to have control of this and now we no longer have control of it see our human nature how many of you are human I know you're Virginia you're still Southern go Lee the South's gonna rise again right see the human nature or human nature is to resist it I know I ain't preaching none of y'all tonight I'm just preaching myself see our comfort zones become penetrated and we feel like they've been violated and sometimes we kick back and we drag our heels in and we resist to we don't want nobody else coming to church because we like our little group because when you add members you add complexes you had a different element change I always tell people you come to my church you need to be an asset on the balance sheet not a liability make an impact be a positive change God LED you here put your shoulder to the wheel God brought you here get behind the work of the ministry get behind the anointing get behind the supernatural put your whole heart into it you're not just here to be a problem alone you're here to worship God now put everything into it don't come and be a spectator there's enough spectating going on out there we're here to put everything we got into it because what we're expecting our major change Church we're expecting a God to come down and completely transform Our Lives but I want you to know it starts on this side it starts now see change disrupts our Comforts it challenges us to adopt to adjust it makes us better change makes you better you say bro Joe I need you to tell me how's that so now how many you've been changed from a sinner to a saint are you better or worse it's just that simple it's just that simple change and to change often makes you perfect see change is healthy for the human nature for those that are not willing to change they get left behind ever been part of a company to where they started initiating some changes and people grumbled and complained and they fussed and they just did everything they could they didn't want to change they refused to change what happened they left they left but see it's no different than the children of Israel God sent him a Vindicated Prophet by the name of Moses can I keep going am I okay for time he sent him a Vindicated Prophet now they've been down in Egypt for 400 plus years you would have think they had nothing got sick and tired of that place come on y'all gotta do better than that I mean let's just Egypt laodicea wanted to say they down there working for Pharaoh you're getting harder and harder getting beat every day getting whipped every day getting ridiculed every day getting accused every day every day every day every day and we find when God said a Vindicated prophet he showed them signs he showed them ones he called down plagues and this and that and they crossed over on the Red Sea and yet they still complained about it notice what they said in Exodus 14 and verse 11 and they said unto Moses because there was no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore has thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt it's not just a word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians they didn't want to change Dwelling Places but I want you to know tonight brother assistant God has got something better for you don't you get used to laodicea don't you get comfortable and lay out of sin God has sent you a Vindicated message he's gonna pluck up all the feathers he's gonna make it rough because he don't want you to get comfortable here he wants you to change tonight [Applause] [Music] but many of us change Craig's anxiety because you don't know what's around the corner see I worked for a hospital for 24 years and we find that change Always started at the corporate level because you know what they got the greatest ideas right and then you find that it comes down to the hospital and it doesn't start at the bottom change never starts at the bottom it doesn't start with the front line staff it started with the CEO the CFO or C whatever o you want to put behind it it always starts with leadership the executive level leadership and see that change becomes to them first and they have to accept that change and embrace that change so that they can be change ages to push what what that organization wants out to the to the whole of the company and notice they may push it out it may be months that that leadership sits on him and they embrace it and they learn about it see it's changed they didn't like it at first just like you don't like it but then time comes and they have to roll it out to the middle managers then they roll that out that change out and it gives the middle managers time to embrace that change and you find there's going to be those that kick May fuss my goodness I was in in leadership for a long time there was a lot of fussing and kicking going on you didn't think we had Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris up there fighting people don't like change so it comes from the top then it comes to the middle managers and then after maybe months they finally rolling out to all the front line staff so that they can Embrace to change embrace the direction that the company wants to go foreign yes I agree some of it is nonsense well that let me use it tonight please like I'm going somewhere with this so we think about the bride or we think about our change where does it start it doesn't start at the front line staff it doesn't start at the bottom guards God started with a prophet God started with the prophet and he gave that proper direction this is where I want you to go this is how I want you to preach this is what I want my bride to be and what did he do he began to preach it and then what happened then the middle managers then the preachers and the five-fold ministry got a hold of that message they got a hold of what but God wanted to be changed and they began to preach it and preach it and preach it and preach it and was it it made a change in your life and that's why you're here tonight because it started at the top but God don't want it just to stay at the top he wants you to live that life he wants you to embrace this message and change he wants you to embrace the change that's coming for the body of Christ do it you see we as Believers we're going to face change you know you hear churches they're building Fellowship Halls I know some of you old people where you don't like them Fellowship Halls how dare you preach about Fellowship Hall have you looked around the world we're living in we got to do something for our young people we got to provide them something it ain't the way it was 50 years ago so ciety is the same as it was 40 years ago on the world has changed around us and now we must change build the fellowship hall get the people together have Fellowship one with another keep yourself in Christian Fellowship cause if you don't do something for the young people the devil certainly will that's the problem with too many churches they refuse to have it and you find lives are being wrecked homes are being destroyed because people preachers have dug their heels in they don't want to change but we have to brother and sister we have to change for the good of the whole we have to throw our or our vote in for the good and say I may not agree with it but I'm going to do it anyway because my young people deserve it it's our fellowship not with unbelievers out in the world but they deserve good Godly Fellowship so you build a fellowship Paul and you play basketball or volleyball or whatever ball you want to play what is wrong with that what is wrong with that it's Christians it's Believers it's gospel sinner You Ain't Got Drugs there you ain't got homosexuals there you ain't got the world there no sir you got God there you got God in the midst of it don't dig your heels in tonight let go and let God have his way quit resists in this tank God is ready to break out on this place things ain't the way it was in the 40s 50s and 60s just as your Prophet evolved in his ministry so has this ministry of the Bride evolved till today we're not backing up get on board we're not backing up we're not going back Church the prophet of God said the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the Lord I say throw down those worldly bag of peanuts get on the train cause we're pulling out somebody's gonna be changed somebody's gonna be transformed somebody's going to be be a gun lead this world in the moment in the twinkling of an eye [Music] I say why not me why not now find out my young person why not my son why not my daughter why not my wife why not my husband why not our church why not the preachers why not the deacons why not the trustees why not the musicians why shouldn't we change he wasn't meant to stay here forever [Applause] God say the best for last he saved the best for last look at your neighbor come on it's okay you're the best you're the best he saved the best to run the last leg he didn't pick the weakest he didn't pick the feeble he didn't pick those that were or there was undecided in their minds he picked the very best that he could pick and he placed him and laodicea because he was determined I will have a bride she'll come out of chaos she'll come out of corruption and this old corruptable body is going to one day put on in corruption in this mortal flesh he's gonna take your own immortality and that's why you're here if you're not here because Ron Spence is your preacher or your pastor you're because God placed you here God anointed you to be here God elected you for this hour God placed you in this body that's why you're here that's why you serve the Lord was he coping coping with change can be difficult brother Mark just took a church got his dad's church it's change he can I think he's about to have a heart attack without any paramedics in here but it's a difference he's been a support down there for many years but now it all falls on his shoulders see the changing of the guards and some people may find it difficult to cope with even as a young a new pastor you can find the change in the burden of everybody it can be difficult people ask me all the time are you going to be a pastor I don't know I'll say he's going to change my nature I ain't got time for foolishness [Applause] [Music] don't don't shout too loud I wish I did I wish I was a little bit more flexible you know oh gentle politician that ain't me come on buddy you bring that devil in the house of God we'll knock him out [Applause] if people say man bro Joe you're such a bulldog in a prayer line well I only know one way I'm not gonna pamper no devil we ain't got time for pampering Devils we ain't got time for patting them on the back we ain't got time for this no we got one commission cast that dirty thing out and let the house of God have victory at the people of God have victory I'm talking about a change I see Devils defeated I see young girls set free I've seen the change come over their face when the presence of God comes down see change am I okay tonight change for the believer can sometimes be difficult but all the time for the Bible says in Romans 8 28 we know that all things whether they be good things whether they be bad things no matter what they may be all things work together for the good to them that love God now if you don't love God here tonight you ain't going to enjoy this message you ain't gonna enjoy the preaching you're not going to enjoy the worship you're not going to do anything but if you love God and God is in your heart you can't wait to get to the house of God look I drove 17 hours just so I could preach to y'all tonight the greatest joy of my life is to be able to stand before the elect of God and share the very thoughts of God I know what I was Sister Connie I know the life that I used to live but I know what God has transformed me let me tell you ain't no devil can point me back and say that that man is still alive that man is dead it's midnight there's a new man now there's a new sheriff in town the Holy Ghost is called the Holy Ghost is Raven the Holy Ghost got jurisdiction over my life and I trust that he's got it over yours tonight you may not like to change but it's good for you [Music] well brother Joe we don't like all that emotion that's what I want to say sometimes people don't like emotion you know I tell the story when I first got saved and went to Brother Tim's Church I was a baptist boy well I said I was two years in a Baptist Church I was searching all over the place because God did something that voice spoke to me and turned my life around and for two years I went searching Methodist Church Presbyterian Church Pentecostal Church Assembly of God Church Baptist Church then I stumbled across 10 Pro it's even like to have an apple in the first service I was sitting there are standing because they don't sit a whole lot at that church I was standing there and all of a sudden something just went and hit me brushed against my ear and I turned back there was no hand there I knew there was something different but I remember like I wish these people be quiet I can't understand what this man's saying I didn't know what he was saying anyway it was all messes jargon and I didn't have a clue but I knew something said this is where you belong and you can ask my wife God be my witness for weeks months I drove every weekend to even like to have an echo three three four hours there three four hours back every Saturday or Friday night I drive I drive back Sunday morning or Sunday night so I could be back to work and finally I found a job God moved me over there the greatest change of my life I never expected to see what he was going to do but God started something in that car and now that something has evolved to what's before you today you say was it all easy was it all cookies and cream no it was a lot of Rocky Road in it but we're here and we ain't backing up we ain't giving in we ain't giving a devil an inch we come this far we didn't come this far to give up we didn't come this far to lose we came this far to win we came brother sister we came to be changed we came to be transformed we came to Earth that's why you're here tonight you didn't come to hear me but you come to be changed by the preaching of the word so that your heart can be oh it could be revived tonight so the change for the believer it may be difficult but it's always good and notice now First Corinthians 15 and verse 51. my my I'll show you a mystery we shall not all sleep now some of us here tonight you may go by the way of the grave but not all of us and let me just say this even if you go by the way of the Grave you're coming up first lucky you lucky you see I show you mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all my if we could just clue in on that we shall all be changed oh I just love that in a moment in the twinkling of an eye now I don't know how you twinkle to your eye but whatever it is it's that quick I know when I used to when my wife and I were dating according whatever y'all call it we want to call it we'll wink at each other she winked back at me it was all right back then y'all girl y'all do that uh-huh we're gonna have to come over here and preach a little bit sister Connie yeah see that little cute boy man look at that boy he's he's from Louisiana could be over there across there yeah yeah you sit over there and sit down like oh look at him we're gonna be changed in the twinkling of an eye oh your heart's already changed oh yes I'm on cloud nine oh he winked in me yeah hey that's what I thought my wife chased me down I said hey look at you you got me [Applause] I'm going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye thinking how fast how sudden at the last trunk for the trumpet shall sound and the dead and dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we all shall be changed for this corruptable must it has to if we're going to inherit the kingdom of God it must be changed this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality notice he emphasizes it twice it must it's a decree from God it has to because there's no other way in the kingdom of God unless these bodies of ours be changed now listen to what your Prophet says notice now Paul he tells us this change is a mystery if you hadn't listened to brother Wayne Priest The Mystery of our change I encourage you to go back and listen to it because he does a phenomenal job see I'm an evangelist I'm not deep like brother Wayne my goodness I wish I was but I can only be Joe Adams and so I'm gonna preach it to you the way I know it and here we find it's a secret that's only for the pride you can't preach this to everybody you can't preach you know what they think about the Rapture planes are going to be falling out of the sky trains are going to run off the tracks cars are going to wreck on the interstate but what did it take a Vindicated profit to come and explain to us our change how it's going to take place when it's going to take place oh Church see these vowed bodies of decl decay in humanity is going to be changed into a body like his own glorious body see this is only a mystery that it took a message from a seventh angel to come and reveal the mystery of your change how when where we ain't got to go to Arizona we ain't got to go to Jeffersonville we're going to be changed right here in Elkton Virginia and if I don't make it back to Minden Louisiana I'm going to be changed on the interstate they can have my car I don't really care I won't need it I'm gonna travel like a thought [Applause] but see the prophet of God will say the Pentecostal message was to restore gifts back in the church but this is the calling forth of the Bride what is this message this message is the calling forth of the Bride another message that was to come just before Sodom was to be burned see we know that now with the seventh angel all the mysteries of God have been fulfilled all the loose sins from the previous ages have been tied up now we have one great infallible word until man bastardizes it and we find that the book that we are reading from now is no longer a closed book now it's an open book and the prophet of God say when that book became open it became a new book it's not a book that we read from a previous age because now the seals have come off of it the mystery of our change has been revealed only thing we're waiting for is a manifestation of our change see we had a prophet to come and he would reveal all these things but yet you find how many of you are welcome in this change he longed for this change but there's one out there that resists this change your adversary the devil doesn't want you to change he resists your change he knows what the word says he knows it's already been spoken why are you under attack why are you under an assault because he's doing everything that he can to keep you from being transformed he wants you to get comfortable and Leo to see you notice what he did he created his own Eden just so you can find any form of pleasure that will suit your fancy You Like Drugs he's got all different sorts of drugs you like alcohol he's got you a cocktail waiting you like women well he's got women he's got me and he's got it all out there he's got everything out there to do what to entice you to keep you bound here because he knows there's been a word spoken over a people and he knows that ain't one of those words going to return void [Music] he knows and not one of those words he's been defeated down through every age let me tell you Church he's going to be defeated in this age brother Bama says now now he said watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival can we have a Revival Church a Full Gospel Lighthouse when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word watch then again you see how the scriptures at that time there will be a message sweep out and catch the bride and catch that woman the elect that's why you're here because God knew he was going to have a bride and so he sent her a message that she would catch her sure what is the
