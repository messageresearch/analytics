========================================

week that God give me a sermon I didn't realize it was for tonight but it's very fitting my title for this evening is don't worry and that's just exactly the way that it came don't worry where was I at when I got it I was on a treadmill so this is the first sermon I've ever got on a treadmill and it just came and so here we are probably 5:30 in the morning Amen lights were on and somebody was home so how many of you have a PhD and worried yeah you are known as a worrywart you worry about things that you you can't change anyway circumstances that are coming up and and you think that by your strength of worry you're going to change it how many of those hands went up tonight how many was it was your hands went up yeah well this service is for you Alleluia brother Kelly if you're watching it's for you too so a man a man I told him what it was preaching on tonight and he said well he said we won't worry a man so I'm trying to have faith in that whole situation as I preach this sermon Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 7 blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreaded out her roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit Philippians chapter 4 in verse 4 a man Philippians chapter 4 in verse 4 rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but let but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally my brethren finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things amen let's bow our heads for prayer amen god bless you let's pray the Lord Jesus now Lord of many things even circumstances are going on even now I pray that you would anoint this service in a very supernatural way thank you to have friends with us brother Nick Greene and sister Caitlin with us and Lord brother Kenton and sister Lorraine and the many others that are here tonight I ask you that you would bless them and anoint them father made you just come among us in a mighty way father these are your words and we now look to you even in brother Kelly and sister Mara's situation and pray that you would stretch forth your hand of mercy and do a great work we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen amen and amen you may be seated amen we live in an age of great pressure pressure is on everything pressure on your job pressure on your finances pressure your school how many of you young guys that are still in school young all the way to the age of 50 still in school that are that feel the pressure sometimes as a teacher you still feel the pressure and it even actually becomes a more pressure on your jobs you feel the pressure times of types of of arrangement of pressure of getting things done the pressures of being able to do the right kind of a job that it will pass quality control if you eat enough on Thanksgiving Day there will be pressure Niagara Falls will not have as much pressure at the bottom of it as some buttons on church on Friday morning the pressure of a scale blood pressure the pressure of a doctor's report there's us actually a term called white coat syndrome - where people's blood pressure goes up as they are walking into the doctor's office concerned about what the doctors going to say to them this is actual things worried causes phenomenal amounts of health issues where he causes cancer are you with me where he causes cancer where he causes anxiety that drives nervousness and and and very many diseases that come along with the simple term worry but where he is opposite from faith so worry does not come from God it's not a virtue that is in godliness so worry does not come from God this service will probably help sometimes we wonder where do we turn when we come to a roadblock in our life where do we escape to where do we go people build on tops of mountains in the middle of woods they build help me they build in a lot of different places to where that they just want to get away I found at that place where you just want to get away to when you get there you'll find out that half of America is already there maybe yesterday when you decided to do Black Friday shopping you realized after a few moments of arriving at Walmart I've never did it I'm just going to above it about some stories that you realize you're not the only one down maybe you got up at 3 o'clock in the morning to beat all the other people and you get there and you find out that there's 200 other people had the same idea I'm not going to get it I'm only going to get that piece of product am I going to do it whether you know it or not if you've done your studies and I'm sure all of you have but the product that they sell for the Black Friday is a lesser product that they sell two days before and they make that as a product to be so cheaper so actually what you're buying on Black Friday is not as good as what you could have bought on Thursday a few dollars higher a man you can always get lessons here not doctors you know because they're doctors and they're looking at circumstances when you walk into their office they all they'll try to treat you so they'll give you pills to kick you up and then they'll give you pills to kind of lighten your mood so they'll give you Downers a little bit they'll give you pills to kind of cause the anxiety to be calm before long you're a zombie 14 different pills during the day to kind of keep you on an even keel and then when you get the bill at the end of the month you really do have something to worry about whether we realize they're not this ages it's promised darkness in it it's promised darkness since it's promised a lot of distress it's an age to which that even brother Branham would say was not fit to live in it's actually not fit to live in morality has been destroyed marriages have been destroyed just common sense has been destroyed whether Bevin said science has come to its end civilizations coming to its end we can see by the sound post that the gym towel dispensation has came to the end of where Daniel said it would come to and it is arrived all of the government's are at their end there all have got their leaders they're all at their positions but so is the bride of Jesus Christ are you with me and if you know that you know that you know without a shadow of a doubt of who you are and what you've been called for and what your purpose is there's nothing that the devil can do with you Jesus would give us instructions let your light so shine before men that they might see your good works and glorify the Father which is in heaven he would say to us my burden is light I would like to just tell you tonight before we go into this God has already given you grace that's given you grace that's provided for your entire journey and for your entire roadmap and let me just give you a piece of advice as I go forward tonight keep your focus on the main thing all of us get tripped up when our focus gets off of Jesus whenever the first priority gets placed in in second place but the homer always had a rule for us ministers he he would tell us over and over again he preached it to me and preached me to Danny Smith and he preached it to Andrew here and Matthew and you know especially in his family he preached it he always said rule number one for a preacher it's never be alone with a woman other your wife and he said rule number two is never break rule number one and if you abide by those two rules in your life where it about your marriage is not going to be an issue Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses so we are not alone we are not alone in this in this battle there is somebody watching from another dimension that has ran just ahead of us are you with me now they didn't give up they just ran out of town they just ran out of time my grandfather was 53 years old when he ran out of time had a stomach condition to which that they actually took his stomach out and put a sheep stomach in to try to prolong his life and and these last hours of his life he had become a Christian in the last five years of his life and and I was born and my brother was born and we were we were we were just small we were I was four years old his last Christmas present to me was a blue ball I remember that very well and he asked the doctors and the nurses could he get out of the bed out of the hospital bed and get in the floor with us children he said I'd like for my last hours to be with them and so that's that's how my grandfather went to be with the Lord he said the difficulty of life or the difficulty of sickness it was not fighting the sickness it was saying goodbye and they would say that's probably the hardest most difficult thing is to say goodbye but there's a land of knowing that my last breath here my last breath here is my first breath there we are compassed about people about with a so great a cloud of witnesses of overcomers of their time and now they're encouraging us from that dimension are you even out there encouraging us listen without you they cannot be made perfect so somebody is counting on you are you with me now the scripture tells us to let us lay aside every weight let us lay aside when translation said lay aside every wearing and the sin which does so easily beset us rather on I'm not in sin unbelief it's sin and to confess confess a negative testimony is sinful sometimes we label we label our favorite sins or attributes of sin we label them to say they're bad but a negative testimony it is opposite of faith and God can only make intercession on your testimony are you with me tonight brother I don't want to live an overcoming life you will by your words the most powerful supernatural thing that you have is your tongue but the jewel for Nia's was to be here tonight but he as well had issues and couldn't come how to plumbing issues at his house but they remember one time he was here and he said the most supernatural thing about your entire body is your tongue it has the power of life and death inside of it it speaks words that that create create atmosphere create attitudes create praise and honor Valentine's Day you talk of love but it's more than just a Hallmark card we should express encouragement to our children to one another as we're here listen you never know what somebody else is going through set it on the seat beside of them you never know what they have went through in that day the scripture said looking unto Jesus there's no other place to look to there is no other place to look than look to Jesus sometimes we test our faith by looking at the spots we look into other spots maybe you look to Washington I can warn you now don't look to Washington they can't figure out interstate 81 they've got all of this community upset by their school situations now so if they can't count kids they're gonna have a hard time teaching them algebra I'm sure they're doing the best that they can there's no perfect systems no perfect government's no perfect places to live only in Jesus Jesus would say in Matthew chapter 6 in verse 25 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on it's not the life more than meat and the body than raiment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth them are you not much better than they which of you taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature let me just say at five foot five I have broke the scripture many times when I was a young man I always wanted to weigh 200 pounds I got that one and be six foot tall I did not get that one I missed that one by for my calculations right is seven inches I missed that by seven inches I'm worried about it short people get complexes don't tell me you don't but the random-dot dealt with complexes he dealt with complexes you remember it was even said of him that he had complexes about women elisha had a complex mother that had complexes meaning you've got complexes admit it or not brother branham was talking about Edmond way about his complex and it cost him such an issue till Edmond way got so anxious he fell dead in the pool and in the in the congregation and brother branham just standard the audience he steadied the audience the nurses ran they checked him he's gone he's gone and brother BAM just steps out speaks to him calls him by name and brings him back to life a man I think sometimes our critics ought to listen to a testimony like that for what take your thought for arraignment consider the lilies of the field how they grow and they told not neither do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which said this day is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you all ye of little faith brethren do you mean to tell me just go home and sit on my couch and God will bring me bring it to me absolutely not you're not reading the same scripture that I'm giving you God gives you talents God gives you abilities God gives you oxygen in your lungs he told us to go back and to look at the ant how that the ant which is one of the smallest creatures of Earth how he works and is a continual worker it's kind of like the man that was there and you know the local preacher came by and the man was working his gardening and you know it is the first year for that man's garden and it was beautiful fullen everything was going well and so the preacher trying to figure out what he could say to him to kind of bring them to a level of spirituality and he says you and God is doing an incredible job with that garden the man looked across the fence and he said you ought to seen it last year when God had it some of you get it today some of you get it tomorrow so God uses your hands God uses your feet how many times they hire tough situations with the business and needed the phone to ring because if you don't work when you work for yourself if you're not working and the wheels are not turning you're not making money that's just that's the formula you figured out real quick if you work for yourself you can own 15 vans and if there are no wheels are not turning there's no money that's coming in because guys that that are in that situation they're not like the government they're not just writing checks to figure it all out are you with me so listen as a believer I begin to realize these scriptures I'm not worrying about tomorrow what tomorrow will bring I put it into God's hands and if God is my partner I better have some great big plans rather Tim Pruitt a few weeks a few years ago he came to our place and we've been buddies a long time and he came to our place and you know he seemed happy in his church and and some things and I'm not gonna tell you the whole story because I'd take till next week sometime but anyway he came to my place and he was showing us they bought about 38 acres of land and they paid for that now they're going to build a they're gonna be able to church on it I don't know where the money's gonna come from but God God's told me to build the church he built a phenomenal answer there he built a phenomenal a phenomenal church couple million dollars I would say building and when he finished it it was 100 percent paid for [Applause] he's just built a fellowship hall I think it's a hundred foot wide 100 foot long by a 150 foot long by by 65 foot long it's not finished but it's paid for when it came to the parking lot it was paid for and I reminded him men his friend all through all to the journey I said if God is your partner and here's the way that I look at this God wanted to build him there he wanted to build in there he wanted a building here he wanted a building here we're preparing to work on a fellowship hall here and funds will be allocated for that to take place don't worry that might gonna be the text to you tonight you builders don't worry how you gonna do it brother run he told me to so we're gonna build it the way we did our house didn't we brother Terry we built our house and he told me exactly how to lay it out and we built that house and brother Kent walked in last night and eyes wide open a grin from ear to ear I like to see that you see if God is your partner take worry and put it in a mailbox and send it away I borrow another statement that said write all your whereís down and when you're done writing all your worries down throw them in the trash can Psalms 23 says this in verse 1 and you're familiar to you but I want to remind you again the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures and he leads me beside of the still waters so who is steering a Christian who is the captain of the boat or the captain II or so the very god to you it's him he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death here comes that word that has said six hundred times in the scripture fear I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me and thou prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with all in my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life are you with me stay with me and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever now let me just say that seems like it seems like simple you've quartered it since a child but if you will follow those scriptures and stay in the house of the Lord raise your children appropriately good things will happen in your household and let me just say though your children might look like they've gone a million miles away and there's no hope for them never give up never give up never give up put them in the hands of Jesus Christ who better to put your children in in the hands of Jesus Christ God came and met Jobe and you know the story Jobe is written in the scriptures for our admonition and for a measuring stick for all of our problems and none of us have had a problems like Jobe had none none and the Lord answered job out of a world one chapter 38 in 1 out of a whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge where are you getting your counsel from look at now thy loins like a man for I demand of thee and answer thee me where was God when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou has understanding who hath laid the measures there ever thou knowest or who has stretching the line upon it where upon the foundations there are fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy where is all of us the sons of god gonna shop for joy at the end so God is having a meeting with joked and he doesn't talk to him out about his children he doesn't talk to him about the pity party that he's in he doesn't talk to anybody's wife he doesn't talk to him about the men that are making accusations doing oh brother on I wish God would come and talk to me he would not talk to you about your problems we have an example here he won't talk to you about your problems he'll talk to you about what is eternal and the great thing about when God comes to talk to you that you're in his plans [Music] that's quite an incredible thing that's quite an incredible thing to be in his plans what more could be said right there so when this world is remade and it becomes fire all over because that's what God's going to do with it it's going to burn all the trash off of it it's going to burn everything that there is and it's going to become dust and he's going to remake the earth like he had to do you you had to do you the same thing had to burn all that stuff on the out of out of you and recreates you because you couldn't live with yourself you had tempers they fight about saw you had a mouth that would make us a navies axial Navy SEAL actually embarrassed to be around you your thoughts ran in every kind of chaotic direction and you really didn't have a plan for your life but God rich in mercy told you that you came from God and you're going back to God and he picked you up when you wasn't looking for God he picked you up and he shook you from your condition and some of you've got some books I'm going to preach in a week or so maybe tomorrow on the two books you had an old book and God had to rewrite that old book because there was a lot of stinking chapters on the inside of that old book and God had to rewrite it and remake it [Applause] Jesus would say it like this come unto me all ye that are heavy laden unto me all ye that labor and are heavy-laden I will give you rest and that's Matthew 11 verse 28 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls my yoke is easy my burden is light I've never had a hangover throwing my guts up from being in a service I've never left this building and wake up tomorrow morning not knowing where I'm at now in the world when you gave the world money they wanted more and it was just a money pit Korres is a money pit there's no end to the satisfaction that comes at the bottom of a bottle that bottle will destroy homes lives and bodies and feta means and drugs and all kind of nonsense that people put in their body for a sensational high that will last minutes or maybe overnight that will last people will go through all different kinds of websites to figure out if the doctor gives them the right medicine that won't have interactions they'll they'll take a drugs from a hood a guy in a hoodie and ingest it into their body and it eats their liver and their kidneys and their lungs and their heart out of them and they call that a good time sin will destroy it sin will destroy you I will tell you even less once it's conceived it brings forth death are you with me lust is premeditated lust begins to act on actions of premeditation of lust and before long you forgot about your grandchildren you forgot about your children you forgot about your wife and for a few minutes of pleasure that the devil will worry you to death about the rest of your life he'll tell you it was heaven for just a little bit but you'll pay for hell the rest of your life let me just say servant Jesus Christ is the best thing I've ever done [Applause] but sometimes we get amnesia and fully forget and the devil will whisper in your ears and tell you how good those old times was you can be a Christian for 40 years and be in a restaurant and all of a sudden I like that old time rock and roll and you will feel your foot go nuts because this body is not saved brother Brown had a cross hanging on his meal are you with me and a girl walked across him but the Peregrine watched brother branham and brother bran watch that girl walk across and his eyes went back on the cross he said thank God for the cross listen brother Brandon was a man and thank God he was honest oh brother on but brother Brandon made mistakes whoa is that a news bulletin or what there's only one let me give you some news that you can hang your hat on only one came to this earth people go all nuts about brother Branham and they point out all of his mistakes won't you just turn the microscope around a little bit have you read all of this brother on no because I don't want to read all that nonsense because I know the people that's writing it the kid their kids turn out gay they become atheist almost overnight you see I knew those people when they were still professing the message and they were all the actors then that I kept telling other preachers those people don't have the Holy Ghost and don't deserve to be in a pulpit but now they got snapchat or whatever chats that they got don't worry with them you say we're brother on why are you that there's two people here tonight needed to hear that and if they keep telling you you need to read that kind of nonsense you just tell them to take that back to hell where it came from [Applause] do you get brad letters brother on Monday generally is the bad letter day so since I got a bad letter I give them a bad letter and most of those letters consist of this because you are an idiot god bless you because you are an idiot and decided to waste your day on about telling me what to do don't waste your time on me no more you're asking me to practice what I'm preaching so don't worry with them so you called it like you see it because you're an idiot if you're watching tonight brother Tim that's your favorite word proverbs 12 and verse 25 anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down what a good word makes him glad that was a translation first Peter chapter 5 and verse 7 cast all your cares on him because he cares for you now this is going to give the devil some heartburn you had to suffer from heartburn last night this is going this next a little bit it's going to give the devil some heartburn so hang right with me ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6 being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ God is not the kind of businessman that starts a project and then just throws you away so how many of you in this building believe that you definitely are not at you're in but God has started a work in you maybe this mic is not working you're not at you're in because you're not in the next dimension so how many of you in this building actually believe that God has begun a work in you so I'm reading you what God said about your hand being in the air I began a good work on you and I will perform it romans chapter 8 in verse 28 and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God how many lovers of God do we have to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us say this with me if God be for us who who can be against us well Ron I've had trouble with so-and-so well I'll give you some instructions just only a couple of minutes ago I may not work in your case most cases it will so I give you a scripture that will help if God be for me now I really like this part sister care if God's on my side don't matter sometimes you just need to go I mean this may not be real deep tonight but I got a feeling if you really get this tonight it gonna help you just raise your finger this might be I don't know if this is any kind of worldly move or not but just raise your finger say these words with me it don't matter hey don't man Sarah you can use this use this in class they don't know what you're doing but you're gonna it don't matter think you got it anyway you'll be all right someday I want to just come sit in your class I that's got it that's got to be awesome it's literally gonna be awesome you could YouTube that you would you would set the records I'm sure that's great he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us how shall he not with him freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified now under the Seventh Seal we understood what justification is it's as though you never did it in the first place how many's ever done wrong in your life don't raise your hand right here you might be setting this on your wife has ever done wrong and then the devil beats you around the post now I'm not talking about some crazy major things if you're a Christian you ain't doing major things you've thought things you've looked to things you've done you've done acted you've had the wrong attitude I think I'm getting to the right spot here you get the wrong attitude you get the wrong attitude how many wakes up with the wrong attitude boy I'm preaching to the right bunch of people here tonight you can go to bed and feel the presence of God while you're praying lay down on your pellet might be you need a new pillow lay down on your pillow have a perfectly good four to five hours of sleep roll out of bed put your feet on the floor and you feel like you could fight a bustle what happened to the rapture condition just before you went to bed I'm preaching the right group now who is it the condemneth it is Christ that died gay rather that is risen again even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress are persecuted this is a list now persecution famine nakedness pearl or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long and counted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we're more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded remember where Paul's writing this from from a dungeon for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present or things to come nor height nor depth any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord resurrection of Jesus brother Brent says this he said if you will just notice it's when you're discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you and he said that's when he gets you if you come into the church to say well I don't know I don't know whether I'll I'll get any better or not I've been prayed for twice oh my you're just as well as you you just may as well go home that's all but you can cast that aside but you can cast that aside God don't want you to be frowning it takes more muscles to frown than to grin I want that to go through it takes more muscles to frown than to grin so if you're trying to fight H look over to your neighbor and smile you've just did something for your health God wants you to be happy this is what better random is saying God wants you to be happy letter preached letter preached the human heart was made to be happy where he will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset did you just hear those those words don't never be upset don't never be upset say it don't never be upset say it fast it won't hurt this bad you're sitting with your wife your husband tell them that what I just said just go ahead and tell them innit because that's what brother Bram said maybe that'll go with that little fingernail this is good I'm enjoying it just walking his life knowing that you're walking with him nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you there's me the powers there thinks president or things future nothing can separate us from the love we're in him and we never come in by our own will he by choice notice not we by choice he by choice elected us and brought us in to him well I wish I could just write this down put it on your refrigerator for you to listen at it and over and over again well the man says God's given every sick person in here divine healing every one of you Jesus was wounded for our transgressions and with these stripes we were healed it's yours but you have to fight for every inch that you possess are you with me are you with me you'll have to fight for it Joshua I've given you click Prince means possessions let's go in footprints it's possession let's take every inch of ground that God give us and if you haven't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter said the promise is unto you and you your children and to him as afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call footprints this possession let's go get it Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever let's possess it the works that I do shall you all you also less possess it it's God's promise don't look at the circumstances don't look at how hard it is less possess it Joshua fought for every inch of ground from one one part one end of the country to the other but he had a promise he said God said I'll give it to you whether there's Giants whether there's atheists where there's infidels where there's cold formal churches what difference does it make God give us the promise let's take it let me just say this is I never ever worried about the rapture I never worried about the resurrection because I'm in the rapture it can't happen without me I'm not worried about the resurrection because the resurrection is in me are you with me and if it's in me if God takes me by the way of the grade I never think the thought hold mine just worried about death death is only a tool in the hand of God in my life I could write a book on what you can live through are you with me how will you die brother run I've lived through a lot of things but if he takes me while I'm sitting in the chair like brother ghido and I just slip away it's taken care of Billy Graham said don't you cry for me don't weep a kill it's everything that I've wanted Charles Spurgeon said it's the greatest thing for a Christian as they get near the last hours of their life that new body is coming to take you home listen God's never in a crisis God's never worried he's never tore up the Bowery with me now how is it going to be at my end let me just say it's in the hands of God it don't matter I got my hands in the hands of the man that can steal the water if God might have promised and God gave a promise and you believe it I don't care what takes place it's yours if God made a promise and God gave a promise and you believe it I don't care what takes place it's yours are you getting this now if God made a promise and God gave the promise and you believe that and I don't care what it takes place it's yours fight the devil on every ounce of ground that he stands on walk over take it take the sword of the word God's promises is true nothing can stop them they're God's promises he gave us the promise of that just like he did the children of Israel he's the same yesterday today and Thor I love this one if the enemy smites on one side of the cheek let's remember what he did before we smart back let's remember his action if there is a decision to be made let's wait remember what kind of decision we make we think he would make then let that be our decision this is brother brems words he said if we get hasty let's remember he never was in a hurry if we get over anxious remember he dwells in eternity and time means nothing the man that was standing there - the preacher that was standing there in the foxes Book of Martyrs and he handed the priests his watch his timepiece he said will you hold this for me and he said well that's a strange request he said I'm not going to need it where I'm going [Laughter] Jesus was three days late and it was right on time and you may think he's been late to your case over and over and over again but I have been proclaiming the promise and I proclaim performance and I proclaimed the promise don't get too hasty God's always on time brother Graham said don't get ahead of God because he's the one that's leading you what a powerful statement sometimes we get wore out thinking God has forgotten and God doesn't care and God doesn't love us and made us a promise but here we are 25 years old older than we was when he made the promise and it's impossible now for us to have children why are we having children well first of all me and you can't produce nothing but trouble but if God comes on the scene now I've got something to back that up Abraham produce trouble because Abraham got in a hurry how many in this building tonight could confess I had some to confess about worry hemming in this building getting too big a hurry getting hurt getting hurt you know well your former pastor you take on the spirit of your pastor and so this would be one of his weaknesses and so I mentioned it too you don't have this weakness no more but remember the trip to Arizona we went to Arizona all of us a family went to narrow zone and we went to Arizona we went to
