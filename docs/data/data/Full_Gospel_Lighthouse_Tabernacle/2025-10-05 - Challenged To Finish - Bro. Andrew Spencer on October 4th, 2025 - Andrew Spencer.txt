Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight, isn't it? Amen. We just want to greet you in the name of the Lord and just say, "God bless you." We certainly enjoyed the weekend services last weekend here. Brother Matthew just did a phenomenal job and bless you just [Applause] I'm the younger brother but I I am sure proud of my older brother and he uh he's he's made me proud a many of times and and uh certainly thankful for the word of the Lord last weekend and we appreciate the prayers for uh last week and us being there with uh Biscoll family and being able to go there, they they they mean so much to us and and we were able to just be a part. Brother Ron, brother Tim just did a wonderful job and and uh I just be honest, I I left there just just so challenged. And I'd like to kind of preach to you from from just some my thoughts from last weekend and just thinking about how how are we here? How are we at this era of time that that the ones that were standing so close to the prophet, they're beginning to go off the scene? And here's a people that were not even not even close. &gt;&gt; We weren't even in the building, but you're still standing here. And &gt;&gt; I just thinking I just thinking about it all. You know, God's God's doing something spectacular. and &gt;&gt; and uh if you haven't watched that that memorial service, I I just I mean to be honest, I've never witnessed anything quite like that. It was it was it was so uplifting and challenging. And brother Tim, Brother Ron just did a wonderful job. And so we just want to we just want to continue to pray for the Biscll family. Sister Ruth, uh Sister Ruth Biscll was just just absolutely phenomenal. I've never met anybody like that in my entire life of going through funerals and things. And she said, "I've not shed one tear." She said, "I'm not saying I won't in the future, but I've not shed one tear." She said, "I'm just so full of joy." She said, "All I want to know, what is Brother Eddie doing on that side?" And it's amazing to recognize that there's a real believer right there that my goodness, my it's just it's just wonderful thing to be a Christian. We got no reason to be sad. We've got everything to be joyful about. Amen. We're certainly joyful to be in the house of the Lord tonight. We we have a rebaptism tonight after the end of the service and then tomorrow we'll be having uh communion and foot washing. So uh we're going to have oursel a ordinance weekend here. So so uh we just looking under the Lord. I believe God's got some special things. We want to come solemnly solemnly and just come with a reverence in our heart realizing that this is a very special time. And so we just want to prepare our hearts, amen, for the things that God has in store. If you have your Bible tonight, we'd like to just look over in Zechariah 4 and verse 6 and John chapter 17 and verse one. Also want to make mention to you, brother Mark Spencer will be here ministering for us here next weekend. So we want to be remembering him. I know that you will have a barrel of fun &gt;&gt; and a good time in the word. Amen. Certainly certainly love my my uncle Mark. He he means a lot to us and and we're certainly thankful for his ministry and we just invite him to come and take the the weekend services next weekend and and we me and brother Ron will be at uh brother Tim Puit's uh October meeting. So just be remembering those things in prayer. So many things to be praying for. Amen. And just just be praying with us as well. And in three weeks I will be traveling to Poland, good Lord willing, to dedicate the church there in Poland. And uh good news is after that trip I'm off the scene for quite some time. I'll be right here. So well I can go out more if y'all Matt they might like you more often around here. So well whether y'all want me here or not I'm going to be here. So [Applause] Amen. In Zechariah 4 and verse 6, then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, oh great mountain before Zerubabel, thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it. Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, The hands of Zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it, and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. John chapter 17 and verse one. These words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour is come. glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent and I have glorified thee on earth and I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do amen let's just talk to the Lord just for a minute Father, we come before you tonight, Lord, and we humble ourselves before the great I am. Lord, we recognize, Lord Jesus, this is the building that you're wanting to build, a body of believers that truly are under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. And Father, we just ask, Lord, as we would bask in your presence tonight, that your word would come and purge our hearts and manifest your glory, Father, right through us, Lord. For truly Lord, we've come to the house of correction Lord for a word to correct the errors and to correct Leoa and to make us to be more like unto thee, Father. So we ask Lord tonight as the word would go forth that you would just minister to us every need that has been lifted up, every every church member here. We ask God that you would bless them Lord by the preaching of the word. May May the sinner may he come to a recognition a recognition that he needs to come to a place of salvation. Father, may those that are sick, may they come to a recognition that there is healing that flowed down from Calvary for them. And we ask, Father, that you would just go, Lord, and let thy word be a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of our heart. As we look unto you, the author and the finisher of our faith, we believe that you are God. And we ask that you would come tonight as we invite you to take the pull pit just now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. You may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord. I'd like to just take a little thought that's been on my heart on challenge to finish. Challenge to finish. And and if you begin to look at that word uh finished, it means to be completed. It means to be brought to an end. It's saying that nothing else is more required of the thing that the task or the project or the progress on the matter is completely done. It has been perfected. It has been polished to a spot where it no longer needs to be buff buffed or needs to be needs to be it has been it has been to its attended state. It means that it is in a no longer in a process but it has come to its final state. And I believe that the message of the hour has put a mandate on the church of the living God to finish the things that God has started in this hour. And I believe that what this message has done is exactly that. It has challenged us to finish what Jesus Christ started 2,000 years ago. That which he did not accomplish in three and a half years in his eternal or in his physical body, he is now finishing in his corporal body. the body of Jesus Christ. Now, brother Manam said in the message of grace, he said, "Now, according to prophecy," he said, "there will come a headstone." He said, "I want you to notice that when that headstone comes, the prince that's going to cry out, the message will cry out, grace, grace. For it's by grace are we saved and not of works, lest any man should boast." The message of grace has been tramped under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace. And I could say that's the truth where people think that they can get by with anything and they'll say, "Well, God still got grace to save me." But I believe that if if God if we recognize the power and the message of grace that we have received, it will turn us into recognizing the power of this grace. And it'll make us be so locked in and focused that we will recognize that we ought to be challenged to live so clean and so pure before that great I am. He said the message of grace has been tramped under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace. He said some of them runs out into etern eternal security and some runs in now on to everything. He said but the true message of grace remains the same. He said it remains the same. And that's where Satan tries to knock it from the church. You see, that's the fight that you and I have today is because Satan wants to take and knock the message of grace right out and say that grace is no longer and that grace cannot be extended. But I want you to know that no matter where you are, no matter if you feel unworthy, no matter how far that you've gone in God, I want you to know that there is grace still sufficient for every single one of your needs of your life. And you may not feel like you are worthy to finish this race. But God almighty saw that you was worth anointing and challenging you to finish what God has in store for the church of the living God. I want to say it like this that we are believers and as believers that we ought to aim to fulfill the portion or the specific work that God has for us and that while we are here that we ought to work to get the allotted word of our hour completely finished. Now you look at Moses's life and Moses was a man that if you could look at it in this way he was challenged to finish. He was going to do everything within his power to finish the commission that God had given them to take his seed into a s into a strange land to bring them into a promised land. But Moses, when you look at it, Moses was not able to finish &gt;&gt; because he was only allowed to go up into Mount Nebo and he could only go so far. But I want you to know as an older generation, you might feel like your purpose has ended and you're not doing anything no more. Do you realize what Moses's finishing was? He was simply preparing the next generation to step up and accept what he was called for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, I would say it like this that we are a generation with a purpose. Just as every age, every every age like Noah, Moses, and the prophets, they all had a they all had a portion of the word that they were going to fulfill. Now, notice what the Bible said in Acts 13 and 36. For David, after he had served his own generation, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, he fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption. It was not after. It was not before, but it was after he had completely accomplished the work that he'd been given. Hallelujah. But I wasn't born in the right family. I wasn't born to a king's home. I wasn't born into a pastor's family. You are not here by accident. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are only here to fulfill God's divine appointment for your life. And you may not understand it, young people, why you are in the room. And maybe you feel like your parents have brought you to church. You are not here just because your parents brought you to church. You are here to finish what God has started. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This current generation is here to transform the age by fulfilling its specific portion of God's word in this allotted time. So we could say that you're anointed to finish. You're anointed to finish this age of of of of Leosa and not be a part of Leoa, to not be lukewarm, to not be caught up with the ideologies of the world and and to get cold on God and to be a serving a a serving God by tradition. But you are anointed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are anointed because the word of the Lord of this hour, the message has prepared you to finish. So we are believers with authority. &gt;&gt; We are believers with authority because Jesus said, "As my father have sent me, even so send I you." I say that all of heaven has authorized me to be here and I am called. &gt;&gt; I am elected. I am anointed. I am challenged to finish. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to maintain tradition. I am not here just to take up a spot and I'm not here just to be a spectator, but I am called to manifest the finishing of this word. &gt;&gt; Paul ran his race. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Luther ran his race. Wesley ran his race. William Brandham ran his race. But it's my time and it's my What are you going to do with your time? What are you going to do when God calls on you? What are you going to do with your time? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As Paul said, I don't know what you're going to do. &gt;&gt; And I don't know what side you're going to take, but I have fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; I can't say for the rest of this generation what they're going to do, but I'm gonna say it like Paul said. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course and I have kept the faith. And I know that we live in a faithless generation. But for me, I'm going to be one of the few. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be one of the few that say, "I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I did what God called in me. And I have kept the faith through men talked about me. Though men said the message wasn't right, I have kept the faith. Hallelujah. So the same God, So the same God that started, who began the story in Genesis is will be the God that'll close it out in the book of Revelations through a people that know they are sent. A people that know that they are anointed to finish. 2 Timothy and 3:16 that says that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction, and in righteousness that the man of God might be perfect. Perfect. How many perfect people we got in here? There you go. I got one believer here. How many people's perfect tonight? Come on. So, how many's perfect in here tonight? &gt;&gt; I know one lady saying amen cuz I know she's perfect. But how many believers can recognize that the word of the Lord has made them perfect? I'm not perfect in my flesh. I'm not perfect in my emotions. I'm not perfect in my mindset. But by the blood of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; by the word of the Lord, I have been perfected, thoroughly furnished unto good works &gt;&gt; to accomplish, to finish, to complete. The word is given to you to finish the work. Scary to think about perfect people sitting in this place. That's exactly why some of you moved here, cuz you was looking for a perfect church. Well, if you're looking through the blood, you found it. But if you're looking at our flesh, I tell you, we're going to let you down. But if you're looking through the eyes of Almighty God, you have found a perfect people bought with a price, sealed with the Holy Ghost, and born to be devil destroyers, serpent bruisers, to mash on the head of the enemy, a perfect people to destroy the works of Satan. &gt;&gt; When Jesus is there in the book of Revelations, he said, "I am alpha and omega." When you look at it, alpha is the A of the Greek alphabet and omega is a Z of the alphabet. And Jesus said, "I'm the beginning and I'm the end." He said, "You put all the words together that you can make up with the alphabet and I will be all of that to you and I will be all that and more. And I'm going to put something on the inside of you. I'm going to put a witness of myself on the inside of you that you won't have to go out there and fight and challenge and try to do it on your own. But I will be your everything if you make me your everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Notice what the Bible said in John 1. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made, Paul said in Colossians 1:16, for by him, somebody say, by him, &gt;&gt; were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created, say, by him. &gt;&gt; And say, for him. &gt;&gt; Say, I was created by him. &gt;&gt; And I was created for him. When God comes and he begins to speak the world into existence and he said let there be light. He said let there be affirmative and let there be this and let there be that. But when he comes to the end of his work and the Bible said in Genesis 2 that on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. I was made by him for him. &gt;&gt; So God spoke the word. He thought the word, spoke the word, and then the word was made manifest. &gt;&gt; He brought to pass what he said. So the word has the ability to create. And if you really believe that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, you will believe that for you and right now, that he is has the ability to create in you a new heart and within you a right spirit. That he can make you a new creature in Christ Jesus. So the word he spoke is the word. What he did is exactly what he said. The reason why there's a sun here is because he said it. The reason why there's a moon here is because he said it. There would never be one of you here unless he said it, spoke it, believed it, manifested it. So before there was an atom or a molecule or anything that was brought into creation, he thought of you. Then he spoke of you and now you're here. So you cannot separate God from what he does and what he says because what he says is what he does. &gt;&gt; I like that kind of math right there. I I can pass in this kind of I can pass it this kind of test right here. What he says is what he does and what he does is what he says. And I found out a whole lot of times about man is that man will say one thing and they will do another. But I have never found almighty God to ever let me down. What he says is what he does. He said I was an overcomer. Then I'm an overcomer. He said I was bloodbought. That means I'm bloodbought. He said I was elected. That means I am elected. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said there will be a people who under their messenger what he says is what he does. &gt;&gt; I feel like preaching right? What he says is what he does. If he said it heal you, that's what he'll do. If he said he'd save you, that's what he'll do. If he said it, then I believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Numbers 23 and 19. God is not a man that he should lie, neither the son of man that he should repent. Have he said it, and shall he not do it, or have he spoken, and shall he not make it good? Tell me one time. Hallelujah. Tell me one time. His promises are not like the shifting sand. They're a rock you can stand on. Every prophecy, every covenant, every word spoken of your life has got to come to pass. It's kind of like a builder that's got unlimited funds. He can start the foundation and you ain't got to worry if he's got strength enough to do it. You ain't got to worry if he's got funds enough to finish it. Jesus said, "If I start it, then I'm going to finish it." That's what God is saying about your life. That if I started you, I'm going to finish your life. Come on, somebody. I want you to know that God did not just start you on the road to this message to lead you half the way. The message came across your path to put you in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said, "Looking unto Jesus, the author, &gt;&gt; the author, the beginner, and the finisher of my faith. I ain't got my eyes on Putin. I ain't got my eyes on Trump. I got my eyes. Oh, King Jesus. Paul said in Philippians 1:6, "Being confident of this very thing, which he hath begun a good work in you will perform it under the day of Jesus Christ." Solomon said in Ecclesiastes 7:8, "Better is the end of a thing." Better is the end of a thing than the than the beginning thereof. &gt;&gt; Take a look around. Kind of like Sister Pat says sometimes, getting better like a fine wine. Getting better with age. Aren't you thankful I ain't preaching on the same elements that I was when I first started preaching? Some of you wish I was because I preached 17 minutes and I got it down to the end of it said that's all I got. But to be real honest, if I had to go back and watch that, thank God we didn't stream in. That'd be some humbling services right there. But if God would cap off my life right now or he cap off your life, are you still in the same spot or have you advanced? I would say like Solomon says, not about my ministry, but better is the end than the beginning thereof. And the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. Hallelujah. I mean, well, you say, "Well, I can't fellowship with you on that because I'm still in the same spot. I haven't advanced my prayer life. I haven't advanced my listening to the mess." I haven't advanced. So, I can't really fellowship with you on that. Well, let me let me bring you over to maybe where your mind might you ever drove past a beautiful house, they're in the making of it, and they got they got everything up. They got the plywood, they got the bones and everything together, and it just stops all of a sudden. It's a It has the ability or the potential to be an absolute beautiful masterpiece of a house, &gt;&gt; but some reason maybe the guy that was building it ran out of money or the guy that was building it, he got sick and he couldn't finish it. I tell you what it is. It's a monument of failure. &gt;&gt; And I believe that's a way that a lot of people are in Christian churches or message churches. They've never advanced. They never come to church early. They they can skip church and they can go here and there and they never advance and they're a monument of failure. &gt;&gt; But God didn't start something on the inside of you just so that you could be a failure. He elected you, anointed you, called you, and he put something on the inside of you to finish it. Finish the work. One man said, "How can I overcome?" He said, "And now he that starts, not he that starts, but he that finishes." Many start the race, but there's one finish. And he said, "There'll be many churches that start. Many of groups of people," he said, "but there'll be one group finish." &gt;&gt; There'll be one group finish, and that's the overcomers. If there's one going in Virginia, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm taking a spot. If there's one church going in Virginia, we taking a spot. If there's one people that's going, we're taking a spot. Why? Because God said it and God's going to do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I probably upset somebody cuz I didn't call their church's name. I'm sorry, but as for me and Full Gospel Lighthouse, we got one goal, and that's a rapture. You can come and go with us if you want to. You ain't got to go to my church, Brother Tim's church, Brother Donny's church, Brother Tom Ray's church. Just get under the token. Hallelujah. That's what God is wanting. A people under the broken blood sail completely washed by the blood. [Applause] You imagine, I read a statistic about those that start college and never finish it. 60% of people that start college, 60% is the only ones that finish it. So the people that you started with at 100%. Imagine 40% of them walking away. What if 40% of this church didn't make it? What if we're 40% of your own family didn't make it? You see, there's a lot of people that have great ambitions. There's a lot of people that want to do something for the Lord. There's a lot of people that want to escape, but they never want to get down to where the rubber meets the road. &gt;&gt; You see, when you begin to look at things in the natural, you see these men that run these marathons and women, they they they have trained for it. And marathon runners say that when you get to the wall, which is a 20 mile radius somewhere in that neighbor neighborhood, you hit a wall. And that's where a lot of people fall out. They can't make it no more. Their their feet are burning. They have ran all that they can run and they stop and they can't go no further. You know, over 30,000 people every single year get involved in the Boston Marathon and 97 people 97% of people that join that marathon actually finish it. But there are thousands that cannot go the distance. There are thousand that give up because they just didn't have the stamina. They didn't have they got exhausted or maybe they got injured and they couldn't go all the way because they hadn't trained to finish. But I ain't talking about people that go halfway like Pharaoh wanted to offer Moses. He said, "If we're going," he said, "we're all going." &gt;&gt; In the Olympics, out of millions who dream less than 0. 0001 ever compete. It takes an uncommon perseverance. Like brother Brandon would talk about George Washington. It takes uncommon faith to press through. Studies show that nearly 70% of kids in the US drop out of organized sports by the age 13. But don't tell little Johnny he ain't going to make it to the MLB. At 10 years old, he still got three years left. 70% of kids. I think it's amazing because I'll be honest, I had dreams of doing it, too. There's a lot of times I was out there in my front front yard on that gravel pad and I thought I was going to be the next guy that was going to play at the UNCC Tar Hills. And I'm going to tell you what, I dunked on that thing and I thought, man, they cannot live without me. I tell you what, my dreams got crushed by an eighth grade math teacher. They said I couldn't pass algebra. So therefore, I couldn't make it on the basketball team. So I couldn't finish my dreams because I'm an eighth grade math teacher. But you know, somebody gave up on an eighth grader one time and they said, "Nah, he ain't good enough." Hallelujah. And this man missed over 9,000 shots and lost over 300 games in his career. But he is known as one of the greatest finishers of all time. His name is Michael Jordan. And how would you like to been the guy that gave up on Michael Jordan? Said he ain't made he ain't good enough to make the cut. &gt;&gt; There's a whole lot of people in this message that gave up on me. There's a whole lot of people in this message that would have gave up on you. But I do not have a mentality of people that give up. I have never listened to a loser in my life and I'm not going to start now. I was born to be a winner and I believe you are too. So if you believe it or not, the Bible said, "As a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he." You cannot talk me out of it. You cannot shake me out of it. I'm a winner. I'm victorious. I'm an overcomer. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There was a runner by the name of Eric Liddell. They created a a movie about him in the 80s called The Chariots of Fire, I think. and he was a he was a runner in the Olympics, but they wouldn't let him compete because he refused to run on Sundays. He chose his faith over top of fame, but he still had a destiny in front of him. He said it in these words. He said, "When I'm running, I feel his pleasure on my life." He found a way to finish. He found a way to finish and he come out and he won the 400 meter in the Olympics when he chose his faith over top of fame instead of what people want, instead of what people say you got to do. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You do not have to be a slave to lay out a sea. This word, this word will change your body. This word will change your mentality. This word will make you a finisher. &gt;&gt; Notice in the Bible, you'll find that King David, he lived in a house of cedar. He lived in a house of mansions of gold and all the things. But he begin to look at it and said, "How in the world can my Lord live in a house?" and I live in this great big mansion. He said, 'I want to build you a house, Lord. And the prophet Nathan went to him said, "David, I brought you from the sheep coat." He said, "I made all of your enemies fall before you." He said, "But you sped you, you spared you bled too much. You brought caught too much blood upon the scene." He said, "I'm not going to allow you to build a house, but I'm going to raise up somebody in your lineage that will build me a house." And he raised up Solomon to build him a house. And David commissioned him, said, "Do it." In 1 Corinthians or 1st Chronicles 28 and 20, "And David said to Solomon his son, be strong and of a good courage and do it." There will be people that say you can't do it, but do it. There will be people that say you can't go the distance, but do it. Solomon, fear not, nor be dismayed, for the Lord the God, even my God, will be with thee. He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee &gt;&gt; until thou has finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; God's going to be with you. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm never going to leave you nor forsake you. I'll be with you even in you to the end of the work and you're going to finish it. Notice when Zerubbabel when you see him come into the picture in Zechariah 4, you begin to see that he was a spiritual head over top of the tribe of Judah at the time when when under the Babylonian captivity. He was the one that led the first group of captives back to Jerusalem. And he set it in his course to rebuilding of the temple after the Babylonian captivity and the Jews had returned to their land. Notice what brother Brandon says. He said, he said, "We're all acquainted with scriptures." He said, "That reads the Bible." He said, "We know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and Jeru was a great prince amongst the people who had laid the foundation of the building." He said, "Now you, I want you to put on your spiritual thinking, anointing jacket this morning as we think." And this great prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord. And then when he did, he had laid the foundation stone. As we read on further, we find out that God said, "Jerubbable has laid the foundation with his hands. He also shall bring forth the headstone." He said, I want you to notice, he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone, but he said he shall bring forth the headstone. Now we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the chief cornerstone but he's also the headstone. Now if we will think for a few minutes he said that the seventh church age messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. In other words rebuild the church under the power of the spirit. Not by might, not by power, but by my spirit sayaith the Lord, not by organization, not by denomination, but by the Holy Spirit. God will bring forth the church in this last age. &gt;&gt; Under the message he is beginning to rebuild, &gt;&gt; rebuild the church under the power of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, that's why William Brandham said, he said that this age would be both mechanics and dynamics. That it would be a refilling of the Holy Spirit. That the dynamics is the outpouring of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What are you saying? I'm saying that we're not in a horse and buggy day no more. &gt;&gt; We ain't in airplane day no more. But the prophet said that we were built for another atmosphere. But this is the astronaut age. Let me say it like this. You cannot put hay in my rocket and think it's going to take off. You cannot feed me corn and good grain and think I'm going to take off. But oh, if you put me some rocket fuel, the message of the hour on the inside of me, I'm built. I'm built for another atmosphere. I'm built to take off. I'm built to leave Leosa behind me. &gt;&gt; He said, I want you to get built up in the holy oracles of God in the faith of this hour. The faith, he said, it's going to take more faith than any other age. He said, for this has to be rapturing faith to be taken up. He said, we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider whether this be of God or not. &gt;&gt; How many can say that this is God? Amen. &gt;&gt; Accumulate the things that you've seen. Accumulate the message. Accumulate what you see out there in the world. &gt;&gt; I'm going say if you want entertainment, watch the Pentecostals. But entertainment will not put you in a rapture. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not knocking on them brothers and sisters out there. I'm just simply saying that ain't going to feed me. They ain't going to feed me just because somebody jumps up and speaks in tongues for half an hour and then gets up and interprets what they think it said. That ain't going to feed me. &gt;&gt; Ain't going to feed me when they come out and try to breathe on top of people and speak on top of people and do all kind. That ain't going to feed me. That might feed somebody else when they jump all day and they can't get to the preaching of the word. That might feed somebody, but it won't feed me. I'm an eagle and I got to have an eagle, a fresh gill to be able to set here under the shadow of the wings of the Almighty. &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice, hallelujah, the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, completed, polished, perfect. It wasn't a whole lot about William Brandham that people thought he was polished. He said pull pit instead of pull pit. He said hit stones and hints and all kinds of different things. Didn't have a good vocabulary. He wasn't polished to the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; But the same one that crafted him was the same one that crafted me. &gt;&gt; And they want to polish up the message. They want to polish it up. and try to rub it down and smooth out all the corners of it and say we need to preach it like this. We don't need the demonstration of the power no more. All we need is an intellectual TED talk where somebody gets up and reads a few quotes here and there. But I beg to differ. I beg to differ. I say if we're going to preach a message, then there ought to be some power behind it. There ought to be some anointing behind it. This is the finishing of it. So if it's finished, then it was perfect the way that William Brandham left it. Then let's preach it just like the prophet left it under the gene seat of almighty God. We have been led to finish. To finish. Let's run with a message. We've got the answer. Run. Don't change the message. Live the message. Preach the message. Be the message. [Applause] Hallelujah. I am challenged by the message to finish my course. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You talk about a challenge. William Brandham was challenged. to take all these loose ends time together. It's a paradox, but it's true &gt;&gt; that God can tie up something and loose at the same time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He tied these mysteries together and brought them back, but when he did, he loosed you. He loosed you to believe. He loosed you for healing. He loosed you to believe that the rapture is for you. He said, "Yeah, it's a mystery, but it's solved." Yes, it's a mystery, but it's solved. You see, it is no longer a mystery to the church of the living God. What was it? The seven thunders awaken the sleeping body that they recognize. What was it when the seven thunders uttered their voice? The symbology was broke off the scriptures and now you see Christ. &gt;&gt; I love what the prophet said in the guide. He said at the finishing of the seventh seal, the mystery of God should be finished. To know who God is, what he is, how he lives, his nature and his being. So the shout challenged you to press on &gt;&gt; and the spoken word is the original seed. He said God is taking the elect out of that Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out and finishing up the word. It's got to be so close but to the world itself will blend with this word. There comes a headstone crying grace. Grace amazing grace. What is he doing? Our founder, brother Homer, come out of the Pentecostal church. But the reason why he came out because he was not a part of it. How did he get here? There's other people that was handed a message book. &gt;&gt; There's other people in that same church that was handing a message book, but they couldn't handle it. Let me say it like this. The Pentecostal age could not finish what God ordained for you. &gt;&gt; You see, they were not people of the commission. They could only go so far. But the reason why there's a church standing here and was ordained by Homer Fraser was because almighty God elected brother Homer Fraser before the foundation of the world and planted him right here in the hills of Virginia and said, "You're going to be in there, but I'm going to pull you out. I'mma pull you out of that hybrid system because why? I've got a job for you to do. You've got to finish this." But he didn't just leave it from the pull pit. He put it on you. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Let's finish what God started. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel anointed. I feel anointed to tear down strongholds and to build up the church of the living God into such a place she will believe exactly what the prophet said about her. &gt;&gt; I believe that God ordained me to preach this message. I believe that God ordained you to believe and receive this message. I believe that God called you to come out to come out to come out. You said, "Well, I wasn't in no organization." But you still had to come out of it. Some of you had to come out of the Amish movement. Some of you had had to come out of the Catholic movement. Some of you had to come out of Baptist and Methodist and Presbyterian. But God called you to come out. &gt;&gt; He elected you to come out. And it shows what kind of seed that you have on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you came out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Said, "But can God do anything with me?" Sure he can. Sure he can. Remember the prophet one time he was telling a story. I'm getting ready to close. He's telling a story about the queen. She goes to this great big paper meal. She's toring the paper meal. She's looking all around and she comes to a place and the manager of the of this paper meal is standing there and the queen looks down at it and she says, "What is that mess right there?" And it was nothing but a bunch of rags laying there. He said, "Well, that's tomorrow's newspaper." She said, "You mean to tell me that that's tomorrow's newspaper?" He said, "Absolutely." and she left the building and the next night the manager of that place took those filthy rags running through his machinery and the next day he printed the queen's picture right on the front of it to prove to her that the the image is &gt;&gt; the image of the queen was on filthy rags Some of you getting it. &gt;&gt; It ain't how you look. It ain't what you look like. But when the master gets done with you, when the master of the facility gets done writing your story, let him print his image on top of you. You may have came from a home of disgrace, but it's a message of grace that is rotten over top of your life. Hallelujah. You may not look like it right now, but let your life go through the blood of Jesus Christ, and God will take your filthy rags, and you'll be an image of Jesus Christ at the end of this age. &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come. Blessed be the name of the Lord. In 1968 during the Olympic Games in Mexico City, there was a marathon runner from Tanzania. His name was John Steven Aquar. He became famous not for winning but for finishing. Early in the race, he fell badly. He dislocated his knee. He injured his shoulder. Many expected him to quit. And hours later, the stadium had nearly completely emptied. The medals had already been awarded. The lights had done been turned off. Then suddenly the crowd saw a lone figure limping wrapped in bandage bandages grimacing with every step entering the enter the arena. And the people stood there and cheered as John Steven Aquara hobbled those last painful steps and he crossed the finish line. When the reporters asked him why didn't he just quit, he gave this legendary answer. My country did not send me 5,000 miles to start the race. They sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race. God before the foundation of the world did not elect me just so I could start. He elected me to finish. [Applause] He elected me to finish. [Applause] I believe that's one of them new words, ain't it? Locked in. Is that one of them words? I get it right, India. locked in. These kids come up with new words all the time. I'm just waiting for them to say at the end of it. My sermon was RZ. [Music] I don't even know what that stuff means. But that's what you going to have to be in this age. You going have to be locked in. &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish. Matter of fact, my sermon's finished right now. What are you going to do? &gt;&gt; I know what I'm going to do. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm going to do. There's going to come times in your life when you're going to have to make some tough decisions to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you will never regret doing anything for the house of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me say this world will fill you with all kinds of regrets, but you will never regret doing something for King Jesus. &gt;&gt; You will never regret regret giving your all in worship. You will never regret giving all of your energies. &gt;&gt; You will never regret coming to church when you didn't feel like coming to church. &gt;&gt; And I say, let's finish this with all that's what finished. &gt;&gt; How many's with me? How many say, "God, I I I receive this word as a challenge to run the race that you set before me, and I'm going to do my best, Lord. [Music] I can't do it on my own, but I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. I can do this. I can make it. I'mma press the battle, and I'm going to win." God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; The castle that made between us, how high the mountain I could not fly. In desperation, [Music] I turned to heaven and spoke your name into the light. [Music] Then through the darkness, [Music] your loving kindness for through the shadow of my soul. The work is fading. The is great. [Music] Oh Jesus Christ my lady.

Brother Gabe, if you could check, make sure they're ready for Sister Andy to come on back as they prepare their singing a song. Have you been to Jesus for your salvation power, cleansing power? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? &gt;&gt; Have you been to Jesus for your cleansing power? Are you in the blood of the lamb? Lord, you fully trust in his grace. This high in the blood of lamb. Who are you? In the blood in the cleansing blood of lamb. Who are your garments? spotless are they wise as snow. Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?

Father, we recognize that you're still calling. We're in this apostolic age still, Father. So, Lord Jesus, we stand here, Lord, and I'll baptize her in this watery grave. I ask, Father, that as I raise her up, you raise her to walk in the newness of life. &gt;&gt; Fill her with the fire of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; In the name of God, I pray according to thy faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. saying as we're prepared to be dismissed.
