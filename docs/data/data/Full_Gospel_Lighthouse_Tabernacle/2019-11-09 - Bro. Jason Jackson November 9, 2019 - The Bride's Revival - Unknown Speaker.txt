we pray for it's in Jesus Christ's name and the bride said well it's good to be to my second home I just feel comfortable here but with you people and you still I guess wasn't this considered below the mason-dixon line oh yeah okay just making sure that's why I feel so comfortable you know been from Arkansas it's just easy pretty good to see brother Steven he was with us for about four years and we loaned him to you guys so if you get sick of him just send him back and and we'll put him somewhere and good to see each and every one tonight just pray God would bless you and I want to thank brother Ron and sister Connie and and for having us and their children well they're still children but they're at the but brother Matt and brother Andrew and their wives and families and brother Davey and them just make us so welcome and we certainly appreciate that and I'm privileged this trip to have my wife with me sister joy and my youngest daughter sister Caitlyn she's 17 years old first time she's ever been here I'm kind of ashamed of that but we're good good I'm glad she was able to come with us this time just pray tonight that something would be said that would change your life I had something happen and I don't maybe you could just be seated for a moment I don't want to keep you standing but I had something happen a couple of days ago well it's been about a week or so ago now a week and a half it was actually on Wednesday and brother Ralph had passed on Tuesday and I didn't know it at the time and on Wednesday I was sitting in my office and I could look out over a little lake there in front of the house and right out of my window and as I looked out I'd turned on the tape as the Eagle stirs her nest and as I looked out and I looked across the pond there's sort of great big eagle right in the top of a tree and I snapped the picture of it and I sent it to Andrew I said you got to look at this this is something and and and then he tells me Saturday that as they was putting the body of our brother in the Hurst he was relating the story I think to his sister here or somewhere and it was telling her what had happened and a great bald eagle just flew over the top of the church and began the circle now I don't believe God does things by chance or by just the coincidence there there's something supernatural and then brother John Tandy's sent a message and said Saturday they had had a funeral there was four eagles circling over top of the cemetery well I just believe it's a stirring time it's wraps our time it's time for us to be prepared to go home and and I believe we're living in that hour to where we will see the miraculous brother on kept saying before I come out we're living in that and that time of revival well that's what I'm speaking on the night and little did he know my title but I want to speak to you tonight on the bride's revival but if you'd like to stand just for a moment as we read the word I want to turn to Matthew chapter 24 and verse 28 and then also into mark chapter 16 Matthew 24 and 28 for wheresoever the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered together mark chapter 16 verse 17 these signs shall follow them that believe how many believers in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they might recover you might find Anna's brother Ryan will put you might find that none Almanac or something you're not gonna find that in the Bible for the Bible says and they shall recover may the Lord that is blessing this evening you may be seated I want to read you just a little a sentence out of God's provided way brother and said where God is moving people come the worse of God it's always been so it's always been that way where God is moving people come to Orson but now we know that in the scriptures and in the and the prophet of God is the message he brought us we are called in the world Eagles huh but an eagle had to start out as a baby before it ever mattered you didn't start out flying just as soon as you was born an eagle you had to go through a process that you might mature until you come into that that the Eagle that could actually fly and when the mother Eagles I noticed his brother madam was preaching the message of as the Eagle stirs from nest I got to paying close attention when a mother builds a nest she builds it in a specific special certain way she starts with thorns and briars and thistles and twigs and and limbs and whatever she can find and then she wraps it in fur that's the first thing that has to come out of the nest it's the last thing that goes in the nest but it's the first thing that comes out of the nest and you know sometimes people excuse me tonight the devil is trying to attack my voice bhudev man you know sometimes people don't like being around where the Spirit of God is moving I just happen to like to be around wherever the spirits been poured out hit me under the fountain you know people well you know I guess I won't go back to that church or nothing but a bunch of holy rollers and you're buzzing you're just a buzzard but man said ain't no way your needle for an eagle likes to feed upon the word an eagle like some meat of the gospel an eagle likes to dig into the Word of God and find out what is standing about them listen the singing about who's who or anything like it's about the bride of Jesus Christ and we want to eat old Eagles food but I'm said well he said you know he said an eagle of God eats the Word of God and that alone he longs for he will ride through a blizzard for through a snowstorm and everywhere when he hears there's a revival going on he'll take off to it just as hard as he can listen because there's something inside of that man or woman that remembers the old barnyard that they came out of they remember that revival that they heard about it how it swept over the soul how it changed their lives how it changed their outlook because where the carcass is that's where you go find where the Spirit of God is moving that's where you're gonna find cause I'm an eagle and I'm used to eagle food I don't want some of this theology that people try to give nowadays I want the meat of the word [Applause] now when these Eagles get to a certain size comes a time when mothers got to stir up the nest come to time when the fur has to come up there comes a time when she throws all that stuff stuff out it and they begin to get a little sticker and and they begin to get uncomfortable because see she wouldn't want him like to be like a buzzard and to stay comfortable in the nest she wants to stir him up a little bit and get a revival going in them because she's fixing the take home on the flight god no won't you getting used to Leto Asiya he's getting you ready for a flight that's what's happened that's why the Saints of that believe in this money but they are not dying probably watching don't say I'm there when I'm holed I just changed of mansions I don't hear anymore I'm not from this world but the eagle has to get ready for the nest to bestir so she gets all this things out of it and then you know you have a heartbreak you you have an ailment you have you have a trial you lose you might even lose it you're dumb Notah fat brother on stage you might even go bankrupt and lose all your friends buddy said just get ready God's fixin to do something for you this fixing a big v over c listen trucks if we were so you say everything being perfect we wouldn't want to get out of this world but there has to be something to get inside the brides to make a wanna lead [Applause] comes mama Eagle m1 and she lets out a scream I'm not gonna scream but shoot that sound scream Oh Helen oh yeah she comes Friday all those little eaglets in her begins that's my other sub where somebody listen they recognize the voice she had screamed to him before instead of time that's breakfast time whatever that may be she's getting them ready training them listen he's coming she walks in there that day or drops in there's listen guys right today's gonna be a solo flight we're fixing to get out of here well they're just bouncing up and down and her you know smell like the Holy Ghost when you get filled with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost begins to fall people's hands beginning to go home they begin to shout hallelujah hey man thank you Jesus I'm glad you're here and doctors I'm just getting your a day this is not the some new fixin to go on your final flight I'm preparing you huh letting fall in this bill in the night wouldn't be a sick person in here in five minutes if you could believe when their box liner set in the seat they've been and alter who and Mail also left at the end of the service [Music] mother ego gets ready she goes alright we're getting the flight now it's time for you to dig in now she's playing these Eagles would it come time to fight how to hold on and when she spread out the old and the New Testament and she was right there she told them to hold on to what the head listen you've got the new and the Old Testament together you got everything you have need of hey y'all do it hey um do it Diann to it he is Almighty he is of Shadia huh he is the breast of one he is the wing one he is the West one he's the old in the new she got a pearl no she got it all on that morning she's balancing about filling the weight gets over to the engine and this takes the plunge they'd never felt nothing like it before never felt nothing that strange before they never felt that kind of wind before remember how it was the night you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost when the rushing mighty wind came down in the building and filled your ever fiber there was something happening you felt a little strange but you was being born again the Spirit of God God told you he knew you here lucky you he ordained you and put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world what are we scared about or what school your skirt needs to be scared I'm an eagle this is my revival I did a study years ago on Eagles going through the multi instant process and as they go through the multi process an overt our Eagle getting down in the valley and his own beat becomes all callous over and he can't even eat but some of the other materials they'll come down in the valley where he is and ripped out meat apart and hand feed him big theme big to big here's your meat today here spiritual food in new season when you that know it's way to go God spoke to you meanie brother on told your brother Andrew Collier what are the other brothers or sisters central message it wasn't him it's God cuz he called you he elected you so don't be scared well Justin I've got I've got kids brother Ben wrote a track why fear cancer huh what is it it's another we got a sister in our church come down with breast cancer just here recently my simple sister will be praying for you she said I ain't afraid she said I ain't afraid for some reason God chose me to let me allow me to go through this he's got a testimony I'm not worried in fact she said I'm thankful it was me out of all my family that kind of testimony that kind of attitude God's gonna do so they told her you know we don't know exactly I thought it was second stage second stage already she goes in to take it out wash there's barely first stage it's it's one a they told her just barely anything not gonna need no chemo not Nino radiation huh she had a positive confession as for a purpose God should he do something for his people we're heroes well a person like we are Eagles of God he's so far huh you have been a man in in this hour we've been anointed to stay in a pine heart you've been annoying to find the glory God invited you to the cross in this Bible to take his promise far away with the slate never been upper before don't worry hang on he'll get you there he'll get you there ain't never been able to move my monkeys start moving it ain't never available warpath start I'd start testified he is the high priest of your confession these signs shall follow them that believe we saw a living dog she shakes him eagles off and they start falling brother I'm said and she swoops down beside him and she's just waiting if one would get out of control she'd swoop down and pick him up by grace and restore him again brother some people just get to Pentecostal they get to all out of order let me tell you the Holy Ghost don't get out order you might get Pazzi terzi's brother branham's head and you might clean him flop all over the place but if you fall he will pick you up and grace again there is a grace in this hour this message ain't a bunch of legalism this message is God's grace to you I heard legalism all my life but this message ain't legalism this gospel lives [Applause] [Music] the Regals having a Pentecostal Jubilee what if they fall what if I what if I make a mistake forgive you forgive you cuz you're doing it on purpose it wasn't really in your heart he knows he's able to forgive hey while you're down here having a good time I clicked on this the last part of y'all service less Sunday night and I seemed Eagles dancing around this church what Buzzard zoos Eagles recognize their possession recognize who they were Tory to God if we could get the revelation of who we are nothing what stand in our way let the denominator I can't say mom I'm all read I'm just forgetting a nominations take some of these I hope they're watching right now some of these message theologians who want to take the power out of the gospel who want to stop the gospel everything it is anyone is sleeping and everything the prophet of God told us we will have let me tell you you're not taking it from this eagle you might take it from one that don't recognize who he is yeah but you ain't get that from me this is my revived this is bad time for hello hurry listen there's been a lot of message preachers to try to crack the wings of a needle but he's the healer you know what the whole problem is they never flew

to bring it to our day cuz this is our revival we worship we thank God for all the things that happen in the Bible and then brother man's ministry but Christ is still here he didn't leave 1965 he's still here it's all right for sure just a few things with you first of June your pastor and brother Tim foot come to our church during the month of June we'd do something a little different than how we have a special meeting every weekend except for Father's Day and I'll take father's day so we don't have somebody come in and then I usually preach them the midweek service but I'd asked for the Tillman brother Ron to come and God works so many supernatural things then it was beyond my comprehension some of them us is too personal maybe to even share but I'll hit the I'll hit us I'll hit a bunch of them tonight if the Lord had helped me we had a service brother Tim preached a powerful message whether on preach the first night but the Tim preached and then brother Ron preached on Sunday or Saturday night Sunday Sunday night Saturday night Sunday night brother Tim treats anymore and brother Tim said I'll get my two services in either way so and Friday and Saturday night rather there was until all four call me there was no prayer for the sick made but there was a lot of people come up front for a recon secretion and a refill and if the Holy Ghost probably 100 and some people gathered around the front our piano player sister Sheila she was here near your Labor Day meeting she was just diagnosed with sarcoidosis and brother on center let's go pray for sister Sheila so while people were worshiping we slipped over and prayed for and a couple with a month or so later she goes back to the doctor sarcoidosis is gone completely God took her off all the medicine while he's preaching he kept saying his personal name and being cleansed and while he's preaching he keeps saying stab me be closed stand and be cleansed well there happened to be a lady standing sitting there sister Jessica they sing here at your Labor Day meeting brother Tim because she was sitting there and she'd had two lumps on her breast and and scar tissue on her abdomen and they couldn't do any more surgery just make more scar tissue and she said I had a prayer cloth on I already said I'm not taking it off until I'm healed and she said I said there and I was battling a mental battle and brother Ron can't say stand up and be cleansed she said after much middle debate I stopped and a fire went down to my body and the looks and the breasts laugh immediately that girl's been healed of everything anyways completely caught there was a man there who his name was Rex still doing good as well as as far as I know he had he lives in about 45 minutes to an hour away he had stage four cancer and he couldn't find no Church in that town to pray for and then unbelieving that he found so he run into her brother in our church one day sold him a car and he says I'll tell you what we're fixing to have

something compressively half brother tell tell about that campfire that they set around after youth camp and I knew there was a brother there who was struggling and I just kept fighting harness ain't

testimonies God moved on the man that night the man comes in the prayer life needed deliverance listen God knows how to get us he knows how to deliver us he knows how to speak to us you can't orchestrate these things we had another brother in the hospital that same weekend his legs were all swelled up and didn't even know from what it they was running all kinds of blood work and they

and been hurting again she had on like 10 or 12 years ago center in the service and that's the preaching of the word don't have to just feel in on hands we believe in that but it can be out the preacher he his word and he healed them and at the preaching of the word that pain left her body my sister-in-law was healed sat in her seat that weekend I just the preaching of Lord the last weekend we liked saving the best for last brother Andrew coming preached somebody believes it in him I'm not sure who said that but might have been his mama just our grandma he come and praise our song leader had been battling dizziness while he was leading the service left him in the service leaves my wife was sitting there battling fibromyalgia from which the tick bite had left her from a few years ago and God healed her of that chronic fatigue she was saying they're battling pain in her body while she was sitting in the service and Andrew was telling the story of how the children of Israel how they left out of Egypt all they needed to do was get through the desert and she said what's this pain to God and a feeling come all through her body and all the pain left with it we share a supernatural cause Seattle to where your problem is tonight that's not too bad for God this is Jerry lies hooked it's up to you whether you ask God when they ask you to ask Oh had another sister sitting there with blood pressure just stood the roof been going crazy for weeks delivered you don't talk about a revival and Hardy we've been having positions everything being lost oh no split a fight cuz program said wheeze gonna have a fly it won't be easy cause once all the blessing pours out that devil gets mad but it's brother Sam saying long ago he's picking on us cause he's scared of us he knows you're the real deal kind of like an stewardess told you layer on that time I want you to pray for this turbulence coming up oh there's a guy in front of a sister that's a preacher too and she goes but you're the real deal so God knows God lets people see what's on the inside of you sometimes you let him see a light around you brother Sam you didn't know it but we're children of the light cause we're equals of God we're not called to be down here messing around with Leto and SIA we're called to take a step up this is got time you're gonna fight when everything that's within you you're the lead here tonight so this is my day this is my deliverance this is my hour a little bit a couple of months ago I had a dream well just to name a prophet here to interpret this one didn't need any interpretation it's pretty plain I dreamed that my upper cervical doctor I'm I'm pretty good friends with was out on my road in his old truck that he is restoring and he was looking for parts you don't come out on my road looking for parts for that old of the truck cuz they ain't out there there's a salvage yard out there but he didn't get them come apart by the 1940-something pickup and I wake up at five or six 2627 and I look over at my phone and I had a text from this doctor he send it at 5:44 I guess he couldn't wait I'm glad he didn't send it at 3:15 when when he was awake and had all this come to him here since this textile know I woke at 3:15 this morning with a burden this lure this was back when school was just starting I know that many children in school and God's people had been sent in a similar burden to pray over our children in loved ones I feel like the Holy Spirit sent a different burden through though instead of praying over the millions of children and staff and church staff and people in public places my burden is for less people far less people my burden the Holy Spirit revealed to me was to pray a simple for a simple few he said the prayer is for the loss and devil possessed who would commit those terrible crimes of taking machine guns in the schools and mowing down children they said there's nothing there's only a handful of these kind of people he said I pray that Satan when Satan enter these few people they walk into a public place when they'd open the door the Holy Spirit of God would stop them in their tracks and as a Holy Spirit would enter into them he would wash them clean snow white clean he's got my attention at 6:20 in the morning he said in let them go go ahead and enter but don't do any harm and they would enter into their places where they were gonna mow down the people and they would testify how God just saved them and just stopped them from doing what they were gonna do to harm God's children God knows you knows our knows you all know all people's hearts and you can change the people's hearts now he's actually praying almost in this text change these new people pour out your blood over us and your children lord save them protect them convert them when they would do us harm save them and from them and convict them convict our leaders and save them cause the scales to fall from our eyes then we may see that man's laws cannot fix wicked hearts this guy in the preacher I said let them see you're the only one that can change men's hearts open their minds to the truth Lord and let our leaders start speaking your truth versus playing into the hands of Satan forgive me of any sins I have Lord and wash me of any pride or lust of the flesh that would inhibit my prayer from being answered thank you Jesus for saving me and providing a way for us to be with you I love you and thank you England reading this is 6:20 in the morning and immediately my mind goes to the Welsh revival and that text came back and I said what a burden may God answer that prayer what a changing experience that would be I said I was just dreaming about you you drove your old trip up here no trucker pair to my place looking for parts I think this dream needs interpreting you're looking for parts and then I wake and see you text so I'm not sure if you've ever heard of the Welsh revival from Wales in 1904 rebel sends you a clip that I've read so I copied it out of the message sent it to him how brother Dan talks about in the Welsh revival he said there was a time of Jubilee time for the Welsh people and he said he just started in a bunch of illiterate people I sent him several paragraphs of it I wanted to get him the part he's looking for parts I had the part if he could just grasp the part this is what he needed to restart the old truck brother Ram goes on you know he talks about how the people would put men under ditches and then tables they'd go in and pray and people would follow to the convicting power of God when they'd go across the culvert or into a restaurant he went on into the city and asked for missing tasks the busing at the table and the dinner was served he said Lord God bring conviction every man or woman that sits at this table and I said that's the kind brother and goes that's the kind of revival that we need tonight where God gets out amongst the people he gets out amongst the

that he would kill his life try to put all types of different diseases on him sarcoidosis tick fever all types of different things but tonight you heard from a man of God that Satan tried its best to destroy but what God puts his hands on the devil can do all he wants to he can roar or he wants to but I have to say that there was a line that was roaring tonight [Applause] and Satan is defeated whether samwer threat to him we're a threat to him I want you to look at your neighbor until your neighbor said I'm a threat to Satan you may be the weakest Christian in here but you're a threat to
