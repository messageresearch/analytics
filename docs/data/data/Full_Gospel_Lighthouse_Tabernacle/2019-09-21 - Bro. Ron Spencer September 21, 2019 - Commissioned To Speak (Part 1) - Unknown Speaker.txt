thrilled to see all the changing of the colors but it's real beautiful in it a man we live in a beautiful part of the world a man I know if you've not traveled much yeah it's kind of hard to appreciate but you live in one of the most beautiful places in the entire world and amen take advantage of it and the visitors that come here I tell them go to the park go to the park so if you don't go to the park very often go to the park and all of that's going to get you ready for the park Alleluia god bless you if you will turn with me this evening to Psalms chapter 23 very familiar to you I'd like to speak to you this afternoon new non-commissioned to speak a man yes hey man hey man race the Lord for that hallelujah a man well this is a good verse to write read behind that a man the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to let it lie down in green pastures and he leadeth me beside of the still waters and he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me I want you to know tonight on her own a lot of fear can happen but as long as he's with me I know that fear thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies I want you to snow tiss where David said where God anoints me this where God anoints me he prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with all and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever John chapter five and verse 31 and Jesus was saying this he said if I bear witness of myself my witness is not true there is another that beareth witness of me and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true you sent unto John and you bear witness unto the truth but I received not the testimony of from man but these things I say that she might be saved he was a burning and shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light but I have greater witness than that of John what a turning of the corner but I have greater witness than that of John for the works which the father hath given me to finish the works that I do bear witness of me that the father has sent me and the father himself which hath sent me hath bore witness of me and ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have not his word abiding in you for a whom he had sent him you believe not notice these words search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and you will not come to me that you might have life let's pray Lord Jesus we love you with all of our hearts tonight Lord we thank you for your gathering this afternoon and lord I just asked you that is you would anoint our hearts and anoint our lips as we would study and prepare for the service we ask you tonight that you would anoint this audience and congregation those that are listening in now and those that will listen to it we pray that you would speak to our hearts in a supernatural way this evening Lord touch the needs of this audience strengthen us we pray in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen you may be seated Exodus chapter 14 and verse 12 these are quite powerful words is not this the word that you did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than should die in the wilderness and Moses said unto the people I love these words and Moses respond and Moses was commissioned are you with me not just Moses not just our prophet but you and Moses said unto the people fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you you too you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever I don't know if you can read a more powerful text than that can I just read it to you again remember he was commissioned to stand in the spot now how is he commissioned to stand there he had stood beside of a bush that was not consumed with fire he had met God himself he didn't call himself God called him political people didn't call him God called him let's ask herself tonight who called us who gathered us who anointed us for this age God did now just as with your circumstances listen there they were and they were right amongst and the largest murderous situation was about to go on a literal genocide the greatest army of was buried down on him and it looked like they would drive them right into the Red Sea or destroy them there on that on that beach area I want you to understand and people begin to respond we'd have been better off we'd have been better off if you two just left us in Egypt we would continue on are you with me now but Moses responded sometimes you just got to respond in the face of all the unbelief that there is are you with me tonight two different powers comes to church one is the power of faith the other is the power of unbelief it's to whom that you surrender yourself to and when we begin to respond this word is for me and the challenge is for me in this day God could have chose a lot of different days for us to be born in but he knew pre-planning exactly when you would be born what hour that you would be born what circumstances you would be born under now notice what he said fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace it's a powerful thing to be able to hold your tongue it's a powerful thing for you to be able to hold your tongue it's a powerful thing for you to be able to hold your tongue hallelujah that's a powerful thing in it are you with me ships have great rudders great machines have great things but this tongue the scripture says no man contained it tells what's on the inside of your heart you remember when Jesus is standing before the judgment the greatest preacher the greatest king the greatest man that ever was lived did more in his silence he did more in his silence than men that has stood all day with great speeches in second chronicles chapter 25 in verse 15 and he said hearken ye old Judah and ye in habitants of Jerusalem and thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the LORD unto you be not afraid or be dismayed by reason of this great multitude notice these next words for the battle is not yours but God's tomorrow you shall go down against me of their men and behold they come up by the cliff of Ziss and and ye shall find them at the end of the brook and behold the wilderness of the Generale and ye shall not need to fight I love these words you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourself and stand still and see the salvation of the Lord with you o Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you God constantly reminds us that he'll be with us but the Brandon was asked over and over again as he would stand before the phenomenal audiences up into the hundreds of thousands of people and God would do incredible mind-boggling things before the people critics false religions setting literally feet away from him voodoo artists demons trying to call up things against him and they asked him did you ever get nervous no he said he would be with me are you with me he said he would be with me now he had something in common with Moses as he was standing dear and God spoke to him don't cry to me stretch your rod out over this seat now let me just say you and I are not prophets but we're sons and daughters of God let me explain to you as a reminder sons and daughters of God have more authority in heaven than Archangels sons and daughters of God have more authority in heaven than Archangels turn to your neighbor and tell him that wormwood destroyed the world with water wormwood destroyed the world with water are you with me you have more authority than the destroy an angel of God so imagine your power over hell are you listening imagine your power over hell is it not a wonder why the devil tries to keep you from believing who you are is it not a wonder why that devil tries to keep you from believing who you are only with me and he tells you God don't love you and this book is full of I love you this book is full of promises I'll be with you I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you are you with me people have promised keeper conventions listen that's not a new thing God's been a promise keeper since before the foundation of the world and he still a promise keeper to not [Applause] [Music] [Applause] politicians only borrow it from God they stand and make promises to things that people want to hear and they make promises and make promises no and they'll never be able to fulfill any of it everything has to be elected by Congress or these or some kind of power listen God makes a promise God's the infinite power that said let there be a Sun Moon and stars and he believed his own word the thing with God was God spoken and then believed his word God deposited a part of himself inside of you all that God was he poured it into crust all that Christ was he pours it into the church you are the living epistle of God you're literally a testimony living Revelation chapter 3 and verse 21 to him that overcometh this is your age to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne not to him that survives not to him that gets BA God knew this Laodicean age and how dark it would be and how deceitful it would be and how horrible it would be and how immorally corrupted it would be and how politically charged it would be and how homosexual filled it would be he knew all the God didn't say I'm not gonna be able to have anybody I'm gonna have a bride that's a predestinated elected bride of Jesus Christ that will overcome hallelujah I happened to attack actually believe that Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 thrilling my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that she may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil forget wrassle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against powers and against the rulers of the darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places the battle is for your position the battle is for your position the what makes the news out there is just dust fightin dust flesh unredeemable flesh fightin unredeemable flesh but the real battle that's going on that will never make ABC CBS or whatever the nonsense is it'll never make the news it's the battle for your position ah then lujah it's not about our car it's not about our house it's not about our job it's your position it's your position if satan can keep you off your knees he knows his kingdom won't shake and he knows if the weakest of christians go on their knees the kingdom of hell shakes and if they begin to talk to god the only living true god and they be done to recognize that i'm a part of the kingdom I'm a citizen of another Kingdom I am a son and daughter of God they can ask petitions on the Living God and know that God is able to answer their prayer so how does he work on you how does this Satan work on you keeping you off your knees is one way listen this isn't science just keep you off your knees keep you busy any of you ever get busy are you with me senior citizens are the business people in the world you moms are changing diapers you don't have no no idea what it's going to be like once you're retired of how busy you're going to be I've been in the business world a long time just try to plan something with a senior citizen they got a look at the calendar don't get mad just hang on here with me I'm gonna tell you the fight on and over when you turn 65 a Christian battle is not over with when you turn 75 it's all the way through the German [Applause] stand therefore with your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith so many times we pick up the wrong shield we pick up the wrong shield the shield of doubt the shield of fear the shield of dread how many of you ever had your daddy said when we get home I'm gonna whip you I'm gonna give you something to cry for the dread was worse than the whoopin your daddy said this is gonna hurt you worse than it I never did believe that statement brother Ron I've I just have so much fear I when I come up against things I have so much fear quit crossing bridges tell you get to I can't overcome three weeks from now til I get done a lot of people want to believe we're living in the eighth day I got news for you we're still living in Laodicea now our soul is for the eighth day and we're going to the eighth day but baby we're still alive in this day Alleluia we still got a battle on our hands now Jesus commissioned us knowing we were going to have need some some charge orders and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel that every creature and he that believeth not he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils and they shall speak with new tongues and they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover [Music] we fulfill some of that in the last week or so we got on a plane we made the journey we sat on the tarmac for for two and a half three hours before that we even left Charlottesville we just sit there then we messed mixed own we missed our next flight and then we set in Chicago about four to six more hours and then we got to Calgary and we set for a few more hours and what I was supposed to do was get there at 3:00 and I got there at 11:11 did you enjoy your vacation brother run nah what's going to work my job to go to work are you with me I like what Billy Graham said one time he said you know I really like my cabin here in North Carolina he said I really like my home place but God told me to go and he didn't give me excuse he told us to go and preach the gospel and so we go by the commission of the word of God and speak the truth of this day and then there'll be signs and wonders follow so you can look back in your journey and see God did this and God did that and God did this and God did that and God did this brother Jason Jackson's watching this evening and we went to his place in in June and at his place there's a list that after the meeting was over there was a list that brother Jason presented us over the coming weeks of the things that God did and the list just kept growing and the list just kept growing and it just kept growing cancer was taken care of relationships was taken care of one situation after another was taken care of over and over we preach the word and then God is the final lay man and then after we walked out of the building we walked out in a and a person said now now listen only brother Branham could do that you're too late you're this way too late it's to every believer he gets us all differed to preach the gospel and different gifts in our lives but let me just say this these signs shall follow them that believe alleluiah and we're given the badge of authority in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you I'll never forget I was mowing grass behind our cabin I was mowing grass behind the cabin and we were pretty famous there in that area to have copperhead snakes and a copperhead just bit me bit me right on the ankle and maybe that thing was real and he took off disappeared I couldn't see him and I went to get I went to the power line brother Homer was working up there went to the power line and and I said hey I've been bit by a copperhead snake he didn't grab me take me to the hospital he always had a he always had a pill bottle in his in his pocket he pulled that pill bottle out gave me two benadryl put his hand on my head and said in the name of Jesus Christ he didn't quit erdan man mark chapter 16 then he said go back to work I think so many times we have a personal pity party real quick and if you're not careful you'll get mourners and grievers and warriors and they'll all gather real quick about how bad it is just stop just a moment take God at His Word the scripture said whose report do you believe I choose to believe the word of the Lord hallelujah we looked at an absolute catastrophe last week and I'd say this is more than our hearts can stand when brother Joe Reynolds and sister Mandy's daughter just a real angel on the earth and we'd known since she was small maybe even before I don't know how we absorb such dark horrible situations of life it was only grace that can get us through those trials we're not immune as Christians we're not immune to trouble sometimes we think well I'm a Christian now why does trouble come or what is this you're you're under Adams fallen race and so troubles going to come but God said I'll be with you in trouble young lady in an accident 16 years old and gone to be with the Lord it took all of her breath many of you no doubt wept and cried we've sick cards and different things just to try to encourage and strengthen we're a body of believers no matter where we're at we're a body of believers and we stand strong together but whether we realize that not like my mother or brother Homer or many of our loved ones that came here that last breath here was the first breath there are you with me we look at things in the mortal realm God looks at completely different he knew what they would come on the earth and what they would leave it's not a time to stop and get mad at God because we have troubles it's time to stop and commit our troubles to God and say God you promised that you'd get me over this mountain you take me through this valley hallelujah are you getting when a man is inspired and he reached the reeds he inspired words the two inspirations together gives a result I want to read that again when a man is written spired and he reads the inspired word the two inspirations together gives a result no matter how well did you study the work it'll never do you any good till you're inspired yourself how many of you have ever in the morning you've just got an issue coming that day and you come to your you come to your daily Scripture and write laid before you is the answer I'll never forget I was in I was in an airport one day and I was standing there and they had canceled my flight I was standing there and when they canceled my flight they told me they said you're going to be several hours before you'll be able to leave I was young and tribal didn't understand everything just because you're a passenger don't mean you can fly the plane don't mean that you can make the scheduled you're just at their mercy and so I was kind of aggravated about it I was kind of like you aggravated about some of the situations that had found myself in I walked man I walked into a store walked into a little bookstore there I walked up to a certain religious counter I was looking it was books all away from the ceiling to the one and I just looked right straight in front of me and I pulled a little old bitty book out and I opened it up to a certain page and this certain page it was the right hand side of the page said you're standing in the airport and they cancelled your flight and you think god don't know you're standing there he's got a plan in your life I bought the book I bought the book I don't know about you but sometimes I'm driving down the road and there's a scripture up on the up on the sign I don't know who had the inspiration to put it there but sometimes the scripture on that sign responds to the need that I got going on right now sometimes I'm listening to enlighten on the radio and all of a sudden they're singing a song I'm a soldier in the army of the Lord what we need today is an inspiration over us God's sweeping down with a new inspiration breathing over us his power his love and himself that might inspire us to quicken and awaken us to his word and then the word being brought into that spirit of inspiration then you'll see miracles happen and things play take place because - just comes together listen some miracles you can measure by a wheelchair or cancer being set free but some miracles are just daily miracles some miracles are just daily miracles not earth-shaking but you know that you know that God worked that out somebody ought to help me preach right here you know that you know that you know that God worked that out this is either the word of God or it's a deceiving book it's either right or it's wrong every word of God is inspired or none of them is inspired we heard about a woman that she sent away to her son a letter and he was in Bible School and she sent this letter and told him that she had cancer didn't have long to live and she just kind of sent some things along that look that thing and don't you don't need to come home and that kind of a thing and just told him she didn't have long to live remember her in prayer I'm not going into all that but it heretofore but let's fill in the blank read the random said there was some sisters from a local church came back down to see her and they believed that God would confirm his word and and they had a pastor that would come and anoint with all and she'd get well so she said yes sure and so that pastor came anointed her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he read to her from mark chapter 16 and the words in Isaiah 53 and she just got well her son came about six months later and they begin to talk and have a discussion and he's coming home from Bible School in seminary and he said by the way mom I got a letter about six months from a gold from you that that you were sick and nine to death and she said yes and she began to fill in the blank for him that Amanda that sisters came and the pastor came and anointed me with all and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I get well and he said well mom we learned in the seminary that those words are not inspired and she started dancing all over the place and and he finally got her settled down and he said she said what's wrong mom she said he Majan dis if God could do that with the uninspired part imagine what he could do with the inspired part you know there was a woman that would showed up at a Baptist Church she was a little bit emotional I shared this at Saskatoon and she was a bit emotional and she was sitting back there and the preacher said something good enough for an a man and she screamed amen and the D contact us if we don't do that here that's for a while she said hallelujah wasn't no wonderful and the big contactor again said we don't do that here and after a while she's saying praise the Lord hallelujah and they told her said you got to settle down and after a while she was beyond help and he walked over said what in the world's wrong with you she said I got the Holy Ghost he said you didn't get to hear one more to go with that brother Graham said him that this couple that had a daddy that was one of them you know one them full of the Holy Ghost status and he was all the time emotion they were steeping him in their home and he'd get emotional he'd get to read in his Bible and he did the shouting and he'd get to dancing you know what we ought to be doing and they'd get to dance and he'd get to shouting and they were going to have a social that's their house and they thought well you know we got to do something daddy so they took him up in need they took his Bible and they took his books and and then they put him up in the attic and have give him a chair where he'd be comfortable and they were having their social party going almost sudden there's a party going on upstairs and and she went up and she said daddy I your Bible I took your books what in the world cost you be emotional he said I got to look it around here and I got this book here that tells me about oceans and it says that there's no bottom they can't find the bottom to some of those oceans and the scripture said that God casts my sin into the bottom of the sea Alleluia don't you love the Lord because I live you shall live also my life will be in you the works that I do you'll do also the church has got to get to that place too and he promised it would do it and it will it's got to come that way that's what takes place we got to be that way wouldn't it would be wonderful if all the people could just take that attitude don't question if God said so that settles it well brother on that's easy for you to say really God tells me I'm his son that should settle the issue of the wrestling match so how many times that's the enemy wrestle with you you're back sweet God don't love you come on somebody preach with me if you two prayed more if you'da studied more if you don't you didn't feel nothing tonight you almost went to sleep in church really well you're in good company you didn't get nothing out of church just wait a little more not I'm gonna go right back tomorrow night believe that God's gonna come down and feel my cup so full it'll overflow down though through the saucer down over the table now we get what we expect we get what we expect are you with me same church few weeks later we didn't have to come two hours early to get our seat but it's the same God it's the same God he's the same word are you with me we experienced something from with people from Pennsylvania South Carolina Louisiana all are you with me now and they came in they gathered and we were able to host them while Jesus came and spoke to us along the way we took from those services and he made us better Christians and strengthened for the journey but we needed to refill and so we come back and are opposed to booted are you with me tonight and we stand strong if God said so that's it if God said there will be a resurrection I don't need a scientific formula to try to figure out the timing or the date or how it's going to happen but this mortal will take on immortality and will be changed in the moment and the twinkle of an eye God said so I take him at his word and I believe it paranoia there's people in Israel looking for a messiah to return God will send them to prophets they'll preach to them the message of the hour that you and I have overcome in this day they will hear the voice that will get them ready for the Messiah the same as this message got you ready for the rapture and the coming of the Lord Jesus turned there in the first scripture that we talked about John came John did come you received John but a greater than John a greater than Solomon is here brother Branham preached a greater than Solomon is here 23 times God's greater than prophets he's greater than Kings is greater than potentates and he is the author and the finisher our faith he is the important one here tonight he's never on vacation he's never ladies always old to him and he's my god glory God said so that settles it if God said that did that makes it rot he's the final voice of all on earth of all authority he has all authority and everything God has the supreme authority with God in his words he don't negotiate he said wouldn't you like to live where you're just conscious that the unseen world is right with you all the time notice these words to realize when you walk out here and get in your car angels take their position by the side of you when you walk up yonder to that man so unleavened ly to you that the Holy Spirit is standing right above you and the angels are all around you the Bible said that angels of God are compassed our contempt about those I want you to just notice these words the angels of God a camped about those they don't go back to heaven they camp here they camp here you are better protected than Donald Trump you are better protected than Donald Trump you're better protected than Ronald Reagan or Obama or Bill Clinton or any of those guys you're better protected with a man that came here to church with us and you didn't know it I knew it but you didn't know it but he was a suit a Secret Service guard of the vice president of the United States said in his church for many years and many of you didn't know it he would have give his life for the president hey buddy give his life for the vice president but there's things he couldn't see there's things he couldn't see but let me just say this you my guards see it off ain't that good ain't it good take your neighbor ain't that good ain't it good ain't it good so the ladder that you two bumped your head on he moves you over the car wreck the mixed up doctor's report are you with me now oh brother on but you don't know what I went through you don't know what you've been kept from [Applause] we got schoolteachers sitting here too not in about 15 minutes they could give us a report on things that our children don't have to go through there's children live in horror stories and these girls are the best part of those children's life come on church your home is a home of peace and a blob and a sound man are you with me God provides food on their tables and he's given you so many good things around your life and he gives you stability you don't have to own ten million dollar house or drive a Mercedes Benz I want you to understand God is good all the time our children are blessed because we are blessed our children live under a token that watches over our lives our children come to church and maybe don't realize what is going on around them but this word is a protector this word is a sustainer this word is filled with phenomenal promises to it the Ron I can't explain it all don't need to just say I believe it they don't mean we're mindless bodies to wear that we've got no right to choose but I take God at His Word and I believe it give you one more example when you was a child you thought your daddy was the greatest in the world had the biggest shoulders he had the curliest hair every one of us had the same philosophy my daddy never lies he never tells any stories I hope he was raised in that kind of a home brother BAM said he looked up his father and he said I looked at his big brawny shoulders had two big long curls and he said he said my daddy will live forever you see he was a child and Jesus said except you become as a little child you'll not inherit the kingdom of ever all I know is this I've got an eternal Papa and I came from him and I'm going back to him and when I can't hold myself up he holds a hold of me and in the darkness of my knots that I have to go through when I can't see another foot in front of me I can't see my hand in front of me he's got ahold of my hand when I can't feel him and I can't hear him and none of my senses tell me that he's there his word yes word is enough his word is enough if I told you after church to not to meet me at the back door you know the kind of man that I am you found me to be honest you found me to be transparent you found me a man to not not be wavery and I made you a promise that I'll meet you at the back door and give you this certain amount of money when the service closed you would be under expectation to walk out that door because I've been honest I've been faithful I've stood sure now if I would make you that kind of a promise what about God what about God God makes you promise and sometimes I just wonder at this we in our crazy human minds try to figure out God and we can't I feel afford our meal tomorrow and we try to figure out God when we first started out brother Denny we couldn't afford what we had one time I I remember as a boy we were Kanye and I were up against it and I didn't have gas money to get get to even to work I called my grandmother and I said I don't know I don't know how we got here we're doing the best that we can but I don't have gas money to even get to work if I'm get to work I I'm not gonna be able to get next week's pay my grandmother said well I don't have any cash but if you pray I love these words but if you pray I'll go look in my pocketbook I love those words if you pray I'll go look in my pocketbook and she came out of the door and she went one of them it was all all excited all the time but when she came out of the door and she waited she was about five foot tall weighed about 240 250 and a good good good nice day and she came out waving that twenty dollar bill she knew it wasn't in there but
