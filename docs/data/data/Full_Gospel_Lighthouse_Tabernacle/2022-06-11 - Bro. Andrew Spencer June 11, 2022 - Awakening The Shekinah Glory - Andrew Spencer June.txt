their family they passed away this week in a home explosion there in ohio so just be remembering brother ray erickson and the church and the family there and all that situations devastating situation for them there we have a testimony here and we thank the lord for for this brother joseph amani our brother that's been coming from michigan here in the past couple weeks their six-month-old elisha was in uva this past week he had stopped breathing several times the doctors found it was due to an electrical seizure they placed him on some medication for it they did an mri yesterday and the findings there showed no issue on the brain and brother joseph wanted to thank everyone for their prayers during this time for them so that is a big deal for that little little elisha and that family there so we thank the lord for that amen we serve a god that can heal and meet each and every need tonight amen amen i'm gonna ask brother gabriel spencer just come lead us to the throne of grace this evening and we just believe in all things let's just bow our heads [Music] gracious heavenly father lord we just thank you for coming and being with us in this service tonight we thank you for the wonderful blessings that you've blessed through throughout the services last week his brother aaron was here and spoke directly to our hearts and spoke to many needs that was within the building lord we're just believing that you could do the same thing tonight and just use the minister in a mighty way use them in a way that can speak to the needs that are within the building and even over the airwaves of of the internet lord jesus as these prayer requests come across lord you know each and every need you know exactly what what is needed to be able to allow everything to go back in the perfect working order lord jesus whether it's a sickness or or injury whatever it may be just as you've done in the in the young boy this week is they couldn't find anything there in the brain lord jesus that is nothing but the working hand of you lord we know that if you if you were there death and sickness and everything must flee and lord jesus i just asked that if there would be any bonding spirits or anything that come and try to hinder the service or anything that may come by the way lord i just ask that you will just cast it out and lord jesus i just think that thank you for sending us a prophet that that you he could go and pick out directly what those spirits would do and and he would say it would be like a rubber band if it was a deaf person and it'd be a rubber band squeezing around that that eardrum and and hold it off from that person being able to hear lord jesus it is nothing but a spirit lord jesus i just ask that if there is any spirit that is binding the people i just ask that you will just loose them in the name of jesus christ lord jesus we hear all the spoken requests and we also hear the unspoken request lord jesus we know that there are many needs the lord jesus one that comes across my mind is there there is mothers that are that are praying for for a loved one lord and not just a loved one that that may be lost in a prodigal son lord jesus but i'm believing that that those mothers that are praying to just birth a son or daughter lord jesus that you could just come by their way and that spirit that binds that womb or binds the father lord jesus you can just loose that in the name of jesus christ lord because where you have planted a seed and said there is going to be a seed that will come forth no matter what to say no matter what satan says or no matter what the doctor says lord that seed will come forth and lord jesus we know the testimony of sister whitney and how the doctor said there was no way for that child to be born and now she has two i'm believing that those testimonies will start coming forth lord jesus and i just thank you for those things and i thank you for what you were going to do for us tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen good to be here isn't it amen at this time we're going to receive this evening's offering maybe brother donny would you like to sing one for us this evening amen we have brother donny come sing one for us and then maybe sister katie and sister whitney could come sing for us after brother donnie sings you come just lay your offering here on the altar after you've given you be

a hand clapper praise this evening hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Applause] hallelujah aren't you thankful that you're not alone but he's god alone hallelujah what a faithful faithful father that we have amen amen and it's certainly certainly good to know that in good times he's god but in bad times he's god and it seems like we constantly are going through things and trials of this life but he is always so faithful to be there for us in our deepest of trials and our and our deepest of moments he is such a wonderful god and he is mighty to be praised and uh just another note before we go forward this evening i want to be remembering brother joe green's church brother dean simpson brother joe's brother-in-law sister mary simpson brother dean passed away this past week and they'll be having a funeral this tomorrow and it's very quite quite of a sudden to them and so we just want to be remembering him sister mary was you'll remember her she was the one that played the played the organ or the piano for brother joe there and brother dean was one of the most quietest men that i knew but he was one of the most greatest men he had such a godly character about him and carried himself of of great dignity and was just a prince on earth and i know he'll be greatly missed and you know god's got a plan for our lives and also remembering the the collins family and brother ray erickson's church there true word and the tragedy that happened and you know there we know that the bible tells us that all things work together for the good to them that love god and not all things may be good but all things are working for our good and he's in control of all things and we just put him high above every thought above all of our ways and we know that his ways are perfect so we just want to trust his trust his promise and his plan and we know that he'll be with us even in us to the end of the world isn't that right amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over uh in in the book of exodus this evening exodus chapter 40 and verse 33 if you don't know where exodus is it's the second chapter in the bible right after genesis certainly thankful to have our pastor back with us this evening amen we're looking forward to what the lord has in store tonight and also in the morning amen amen god is so good to us and he is mighty to be praised trust you all had a wonderful week and amen i certainly loved having brother aaron ogles be with us last weekend and just just did a tremendous job and i'm certainly proud to call him my buddy i didn't know who was dragging who there for a little bit in this in his little skit he was putting on there but when he decided to turn me loose i i'm glad i didn't go flying in that piano so amen amen i thought that was just a powerful illustration and uh i believe that's something that these little children won't forget and even us older children amen amen exodus chapter 40 and verse 33 and he reared up the court around about the tabernacle and the altar and set up the hanging of the court gate so moses finished the work then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle and moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode thereon and the glory of the lord filled their tabernacle i want to i want to deal with that this evening on the glory of the lord and he said that that moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode thereon and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle the children of israel went onward in all their joint on all their journeys but if the cloud were not taken up they journey not till the day that it was taken up for the cloud of the lord was upon the tabernacle by day and fire was on it by not in the sight of all the house of israel throughout all their journeys let's just speak to the lord this this afternoon heavenly father we come before you lord you are a faithful high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and lord what a privilege it is for us to be able to come before you and to reach out and touch you lord and we realize that just one touch lord just of the hem of your garment it healed a blood issue father and maybe there's somebody here that has had a blood issue or has a blood issue in their life but i plead the blood of jesus christ over this congregation tonight and over their lives and over every situation and lord we just want to just cling unto you father and and lord may the holy spirit as we begin to feel you tug on our hearts lord jesus we we've not come here to occupy a pew father we've not come here to be seen of men but father we know that that we're in a very special and a very important time in life that men and women are making decisions even right here and their pews father and lord we know that there is power in our decision and we realize that we are put here on free moral agency but father we we want our choice to line up with your choice and father we ask lord that you would come and you would have the preeminence in this service tonight that you would begin to bless your children like never before father we've we've heard this word all of our life we're not we're not a people that that are new to these things we're not a people that have just come about but lord i understand lord jesus that we're a mature group father we are listening to the word of god daily and lord it would begin to get a little bit more than a man could handle if he began to think about in his own human ability but we realize father that you have something that you want to speak unto us and lord we realize the importance of going to church lord that you told us not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together there as we see the day approaching father so we realize that that you went to church father lord you had to pray so father we how much more as sons and daughters of god is it our importance to draw close to you father and and to ask the lord that your word would come and take the preeminence in our life forgiving us of all of our sins our mistakes and our failures lord and ministering to the lost and the bound father and lord we'll be careful to serve you and give you all the praise the glory and the honor tonight and lord may you be high and lifted up in this place in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen i'll let you have your seats this evening i'd like to speak to you this evening on awakened awakened to the shekinah awakened to the shekinah and i sent this this quote quotation there brother branham said the identified christ of all ages he said until you come in behind that badger skin and until you get out of your old skin your old thoughts your old creeds and come into the presence of god then the word becomes a living reality to you you see if you're always out there in your own thoughts if you're always out there in your own ways or if you're always staying out there you're you're going to have your own opinion you're going to have your own thoughts he said but he said if you can come in behind the badger skin he said then the word becomes a living reality to you then you're awakened to the shekinah glory then the bible becomes a new book then jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever you're living in his presence eating the show bread that's only provided that day for believers for priest only and we realize that we're living in a very very special and powerful moment in time that we're living in the fulfillment of malachi 4 and we're living in the fulfillment of luke 17 and 30 and revelations 3 and 14 and revelations 10 1 and 10 7 but we realize that there's a people that are fulfilling they're fulfilling that portion of scripture that is laying there that's laying in the word of revelations 10 8 through 11 that we are to prophesy again and we know that the bible has told us that we are kings and priests and we realize just to set a little set a little foundation that that at the the establishment of the tabernacle that only the priests were able to go in under the tabernacle and carry carry the burdens of the people but the bible tells us in the book of revelations that we are kings and priests and none knowing this that as message believers that this message that we have received is none other than the king's message and this king's message is not leaving us where we were it's not leaving us in our mind complacent it's not leaving us as we were it didn't we didn't come as we were and stay as we were but this message it changed us i remember when i got behind that old badger skin and i remember how that how that this message how that the message brought a new light to the book i remember meeting him face to face one night i i remember the day that he that he got a hold of my life though he saved me 2 000 years ago but i remember the day that i woke up to the fact that i always was a son and daughter of god and i though i'd read this bible many times i read it from matthew to revelation i'd i went back and forth i'd familiarize myself with the psalms but when i had an acquaintance with the shekinah my this bible become a new book i couldn't put it down my wife said there's got to be something up with him i don't know what happened to him out there on those streets but i i got a new husband and i'm so thankful that there was one that came looking for me even though i may not have been looking for him but he woke me up to the fact that he's not a dead god but he's a living god and i'm so thankful to realize this evening that that we're children of the most high god and even though we've got struggles and even though we've got carnal things that are constantly going on this message is moving us into a faith that we're that that we're believing for rapture it's it's taking us higher in our thought it's taken us higher in our worship and we realize that brother madam would say that there is rapturing faith that is laying it right here in the word and i'm so thankful to know that it's this message that'll wake you up to the fact that you don't have to stay here till the bombs drop you don't have to stay here in the tribulation you don't have to go through this chaos but there is a way of escape and we realize that we're living in a world where satan's got an agenda it's not just against the world but it's an attack on the bride of jesus christ and we realize that satan is forcing his agenda he's forcing his temps he's he's forcing his demons to try to influence the service and try to hinder and try to move you into your thoughts and move you out of this service in a way to take you out of this building and take you to your lawnmower or take you to your car problems or or take you to your financial problems but i believe that there's a force of the holy ghost here as well that'll make you leave your problems when you come in a door i believe there's a force of the power of god that'll make you move right into rapturing faith to believe that all things are possible to them that believe we realized that brother branham would say that national forest had put israel back in her homeland he said national forests will also put the world put the church in the world cancel the churches but he said it would be the power of god that would put the people in the bride he said the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward and we're not sitting here this evening as a bunch of elementary school girls we know exactly what we're talking about this evening and we realize that we are forcing or we are forcing the forcing the issue and standing here and pushing back satan is pushing against us like never before we ought to push back on hell and we ought to tell hell we're not going to stand back and let you run over top of us if hell's going to fight we ought to fight back as well if hell's going to lose every every power it's got against us we ought to lose every power that we got and not just stand back and hold back everything that we've been garnering all these years if there ever was a time to stand up and preach the gospel of jesus christ it's this time if there ever was a time to testify of the god that saves it's this time if there ever was a time to testify there's a god that heals there's a god that delivers if there ever was a time we ought to just wake ourselves up to the fact that jesus christ ain't done with us [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] realize that satan is trying to stop the very purpose of god but do you realize to to think about that that satan is trying to stop the very purpose of god i believe that god's got a purpose to heal you he's got a purpose to fill you he's got a purpose to save you and we realize that satan has got a purpose to stop or try to defeat the very purpose of god but if he could do that he wouldn't be known as satan the prince of the power of the heir he would be known as satan the almighty you see he would be known as satan almighty but he can't stand here as the almighty god he can't stand here as the omnipotent god because there's one that already has claimed that title tonight his name ain't some weak name it's the most powerful name that's ever been named on the face of the earth you're not asleep to the fact to realize that you're serving a weak god you have awoken to realize that you are servant the mighty god he's you're serving el shaddai you're serving jehovah samuel the lord is there you're not serving a weak god that's pushed back in the corner by satan the prince of the power of the air your servant el shaddai elohim rock elohim the god that created you the god that sustained you i want to tell you tonight church the god that you're serving is not asleep but he's woke up and looking over you i say let god arise and let his enemies be scattered hallelujah he's the god that created the stars he's the god that created the molecules he's the god that created you all blessed be the name of the lord most high isn't he wonderful isn't he wonderful now notice what what david said in psalms chapter 3 he said i cried unto the lord with my voice and he heard me out of his holy hill he said i laid me down and slept but i awake for the lord has sustained me for i will not be afraid of ten thousands of people let them set themselves against me round about and to think that david was in a spot many like you're in a spot tonight that david was in a spot when every it seemed like every gun was turned on him where it seemed like every every every enemy was against him but david said i laid me down and i sleep and i slept and i awaken notice when he got up he was just as safe and secure as he was when he went to bed he had not been suddenly attacked by his foes he had not been crushed by his own anguish in his spirit he had been he had he had he had woke up to the same enjoyments of life that he went to sleep with and i'll say this man is not the maker of our destiny man is not the maker of your destiny so even satan himself that cannot be the crusher of our destiny he knows where you're at god knows what you're going through so satan cannot check make god and try to say that this is your last move you can't strip god of his omnipotence but we have been awakened to the knowledge that god is our sustainer that god is our protector that god is our deliverer i'm not i'm not asleep on this matter but i am awakened to the fact that he is my mighty conqueror i am awakened to the fact that he is he is the same yesterday today and forever i'm not asleep on this fact i realize he's the mighty angel so every devil in hell is not going to be able to lull me back to sleep with some man-made idea let me say this to you brother branham said that the mighty conqueror is here he said and when he's here doomed devils are on the run i'll say this to the church of the living god almighty god is here and doomed devils are still on the run and there will be running hallelujah we are awakened to the fact that we are the temple of the most high god for the bible said in first corinthians 6 and 19 know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and you are not your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods colossians 1 and 26 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now was made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery amongst the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory you see god don't accept no fellowship outside of these words right here christ in you the hope of glory he doesn't accept the fellowship card he doesn't accept the denomination he doesn't accept the creed he doesn't accept anything else because it's dead and it's been pruned off but he does accept that christ is in you the hope of glory and that's what god is wanting to do like never before he wants you you're his tabernacle you're his dwelling place chicana simply means the dwelling place of god it is the physical manifestation of god and the tabernacle was the place that he came to dwell to realize tonight that he's willing to have the preeminences in you you realize that what he has spoken he is the god that created it and he is the god that said it was good so if he said it he will be that if he said let there be light there had to be light or he wasn't god so he's the god that performs the word and that's exactly what he's wanting to see his children acting like the father you see the reason why you can say that your body is the temple or your body is the tabernacle of the holy ghost is because the dynamics are there is that right it ain't just good enough just to have the mechanics it's not just good enough to sit there and know all the scriptures or know all the dates and know all the quotes but you gotta have the dynamic power of the holy ghost you can't separate one from the other but you cannot make this run you cannot make this message work without the dynamics of the holy ghost you realize that when you go to reading over genesis that there was a guy that was much like some of you he had the name of he was a he was a shyster he was a liar you know who i'm talking about don't you i'm talking about jerry oh wait a minute i'm talking about brother fred no i'm talking about jacob he was a shyster he was one that could pull something over on he'd pull it over on his brother he pulled it over on his father he'd pull the wall over his own father-in-law laban back there but you know when you find that in the bible that jacob was traveling in genesis 28 that you'll find that genesis that jacob was traveling from beersheba to her on and when he got over there the bible said that he found a place and he lifted off that he laid himself down to sleep now here i've never been in that country before but the bible declares to us that jacob made his pillow out of stones now i've not been over there they must have they must have the softest stones i ever that i've ever that i've ever that you ever could imagine but here jacob i can't imagine sleeping all night on the back of a rock but if you'll catch a spiritual revelation of it you'll find yourself sleeping on a stone but jacob is there and he's laying he's laying there and he goes to sleep and the lord visited him in a dream he visited him in a dream and there was a ladder that was hooked that was hooked on earth and it and they came and hooked on earth and there it was hooked in heaven and there was angels ascending and descending and the lord was at the top of that ladder and the lord spoke unto him jacob the land where you're laying i'm giving that to you i am the i am the lord your god of your father abraham and the god of isaac but i am also your god but the land where you're laying on is the land that i'm going to give unto you and when jacob woke up go and read it when jacob woke up he'd realize that he the bible said that he woke up out of his sleep and said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not i'm afraid that too many times people are just like jacob and they are asleep on the fact that he is still here they have missed their recognizing of the day and the message that they're living in but jacob didn't just stay there in his slumber or in his sleep he woke up to the fact that jehovah was his portion he didn't stay there or forget what lord what the lord had dropped into his heart and visited him by a dream what did the bible tell us that jacob got up and he built an altar and if there ever was a time to rebuild your family altar if there ever was a time to have the fire fall from god from heaven again it's time again maybe you could be like maybe you could be like elijah when you're standing up there with the prophets of baal and said maybe your god's a dead god maybe he's out there on a fishing trip maybe he's out there asleep why don't you go wake him up but they never could wake up the god bell because he wasn't a living god but elijah said go ahead and put put water all over this fire put water all over this sacrifice and let the god that answers by fire let him be god what did elijah do he was rebuilding the altar oh if the fire is going over your altar you can't enter entertain some strange fire and entertain some cold form of religion it'll never get you nowhere he won't get you in a body change he won't get you in a rapture but if you can get the fire that was on the altar [Music] it won't go out hallelujah notice this is the place that he's resting in where jacob is resting in he's resting right here on this thought and the place that you're laying in jacob this is your land as far as you can search that way as far as you can run that way as far as you can go that way and as far as you can go that way that land is your land it's not just your land but it's your offspring after you you see what is god saying to you church where you're resting at in this message of the hour is your inheritance for the bible said in isaiah 28 that with a that with a stammering tongue and another tongue will i come and this will be the refreshing of the lord those that are weary can rest right here that the holy ghost is your only place of heaven a place of rest it's time that you wake up and realize that god is here what did he do he woke up and he built an altar and he said this is the house of god and this is the gate of heaven what was he saying this is the house of god's bread if you're ever going to get fed you got to go to bethel that's why the prophet would preach a powerful message on why little bethlehem why did the god of heaven come to a little bitty town that was so insignificant why'd he come to this little town because he was the bread of heaven man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and any man that taketh away or added to him shall be receiving of the plagues that are laid here in the book you cannot have overcoming power and take away from the bread of life you'll never feed yourself on the on on this message you'll never feed your soul trying to feed your fire trying to feed your flesh but if you can feed upon bethel one time there was a reason why david long for that water there was a reason why jesus had to come to that little town because he was the bread of heaven what did jacob wake up to what he wake up to the fact that jehovah was his portion and that god was for him and for his seed that even though that even though jacob was hated and even though jacob was scorned by his family but because jacob loved the birthright god was saying i got a place for you and some of you been running from pillar to post trying to find your direction but god is saying i got a place for you this is the place of your rest it ain't in some man's ideas it ain't in some man's creeds but it is in the very word of god notice when when moses was given the instructions on the tabernacle in the wilderness you see the tabernacle it served as a place of worship for israel after god gave moses on mount sinai the commandments an ordinance he gave moses instructions to construct the tabernacle that this would be the place where god's presence would come as i said to shekinah the shekinah is the visible manifestation of the presence of god and that's what i'm i'm driving at tonight is that that we are awakened to the fact that his physical presence is here that's who you're feeding on that's the one that comes time after time and feeds your soul and ministers unto you and many many carnal people look around and think well that was just a man or that was just his doing but you'll wake up to the fact if our god ever gets ahold of you this is the lord's doing this is the lord's doing but notice on the outside on the outside of the tabernacle where it was surrounded by a white curtain that was known as the outer courts and out there in the outer courts was a brazen altar was the brazen lefer where the priests would wash and kill the sacrifice the tent itself was covered by by four separate coverings with with linen and them pure white goat's hair ram skin that was dyed red but the very top layer that jehovah would look on as he would come and condescend upon the tabernacle was that of badger skin which is the meanest animal which was one of the fiercest animals that there is notice that in that tent there was two rooms there was the outer eastern court which was known as the holy place and then the holy place there was furniture of the altar of incense there was a seven golden candlesticks and there was a table of the shoe bread where the priests would make it every sabbath there was a period there was a there was a layer for the 12 tribes for the 12 tribes and it had to be fresh every day or every sabbath it had to be made over but over on the inner western room was known as the holies of holish and to think that today that you're a triune being you're a triune being and how many times have you tried have you tried to please this outside how many times have you judged your christian walk by this outer court there's some days when this outer court don't look like don't look like a place of the tabernacle where shekinah is dwelling there's some days where it's raining on the outside there's some days when it seems like you can't ever get the fire lit there's some days out there when it seems like the sacrifice ain't copper cooperating with you they're trying to run away from you but there's some days when you move in to the to the to the inner room to the holy place but in there is the golden candlesticks if you stay in there in a spot of sanctification you'll stay there and get all smutty up i went one time there's a place in pennsylvania that's got a recreation of the tabernacle and wilderness and you walk into that outer court and you look at it and you see all the glory but you walk in you walk into the holy place into the first room they light the seven golden candlesticks and they burn the incense there you can't hardly stay there because of the smoke that is in the room you can't you can't hardly see what's on the other side of the room you can't hardly even see the furniture that is laying there because of the smoke that is in the room and if you stay in a spot of sanctification your life will become so smoked up that you can't see the purpose of going to church on saturday and going to church on sunday if you stay in a spot of sanctification you'll think playing tapes is okay and just live in any way any kind of way you want to if you stay in there in the inner courts if you stay out there you're going to have troubles storms are going to rise up and you'll think well god don't love me no more i can't see his presence anymore oh i remember i remember how it was when he first got a hold of my life but if you stay in a spot of sanctification you'll forget those days because your memory will get all foggy i think where in the world is my god at if god was really for me if god was really for me he'd move on this situation if god was really for me he would drive away this cancer out of brother ron's life or he'd drive the cancer out of sister erica's parker's life or this that one or the other that's dealing with certain things you see you're living in a spot where you can't see the purpose of god you watch somebody they're always up against it or they never can't figure out the way why's god a god got to do it this way or why has it got to come this way they never went far enough yet but if you can walk if you can walk just a little bit further don't stop don't stop in your experience in just the holy place move on a little bit further you see everything had to be in order and when you move over in into the holies of holies there was a curtain that was separating there was a curtain that was separating the holy place from the holies of holies and there was only one piece of furniture that was in that room and you think about all the materials where where moses is telling telling all these tribes you get this one from that one you go you build it according to this there's only one piece of furniture in there because god only wants your attention on him he don't want your attention on what the world's going he don't want your attention on what russia's doing he don't want your attention on what biden's doing he's wanting your attention solely on him in there was only one piece which was the ark of the covenant but on the inside of that ark of the covenant what's the two tables or stones that held the commandments of almighty god on the inside of that ark of the covenant was the golden pot full that was full of the manna that rained down and every priest that would come into there and was able to partake of the original manna that fell down on the very first day oh i want to preach to you right there every person sitting here has the ability to feast on the original manna that fell down on the day of pentecost it's the same as it was 2 000 years ago it don't get old in there it don't get rotten in there it don't give wiggle tails in there because it's housing the shekinah glory [Applause] we say brother andrew [Applause] there's no way that i could ever live this kind of message there's no way that i could ever beat to a prophet's drum like that my life if you could take a look at my life it ain't nothing i've been so dried up i look like a cactus all you needs a little bit of water i'll tell you what if god ever gets a hold of your life you'll be amazed at what you do in this world you'll be amazed how you act they put aaron's rod that was nothing but a dry old stick they put it in that ark of the covenant and when the kind of glory would come down it blossomed exactly like it was in the very beginning and yo you may be we'll know you may be dark you may have sinned stacked up against your life you think there's no way you let the shekinah come over your life and you'll show exactly what you were to show in the very beginning because he is the life that was only allowed you can go back and study the scriptures through leviticus powerful studies but the high priest and you know these things that i'm i'm going through these things again for a purpose but the high priest is only allowed to go in there one time a year and you get the joy of coming into it day after day after day after day [Applause] we said well i don't know about that if you're god's tabernacle do you realize brother branham said that god goes to church every day and you can't hardly show up once a month but god if god is your tabernacle if you are the tabernacle of almighty god brother the brother random said that god goes to church every day he's living in you and expressing out of you his godhead deity showing again that god is alive living in this mortal flesh [Applause] [Music] this high priest you know the stories you know the scriptures he had to be dressed right he had the head to oil dripping off of him he had to have the blood that was touched on his ear touched on his hand and touched on his foot showing that when you walk into the presence of almighty god you've got to hear through the blood you've got to do actions through the blood and you've got to walk with the blood and he's walking he's walking and he's got his priestly garments on he's carrying the ephod on his shoulders with two onyx stones and when he's walking in there on those arnic stones is the name of the tribes of the children of israel so when the high priest is walking in there he's not walking in there alone he's walking in there with your name on it and the bible said he is the high priest of our confession [Applause] he's walking in he don't just stay out there where it's raining when there's troubles on every side when there's wars and there's rumors of wars he don't just stay out there he moves into the holy place beard is dripping with oil he's dressed right and he walks once a year once a year walks into this place and on the bottom of his priestly garments there's pomegranates and there's bells that are ringing out holy holy holy is the lord i think if a bail on a pomegranate could do it if a priest garment could do it what the children of god be able to do he walks in there he walks in there notice the noise wasn't only for god but the noise was for the other people too because that was the only sign that the priest was still alive you say well i don't want to bless god you say i don't want to praise god i don't want to worship god i'm going to because i'm going to let the outside world know that there is a living god and i'm still living in his presence i'm still shaking and blessing his holy name in his presence he said well i'm not going to do it there's going to be somebody that'll be a king and priest that'll walk into the shekinah glory and know a player walking right dressing right living right praising his name right well if you study his message out you'll find that brother branham said he says in a way that that room was a soundproof room he said it was built in such a way that you couldn't pay attention to the lines on the outside and if there ever was a time to shut up the critics and shut up the people making fun of you and shut up the people that are saying things about you and saying things about your pastor and saying things about this message if there ever was a time to drowned out the outside world and come into a room and not pay no attention to whatever endeavor in hell is trying to do against this church and do it against this message you ought to let your bells and your pomegranates bring out one more time holy holy holy [Music] you get one time in his presence and you'll not pay attention to the naysayers you'll not pay attention to satan you'll not pay attention to his demons come with me i'm going over jesus that little tent is where god tabernacled that little place could you imagine as an onlooker coming over the hill looking over and saying what's that going on down there i'm gonna tell you what it takes a big place to put two million people at but could you imagine brother tyler coming over and looking over that hill and somebody said what in the world is going on what's what's why are those people camping out this ain't no time for camping it's a time to be moving and somebody said well you don't know what they're doing you see that tent there they're you're not gonna believe this but there's a prophet that got instructions on how to build this body i know you're not gonna believe this but that's where what's that dinky looking tent out there and it's covered around by them curtains what are they so scared about you don't realize but that's where our god lives you got to be kidding me that's where your god lives that we carry our god around oh brother we don't have to carry our god he carries us he in and out on him an image but he's made us an image [Applause] and he wants your tent and you think what in the world's god doing inside of that little girl that's where god's living at and the rest of the world said why is she acting like that this the shekinah came down and the shekinah began to bless and the shekinah began to pour out she couldn't contain herself you mean to tell me that's where your god lives at absolutely you mean to tell me that he lives under the fifth rib of your heart that he wants to dwell there absolutely but you don't know him like i know him you don't know him like i know him let me tell you the first thing that god seen when it came down was nothing but an old badger skin [Laughter] some of the meanest people i ever knew in my life sitting in this message they ain't known as an old badger no more i'm gonna tell you right now you don't want to mess with us the way we are but you definitely didn't want to mess with us when we had that old stinking nature on us what was it it was a veil and it was hiding to the outside world almighty god and when they came in hebrews or john chapter 12 and and those and those greeks they desired to see god and they were looking at him but they couldn't see him because of the veil and they can't see him today because of the veil and they get confused and say that ain't nothing but an old badger skin it used to be on an animal but that is a place where god's wanting to dwell there's a lot of people that look on it today and said ain't nothing but a bunch of holy rollers but that's where god lives at [Applause] let me tell you you ever get good and woke up one time man you sleeping good you sleeping a night away you don't took 15 melatonin to get that way and baby you're rocking out some logs but all of a sudden your wife hears a knock or she here thinks she hears a knock oh hell ain't gonna keep you asleep you wake up and grab a baseball bat say hey wait a minute let me grab my glasses i can't even see who i'm swinging at i know i heard something honey i had that never that's never happened to me i'm just going by another story about somebody else did you hear that must be them bears again but you you you never get good and woke up like that you ain't going back sleep ain't something pumping on the inside of you you can take nyquil you can take zeke wheel you can take all kinds of benadryl but you're not gonna put that thing back to sleep you might as well go ahead and study the seventh seal because you woke up you can't put that thing back to sleep that body's jacked up because somebody has woke you up let me say this to you the reason why you catch this message is because it was seven thunders back there that woke this bride up and there's no way that no cold creed dogma will ever put this bride back to sleep we've been woke up shook up and there's something pumping on the inside of this body i'm waking to the fact that the shekinah wants this body that doesn't kind of wants to live here that she kind of wants to pour out it's the greatest place to rest at but it's the greatest fact to wake up to that is the same yesterday today and forever that was a type the tabernacle was a type of christ coming to dwell in you he said well there's no way i can live this but i want to tell you he's your waymaker because the bible said in hebrews 9 11 but christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and of calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats and ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh and we i i absolutely love studying on the tabernacle of the wilderness but hegei chapter 2 tells us that the glory of the former will be greater than the glory of the former and to think that tonight that as great as the tabernacle of the wilderness was to think about the tabernacle of the man jesus christ they ain't never been a man like this man there's never been anybody walking shoe leather like this one there's never been anybody that could lay hands on a sick like this one so you you ask you ask this question who's the one that's doing the work amongst us it's got to be the one in this tabernacle again now notice notice but dwight moody said this he said the moment that moses finished the work the moment the moment that he finished the work the moment that the tabernacle was ready the cloud came down the shekinah glory came and filled it so that moses was not able to stand before the presence of the lord and dwight moody said i believe firmly that the moment that our hearts are empty to pride selfishness and ambition and self-seeking and everything that's contrary to god's law the holy ghost will come and fill every corner of our hearts but if we are full of pride and conceit and ambition and self-seeking pleasures in the world there's no room for the spirit of god i believe many a man's praying to god to fill him when he's already full of something else he said but before we pray that god would fill us he said i believe we ought to pray that he empty us i believe that cs lewis said god can't feel you if you're full of yourself but this is the human flesh that deities want to dwell in again to think this is a tabernacle where god wants to dwell he wants your tent he wants your 16 elements he wants your heart he don't need your money he don't need your stinking attitude he don't need your abilities he just wants your heart sampson gave everything away he gave his power to god he gave his strength to god but he gave delilah his heart if he would have simply gave god his heart they never could have been able to whip him and if they sisters if you sisters ever allow the enemy come to take your nazarite vow away from you let me move on the veil the veil hid to the outside world what was laying there you see there's where god dwells at is in his church that's laid up in accordance to his word and the bible tells us that god is dwelling in earthen vessels and paul would say that we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us to think about what a power that you have that you have this treasure in earth and vessels what i love about i absolutely love that scripture second corinthians 4 7 that that we have this treasure it's the greatest treasure you'll ever find young people it ain't gold and ain't silver jesus said put your treasure up where man can't steal it and rust can't corrupt it but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the power the excellence should be a power of god and not of ourselves how many believe that how many believe that you have this treasure in earth and vessels so when you go through some stuff are you able to say we have this treasure because paul said that we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we're persecuted but not forsaken we're cast down but not destroyed but we're always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our glory to god to think that tonight that you have a part of almighty god living on the inside of you you remember brother branham talking about that chinese laundromat how we would come over here he said it was a great contract that they had he said even better than what we've got today he said because man can forge statements that they write out on letters he said those men they'd come over here and they'd take that piece of paper and before you could you take your dirty clothes in there and before you could get them back the ticket had to match up so they would rip it and when you come in there if you didn't have the right parts you couldn't get your clothes back but if you had the right part you get your dirty clothes back clean again and he said up there on galgotha he said god tore his only son apart he said but he sent down his son he sent down his spirit to live in you he said and now we're watching the two parts of the contract come back together he said jehovah of the old testament was jesus christ of the new and he matched every old prophecy that was laying there and he said everything within me is testifying that this message of the hour matches everything you realize tonight that you've got a part of heaven living on the inside of you i got the message of the hour in me it ain't on the outside it ain't on tapes and books god wants your heart see we're not living under we're not living under the light of luther's day or wesley's day we're living under the light not even the light of a pentecost day we are living under bride time and when jesus was standing there he told them he said in vain do you worship me if you're going to worship god you've got to worship him in spirit and in truth true worship comes from the heart true worship is a giving is a giving worship expecting nothing in return it is more blessed to give than it is to receive but too many people got their hands out today wanting to receive without giving anything but gee let me move on jesus said that in vain do you worship me teaching for doctrines the traditions of men and he said by that you've made the word of god no effect he said so if i come to preaching to you a methodist message he said it won't have no effect on you he said because this is bride time he said but if there's a predestinated seed that has come to this moment it's got to be watered with the same with the same water that is under the anointing that it's in so you can't water this message seed with some cold baptist idea you can't separate you can't separate the word and the spirit because they're one and neither can you separate us from the message because we are a part of the message let me move on i'm going to drop a few quotes right here he said the shekinah he said it ripens a showbread that we feast on and drive across the country for hundreds of miles he said it's the believer's food it's only for a believer remember the show bread was only for believers only the shoe bread seed he said what does it do that's the kind of glory over the shoe bread keeps it from spoiling again he said what's this economy this kind of glory today he said it's to break beyond the veil to see who god is standing before you the pillar of fire he is veiled in human flesh but what does this kind of what does the shekinah what did it do he said the showbread seed the word that we're to live in this day by these promises the shekinah glory ripens that shoe bread and brings it to pass and makes it bread to the believer that laid there in the pages of the bible year after year the word for this age so if he said it i believe it so if he said it it's got to come to pass he said he would come and his promises is equal to his presence again he said but what does it do in this last day what is it to reveal to bring forth what malachi 4 to do it's to turn back the people from the stump from that stumbling block to break down the traditions and reveal the bread with the sakana glory watch it ripen and produce just exactly what it said it would do the shoe bread of this h so you can take this message and you can stick it out on your own island but without the shekinah it'll never work and there's men that try to push it off and say you can do this or if you follow this well i'm just going to stay home i'm just going to do it this way or i'm going to do it that way it'll never produce john 14 and 12. but if you fall in line with the shoe brand of this day and it's only for believers you'll never be able to eat on the unfailing body of the word if you're an unbeliever but if you're in line with the word that shoe bread and the shekinah glory meeting up together will produce the same works that jesus did it'll produce the same faith that jesus had it'll produce the same works because you are a believer and you may not be able to figure out how in the world i can do that how in the world i can lay hands on a sick how in the world can brother joseph get better how in the world can this one overcome this one and how can this one overcome this sickness but the shekinah coming behind the message will make it work out exactly what he said there you see you're not alone but you're walking into an atmosphere where the presence of the lord is you're not the shekinah cannot be separated the dynamics will not come to a tabernacle that's not feeding on the mechanics notice he said you get the people in the right kind of atmosphere and all kinds of things will happen you see if you're out there in the outer courts nothing's going to happen for you if you're out there in sanctification it may you may get a glimpse of it the curtain may open just a little bit but you've not went on far enough he said but it takes the atmosphere it takes the atmosphere of the people to create the miracles i got one quote that i i got to drop to you and then i'm gonna then i'm gonna i'm gonna close out grab your purse you ain't got grab a jacket it's hot outside but i know you're getting ready resurrection power just went through the body he's a closing i'm gonna preach that one these days i'm a closing we'll have ourselves a shout meeting won't we notice he said the constant words of jesus said fear not he said i'm he that was dead and alive and again alive forevermore he said fear not he said get that atmosphere around you get the atmosphere he said now he's he said well now he's a methodist or he's a oneness he's a trinitarian he's this under the other get that out of your mind i love him he's my brother she's a catholic she's a prostitute she's a protestant get that out of your mind get an atmosphere around you that you'll never do you'll never do it standing out there in this other court you've got to come into christ first and live in his presence there's certain people that you absolutely love to be around because it's an atmosphere that to create and that's what he's trying to drive get this kind of atmosphere that though your enemies may be scorning you and laughing at you have the kind of atmosphere that the people around you can't even tell you're bringing your friends between your friends and your enemies get the kind of atmosphere get an atmosphere around you you got to come into christ first and live in his presence and he said the bible said that he that overcometh i'll give him a new name i'll put my spirit in him watch there's an overcoming first you've got to overcome these things in order to be in christ he said that's where the church is failing in one place overcoming overcoming temperance overcoming temper overcoming difference overcoming church prejudice overcoming hatred and many people tonight who shout and speak with tongues and run up and down the aisle and hate their neighbor brother you're lost yet that's hard to say but that's the truth overcome you can only you can only overcome when you say well you say well i'm meeting man of glory to god yes but look what happens from one day to the other he said you get the missed meal cramps he said come on up here with a man of fresh all the time where your neighbor treats you right or not you love them anyhow that's the kind of attitude that you gotta have to make the word of god come to pass [Applause] i i enjoy let me just drop this and this is free this is for me maybe not for anybody else but i i enjoy i enjoy revivals we're coming up on a revival we've got brother wayne lawson coming here in a couple of weeks we're looking for a great time invite your friends invite your neighbors invite your enemies it works i enjoy these meetings and i enjoy i enjoy going to these camps i enjoy going to this great these great meetings and watching the power of god come down i'm preaching these things i'm going to these things because i want to see one soul saved but everybody loves riding the ways of the holy ghost and they're living and you watch so many times today young people running from this camp to that camp and i'm formed on but you ought to be able to bring something back home some people are only living during spring and summertime when all the camps are really going on and they go two weeks without a camp and man god's not for them and god's against them what they got is the missed meal cramps and they're just feeding off of the atmosphere of a meeting but i happen to believe we're blessed people here tonight and we feel like we've got convention atmosphere weekend after weekend night after night i believe if you ain't get something from your church this is going out over the internet and if you ain't getting something from your pastor you're probably not putting nothing in but if you can get an atmosphere and create an atmosphere where the holy ghost is welcome you'll watch the spirit of the living god come like never before will you say my pastor don't preach like brother ron or my pastor don't preach like brother wayne do you made man [Applause] i ain't preaching this to you because y'all are the y'all my church so i'm gonna say this y'all the best day manners there isn't a message if you want to beat that when i'm going somewhere go ahead and try but you say well my pastor don't preach like that or my my church don't teach like that or preach like that why don't you start worshiping and why don't you start praising god like you're at a convention every weekend every service and you'll watch an atmosphere created where the miraculous can take place i tell you when you create an atmosphere like this that you feel right now this is the kind of atmosphere that eagles are born in this is the kind of atmosphere that cancer get cast out in this is the kind of atmosphere that young people get filled with the baptism of the holy ghost i'm awakened to the fact that god still god and his enemies are liars i'm awakened to the fact [Applause] you can have it in your home you can have it in your car you ask brother adam you ask brother matthew you ask us as a team you say well i ain't got that kind of job like that you got that kind of car like i got you got the same iphone or the same message that i got i play it all day long and when i ain't playing and i'm singing something i'm trying to get i feed my spirit and feed my soul and when you get to church church already began before you got here [Applause] bible said in jeremiah 29 13 i'm closing musicians ain't coming yet because i ain't done but i'm close but he said when you search for me with all your heart you'll find me and the bible said when you start looking at solomon's lover and she said in song of solomon chapter three she said that i searched for him she said i laid there in my bed and i searched for him i searched for him but i couldn't find him let me tell you something you're never going to find the lover of your soul just laying in your bed you're going to have to get up out of your sleep and get up out of your slumber you're going to have to wake up to the fact she said but when i arose i went through the city and i talked to the gatekeepers and said have you found my lover have you seen my lover and when i was a little bit past them she said i found the one that my soul longed for i'll tell you one thing church of the living god you'll never find him laying in your bed you'll never find him sitting there in your self-pity you'll never find him in your sickness you'll never find him laying there when's god ever going to do something for me you've heard a shot and you've got the oil but it's time to wake up you that sleep when you wake up you're going to find out he ain't a dead god you're going to find that he's a living god you're going to wake up to the fact that he's your sustainer he's your protector he's a miracle worker he's a promise keeper you're going to wake up to the fact ruth yes there's a spot when you gotta wait there's a spot when you gotta rest lay your head right here ruth and you rest right here on this i'm going to do the work ruth you can rest right here but when you wake up you're not going to be known as a moabitess you're not going to be as known as a nobody as somebody that was getting by barely you're going to be known with the one that's a mighty man of wealth he's not a god that's washed up or washed out he's my god he's a god of all my days i don't know too much about the gods or the sports of this world i don't know too much about the gods of michael jordan and michael jackson and elvis presley but i knew no i do know about the god of heaven i know this god and this god is willing to heal you this god's willing to forgive you i can't be put back to sleep i woke up to the fact that he's here i woke up to the fact that i'm not entertaining some man but i'm entertaining the angel of the lord i've woke up to the fact that i'm not called a moabitess no more but i am known as ruth the redeemed he thought you were worth going in front of all the public eye he thought you were worth going in front of everybody and the bible said there was one that was closer of kin than that of boaz but he wouldn't mar his own inheritance he said if you if you redeem naomi you got to take ruth and he wasn't willing to marry his testimony but god was willing to step out into the public eye and kick his shoe off and make a public testimony that i am a mighty man of wealth i am her redeemer i am a closeness of kin i'm willing to do everything [Applause] oh hallelujah when he redeemed israel he got the gentile bride i'm waking to the fact that he can't leave me down here but he's got to take me in a moment in a twinkling of an eye between the hours of six and nine i woke up to the fact oh it's a body change for the body of jesus christ you can take me to the graveyard you can lay this whole body down but on resurrection morning [Applause] you might run your race just a little bit faster than me but homer fraser homer fraser will be there charlie spencer will be there hallelujah christine spencer will be there your loved ones will be there and they're looking through the lattice of time saying run your race you have woke up to a message that will finish this gentile dispensation run with everything within you run with the king's message run with the king scepter don't let no man stand before you i woke up to the fact i woke up to the fact that my praise here is just only a type of what is going to be there i woke up to the fact that i'm going to bless him all my days i woke up to the fact that every devil in hell has got his guns trained against us but i can't go back to sleep and think that we ain't got enough power to shut them up let the musicians come i got to quit preaching you ain't gonna put me back to sleep on this brother davey you can't tell me god don't heal no more you can't tell me god don't save no more you can't tell me god don't deliver no more you can't tell me god don't heal cancer no more you can't tell me god don't fix marital problems anymore i woke up to the fact that i can't go back to sleep brother matthew i happen to believe if god met me up there on the streets of canada he can meet you in a church building i can't go to sleep on this fact arise thou that sleepless god wants your tent he's wanting to wake you up to the knowledge the deity's dwelling in you i know it's a hard fact to admit sometimes where the jerry but that's a tabernacle man i'm sure she can upset you sometimes but little rebecca's the tabernacle of almighty god it's hard it's hard it's hard to wake up and look over by a chainsaw snoring in the bed beside you and see god living in them let me go back to sleep on that fact but i can't be put back to sleep and think that that little girl right there you may go through some stuff i want you to know this that if god is your your everything [Music] your loved ones can walk away from me your friends can mock you make fun of you but if you ever get woke up it doesn't matter what the critics say about you doesn't matter what your family says about you it doesn't matter the storms that surround you you'll never go back to sleep because you've been awoken to the fact that the shekinah is living i'm thankful to know that it ain't just in one man but i'm thankful to know that god's got some tabernacles like stephen and chris short that when i'm in trouble that i can ask my brothers to pray for me the god's living in a person by the name of jordan martin that when i'm in trouble i can i can call on him and he'll go to prayer for me i can't go back to sleep on the fact that god has still got some prayer warriors that's willing to press through the pain of living on their knees all night long and calling out to god young people i want you to know this there's a whole lot of things that are going on out there in the world but don't get your eyes on it get your eyes on jesus christ and keep your eyes on him for he will be everything to you when you don't know where he'll be your way when you can't make a way he'll make a way he said i am the way i am the truth and i am the life and whenever devil's got his gun pointed on you you'll be all right you'll stand there that's the time you'll stand right there because god is here let me tell you my little girls if they get the baptism of the holy ghost they're sensitive to the holy spirit they're sensitive to the moving of the angel but if they ever get him i'm not worried about what comes in life parents it's time you turn your focus off of everything that's going on in the natural and turn it to the spiritual do you woke up to the fact that the shekinah wants to live in you i want you to offer your life for him once you raise your hand say god i want you to live and feel me like never before i want you to manifest yourself in this tabernacle
