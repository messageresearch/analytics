touched me it may not be a lightning strike it may not be anything that we feel even just now but Lord Jesus it is a faith that we have that that one of these days we will all be Lord and we're just believing in that balm of Gilead that you could come down and you could wipe just across this and and you could heal us of every condition that we are fighting but Lord Jesus more importantly I I'm believing in a in an Assad that you could place a spiritualized salve that you could place upon the people that if they don't see your word if you're if your word has not been revealed unto them Lord Jesus I believe that you could come just across them just now and you could close off those channels that Satan has tried to tried to open up and send his word to their ear that they would listen to listen to the things of the world and he would try to draw them in closer to to the the witnessing that he has done to the world already you would close off those channels and open up the channel ways that that would come from you that would come from you that you could reveal the word unto them and reveal that the true word of God and not not some tainted word not some word that that men have been able to taint and put their own man's idea of of how to do this or how to do that allow us to be able to come and just worship freely we thank you for for bringing making the change we thank you for all that you've done but Lord Jesus we're believing that our Kinsmen Redeemer could come down our way walk down our aisles this this weekend Lord and heal us of every condition that we are fighting go

praise the Lord amen aren't you so thankful for the peace of God you know I was thinking before Jesus left you know he said in the world you're going to have trouble he said but fear not because I have overcome the world and then he goes on to say and he says my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth but my peace I give unto you we don't have a man-made peace we don't have some psychological therapist piece we've got the peace of God within our very Souls regardless of the storms we go through regardless of the week we had regardless of how determined the devil is to get you we're covered by the peace of God we're sheltered you know people are there there's this big movement of bugging out there's this big movement of prepping they call it getting bomb shelters and having a place to hide and the bride her bomb shelters the wings the wings of Papa Eagle that's the peace of God we're not digging bomb shelters and we're not planning on staying we're planning on getting out of here aren't you so thankful for the truth aren't you so thankful for Jesus Christ that has made a way out and he promised he would not leave you here what a comfort to our hearts amen God bless you we certainly love you with all of our hearts it's certainly an honor and privilege to be standing before you and to share this glorious message that we believe with all of our hearts amen we want to just pray for other ones he's there in Ohio want to remember all the needs thank you musicians of the local body here we want to remember brother Randy he's sure going through a time but you know God knows all about it and it's in these kind of moments you remember that man that had the dream about the only one set of footprints in the sand these are the moments that he's carrying Brother Andy when you go through these moments and it may not be cancer it may be just the darkest Valley that you've ever had but it's in those moments that he's carrying you amen God bless you if you'll turn with me to Matthew chapter 13. and also Luke chapter 14 Matthew chapter 13 verse 44 will begin Matthew 13 44 and then Luke 14 verse 27. the Bible said Jesus speaking here and again the kingdom of heaven is likened to treasure hid in a field that which when a man hath found he hideth and for Joy therefore goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field again the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one Pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it in Luke chapter 14 verse 27 and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it lest happily after he hath laid the foundation is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man begin to build and was not able to finish or what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh with him against him was twenty thousand or else while the other is a great way off he senteth an iMessage and desireth conditions of Peace So likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath cannot be my disciple amen let's bear our heads in our hearts to the gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus for these moments in your presence Lord we recognize Lord Jesus that we're standing father in the presence of An Almighty all seeing all-knowing God we just ask Lord Jesus that you forgive us of our sins I just pray that you help us as you just speak to us along the way Lord May our hearts burn within us as we look into the scriptures father Lord and see our identification or so clearly and hear our name called from the book we love you with all of our hearts we pray you be with all the sick and needy bless this service for your honor and your glory bless your people we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you as you're seated with the help of the Lord this evening I'd like to speak to title this count the cost count the cost you know brother Braham tells us that he's made the statements before he said if I had the literal blood of Jesus in a charger or if he had it in a little bottle and it was the literal blood of Jesus how careful would he be and how he would just weep over the literal blood to think that this Blood Brother Stephen is a very blood that Set Me Free this blood is what healed me this blood is what cleansed me and he would take so such great care to not drop it or or to not break it or spill it in some way but he said how much greater is the purchase of that blood how much greater are the people that have actually been called out by that blood because we know that the physical ailments of the blood are gone but yet the effects are ongoing here we are over 2 000 years later and we're still being healed and delivered and filled with the Holy Ghost because that blood was shed now it's important in life Jesus speaking here in our text about how important it is to count the cost and he goes into the natural because we understand spiritual things by natural occurrences so he goes into the natural and he begins you know when you even study out history you'll find that many generals they were trying to maneuver and they would figure out how could they defeat the enemy they would have before they would meet the enemy in battle they would have to be certain that there was a good chance that they could win because they had the they had the blood of of men on their hands and when they would make mistakes that would be fatal so it's important that the cost would be counted and he said that when a person finds something of such value they realize that Pearl is of such value they're willing to give up everything else to get this one single Pearl maybe they found it on a certain piece of property and and people can't understand why they're willing why are why are they paying so much for it but there is a hidden value in there that only the person that discovered it is is aware of and they're willing to sell it all to get that property to get that Pearl that hidden treasure that's beneath the Earth now in this world we live in we all have to deal with finances and jobs and bills and we all have bills and we've got to figure out in a lot certain budgets and you know that's the problem that's what a lot of times you know what happens with with world economies is that people start spending more than they're getting in and they're not counting the cost of if I can't afford this now I'm not here to preach finances to you but there's a spiritual parallel of the natural versus the spiritual and that's what's wrong with our generation is that when something is always I'm not talking about gifts but when someone has a lifestyle just gets things handed to them that never appreciate it because it didn't cost them anything so the first time they may be a preach though they appreciate and then the second time they appreciate a little less and the next time and the appreciation wears off and then they begin to look for what we call handouts and you can't get them to go back to work you see because they they never worked for it and they don't appreciate the value of it we look in the scriptures and it's a spiritual strain in the scriptures that we're going to look and follow and we know that Abraham and and we all know the story of Abraham there and whenever Sarah after God changed him back young again eventually they had to die again so when Sarah died she he wanted a special place to bury her so he went and you can find that when you can read it when you go home but in Genesis 23 for the sake of time we'll just keep going but he goes and he approaches the sons of Heth and he's asking about where that he would like to bury his wife here and them men are trying to give that Property Brother Fred to Abraham for free now who doesn't love free property but yet this was something so much more than just in the natural temporal once Abraham was gone the land would end up being taken this was a spiritual strain within Father Abraham that he had because God knew that thousands of years later that that that would be the promised land and that's where he would become manifest in flesh and that is where that Resurrection would happen when Jesus himself rose from the dead the Old Testament Saints resurrected right in that area Abraham was buried next to Sarah and Isaac was buried there and Rebecca and Leah and all these different ones job was buried there Joseph it was so important that Joseph said whenever you leave here you take my bones and you bury him where you're going because he knew that the Messiah would come on the Earth and that that when the Messiah would come on the earth when Heroes they would rise with him so that was so important to Abraham he said no no no I'm not going to take it you name your price I'm going to pay you full price for this property because I want it written I want to make my borders sure I want the title D to this place not he said she said his mama said he needs the title deed and he wants to be able to go back to the beginning to where when when Isaac came along and Jacob came along they were able to say this is the father this is the land of my fathers right here I have the title deed to it here's the proof of purchase you don't get a proof of purchase when you get something for free you have a receipt when you pay for something that is how you can prove that it's been bought and has been fairly and legally paid for so Abraham had the legal right to this property he then could bury his dear wife Sarah there and he knew he could be buried there because he had the full he paid the full price he counted the cost he knew it was worth he knew the investment he was making he knew it wasn't just an investment of temporary Financial investment that would Advance his life here he knew it was for the generation to come and the investment that we're making as parents into this word we realize that this investment isn't just a temporary thing that we may leave them a little life insurance after we're gone or something we know that this investment will carry Eternal dividends we know that this investment will carry Eternal benefits to our children we don't know how long God's going to tear we believe he's going to come at any time you live like he's coming tomorrow but yet you plan like he won't come for 100 years you want to plant your potatoes as they said you want to still plan because there's there's also there can be a mistaken you're you're so determined you're so waiting on the coming of the Lord you don't even plan for the future you got to be wise so you live like he's coming tomorrow but you're playing like he's not coming for 50 years but we have an eternal investment in this word we think of Ruth and Boaz Boaz was a very rich man but you know Boaz was willing to pay the price for Ruth he had access to lots of Hebrew to Young Israelite Hebrew virgin girls that he could have taken for himself as a wife but whenever he seen Ruth she was a moabitus she was a curse she came from a cursed Nation but whenever Boaz fell whenever his eyes fell on Ruth there was something brother Chris that was so he was so driven to get her he didn't care what it cost he didn't care what he how he had to put himself out there he was he he was willing to pay the price he was willing to Bear her reproach he was willing he was ready to put out his reputation his wealth everything that stood behind the name of Boaz he was ready to put on the line for Ruth for a moabite for a gentile he was willing to do it and he was willing to pay the price he had to have her he was driven to get Ruth regardless of every obstacle regardless of a nearer Kinsmen he knew he had to get her and he was willing to pay whatever it took Boaz had all the wealth he had all the land he had it already but he wanted Ruth God had all of Heaven he had all the angels he had all the Boaz had servants God had servants God has Angels God has cherubims but he wanted you he wanted Ruth he wanted a gentile he wanted Gentiles that ran around with clubs on their back he wanted Gentiles that were Pagan worshipers when he was on the earth our ancestors were worshiping pagans we're worshiping idols and were Pagan to the core our Gentiles were not looking for no Messiah but he left all of Glory he left all the land all the wealth he was willing to put it all on the line because he wanted Ruth because he wanted a gentile that's what love he has for you he wasn't satisfied with just the Jews he wanted you in fact he wanted you so bad that he blinded his own children the Jews so he could get you that love is literally beyond comprehension you cannot we cannot comprehend now Naomi has a Redemption she's in there with Ruth but we cannot comprehend the love of that we cannot comprehend in Ruth chapter 4 verse 9 and Boaz said unto all the elders and unto all the people ye are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was a limilex and all that was Chilean and melons at the hand of Naomi moreover Ruth the moabitus the wife of Mahon have I purchased to be my wife amen Jesus Christ purchased us with literally his own blood to be his wife and all the people that were in the gate and all the elders well let me excuse me let me go back to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance at the name of the Dead be not cut off from among the Brethren and from the Gate of it of his place ye are witnesses this day when God saved you he did it in front of witnesses he didn't do it in a corner this message was preached in front of witnesses it wasn't in a corner he met an angel in a cave now there's righteousness in believing that just like it that God that that God accounted unto Abraham for righteousness his faith righteousness is attributed to you because you believe the story of the angel that visited the prophet in the cave and then he tells you the story and then he proves it the angel of God proves it by demonstrating it in front of the witnesses David a great man of God how many have heard of him you know David was a man the Bible says Elijah was a man of light passions as we are what David was no different you know David David had a lot of faults as we all do but yet God out of all the people in the Bible God chose that all the prophets and all the sages God chose to identify himself with the kingship of David so when David you know David he was a king and everything and and he decided one day that he was going to take a census he wanted to number how because you know God would tell him hey you go here and you go this way go by the way the moberries when you hear that wind when you hear me go by that's the time for you and he would actually lay out the strategy for David David would go up you talk about counting the cost and one King going against another and he'd count the cost and say God I don't have enough men there's just a few of us you know and there's a Philistines right there like grasshoppers they're like bugs out there and God will say hey don't worry I've delivered them into your hands you go this way when they go this way this way and you and you see them run you read the Bible you see how the battles happen so David knew but yet he always depended on God to tell him that's how God wants it and so David one day he decided that he was going to number the people and you know God don't want us to always have to figure out how he does things he don't always want us he don't want us trying to figure out now how is God going to heal me how is God going to bring my prodigal he looks so sinful she looked she's so far gone how God how are you going to do it don't take a census don't sit there and try and figure out how God's gonna do something let him be God because remember God works in a paradox it's past finding out how did Joshua tell the son to sit still how can you figure that out you can't so God don't want you trying to figure stuff out faith is about believing it's about resting now Faith is a substance faith is not just hope it's not a Fly by Night Faith needs a resting place and it's a place that you rest so you don't have to always you don't have to understand faith you believe and it's a revelation to you and that's what you hold on to so God wants us to depend on him so he began and joab withstood him he said God don't want you doing this but but David was determined to have his way and he did and that really really caused him some problems there was a prophet in the land by the name of God and the lord gave him whenever he did that God came to him through a prophet and he gave him three options and in first Chronicles 21 and David said unto God I am in a great Strait because see that God gave him options he said either you're going to have three years of famine you're going to have three months of defeat before your enemies or you're going to have three days of pestilence of plague and sickness so David said unto God I am in a great Strait let me fall now in the hand of the Lord for very great are his mercies but let me not fall into the hand of man that was actually a good response David humbled himself and he knew God is merciful so I'm going to let him decide My Punishment so the Lord sent pestilence upon Israel and their fell of Israel seventy thousand men and God sent an angel into Jerusalem to destroy it and as he was destroying the Lord beheld and repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed it's enough now stay now thy hand and the angel of the Lord stood by the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite here's another Gentile and David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the Lord stand Between Heaven between the Earth and the heaven having a sword drawn in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem then David and the Elders of Israel who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces and David said unto God is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed but as for these sheep what have they done let thine hand I pray thee O Lord my God be on me and on my father's house but not on thy people that they should be plagued then the angel of the Lord commanded God to say to David that David should go up and set an altar into the Lord in the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite now a threshing floor it could be indoor or an outdoor but if it was an outdoor like this one it was like a hard packed area and what they would do is they would bring in their crops and a lot of times it was shared by the community and they would they'd put their crops in their their wheat and they would just either step on it or they would just Beat It and it would separate the grain out of the chaff or out of the shut that's what they would do because the community in Israel in lots of ancient times they depended on farming so day and day in verse 19 and David went up at that saying of God which he spake in the name of the Lord and ornan turned back and saw the angel and His Four Sons with him hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat and as David came to ornan ornan looked and saw David and went out to the threshing floor and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground then David sets on and Grant me the place of this threshing floor remember the angel told him you go to oronin you get that threshing floor and you build me an altar in that spot so David goes up to ornament because hey he's humble now and he goes up and does exactly like the prophet said grant me the place of this threshing floor that I may build and altar therein and to the Lord Thou shalt Grant it me for the full price he wasn't looking for a cell he wasn't looking for a deal he knew he did wrong and he was ready to pay the full price for what he did that the plague may be stayed from the people and watch this and orange say to David take it to thee and let my Lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo I give thee The Oxen also for the burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the for the meat offering I give it all I'll give it to you you're the king and the King David sets on a nay but I will verily buy it for the full price for I will not take that which is dying for the Lord nor offer burnt offerings without costs when we serve God it's got to cost us something we can't come on some flowery bed of eat some dried out confession shake the preacher's hand and then say we have the Holy Ghost or just say we believe God sent a prophet and that's the Holy Ghost no you've got to die it's got to cost you your life it's got to cost you your pride It's gotta cost you your place it's Gotta cost you everything because if you're gonna lose your life if you're gonna gain your life you got to lose a life it's life for a life it's got to cost you something you can't get it for free now salvation is paid for salvation in that way is free is freely given but it costs somebody something but yet it's a daily cost to us to take up our cross and follow him so David was ready he said not without cost so David gave to ornan for the place 600 shekels of gold by weight and David built there an altar to the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the Lord and he answered him from Heaven by fire God answered David by fire you come with the same humble attitude and God will meet you by fire he will consume your sacrifice say Lord I'm good for nothing every one of us good for nothing Lord here's my life here's my future here's everything any question here's my entire future here it is I give it to you it's going to cost me friends it may cost me a job it may cost me my marriage I don't care what it costs I'm giving it to you right here and I pr I I I I shouldn't say I promise you God promises you that he will answer by fire he will consume your sacrifice he's still the god that answers by fire and the Lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof we're talking about the Tree of Life brother Fred after after God's judgment has been appeased the angel that was holding his sword above Jerusalem as the plague was going on and what was it seventy thousand men died he sheets it it's done now this threshing floor because remember after the full price was paid on Calvary remember when Adam and Eve sinned and they left the Garden of Eden the cherubimes had a flaming sword that kept away you couldn't get close to the Tree of Life but after Jesus Christ came and he gave his life sheath now it's come come the cherubims are calling or the tree of life is calling the Chairman's like push and go the Tree of Life there he is he's the way of access has been made again the Judgment Angel's sword has been sheathed to you you've got full access when these brothers get up and they pray over the request and you're praying out there we have full access brother Jerry to the throne of God we've got full access to his healing we've got full access to everything that he has for us full access Now understand because whenever they were bringing the temple back and David was dancing and having a good time there was a man that wasn't accessed yet and there was a man The Oxen stumbled and he just he just tried to help and his Instinct was to try and just touch the art and hit and help it so it don't fall he didn't want the word falling but he wasn't a levite because David was acting out of the will you've heard trying to do God of service without it being the will of God and it caused that man to die but now handle the word run to the word run to the Tree of Life now it's not preach the word for everybody but you've given access remember in in during the church ages the Dark Ages the priests were taking the Catholic Church took the word from the people and made it in a language they couldn't understand that's Antichrist the word is for everybody access it eat it the tree of life here you go here you go every every weekend these brothers they they get they trying to access looky here look here the Tree of Life look at it from this Angle now look at it from this angle isn't he wonderful the Tree of Life now it's interesting that this threshing floor that David paid full price for it was the it was the same place that Abraham took up his son one day it was the same place that Abraham was getting ready to sacrifice this promised son everything that God promised everything he believed God for for 25 years in a moment he was about to take him out of this life and at the very last moment God stayed his hand he said Abraham I know you love me I know you love me because you waited for this time for 25 years at 12 years 12 years later you're ready to take his life and that pleased God in the same place because remember the angel of the Lord told David you go up to that man you go up to ornament and you take that you pay you go on now see the angel actually didn't even tell David go buy it he said go up there and make a sacrifice Dave is going up there and he was getting ready to get it right in his lap here you go here here's all the instruments here's the oxen everything my king here it is but David knew it had to cost him something he knew he had to pay the full price for it it was a spiritual strain in David that place where Abraham went to kill Isaac is this same place the threshing floor where God answered by fire it's then a place after this even happened you read in the scriptures he begins to gather he begins to gather material for the temple but God said you shed too much blood your son's going to build it and that's where Solomon's Temple stood and God after when Solomon dedicated the temple you read in the scriptures what happened God was still the god that answered by fire he was still the god that the glory of the Lord came down they couldn't even stand to minister but oh that's nothing in comparison to hundreds of years later when another sacrifice was walking up the sacrifice that was willing to pay the full price he didn't just come just to get your healing he didn't come just to make you a better person he came to pay the full price for you he came so that we know whenever you read the scriptures in Saint John 17 and Jesus was praying he said father I will I desire this is a desire that he said that he had he said I will that they be with me where I am that's his desire for you it was the same place where our Lord was beaten and he paid the price and you might have made a a mess out of your life just like David did David was responsible for for the death of 70 000 men that's a mess that's some serious chaos but come to the threshing floor Christ Jesus and die out to yourself and be born again First Peter 1 18 for as much as you know that ye were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Jesus of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot that's what you were bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ because remember blood was the only thing that could pay the price for Redemption God required blood but who whose blood because everybody is sinful the animals were beneath that covered sin for a while but that was not perfect because the animal species is under the human species so that means someone above Humanity had to come down and remember when God in the order of the creation he started the lowest forms of life and he worked his way up man was a Capstone of God's creation in intelligence he was made in the image of God so when that man when his Masterpiece fell there was nothing above man but God he was the only one that could come and give his life but see you can't kill God so he had to become a man in order to die for us because you can't kill God in Matthew 26 Jesus is in the garden he's beginning to count Lacoste he's going through his ministry and the weight of the sin is really beginning to settle in here then cometh Jesus with him into a place called Gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here while I go and pray under and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and begin to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he to them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tear ye here and watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass for me nevertheless not as I will but as thou will I want to read a quote here brother I'm speaking said let's just think I can see Gabriel come down his great sword standing by his side I can see wood worm I can see the other great Angels Lighting on the Rocks around what was it a conference table was being set then that holy spirit of God as we see the picture of Gethsemane that light which God is light Elohim the self-existing one when he came down into his presence do you want to go through with this son Jesus had a choice he had a decision to make do you want what the angels are listening what it's going to be the result the whole world lays upon your shoulder do you want to pay the price or what do you want to do you can imagine the breathlessness of Heaven during these moments they knew who Jesus was they knew exactly who he was the religious churches of the day had didn't know who he was they called him the devil and all these things but they knew do you want to pay the price or what do you want to do you can come right on now without death their lays Calvary before you there they'll spit in your face they'll take you to Calvary all these things you'll die in agony with a crown of thorns on your head and your blood will drain out are you willing and it's Jesus and his Humanity had to deal with these emotions he had to deal with the with your sin and my sin being laid on him and he began because Jesus really died in The Garden of Gethsemane because that's where he died to himself that's where he had to die and have this conference with the angels and the sin began to be laid on his shoulder and it was so intense that the blood and the water in his body begin to separate and it's at this moment he could have been thinking about you brother Thomas feeling the agony of the hour feeling the agony of the sins because remember it wasn't just the sins of his age it was the sins from Adam to the very last one from beginning to end it's the sin of all Humanity was beginning to be unloaded on his shoulders and he had to make a decision what was he going to do was he willing to pay the price so you could be here right now so you could have a theophany and Glory so you can be healed he had to wrestle with this question he knew that in order for you to be with him like he desired he'd have to pay the price because all the Miracles and all the wonderful teachings and all them wonderful things that he did if come to this point he'll say father I can't do it it's going to be too ill it is suffering's gonna be too bad I can't take it Take Me Lord we wouldn't have benefited one iota from that but yet throughout the ceaseless ages we'll be with him because he counted the cost of your sin sister Cassie of yours brother Jerry of every person he counted the cost and he was willing to go that is how people send their soul their own selves to hell because the way has been made and then they don't they they look at it so well it's going to cost me this it's going to cost me that career or maybe it'll cost me what I've always wanted to do to cost me a million dollars if I do this it's gonna cost me so I'm just gonna be a secret believer I mean I believe it's the truth but it's the truth over there but I'm not going to take it to myself and that won't help you on the day of judgment I promise you that amen you've got to count the cost and that intensity of the sins coming right on him being transferred onto him because remember in the Old Testament they put their hands on the sacrifice and that would in type as an as a symbol set would transfer your sins unto the lamb and the the transfer of sins of all Humanity at that moment was being put on Jesus Christ in the garden in the Garden of Gethsemane he said let's see that conference what the conference what's the echo going to be all angels are standing around what takes place now the decisions made what is it not my will but thine be done oh you could just you can just let out a sigh of relief oh the Angels unfolded Their Blessings and began to minister to him then preparing him for that great hour a conference was set a decision was made I'm so glad of that decision aren't you so glad of that decision because remember Satan offered him the entire Kingdom without the cross and that was one of the big Temptations is that you can have you're going to be king of the earth and and you can have all these nations and all the glory of them but you don't and the you know what the best part is Satan is a shrewd businessman I'll give you all this and the best part is you don't have to suffer you can just take it you got to worship me but you gotta worship me but you just I'll just give it to you and Jesus said a gift thee behind me Satan he said he come and he suffered and took the hard rugged route he took the route of persecution he took the route of death he had to die it was the only way to pay the full price but living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away Rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh Glorious Day when Jesus was up there on the cross at his Boaz he was in front of a lot of witnesses when he said it is finished Heaven witnessed that he was dead the Earth witnessed that he was dead hell thought he was dead hell thought they actually got rid of him the Earth the Earth was so convinced he was dead brother said the son said I don't even want to Shine Anymore the Earth there was a massive earthquake had the nerd that the Earth was having a nervous breakdown because the great Creator was just killed and when hell thought they got him it was just the beginning because remember perfect strength is imperfect weakness so whenever whenever Jesus looked weak he was actually strong he was actually strong now Jesus tells us so beautiful a beautiful parable about a good shepherd because we know that pastors are Shepherds and God places shepherds in the church to watch over us but you know he's the chief Shepherd God sends prophets but he's the chief prophet he is the executive so he is the Good Shepherd in Saint John chapter 10 verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door and to the Sheepfold but clineth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he that entereth him by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep to him the poor to openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name you know you can have a herd of 100 sheep or 100 cattle or whatever you want to have and it's not that likely your number you'll name them all it's hard to sometimes calling this the kids around the house you get them just mixed up you know I mean it's just Rebecca I like to know it no you you know Wesley and that's just five just five but you know God has a flock so he's scriptural I have a flock Jesus has a lot so God has a flock too and he knows them all by name but he don't get you mixed up he knows you by name he knows your personality he knows where you are he knows your Tendencies he knows your Temptations and remember when brother man went out east I think it was in India or somewhere and he seen the shepherd leading all them sheep he was so amazed that he could lead an entire herd of sheep and none of them sheep were bothered they just had their eyes on the shepherd and that's how it is with us and Jesus we have our eyes on him so the Bible said or he says and he calleth his own Sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he puteth forth his sheep he goeth before them see he's doing the leading he's the shepherd and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice but he that is in hireling in verse 12 and not the shepherd whose own the Sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and they leave at the Sheep they're out of there because if she don't belong to him but the shepherd defends the sheep with his own life because the Sheep belonged to him in verse 13 the hireling fleth because he is in Harlingen careth not for the Sheep I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine as a father knoweth me even so I know the father and I lay down my life for the Sheep what beautiful words that he knows you by name he knows where you're at if you go missing he notices the Good Shepherd remember the Good Shepherd left 99 of his flock to come get you 99 is just a mathematical equation we're taught we're one out of a million so he left 999 999 sheep because he noticed you were missing and Satan might have tricked you right out of that fold and he said hey so and so is missing I laid them down to sleep right here and they're not here this morning because he knows you by name he notices a single lamb that goes astray and maybe that lamb he got separated by a wolf maybe the lamb was real curious and he left the protection of the fold and the lamb wandered off and in the morning the shepherd the Good Shepherd he wakes up because remember he's the door he lays down in front of the in front of the flock and nothing can cross and get to you except to go over the shepherd first because you you sometimes can feel like you're having such a awful trial God did you see this coming yeah he did God seen it coming before there was a world but yet the great Shepherd will get up and he notices you're missing and he counts the cost you think about it in our natural Humanity this shows how far above Agape Love Is a buffalo if we had a million sheep if we I don't think we wouldn't even notice one was gone and if it was probably like oh well [Applause] especially if you didn't know where I was at now if he's seen it you'd go get it you would do the right thing but the Good Shepherd ain't like this the Good Shepherd knows you're missing and he'll come after you he doesn't say oh well he says no no no no no I've got one missing and I'm gonna go after that single one and I'm gonna Risk Everything to get that lamb back and I'm gonna bring that sheep right back to the fold and I'm not happy until that sheet that one out of a million sheep is back here that's when I'm happy again so the shepherd begins to count the cost and he may have to to climb up mountains and scrape his knees and go through Briar patches and get cut and get bruised and twist his ankle but you know what he's on a mission look how many look at the great Shepherd when he climbed up that hill he was bruised and he was despised and he was rejected he doesn't consider he counts the cost of the danger but it does not affect his decision to come get you Isaiah 53 surely he hath borne our Greece and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed remember the Shepherds Brothers said they would get whenever the shepherd the Sheep were sick they would they would need Limestone and it would help them heal so to get the Sheep to get the Limestone they put honey on the rock so whenever the shepherd whenever he went he made the same Journey that he went to get your salvation was the same journey to get you healing he cares about your healing he care he wants you to be healthy in verse 6 all we like sheep have gone astray and we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him there's The Garden of Gethsemane the iniquity of us all but he has to get you there's no other way you may run from the shepherd for a while you know animals they can do that they'll see you and when they see you then they they run I've got a dog that does that praise the Lord but but you know he's not going to actually give up on this sheep you may run but he's going to draw you to himself and you know when he keeps calling your name he keeps wooing you you may be in service at the service at the service and you you just keep running and he's calling your name on Saturday night he's calling your name on Sunday morning and you're running a little further next weekend he's gonna be calling you again the next day he's gonna be calling you again because he's not gonna lose a single one he's gonna keep calling until he brings you back in the fold it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter if you're in a bar room it don't matter if you're in a house of ill fame or it doesn't matter if you're sitting in a message church for 20 years he calls your name and he won't be satisfied until you're back in the fold and then listen here you are on a journey once he's found you he now carefully carries you back to the fold of safety he is the door and you are secure in him I want you to listen to this he said brother I'm speaking here he said oh I want you to look at a beautiful thing here when Jesus goes to cast out a devil it's so little to him until he just takes his finger to cast it away his finger that's all he has to use oh Blessed Be His holy name he only uses a finger for the most powerful Dell devil that could rise out of the burning hell you name it what you want to cancer TB depression name it what you want to it's just the finger for the god that's it that's how he casts them out but when that's all he does he says but when he's got a lost sheep gone astray and when he goes to bring it back he takes it and he lays it over his shoulders the strongest part of a man is in his back and shoulders and he takes his strongest part not his finger but a lost sheep throws it over his shoulders and gently Bears it back to the fold God is not there to beat you he don't grab his Sheep by the ear and say why'd you run get over here he understands he'll reach down and he'll get you and he'll bear you on the strongest part and he gently he watches his steps as he goes off the mountain and he brings you back to the fold and when he brings you back to the fold he's more happy over you than over the 999 999 that never left because remember it doesn't matter how long you've been born again and how full of the Holy Ghost you are one day you are that lost sheep whenever it was it don't matter 50 years ago 20 years ago today at one day in your life if you're born again you are that lost sheet that he left everyone else for it to come get the preacher the minister is on a certain topic and he goes completely off topic to pick you up what is that that's a shepherd that's more than just the pastor Shepherd that is the great Chief Shepherd leaving the flock to come get you don't worry about that complex what that person said wasn't that don't let Satan tell you that come on back into Fellowship come back into church what is that that is the great Shepherd you know they have a shepherd's hook they call it no it's not yanking it's just leaning this way come back come back to the fold he's a great shipper there was a young girl many years ago and her name is Georgie Carter and brother Brandon he was a pastor in the church there in Jeffersonville I believe it was and he had a vision and in this Vision he heard a lamb blatant or blaton and as he was hearing it he was searching trying to find it but the closer he got to to the actual sound of the blatant he actually realized it was a human voice and it was crying out Mill Town Middletown and brother Ram realized he went back to church and he realized that he had to find where this was and he began to ask around and he found where Milltown was and there was a little girl that got TB by an awful circumstance and she got a hold of a little book Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and the prophet they would hand them these books out to build Faith to the people and she began to read this book and she was better written for TB for nine years and brother Brown was holding a Revival there and he was kept looking for that lost sheep he kept looking for that lost sheep now brother Brown wasn't there on his own accord God sent his Prophet down there the great Shepherd sent his Prophet all the way there for one lamb now there are many other baptisms and wonderful things that happened because of that but here Georgie Carter was her parents didn't believe in Divine Healing her church didn't believe in Divine Healing she was bedridden with TB for nine years and she still held the faith she rubbed the back of her of her headboard or bed post there in agony crying out to God to heal her the first time the brothers came to pray for her parents even left the house they didn't want to be around they finally agreed and then her mother got to pray and God run that imposter out of the area she was a sincere woman and as she was praying because she was sincere she's seen a shadow of Jesus on the wall with the beard and about that time she thought she didn't quite know what that was and when she got up here comes brother Branham to pray for Georgie Carter he found where she was and God showed him he was in the woods and he was praying for her and the pillar of fire appeared and he told him to go by the way of Carters that's what the angel of the Lord told him to do and he comes into the house and he said and I said sister Georgie the Lord Jesus Christ there behind the bed the little post of her bed she'd rubbed all the paint off and her church telling her the days of Miracles was passed she was born to be a child of God and there she was holding on to that promise God by his Mercy showed her vision and sent me down there that's where it was I said I know who you are you're that lamb that I saw caught up in this month a bunch of theology down here Hallelujah I said Georgie the Lord Jesus who you love and serve appeared to me up there on the hill a while ago in that same light that hung over the nail girl and he told me to come by this way I command the devil in the name of Jesus Christ to leave you I said rise up on your feet in front of witnesses and she stood up and she ran busted right out of that house and started blessing the grass and and playing the piano and she became his piano player in church and what does the Bible say about the miracles of Jesus that they the the the man who the miracle was done on was in their midst so they could say nothing so the miracle of Georgie Carter was in the midst of them and they could say nothing but yet God sent a prophet for a lamb and we could go on and on with the stories it even comes to mind about the Memphis woman she was a lamb crying out to God for her son now as I said serving the lord comes with a cost but let's not let's not be foolish here so does serving the devil let's not be naive serving God comes with a cost but serving the Devil comes with a terrible cost it's two different costs in Matthew 10 he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it in Luke 6 blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast you out cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake now watch this next verse because here you are you can be on the job or you can be at school and people are just you feel like they're talking behind your back and there's that girl with really long hair I don't know why she just don't do this that and the other I don't know why she don't wear pants and that's just so old-fashioned this that and the other and they're persecuting you now Jesus said that what happened but he didn't say give yourself a pity party he said blessed are you and watch verse 23 he says Rejoice ye in that day do you see the difference between the human mind and the mind of God you come home after a day at the work and the boss has been giving you a hard time because you wouldn't go on a sociable drink or maybe you wouldn't look at that something that maybe he wanted you to look at and he's just giving you such a hard time and in your mind you come home and you're just worn out from the persecution but then the mind of God said Rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for leap for Joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in like manner they didn't in like manner did their Prophet their fathers unto the prophets God will not in no wise be in debt to any man that's words of the prophet God won't be debted to any man if you don't if you have did that for God forsaken all God will repay you a thousand fold right God will pay it back you forsake the things of the world and the world and the things of the world and God will repay you so many times he says how many is a witness of that here tonight we all know that God will repay you know this message came with a cost too we can never forget that sometimes we listen to a tape and we get blessed and we're on the Mountaintop and it helps us through our Valley praise God we turn the tape off and go eat supper and spend time with our families but we don't realize behind that tape the friends he lost the demons he fought them hours he fasted the hours he prayed the hours he studied it came at a cost you know imagine fathers imagine this you know we sometimes look look at our children we're like good night where did the time go you know I seriously thought the Lord was going to come before Rebecca was ever in kindergarten and she's in seventh grade now but you think and time just goes by so brother Branham when he would have come home he'd be gone and that's right before our eyes how much more if you'd be gone for months at a time he'd come home and his own kids would be scared of him wouldn't even know who he was how that would just break your heart but if preaching this message came at a cost so we're living it but you have to determine in your heart you've got to count the cost that it's worth it because to reap life eternal and Heaven's Joy all the trials and everything that we face in this life and all the sickness and everybody has their own trials God custom tailors does that make you feel special God custom tailors your trials for your personality and for what he needs out of you and he and what he can trust in you so just because you're going you feel like you're going through a much harder trial than your brother and sister don't mean that God must not love me as much no take it as a compliment God you must really trust me you must really love me he would not put that trial on me if he knew he couldn't do it there's story in the scriptures about a woman in an alabaster box her name was Mary Mary of Bethany and in Luke chapter 10 he records it and it says now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain Village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house and she had a sister called Mary which also sat at Jesus's feet and heard his word but Martha was cumbered about with much serving and came to him and said Lord just thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone bitter therefore that she helped me and Jesus answered and said Martha Martha Thou Art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and Mary had chosen the good part that good part which shall not be taken away from her Mary was convinced of who Jesus was she was convinced that he was a messiah so she put all of her worth all of her savings into an alabaster box and she realized that all that she could put in it he was worth it she sold out to everything else she forsook everything else and put all of her investment into one great Pearl of great price called an alabaster box and she paid top dollar she wasn't looking for a sale this is no offense to anyone please don't take offense I'm making a spiritual analogy here we all love getting good deals and and shopping sales and things okay I'm talking spiritual she was willing to put everything that she had into one event Matthew records it in Matthew 26 verse 6 now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper that came unto him a woman having an alabaster box a very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat and when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor when Jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me for in that shift pour this ointment for it for ye have the poor always with you but ye but me had not always for in that she had poured the ointment on my body she did it for my burial she understood there Jesus was saying I'm going to follow my hands of sinful man I've got to pay the price I'm going to come back and here you have a woman who sits at the feet of Jesus and she hears all this and she receives it and she's aware that she's got to do something for verily I say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world including Elkton Virginia there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her now John 12 also records her the same event she also poured oil on his feet and it was very costly and the Bible says that the house was filled with the odor of this ointment now when you look in the order of the scriptures there in Matthew 26 you'll find that this event actually happens between the Jews we're sitting there trying to figure out how we can get rid of Jesus we've got to kill him too many people are leaving our churches we've got to get rid of him and then on this other side you had Judas who actually said you know what he snuck away and said I'll be the one to do it I'm going to find opportunity and I'll betray Jesus to you for the for and he coming to tid with the price in between that rejection and that Judas spirit you have a woman here they gave everything she had to pour the oil on Jesus she counted the cost the prophet said see this woman was so grateful that her sins were forgiven until she spent all of her money that she had and took an alabaster box and broke it and poured the oil and just odored the room with fine smell of this myrrh that she had anointed him for his death now see she did the service not knowing what she was doing she was inspired but she was so grateful to God he was worth it Jesus was worth breaking this box for it was a very precious ointment because remember once it was broken There's No Going Back she spent all of her money that she had on this one single event and when she broke that Alabaster Box sister Whitney the oil could not be returned back in the alabaster box it could not be it could not go and be returned for a refund this was not a pretended believer she got everything she had she invested it in One Moment In His presence she seized her moment and she not only bought the alabaster box to say look what I did she broke it there was no going back no matter the price or quality of the oil if it's not broken it doesn't do any good to have all the most expensive oh my alabaster box and the oil is so pricey brother Gabriel it costs so much let me let me show you the receipt look how much I paid look what I did for the kingdom of God but it's not broken it's not in service the body of Jesus had all my healing had all your healing had all your Holy Ghost had all your comfort had everything you have need of but if it wasn't broken what benefit would it have done you it had to be broken and just as the aroma of that oil filled the room now the aroma of his Spirit fills our lives and people can come by and they can get a refreshing in your atmosphere because of the aroma of the spirit of God that fills your life they can feel the love of God in your life the word of God has all the promises the full truth the rapturing faith everything we have need of from Earth to glory is right here but it was sealed with Seven Seals they had to be broken for the book to be open and now that life that Aroma is now broken in your private study that Aroma is now broken that Alabaster Box is broken and it begins to fill your life yes thank you Lord it had to be unbroken to unleash their power and potential may my Alabaster Box as I'm closing may my Alabaster Box be broken to anoint the head of my savior to refresh him may I spend all that I have all my time my effort my energy for a Divine Divine Purpose to bring him a refreshment when others won't may I if he needs praise may I give it if he needs somebody to believe his word in the midst of this troubled and dark lady asea May It Be Me if he needs someone to be thankful in their heart for what he's done for them Lord let it be me he doesn't just love me because I love him [Music] he loved me when I didn't love him he loved me when I was thinking of him he loved me when I didn't want him he loved me while I was yet in sin that's the kind of a loving father that we have listened to our feet when I had no thoughts toward him musicians can come when I had no thoughts toward him he already loved me he already counted the cost but for the foundation of the world and he believed that my soul and that your soul was worth it may we this evening sure we've we've given our hearts to the Lord we've given our lives to the Lord and if you haven't I pray that maybe even while this while this service was going on while the word was going forth that you have been counting the cost within your own mind within your own soul because remember the Rich Young Ruler he also counted the cost he was presented with eternal life and he counted well if I actually see Jesus said give all that you have give it to the poor and come and follow me he knew that's where that man's weakness was and that rich young ruler was not willing when he counted the cost he was not willing to pay the price for eternal life and chapters later we find him he lifted up his eyes in hell but may we be identified not with the Rich Young Ruler but may we have to be identified with Mary when Jesus is sitting with dirty feet may we be like that woman that came and poured oil on his feet kiss him and wipe him with the hairs of her head may we break our Alabaster Box in his presence and give him our all let's bow our heads to him the gracious Heavenly Father
