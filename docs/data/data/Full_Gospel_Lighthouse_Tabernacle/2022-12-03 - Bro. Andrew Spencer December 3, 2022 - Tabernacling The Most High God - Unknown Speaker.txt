don't want you to break that I want you to keep that same atmosphere throughout the entire service and I want you to let it build up and I want you to let it overflow and I don't want you to hold it back because I can feel it in my spirit that God is about to do something I know that sounds a little bit Pentecostal but let me just say this by the power of the word God is going to do something he didn't just come into the room just to be in the room he come here to prove himself [Music] he come here to prove himself I'd like to speak to you by the help of the Lord tonight on tabernacling the most high God tabernacling the most I gone [Music] and I know that there are many needs that are amongst us and I know that there have been sick ones amongst us and they are great needs right here tonight but I believe that you are the most powerful people on the face of the Earth yes and I want you to channel your faith just now to the needs that are in this building and the needs that you know of and I want you to ask God to come by their way your way and you that are sitting here and Desiring an outpouring of the Holy Ghost I want you to not reject it I want you to receive it right now let's go to the father in prayer Heavenly Father we come boldly before you Lord knowing that our position in Christ Lord is sure and steadfast father Lord we know who we are Lord because you redeemed us and we were yours before the foundation of the world and though we may have been slipped into or put into the devil's pawn shop Lord but because we were yours we have a ticket and a token in our hand father that proves to us that we're your children and we don't have to wait on the Shelf but you've already came and picked your children up and Lord we're asking tonight as we stand here as the ransom we stand here as the redeemed body of Jesus Christ and expressing that there is a God that is here and is amongst us Lord we want to put our faith in your word Lord one more time as We Gather here as a body of Believers now Lord we know that your word said there is nothing too hard for you we know that it is said where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them Father we agree tonight together Lord putting our faith to these needs that are amongst us the prayer requests that have gone forth Lord those that are listening by the way of the internet I pray father that they would fill the charge of the holy spirit that is in this room Lord let it be ever pulsating there in the in their home where they are I ask Lord that you would just manifest yourself declaring yourself alive like never before now fathers we take these these words Lord Jesus lord it's already anointed but I would ask Lord that you would anoint your children both speaker and hearer father let us step aside father we know that what we are handling is the very word of Truth and Lord we want to give the most Earnest heed to it father Lord we want to be careful to serve you and we thank you Father for what you're about to do in this place and we'll be careful to serve you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the Book of Genesis Chapter 14 verse 18 then down to Ephesians Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 18. he knows he said to the Lord is amen he's faithful amen what a protector that we have amen and we thank the Lord for his mercies that endure to all generations Genesis chapter 14 and verse 18 and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram or the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand and he gave him tithes of all Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 18. the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all may God bless his word he may be seated here in the presence of the Lord as you said we'd like to speak to you on tabernacling tabernacling the most high God and we've spent the last couple weekends on on dealing with blessed by the most high God and we recognize that that we have the great strong one that is amongst us the El elean the most high God and we recognize by by just going in review just for a moment that there is no God that is above our God there is no need that is above our God there is no no a weapon that is formed against his children that shall prosper and I think it's amazing that throughout the Bible that God would declare how powerful that he truly is and how wonderful that he is and I believe that God I would say it in my way that God isn't shy on who he is God isn't ashamed about who he is he's not afraid to testify how great he is he's not afraid that it'll be too bold or it'll be to to uh abundant or to to be uh to be to uh I want to use a word but I'm not going to use that word but it would be too it would be too much he's not afraid that he he's not ashamed to tell us how great he is it's it's not it's not that he would be bragging on himself he is The Great I Am you see if you are if you are the greatest you can testify that you are the greatest when Muhammad Ali was at his Elite he could testify that there was nobody that could beat him but as he got older in age there were other Champions that came behind him that had took on the belt and become the world champion of the world but there is nobody that has ever taken the title away from our heavenly father and God is not ashamed to call himself the most high God for even the Bible tells us that Psalms 83 and 18 that men may know that thou that thou whose name alone is Jehovah are most high over all the Earth so God isn't ashamed he isn't ashamed to tell us who he is but I will say this that God is not ashamed to tell who his children is God is not ashamed and he's not shy about his children he's not shy about his protection plan he's not shy about what he thinks about them that he has raised them to set in in a believer's position and God knows who she is and he knows exactly where she's at and there's nothing that can happen to her unless he's already seen it taken place or transpiring before the foundation of the world and I believe that gives us great consolation tonight as the children of the most high God to recognize that there's nothing coming and there's nothing going that God doesn't already know about in our life and to think that tonight that before Abraham got up there on Mount Moriah with Isaac God had already provided for himself a sacrifice and Abraham knew and Isaac was raised in worship and he knew he knew all of those things but before Abraham got up there God already had a plan and I'll say this tonight that when you come into this world God had a plan for you and there's no weapon there's no enemy there's no torment that can stop the very plan of God from getting you to your destination as a child of God I think it's amazing that that when Abraham was up there when he was up there on the mountain and God declared himself as Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide for himself a sacrifice that God made this Covenant with Abraham in Genesis 22 and 17 that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying will I multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed let's say that together and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice and to think that our great father Abraham the patriarch because he obeyed the very voice of God that there is a blessing upon the children of Abraham tonight to think that that your father because because your father Abraham decided to choose to follow God even though it was hard and even though it it may have hurt his flesh may have hurt his heart to go up there on Mount Moriah and take his only son a prayer but because Abraham obeyed the voice of God God told to him and blessing our blessing you see if you touch one of God's children there is an automatic curse that comes back upon the enemy that has touched you because the Bible says touch not mine on it and do my prophets no harm and we recognize that there is another prophet in the day and it's the Holy Spirit and it's living in a people that's so tabernacled by the most high God that Satan has always wondered where will she be at when will she come and finally Satan has an enemy Satan has an enemy as the blood of Jesus Christ that is fully adorned in the adoption wedding band has a wedding band on her hand robed in his righteousness and I'll say this that this bride has everything to defeat anything that Satan throws at her [Applause] hey amen if we're gonna be an enemy to somebody I want to be an enemy to Satan himself I'll tell you if Lucifer is going to fight somebody I'll say let's give him a good fight I think if we could just have a conversation with old Lou tonight we'll just tell old Lou you don't have enough to stop the children of God you see because the one that is on my side oh Lou is more than you could ever be the one that Tabernacles my body has got so much power that he can knock cancer out of my body he can knock sickness out of my body oh Lou I want you to listen up you can try withhold your might but the most high God is tabernacled in the body all right brother man upset here in the late Odyssey in church age he said he said these things saith the faith one true witness now I want to show you what I find what I find in the thought of faithful he said you know we often talk about the great unchanging God whose word does not change and when we speak of him after the manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonable he said it is as though God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then stood back and became a great impersonal God he said it is though that that God made a way of salvation for his lost mankind that they that way being the cross and then when the South when salvation or then when the death of Christ had a tone for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him God just folded up his arms and stood back he said it is as if we majored in believing in a great Creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation isn't that amazing that some people get that idea but notice what your Prophet said he said but now I want to say to you he said that's how too many people are apt to think but that is wrong thinking for God is governing in the Affairs of men right now he is governing in the Affairs of men right now he is both Creator and sustainer for the Bible said in Colossians 1 and 16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him he is before all things and by him all things consist he is a sovereign God by his own counsel he purposed The Plan of Salvation of his own elect which he for new so let me say it again that God is governing in the Affairs of men right now he is both Creator and he is both sustainer so to think that tonight if you've got Bruce Hills in your body that God can create eight new cells in your body if you've got an enemy that is that is robbing you or depleting you of your strength he is a sustainer of your soul now I was reading a little uh devotion with my daughters last night and it was talking about the creation of humanity when God created Adam and when God created Eve he's the the devotion said that there were God's fingerprints all over Adam because he was the one that made them and to think that tonight that all over your life there is in your destiny the Fingerprints of almighty God there is nothing that happened to you the car wreck had God's mind in it the problems and the and the money when it run out of your bank account had God's fingerprints upon it when you got sick and he thought you wasn't going to make it God had his fingerprints upon it if you were his but for the foundation of the world there is nothing [Applause] there ain't nothing that can rob you from almighty God I'll just say what job said that job said that he is one mind and who can turn him so if God has one mind who can turn him the devil sure can't turn him the enemies of God sir can't turn him I'll say this they're those and there's no devil that can change the very mind of God I think it's amazing when you begin to think that God's got one mind he's got one course and he's got one goal and if he's looking upon a people that's destined for a Rapture I'll say God knows how to get us there now notice that the Bible tells us in Acts chapter 7 and verse 48 that how be at the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool what house will you build me save the Lord or what is the place of my rest and you find that when Jesus came he said sacrifice and offerings thou what is not but a body thou Hast prepare for me you see when God was here on Earth The Great I Am the most high God was now tabernacled in the body of Jesus Christ to think that the same one that Abraham was having conversations conversations with back there on the backside of that desert was now living in the body of Jesus Christ brother Brandon said he said he wanted to use his gift he said that was in a man God wanted to use his gift that was in a man he said the Corporal body called Jesus which was his Dwelling Place he said the bodies of Tabernacle and God was tabernacling here on Earth he said do you believe that brethren in the body of Jesus Christ he said God wanted to use his gift so he showed his son to leave the home of Lazarus and Martha and then to go away for several days because Lazarus was going to die now God wasn't becoming impersonable to Lazarus but God knew what he was doing because God had already thought about Abraham or God had already thought about Lazarus before Lazarus got in this situation now can you go into your next trouble knowing that the most high God has already seen your way of Escape out of this saint if it comes by the way of death God's already got a way of Escape out of you and you begin to think in your mind you just you just begin to think well all of the calamities that are happening to the children of God we've got this one dealing with this one we've got this one deal with this sickness or this one's dealing with cancer that one's dealing with cancer this one's got a RSV and pneumonia and covet and all these things and you begin to think in your mind Satan would like to drop things in your mind and say well really who's in charge here who's in charge here when Satan's rage and who's in charge does it look like when cancer is whipping you that God's in charge does it look like when we pray for this one or we pray for that one and they end up dying and go by the way of grave who's really in charge here that's what the enemy would like to put in your mind or you laid hands on this one and they passed away you prayed the prayer of faith over this one and they still remain sick and you curse the very life of Satan in this one and he's still fighting on the inside of them I think it's amazing the voice that Satan likes to put into the most powerful people on the face of the Earth he likes to whisper in our ears and tell us that God's lost control well I'll say this either God's reigning or is being reigned over either God is the greatest god and knows all things or he's the biggest hypocrite and he's the biggest liar that there ever has been but the Bible says that he is the governor of all Nations he's ruling in the Hearts and Thoughts of all men right now [Applause] and I put my voice with Balaam for the false prophet with his prophecy that went out there and said God is not a man that he should lie neither is the son of man neither is the son of man that he should repent let me say this God is the greatest god that there ever has been and when Balaam received the blessing from almighty God he said I have received a blessing from the Lord to bless them and I can't reverse it I'll say this that Jesus Christ has already put a blessing on your life by giving you the Holy Ghost and he's not in the mind of returning the blessing I say God's already got a little girl already picked out for you sister Hannah and he ain't planning on returning that I say God's got a perfect body for everyone sitting here and he ain't planning on sending it back and saying well that one's disabled that one ain't gonna make it God's already got you your healing already picked out God's already got your outpouring Big Town [Applause] God is not in the discontinuing business this Christmas there'll be a lot of returns but God ain't returning what he's gave out he's pouring it out more [Applause] foreign you see God was so Tabernacle in Jesus Christ that he was over there he'd walked away from his best friend in life walked away from him because he knew the works of God can you imagine how powerful a moment that Jesus was having knowing the will of the father I've got to walk away from him to do the works of almighty God but you notice when they question Jesus about his doings and his Works he said oh no this sickness is not unto death you see Jesus knew what the father had in planned because a vision was shown him what was going to transpire in lazarus's life and Martha when she saw Jesus coming she said Master if you would have been here my brother would not have died she said but even now Lord I know that you have the words of Almighty life of eternal life he said that whatever you asked she said whatever you ask God God will give it to you he said my brother will live again she said well I know that he's going to live again in the in the resurrection he said but I am the resurrection and the life you see everything that Martha and Mary had been weeping about was fulfilled in the body of Jesus Christ and I'll say this that everything that you have need of is in the body of of Jesus Christ healing is in the body Deliverance is in the body A sound mind is in the body is that right a cell mind is in the body and Martha never wavered in her face she always believed that Jesus was the resurrection when everybody's at his grave and they're questioning who is this guy he said he was his friend he says he's a resurrection surely if he was the resurrection he would have rolled the stone away but our Prophet said that Martha and Mary had something to do too they had to put their hands upon the stone and they had to roll the stone away and I'll say this you've got some faith that got to go into operation you've got some strength muscles that's got to go into operation You've Got to Believe In the most high God you've got to go to the lowest and still believe he's living on the inside of you you've got to go through sickness and believe he's more than evil why don't you put your hand upon the stone that is in your way that's a give way to Victory what was Martha doing she was open the door for her brother to come back you don't know what you're doing right now but by your faith and by your pool you are opening a door for particles to come back you are opening a door for healing to enter this room by your faith you are opening a door for the miraculous Hallelujah you don't know what you're doing but the son of man is in the building thank you [Applause] he's here to feel you he's here to heal you he's here to save you he's here to deliver you when the son of man steps in the room get away take the grave close off of him [Applause] you don't know what you're doing and Satan's screaming do you realize how dead he is do you realize how bad he stinks do you understand what Satan is trying to put in their minds he's putting in their mind carnal things and carnal blockages and Cardinal roadblocks but I want you to know that Jesus said just get ready just get ready he prayed the prayer he said father I prayed this not because of myself but because of them that are sitting around here and God could have done it Jesus could have done it and he spoke to the stone and it would have been an obliterated right there but God knew that there was some works that had to be manifested Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also notice Martha never wavered Mary was consistent in her faith to say that Jesus's feet and brother Branham said in the spoken word is the Original Seed he said by your constant belief in the word and the life that you now live never deny nothing he said it makes the word become flesh by the life that you live never denying the message never to die in healing it makes the word be becomes flesh now God ain't never left himself without a witness God will always have a witness now God raised up 120 Witnesses on the day of Pentecost because God needed a witness and I'll say God has need of witnesses again in this day he's got to have somebody that he can put their hand upon them and he knows that they're never going to leave him they're never going to forsake his call that they will be a witness to him in good times and in bad times you see his word tonight is as effective in your heart as a Believer as it ever was when he said it in the beginning when he said it when Jesus was here it's just as effective in your heart tonight as a believer now the Bible said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover is that right we are a body Believers and we believe that the apostolic faith has been returned back to the children of the most high God and we recognize that when my papa Charlie Spencer many years ago was working in a chimney pan and then he got his fingers ripped off by using by using a a piece of equipment and the RPMs wrapped around this glove and ripped his fingers off the doctors told my dad said now look all we can do is put Nubs back on there we can just sew it up there the fingers are too far gone he said no he said he said we can't he said he'll lose his finger he'll lose everything that there is my dad said now look if you don't put those fingers back on there when Charlie Spencer wakes up he's going to be a Madman he said but we are believers and you sow them back on there and we'll believe God that he'll put them back into operation again foreign I'll say when you take God at his word God will do the impossible in your life if you can take him for your healing right now you can be healed at the matter of the sound of my voice you can receive your healing if you're Desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost the son of man is in the room and there's a cry for an outpouring of the Holy Ghost and I'll say this if you can believe God will give it out if there's everything anything that we need in this hour it's another outpouring [Applause] I ain't talking about some science I'm talking about some intellectual idea where we get so high we get so built up you think science and intellect was going to help Abraham and help Sarah get a baby they needed a body change they needed an experience with Melchizedek and I'll tell you our young people don't need no signs they don't need no intellectualism what they need is an old-fashioned Holy Ghost Field baptism experience by the anointing of almighty God I tell you what we need we need an old-fashioned Revival where we shake this to lactites out of hell and knock them right in the devil's eye and we shake it down Shake kingdoms down Shake hell down that's what we need another outpouring brother Burnham's head that until God stops calling the Pentecostal power and the Pentecostal message will never cease and if a prophet's headed I believe it and the powers here the experiences here the Holy Ghost is here [Applause] when John and all the disciples are on the boat and Jesus was back here sleeping brother Bynum goes back in there and the testimony to see and he Taps into their conversation he said I can see John saying this he said my daddy told that he was coming this way they told me what Moses did they told me what Elijah did they told me what Jehovah did in Abraham and brother Adam said that when they watch him they were watching he said John said he has the habits of Jehovah now they don't watch they don't watch throughout the Old Testament what Jehovah did and all of his angels the prophets back there they watched what he did in those Messengers as they come up in every generation those prophets that would rise up and they watched the habits of Jehovah in those prophets and now they're watching those same habits in Jesus Christ said he's got the habits of Jehovah and when Jesus was out there and he asked he said do you have any meat when there was a crowd that was following him and he began to he began to wonder about the five thousand now look we can't send them away like this he said they came here they come out here for the message we've got to feed them and Brother Bruno said that God had something to show in the resurrection when Jesus took those uncooked fish and he took that bread and he began to multiply it and it wasn't uncooked but it was cooked now you people like fried fish I say Jesus was right on your side that day need a little bit of bread you ain't got to worry about Long John Silvers with Jesus he makes the best fish you ain't got to worry about the extra Crispies he makes the best fish when the resurrection when I am the resurrection and the life takes a hold of your meal basket prepare to be blessed [Applause] it was showing that he had a part in the resurrection and you know God will always bless people that walk in his way that's provided unto them he blessed Noah because he gave him a way that was provided for him he blessed Abraham because he walked into a way that was provided for Him He blesses those that walk in a way that's already provided for him now you're very aware that there's a presence in this room you know and I know that it's milky all over this place and the presence of the Living God is here so I invite you to pull that presence right into your life to overcome your troubles overcome your situations now he said not thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies he said now what are we afraid about he said possess the gates he said we have God's promise he said we have his word we have his holy spirit the angels of God are encamped about he said everything's in order every wall can be took down he said it's already took down the Son of God goes before us his Banners are waving and there's nothing can stand in the weight of the saint going to meet a promise of God he said death can't stop it the Grave can't stop it the devil can't stop it we are more than conquerors sickness is conquered for you death is conquered for you and you are tabernacling the most high God for the Bible said in Isaiah 9 and 6 that For unto us let's say that together for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called the wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and the government shall be upon his shoulders now what is what is that it's a part what is his shoulder it's a part of his body you see that's his body it's his shoulder it's his body he said where is the government on Earth in his body to think that you have jurisdiction in this world you have the government on your shoulders the very Judgment of God the very word of God upon your shoulders notice what William Branham said he said that's where the real Church speaks in his power there's where Apostolic power returns to the church it's when the government shall be upon his shoulders I want you to think how powerful what I just give you is that is when the church the real true church speaks in his power is when the government is back in the body again and what was he doing throughout the seven Church ages he was building a body he would sell on top of sale in Wesley it was sale on top of sail in Luther it would sell on top of sale in the Pentecostal in the restoration of the gifts but notice that the body has come back to full adoption again and the headship has found a body that it can lay down in and rest in that's what Isaiah told us that this would be the rest where the stammering lips and an unknown tongue well I speak unto my people that in the last days I saw Joe said that in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh All Flesh and my sons and daughters shall prophesy May old men shall see dreams my young men shall see visions and to think that this is the day when there's a people that is not ashamed to be called The Church of the Living God for it is the power of Salvation and it comes in demonstration and by the works of the Holy Ghost God don't need your attitude God don't need your signs God don't need your idea or only God needs is for you to yield your life God can use anybody here in this building and he's wanting you to experience him like never before [Music] foreign ever fell off a 40-foot ladder there's only one person in the building that could say they did that I can imagine what it felt like but I can't testify every little pain that he went through I'm talking about brother Ron if you don't know the guy over there in the corner that Satan's raging about I've tried everything I can but I still can't get him now I can't tell you I was there on the outside and I was looking in and I've seen the thing that was going through I can't tell you what it's like to go through a burning fire but I was looking on the outside looking in but if you hear his testimony he was there it happened to him and there's no devil that can rob this Pentecostal a blessing away from the Church of the Living God because we were there we met the same one that Mary met we said met the same one that Peter met we met the same one that was up there on the road to Damascus and stopped Paul writing his tracks I experienced it his Apostolic age is not going to cease it's still in a body right now you see what Christianity is it's tabernacling almighty God you see to be a Christian means to be christ-like it's tabernacling deity in you the holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost not some emotion but a real Pentecost notice what Jesus said when he was speaking to our church age he said behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in and sup with him and he with me notice what brother random said he said that's the message to the Pentecostal church not try to revive the Pentecostal organization but revive the Pentecostal blessing in an individual heart he said that's the only way and I will sup with him and he with me now what is God wanting to do he was wanting to Veil himself in humanity all right he's wanting to Veil himself in you and it doesn't matter where you came from it doesn't matter what teachings you were raised up under it doesn't matter what kind of creed or what kind of Dogma that you came out of as long as you came out but God is not going to leave you where he found you you see there there was a whole lot of scars in your life there's a whole lot of things that are laying there but look at Moses's life he was known as a murderer he was known as a runaway Prophet but God wanted to Veil himself in in Moses he was wanting to Veil himself in Moses and when Moses went back there and grabbed the anointing of almighty God when he goes up there on the mountain and he turned aside to see a burning bush what did he do he come back under the anointing of the call that he was in of the prophet of that day and notice what Moses did he'd come back off of that mountain speaking thus say of the Lord and he'd come back under the inspiration of the anointing that he was living in in that day and Moses went out there and to think that the word that I am preaching to you is what Moses grabbed inspiration from to think that he went all the way back into the Garden of Eden and had conversations with Adam now how in the world could he do that when he was 400 years from Abraham but he was inspired by almighty God to go back there and grab the anointing and tell us what happened in the Garden of Eden to tell us what happened with Cain to tell us what happened with Abraham to think that Moses grabbed the inspiration and he was inspired to speak the first five books of the Bible and over three quarters of it Moses wasn't even there but Moses had become veiled by almighty God when he come up off that mountain they said no they seen so much of God on Moses they said look man you got to put a veil over him we can't we can't stand to look on the way he's his face is shining he had so much God about him that he was had to Veil himself but today the world can't recognize almighty God because it's veiled in body form again what is it they missed Jesus when he was here because of the veil I say this that God in morphe is veiled in the body of Jesus Christ and Satan and all the enemies recognize that there is a power there is a power that they've watched from the very beginning imagine the jealous spirit that killed Cain or a Cain that rose up in Cain that killed Abel it rose up in Judas it rose up in the Pharisees it's the same jealous spirit that is trying to come in and stop the very move of God he'll try to come in and stop the Pentecostal blessings it tries to come in and shout shoutings and stop trying to stop shoutings try to stop groans try to stop weeping and start trying to stop prayer meetings it's amazing that the jealous spirit is wanting to keep you from the blessings that God has already poured out on you now I've already told you that God ain't gonna take nothing back God ain't returning anything God ain't saying no she didn't meet the bill this one didn't match no I want you to know what your Prophet said for you he said you're more than a Max for your enemy when your Tabernacle with the Holy Ghost and I'll say this I'll take any of our little girls over top of every Pope that's ever been they've got so much power they don't need to create squirrels but just create an overcoming life Hallelujah failed right here in humanity Moses do you watch the characteristics you watch the characteristics in nature you can watch you can watch deer in the summertime or in springtime when Annie got when the bucket he got his antlers on his head yet but you can tell the difference in them because nature tells of the characteristics of it you watch you can do you could see a bird flying and you can tell the difference between a crow and a dove because of the characteristics of it you can tell by the way they eat the characteristics of it you can look at a humanity and you can see all kinds of things they can Bob their hair off they can paint themselves up but you recognize what they really are I'm saying a whole lot to you without saying it but they can try to hide up in there all they want to but their characteristics show what's hidden on the inside of them and notice that God was so veiled in Morris and Moses that it showed the very characteristics of almighty God you see what brother random said he said when he come when Moses come on the scene he had the Revelation and he met the pillar fire and it was revealed to Moses it was revealed to Moses he met God in the form of the pillar of Fire he said watch he said watch the Creator he said watch the characteristics of God he picked up a handful of dust and he throwed it in the air and he turned and it turned into fleas the curator characteristics of God was in Moses now how can man act that way how can the word of man act that way unless God is backing up what that man said now how can a man take fleas when there ain't no fleas and take dust and all of a sudden speak it and take up dust and there's fleas flying everywhere or there's frogs jumping everywhere oh there's blue flies bloating everybody in the country because there was a man that was veiled with almighty God you see it wasn't Moses speaking it was the voice behind the voice in Moses that was speaking through Moses you begin to think about this and here's the phenomena of it that Moses began to speak and all of a sudden these things come into action it was God's voice operating in humanity what was it when William Branham was up there and he was studying on that on that thought of Mark 11 and 22 and 23 it was the sovereignty of almighty God Colorado mountain when he was up there in that Storm and The Voice told him to go back up there where he came from it was the sovereignty of almighty God now why can't the Catholics tap into that because they've never had a restoration but there is a body on Earth today that is in full restoration the fruit is at the top of the tree we know who we are we know what God wants us to do what was it in Moses it was the character characteristics of God what was it and what was it when Abraham was sitting at a tent he's setting out a tent and he hears a voice speaking to him and God wants to take flesh he wants to take 16. elements of the world and step into it and have communion with his son how did Abraham know he'd watch the actions of the voice that spoke to him all of his life foreign how do you know who's leading you how do you know that that's brought you to this message it's the one that's kept you all of your days he's never LED one of his children out of the way now notice and he comes and sits with his back turn to the tent I said why did your wife Sarah laugh Sarah said I didn't laugh brother said she was back here snickering up her arm up her sleeve there she says I didn't laugh you know God could have killed her right there but because she was a part of the promise there was nothing that could happen to her and when God asked Sarah a question he said is there anything too hard for the Lord even though you've been 90 years old you've been believing this promise for 25 years don't you believe that when I bless you that you're blessed don't you recognize that running through your veins right now is the Royal Blood of almighty God and though the enemy may be putting Mind Games in you making you sick and tormenting you that there is a blessing of almighty God and he's got his back turned to the tenth and he knows the very secrets of your heart I'll say that he's still Hebrews 4 and 12 the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart if you know if you knew what Sarah was saying Charlie knows what you're thinking how many times did we hear our prophets and now I'll turn my back to the audience why don't you why don't you over there in the balcony why don't you go to believing for God for something real quick I'll turn my back to show you that the same angel that came and met them before that before they went down to Sodom and Gomorrah that same Angel is in the building and he turned us back and said you you've got this need I see you you're praying for your grandson and he's got he's got stroke-like conditions and this is going on ain't that right that's thus saith the Lord what is it now I'll turn my back again to you now you're dealing with heart trouble and you've been wondering and you've been wondering if the Holy Ghost is for you don't you worry the Holy Ghost is for you and he'll heal your heart troubles that was it it was the same Melchizedek operating in human flesh again hallelujah it's the most high in human flesh again it's God's voice in his body your bodies are the Tabernacle of the Dynamics I can't tell you how the car operates but I know it's got some power I know it's got some power I can't tell you everything about how the alternate alternator works and how all the belts are put together and how all the how all the nuts and the bolts are holding it together but I do know this that if there is a spark and there is gasoline and everything's in order all I've got to do is turn the key and go down the road and I believe that William Branham told us and showed us that this message is something that we can ride down the road and show these Pentecostal blessings off to every dead cold Creed out there inside the message and outside the message that this message has got the dynamic power of almighty God in it Glory Satan swore that he'd stop you same sword that he'd kill you he said he'd stop this message and stop the influence of the message and kill his power but let me let me read you a scripture Deuteronomy 33 and 29. happy or thou oh Israel who is like unto thee laughs hit your neighbor who's liking to me are you happy put a smile on your face it takes a whole lot more muscles to frown than it does to smile it'll do your heart good happy but I'm happy every day as I journey through this land I gotta turn my face upside down well the Journey's almost over and the battle's nearly won and I got a feeling down in my heart I've got to turn this frown around happy David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord [Applause] happy or thou Israel but you don't know what to come through happy are you Israel but Satan's been on my case happy Art Thou Israel Satan said he'd kill the power happy are you all people saved by the Lord the people of thy help who is the sword of thy Excellency and not enemy shall be found Liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places to think that the enemy said he was going to get above your high God and get above him and you are going to tread on his high spots the things that he's greatest at you are going to tread upon it you know that Jesus says 25 of Jesus's Ministry was casting out the devil 25 of it if it was in Jesus's Ministry it's in our ministry is that right if we're his body then we are to act like he acted and we are to cast out Satan just like he cast out Satan brother Raynham said well he said I come upon against one of the worst Devils that I'd ever come up against in my life he said he was biting he was spitting and he was doing all kinds of things and he was wrapped up in a straight jacket and the enemy was on the inside of him and he was called cursing and doing all of these things he said but notice he said I had a double witness he said that Christ died on the cross that Christ died on the cross to set that man free from that demon and I had met an angel up there in that cave that there would be nothing stand before my prayer he said I prayed for that man that was said in that lunatic condition he said I prayed for him cast the devil off of him and he was in his right mind you are Servants of the most high God when Paul was going on there on the way to Macedonia and there was a woman up there had a spirit of divination she followed Paul and Silas walking around all of them days and she began to prophesy or begin to speak out these are servants are the most high God now Paul Let It Go on just for a little bit and they followed him all around the city wherever she went but Paul finally had enough of it I'll tell you I know the devil knows who I am but every once in a while you got to get a break from that Old Rascal and Paul turned around and cursed that thing cast The Demon out of her life and instead of the people being excited about it the men that owned her that had gained much things by her by her spirit of divination they were upset and through Paul and silence on the inside of the jail the enemy might think he's got you but God's got a different plan and when Paul and Silas got a player when they threw him in a common prison they got a player and they begin to sing praises unto almighty God and about the Midnight Hour they've become a holy ghost breakout that broke the prison guard broke him out broke Paul out broke every enemy broke every prisoner in there out because they were praising the most high God now to think that the enemies put them in there trying to stop the blessings of God but Paul walked out there and Silas walked out there and they took the prison guard and they baptized him and his family in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the enemy thought he was going to win but God meant it for his good foreign holy power surrounding in the church that'll make demons flee he said but instead of that it's become a laughing stock he said what is it it's the mechanics instead of the Dynamics who's in charge here who's in charge here has God lost control or is there he letting another uh he's already letting another Power be in Supreme control either God is God or he or he ain't either God still gives a holy ghost story don't either God still delivers from cancer or he don't who's in charge here and it looks like Satan's on the Rampage and it looks like he's going to win who's in charge here we were not put here to be ran over and to be brow beaten by the enemy and for him to beat us down and tell us that we'll never be enough we were put here to be Serpent bruisers and to put Satan underneath of our feet put put depression underneath of our feet to put oppression anxiety if cancer couldn't stand in front of William branham's prayer and the angel that met him is in this room there'll be no cancer that can stand in front of the Church of the Living God the creators in the room the possessor of Heaven and Earth is in the room the Holy Ghost is in the room we watch a little girl's feet that were completely turned inside become straight don't tell me he can't do it sister Caitlin sings this home here don't you tell me he can't do it we've seen prodigals return we've seen broken families restored we've seen pain ridden bodies be completely healed don't you tell me he can't do it don't you tell me God don't give the Holy Ghost anymore don't you tell me that God can't restore anymore I done seen him don't you tell me he can't do it don't you tell me the prodigals won't return look in this room look in this room don't you tell me that your prodigals are too far gone look in this room look in this room don't you tell me don't heal cancer look at Joseph don't you tell me don't hear cancer look at Mark Spitzer don't you tell me don't give the holy ghost look at these young people don't you tell me he can't do it because I know that he can he's more than Abel he's not backed off of his promises he's not backed off of his amens he is Jehovah Jireh he's more than enough for your situation he's bigger than any problem he's greater than any need if you want the Holy Ghost ask and he'll give it to you you need healing tonight ask and he give it to you the reason you have not is because you ask not [Applause] I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you two two more scriptures maybe a little bit more let the musicians comes but I'm giving this to you this can't wait look the turn of me lay on the screen don't turn to your Bibles because you're going to have to keep your hands for clapping that okay just go reading Psalms chapter 47 one time rejoice all clapping to the Lord for he is a god of Triumph I know what I'm talking about you're not Clapping Your Hands to me you're Clapping Your Hands to the almighty God and if Satan could he'd stop you from doing that he'd keep you set it in your Pew and not believing what I've told to you that you are tabernacling the most high God Deuteronomy 31 and 19. notice God commanded Moses says notice when they come out of Egypt in Egypt and they come over against the Red Sea and they come over in Exodus 15 they begin to sing the song of Moses and that is where we watch the greatest Triumph of 600 sisters 600 000 sisters beating on tambourines don't you tell me we can't do it dancing on the shores of tea because cancer they watch tuberculosis they launch they watched anxiety they watch depression as it was being defeated and they happily danced over their enemy Hallelujah and they sang the song of Moses now notice notice what he says here in Deuteronomy 31 and 19. he said now therefore write this song for you and teach it to your children of Israel he said put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel now notice God is wanting you to sing God's wanting you to put this on your lips and teach it to your children there's something about that little song Mary Had a Little Lamb or that little song I I got a little light and I'm not gonna I'm gonna let it shine every child remembers it you see God knows that there's power in sin and if you can go to singing and put it upon your children's lips what is it you are singing the praises to the most high God now notice he said write this song for you put it and teach it to your children put it in their mouths now notice the Bible tells us over and over again now the word of God is Not thee even in thy mouth turn of me and Moses to death not Moses but Deuteronomy 32 and 8. and Moses took up his pen and composed this song when the most highly Heart Divided to the Nations they are inherited when he celebrated the sons of Adam and he set the bounds of the people according to the number of his children Israel for the Lord's portion is his people the Lord's portion is his people the Lord's portion is his people Jacob is a lot of his inheritance he found him in the desert land and it is a waste howling Wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye and your Prophet came to this generation and he preached this message right here over and over and over again as an eagle stirreth up her nest and floodeth over her young spread with her broad her wings taketh them and bear them on her wings so the Lord did lead him and there was no strange god with him William Branham grabbed the inspiration of Moses's song and spoke to this generation it's time to fly only an eagle can come up this High only the anointed can fly here you're not a birth bound chicken we've had enough intellectual I'm taught intellectualism taught to us to starve every chicken and to choke out every chicken there is in this land but you have been stirred up by a word of Prophecy El eleon has called you his portion El eleon says you're his children Elion says you're the apple of his eye if Eliana says anything to you you can take it to the bank because it's coming to pass it's time to fly it's time to fly higher it's taking the time to sit back and wonder when the days of Miracles are they're right now this ain't the time to sit here and wonder well if we'd only been here when William Branham was here I'll say the god of William branham's in this room I'll say that he's more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ever ask or think I believe that by my prayer that cancer can leave the body in this room right now I believe that whatever you have need of if you ask it in his name it'll be done right now if it can't be done then what are we doing here if he's not the god of Elijah then why'd he send us Elijah if he came to it then why to create squirrels if you can't make tumors dissolved then why'd he show it to us in the prophecy of men at William Branham [Music] you know you're standing on Holy Ground you know you're in a special spot what if you
