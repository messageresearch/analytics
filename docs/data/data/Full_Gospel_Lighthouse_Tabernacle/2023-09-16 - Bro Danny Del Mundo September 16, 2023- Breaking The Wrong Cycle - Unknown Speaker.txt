uh a 14-hour trip from Manila all the way to Los Angeles and then I we arrived 8 30 and probably went out of immigration fast 10 a little bit and then had to catch up my flight from LA to uh to Houston uh 12 55 this morning and then Houston to uh to DC probably past 12 yeah we arrived 12 30 and I got out of the airport and then you just could imagine amen so I was I was in the immigration officer and and she asked that the woman asked uh how are you are you okay yes yes ma'am I'm fine I'm just okay are you uh are you sure you're okay yeah are you nervous no ma'am I'm not I'm not nervous this your first time to be in the uh no this I've been here many times but you're shaking yeah it's not nervousness Madam I'm from a tropical country 39 degrees when I left Manila and I come here 19 degrees and now you understand and he said okay here we go amen but honestly right at this very moment I have to be honest with you I'm nervous amen so amen so but I believe amen uh we've been praying for this and the Lord will help us I have great respect with uh brother Ron of course brother Mike I every time I said uh when I'm with bad Lloyd and brother Mike I feel protected because I'm between two strong walls amen but you know brother on we really love him very much we almost made it before the pandemic and uh uh so just before I let you sit down uh we almost made it uh because brother Tim and brother Ron would have been in the Philippines in in 2019 and we were able to arrange meetings and over a hundred ministers committed to join the meeting and bring their congregation and brother Tim said but Danny uh are you sure it's it's safe you know this is our first time brother team and myself it's our first time yeah it's it's so safe because of the convention hall that I got is inside the military headquarters but it didn't happen I know God is our absolute and he has perfect will in everything so I told Brother Rune I have a mission in coming over here because we have unfinished business amen so all right so the Lord is great just respect and uh so without further Ado I would like to bring you to the scriptures directly let us open our Bibles in Ephesians chapter 2. some familiar scriptures and quotation thank you so much musicians amen so Ephesians chapter 2 we start from verse 1 up to six in verse 1 it says and you hat he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins we're in in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the last of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and where by Nature the children of brat even as others so when we speak about by Nature it's our natural birth and uh but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love where we he loved us even when we were dead in sins had quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and had raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus let's move on to another scripture let's read from the book of Romans chapter 12. in verse 2. it says and be not conformed to this world but be it transformed by the renewing of your mind that he may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen may the Lord add blessing to his word dear heavenly father we are helpless without you we cannot speak anything unless you say it Lord and may your mind that is perfect be upon us this evening and we have great respect for you your presence in uh your people that are here they have come with expectation and I believe lord they're not looking at the men but they're looking all of us are looking who's using the man Lord this evening so God we thank you and we commit the rest of the service into your Mighty hands in Jesus Christ's wonderful name and everybody say Amen tonight amen God bless you amen so thank you so much amen so uh special greetings from my uh little congregation back there in Metro Manila it's called Capstone Believers worldwide missions amen and my wife says hello to Sister Connie amen and uh to all of you Amen brother thank you so much and brother Andrew my son Paolo said Papa just although uh brother Andrew don't know me just greet him for me amen so I said them don't worry I'm going to bring Andrew to the Philippines soon amen so amen I feel some approval here amen so I want to speak just a simple thought this evening amen and uh so this is not the new scripture but I would like to uh give a title breaking the wrong cycle amen and the opposite of that is going back to God's cycle because there's only one perfect cycle and that's the cycle of God Amen the realm of God Amen and the realm will where nothing is impossible amen but you go lower than that amen and everything is you know uh uh the devil has an opportunity now in in verse when he says and you and I believe uh Paul is speaking directly to the predestinated Sons and Daughters of God Amen so this is directly addressed to Those whom he saw before the foundation of the world and they were part of him amen and you had he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins amen we're in in time past he walked according to the course of this world Amen so this is the wrong cycle the course of this world this is the wrong cycle and you know just like this clock over here when you say you know you go on a clockwise meaning the arm is going the way the direction of the clock is going but when you go counterclock it is opposite the right direction all right and then you're going back amen so the the perfect cycle is to keep on moving amen now you see we're in in time pass you walked according to the course of this word according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience amen we are not children of Disobedience amen but because of sin because of unbelief because of the spiritual Amnesia we became disobedient amen but praise God by the message of the hour he opened our eyes of understanding amen and and uh take away the veil amen and took away the veil and then we realized who we are and then when we re we realize who we are then there's nothing new with that we just go back where we come from amen and when we realize who we are and and we go back to where we come from then we know how we conduct ourselves we know how to walk in this world how we know how we witness in this world Hallelujah and we know that we're different from the rest of the world in verse 3 among also we all had our conversation in time passed in the last of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and the mind and where by Nature the children who brought even as others and now in verse words started to be the conjunction but amen and so when you use the word but it is going in contrast with something amen it is opposite so in times past we're going in this in this certain direction but amen so that word is just a three-letter word but it has a lot of meaning in it and then he said but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love were with he loved us even when we were dead in sins amen because this world Amen there's no other direction but death amen Bob God who's rich in Mercy brought us back to something amen so but God who is rich in Mercy for his great lover with he loved us even when we were dead and sins have quickened us together with Christ now when we talk about Grace here it is even when we were dead even when we are living without knowing who we are and who our real father is and yet there is a pair of eyes watching over us but because of his love and because of his Rich Mercy amen and so he's six in six and had raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen so we without God's Rich Mercy everything is just falling down amen because of the the gravitational pull it's but natural that everything you throw up it will go down amen but God who is rich in Mercy our direction is not going down but we're going up amen and so that's why in 12 verse 2 of Roman he said and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen so we fully understand that there is a permissive will and a perfect will amen and when we enter into the permissible there's always a consequence with that because it's always going against the perfect will amen but God was rich in Mercy sometimes he allows for you know he permits things to happen that along the way we realize how God loved us so much and then because of that great love and we realize that God's mercy amen you know it brings us back amen so now before I go further I just want to to speak something from the natural because brother said to fully understand the spiritual we better understand the natural things amen so uh brother Brian I mean in here talking about nature it's mentioned in the scripture on nature uh in the in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed he said Christ couldn't help being what he was he was this son of God that's it see what I mean if you were intended to see the word of God you believe it because why there's something new have you ever heard of a strain in a family amen so there's a strain in the family and he said one Islam will kind of impersonate his father or mother or the grandfather the grandmother that strain in the family you've heard it meaning the strain in the family something that is being passed on from from one generation to another amen so your father is like this so that's why you're like that your mother is like this that's why you're like that amen so it's just a strain amen and it it's a strained that that speaks of our natural lineage there's no hope in that amen so there has to be a power there has to be a transforming power to pick us up Amen to break that lineage amen because uh you know I grew up I grew up in a I grew up in a family uh my uh on my father's side my father lives in a in a city in Manila it's called tondo and tondo in the Philippines is popular it's like Bronx you know we're I'm not saying against uh your City Bronx or something but you know in the Philippines you know this is the place where gangsters you know Hood looms they live in that and my father grew in that place and uh of course uh so I'm not ashamed to say but because my father grew in that uh in grew in that place Amen in that City amen he lived like the rest of those people there amen his illness brother is among the gangsters and he was about to inherit that position amen and so if I live there you know uh it doesn't matter about my size amen but I'm going to inherit a certain position in that lineage and where would I be amen but God by his grace and mercy took me out of that and brought me from another Direction amen and so I was the first believer in my family I was the first one who heard this message Amen brother Ron uh hit the right question how did you receive the message brother Danny amen it's my wife because my wife's father was among the Pioneer ministers in the message in the Philippines and so uh so that was something no a call where God started to change the course I didn't realize that amen I didn't realize that I just you know I caught somebody a woman you know I I I've been uh I've been out there in the world although you know I've been with with women who cut their hairs and you know everything you know and then I come here is it it's another Direction yeah it's a cycle something has to be broken you know but but you know but deep inside because we were Sons and Daughters of God the seed in US recognized I didn't realize that but there is some kind there was some kind of an attraction amen hallelujah and God took that attraction amen so and so that I will be in that in this lineage in this course amen be so now that's on on one side on the left side on my mother's side my uncles and you know their drunkards they they can drink from night till morning amen and they could not even make it at home you know just just fall just right on the gate because they're so drunk amen and so uh I I grew up in that condition that when people are happy they drink when people are lonely they drink so I knew that was life then so at that time in my young age when I was happy I drink when I'm lonely I also drink I was in that cycle amen but God who is rich in Mercy amen so you see this this is that kind of strain in the family it's hard to break you know you want to change your direction but sometimes there is some kind of a pull and you're just going back there amen but there is a supernatural power amen that when when that one works amen the Lord is the one working on it amen so now barabena made mention of that of that guy I'm not going to uh to read all but this this guy he wanted to get married and brother Branham said you know when when when when this guy you are you are born again you're born again you know uh one is German and the other is Irish both of them they have strain in the family and so that's why you know their son you know he he could he don't know how to say I'm sorry because he's very strong you know and brother randoms knew that he was not converted yet and he wanted to get married and brother Branham said you know you know you see I advise that young man to never marry a woman that's right he will make hell on Earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit Christ comes in then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellect was his strength to his best to overcome it he can do it he will never become it overcome it Christ will have to overcome it when he lets Christ in then he is already overcome then it will be a perfect Paradox when man is born of the spirit of God that makes the difference amen so now there's scripture on that and let me put some scripture on it to back it up now you know in Genesis chapter 20 we know uh when the word of God came to Abraham they were well-stricken in age this is not something new but let's just be reminded you know that Abraham was promised with a son and he will be the father of many nations amen that's the word of God and you cannot add you cannot diminish anything from it that's it amen but when people try to interpret that especially the woman interprets the word amen so when when uh uh when when Sarah you know tried to interpret that word and he said you know it's it's a wrong cycle because only the man can preach the word amen but when you know the woman started to preach look Abraham see you know look at me I'm old I'm young and my womb is dry I cannot give you a son but perhaps you're the same father look at that woman down there she's young she's beautiful amen you can take her with my approval with my consent at least that will the word of God will be fulfilled all right and Abraham said amen so when he said amen that broke the cycle God was working on it because he spoke it and one guy when God speaks he's obligated to his word amen no one is God should interpret his word because God is obligated to his word amen and so now when they and we will see even though it was not the perfect will it has a result and so that's why people has a misconception of something oh you know you see I have planned I have done all these things and it's gaining good result amen so because Ishmael was born the expectation was there and so they thought it was the will of the Lord until the consequence came in Hallelujah amen so you see now but prior to that you know Abraham you know before before they did it uh we see everything they were old and stricken in AIDS and uh uh you see but when when they realize it's not the perfect will of the Lord and so when uh I believe that's in Genesis Chapter 18 when when Elohim visited Abraham and the Lord called him Abraham and she called her Sarah amen when he was Abram he was well-stricken in age when she was Sarai she could not give her give him a son because of the physical manifestation amen they were in a wrong cycle but when Elohim came and he was going to fulfill his own word he's going to interpret his own word you know God's interpretation of his own word doesn't need so much explanation amen God's interpretation of his own word is the Fulfillment of his word when it's being fulfilled that's the interpretation of that and so God said you know and and and and he called him Abraham and Abraham realized it was the same man because he was the one that changed his name from Abram to Abraham amen and so God Amen took a part of himself I'm going to visit you according to the time of life Elohim was life and so that's why Abraham became Abraham Sarai becomes Sarah amen it is a breath of life ha that's why we say hallelujah amen when a baby is born he said amen when a man is born again he said hallelujah amen because that part of God's life is being connected with this natural life then amen so now from Abram to Abraham God was breaking now the wrong cycle amen they were going down even because they are well stricken in age but when they took the word of God amen when even not only Abraham but even Sarah believed God now amen so that's why it's very important that the man and the woman should agree amen should have the same belief and so when both of them believe the word of God God changed the course amen they were going down they were going down but when they took the word of God they walked amen and little by little it broke the wrong cycle straightened them up amen hallelujah and went to the next Kingdom to the kingdom of amen and so that's why we know that abimelech didn't say a grandmother he saw a beautiful young woman amen because God has entered in and changed the cycle back proving that there's Life coming in Hallelujah they didn't have to interpret they didn't have to make a remedy for God's word because God is obligated to his own word amen hallelujah but now when they entered into the kingdom amen everything was beautiful and then but when they are approaching the the gate Sarah noticed something in Abraham Abraham you look younger than yesterday and Abraham look at Sarah and said Sarah you too amen but then something happened now it's Abraham and said Sarah when the king asked you don't tell him I am your husband now they were in the right cycle already but fear came in you know it was fear in the Garden of Eden that made all these things so fear broke the cycle of God and so when fear said Abraham said to Sarah Sarah don't say anything don't tell him I am your husband tell him I'm your brother because Abraham knew amen because of this Saras condition now amen the king will fall in love and get in that was true and so abimelech took Sarah and now it's a wrong cycle everything now is hopeless Sarah was in the custody of abimelech and the womb that God purified the womb that God restored the womb that now amen has all the potentials to produce the son of Abraham is in danger of being polluted amen and nothing could control it Abraham was in that condition he was so fearful amen and he could not do anything about it amen and so what Abraham will do amen he could not do anything about that because you see amen she was in the in in the Palace of abimelech and Abraham had no control and I see something here amen when nothing seems hopeless because God is Not only obligated to fulfill his own word God is obligated to protect his promise Sarah could not do anything Abraham could not do anything abimelech was ignorant amen but God came to the rescue everything was had fallen into the wrong cycle now and who is able to correct the situation only God was able to correct the situation and so he came down and he said abimelech you are a dead man restore the woman to his to her husband amen but said abimelech said my Lord with the Integrity of my heart I honestly asked but God was absolute he said I have no obligation God who is rich in Mercy my Prophet had no obligation amen bring her wife back and then you ask prayer from him and after he prayed for you you give him love offering I could imagine what abimelech was thinking Prophet telling a lie but God never changed his mind amen God did not change his mind when we were back there in sin we never knew about him we never knew about this message of the hour Hallelujah but God hallelujah all the way from eternity from the foundation of the world God winked his eyes he closed his eyes because he covered it with blood amen hallelujah and he never saw anything against us amens that's why he said in Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 he said for I know the thoughts that I think towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you unexpected end aren't you glad amen there is a God who's the author who knows from the beginning to the end amen hallelujah and I'm so glad I have confidence that I am part of that great plan amen so sometimes we think you know some these things you know we don't know how to make it happen you know don't know how to correct the situation we have been in some situation where we we really do not know what to do amen but when we humble ourselves and we don't put the remedy in it God comes down and make a remedy for that hallelujah amen and so now look it happened to Abraham when they wear and look at that to prove that strain in the family now look this Genesis chapter 26 6-10 amen Abraham was passed and now Isaac and Isaac dwelt in Gerard and the man of the place asked him of the wife and he said she is my sister it was the same Kingdom it was the same King in the same situation the same question who is she amen Abraham said she is my sister and his son pays the same question any son who was not yet converted and gave the same answer she is my sister Hallelujah because why amen and and the man of the place asked him of his wife and she said she is my sister for he feared to say she is my wife same Hallelujah Hallelujah that's why there is no fear in love hallelujahs all these things amen that have happened no matter what kind of situation we are in no matter what kind of sickness we are in Hallelujah don't fear we don't fear because he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah it doesn't change the same miracle that he did before is the same Miracle is doing until now amen I was in the I was in the mission uh uh uh field just two weeks ago and we we went to uh to another province which is 12 to 14 hours drive to the interior of the mountainous area we call it Abra amen uh it's in it's in the northern part of uh of our country and so we went there and it was the first time we we went to the interior we passed hanging Bridges uh uh uh and there was rain and we had quite a number of landslides along the way amen but there are seeds that were hunting and so we went there and then and so Our intention is just to contact a Bible study because there's a young people in our church that that that grew up there and he wanted to bring this message in that in that in that Village and so we went there and and so we started conducting Bible studies questioning answer in the small house and then a a neighbor passed by and and asked why don't you you know why don't we do it in an open area so so that more people can hear amen and so the following night what we did we we were in the uh portion of the covered uh uh uh gym and people you know when they heard the preaching when they heard the singing amen people just come out and just sit down there and listen amen and in in last night my wife was very nervous because in the villages in her country when it's 9 9 in the evening the the the doors are already uh shut and the lights are off already because people wake up very early they they go to the they go to the field at 4 AM amen go to the go to the ocean and fish uh at the same time you know and so that's it and so and the last night my wife was so nervous I I saw him in front and he was kind of like this and I know if if I look to her she will signal like that [Laughter] I knew you know so that's why I was not looking amen because I feel the presence of the Lord amen and I just preached the word just preach the gospel you know the following day we baptized five souls in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah and then prior to that before we reached the river there is a house there amen and uh uh uh uh and and the brother said the the woman heard that there's a pastor and and she said would you pray for him for her yeah yeah we can pray and so my feeling was I'm just going to pray for the sister she was a retired teacher and laying at the bed in at the corner there's an oxygen tank amen and so before we pray I I told them can can can we open a Bible and just I just want to do a little exhortation and they were happy about it and just to set the atmosphere and everything and then suddenly you know the the the woman sat down at the side of her bed and raise her hand and said oh you know I have been praying for two weeks that a minister will come to our village I didn't know that nobody told me but here comes a woman asking for a minister to come by and pray for her tell me God is not alive amen God is alive in our midst he's making connections and what a testimony amen and what the testimony and I didn't realize there were two pastors amen sitting down there amen and then they got connected and said what everything that we have heard you know we're scriptural and I want to hear more about this message amen so not not before the end of this year we're we're praying that we're going to hold a crusade there so that we can uh I'm going I'm I'm praying I can bring my musicians and our singers in the church amen and uh we're gonna be praying you pray for us because I believe God will deliver Souls God will heal sickness and everything he will cast out demons amen it's time for the room cycle in that town in that Village amen so that the presence of the Lord will come down once again hallelujah amen is the same God he can correct the error amen he we we don't have to put remedies and covers sickness cover you know sins and everything we just have to Humble ourselves and go into the flow of the presence of the Lord and God will do the rest Hallelujah amen hallelujah so that's why we realize now amen young people that's why the prophet of God said God has no grandchildren amen hallelujah but Andrew the same challenges that your father brother run he will be the same same challenges that you have Pace that you will be facing because God wants to see that his children will overcome the same thing amen so that we will have our own experiences amen the experiences of our fathers cannot be credited to our children can you see Amen to that but they are privileged to witness something amen because they were looking to their parents who are Faithfully serving the lord at least it works in their advantage right but the conversion comes when they face the same challenges and overcome it by the help of God and change the wrong cycle in their lives glory amen so it's the same thing amen so Abraham what happened to Abraham it happened to Isaac same situation same Kingdom same temptation amen if we measure if we gauge what they did both of them failed because of fear that's why we can call it Grace that's why we can call it Mercy because we have nothing to do with it amen it was God and his love when nothing is hopeless God will not change his mind God will be there amen Hallelujah he will personally do it for you amen thank you Lord hallelujah no it's the same thing that have happened in the church in the laodicean age you know he said a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word amen so the cycle went wrong again but God sent Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke of God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tense toward dogma and Creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak to God then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles red and known of all men for their generation when the metal dispelled God raised up others and as it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age so you see even in the church ages everything amen they get organized amen they received the message in their day intellectually but the proper the power of God isn't there amen and so they they organized the lutherans organized they call themselves Protestants and then after which God raised Wesley and they call themselves Westland called them the Baptist Evangelical support and so on afterwards Pentecostal him but everybody organized amen and here comes the message and people hearing the message you know some amen are still trying Amen to make it like an organization amen you know Church appearing to be once again you know no more Baptist you know no all these things but it's the same Spirit coming in amen you know but let me tell you unless the presence of God unless the power of God words in those people who receive this message of the hour it will go down and go down and will bring back another organization but the prophet of God said you can no longer organize this message Hallelujah you cannot organize this message because the message is an organism Hallelujah and an organism has life in it it has a jail of life it will produce itself Hallelujah and it will break all the wrong Cycles hallelujah amen thank you Lord that's why that word b-u-t but amen it also happened in a generation back in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound then the mystery of God should be finished amen that's why it is a message of restoration it's not something new but it's restoration Hallelujah amen but you know what restoration is not just bringing back the apostolic Doctrine apostolic faith we believe in that amen now we believe that that Elijah has restored the faith of our children and we are the children back to our fathers amen and and our fathers in faith are not the prophets in the Old Testament our fathers in faith are the apostles because they preached the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if we go back to the to the prophet you know we'll go back to you know offering lamps once again but we are our faith is being restored back to the Faith of Our Fathers the apostles amen but you see the ministry the ministry of brother Benham fulfilled scriptures in our day he was the Elijah to bring us back to the faith of the fathers amen and his ministry is just like you know just like the ministry of the original Elijah amen that he repaired the altar in his time amen So He restored the altar amen and now the altar is our hearts amen but when he repaired when he restored the altar the ministry of Elijah was not finished because after He restored the altar there was no fire yet the evening sacrifice amen the evening sacrifice must be laid down on top of the altar that was being repaired that was being restored it's the same thing to us that's why we have justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit our hearts must be converted our hearts must be purified Hallelujah so that the word that is pure should be put on top of the altar on top of the heart that is being restored back to God amen because many people they get this message of the hour without being converted and so when they received this message they just received information amen and because it's information it doesn't fall to the heart amen because the heart is not pure and although it's an information amen it cannot it cannot go down because it's a pure word it cannot fall altar so when people receive the word amen when they get the evening sacrifice but the heart is not restored everything just go on the head just go here and so the message becomes information they can quote one quote after the other they can give the page they can give the paragraph they can give the title but there's no power behind it hallelujah amen but let me tell you when the word of God no matter how simple it is when it falls in a pure heart Hallelujah it has power behind it it has result behind that Hallelujah there is science following after that amen so it's not producing uh members but it's producing Sons and Daughters of God amen and as a Ministry of Elijah but you come to think of that because before the the ministry of Elijah you know better also Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 amen the Seven Star Messenger and in his ministry he was preaching to the denomination just like Moses he he exposed pero amen but he was not rebuking Israel he was exposing he was rebuking Pharaoh amen so Revelation 3 14 was rebuking the denomination exposing the nicolaitan spirit The Jezebel spirit that was the ministry of Revelation 3 14 when that was being exposed then the Sons and Daughters of God Amen you know was able to understand something something is going on and this is not the way it should be now from from Revelation 3 14 and that was the beginning of Malachi 4 going back to the restoration that's why brother Branham said you know you cannot you cannot compare Israel to that you know I could call it a church because it was only a church when it has called the out because the church is they called out once amen so when they started to go back it was the ministry of Elijah amen restoration they were in the wrong cycle in Israel for hundreds of years amen but the deliverer came to break that wrong cycle and now they're going back because it's the only place they will be blessed by the Lord amen and so they started to walk amen and then being restored the word is being restored and then look at that amen and then in Revelation chapter 10 verse 7 once that is the opening of the word amen it's the revelation of the word amen the word is being put placed on top of the altar it's being restored our faith is being restored back to the original fathers we baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Holiness came back the position of the women being brought back amen but we don't stop there some of those things are being done by the Pentecostal people amen but what separates us is the opening of the word hallelujah amen and so when when the word is being opened he said now it's it's it's it's continuing amen so that's why we're not only the the restoration of our faith back to the fathers the apostolic Brothers is just the first part of restoration amen but as we go on amen our faith is being restored back what have happened in the Garden of Eden we realize what the you know something have happened in the Garden of Eden that was the beginning it pointed us to everything because the Genesis Book is the book of beginning amen that's the second part but in the third part amen the ministry of Luke 17 30. look at that amen was being restored not just the faith of the apostolic father not just the original things that have happened in the Garden of Eden we were back in the mind of God and when we go back to the mind of God you realize who you are right you know where you are standing amen we go back to the cycle which is the perfect cycle amen so that's why in in Corinthians 15 54 55 so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written that is swallowed up in Victory oh that where is thy sting oh great where is thy victory amen I like that illustration uh you know from from the lowest form uh you know the the the the grass the plants you know they extend the root so that they can get the elements the substance from the Earth and so the the substance is coming up to the plants amen it's coming up to the plants it's going higher and higher amen but now here comes brother make ask me what do you want to eat brother Danny take I want to feel the reality that I am in the states okay so now the substance go up from the Earth to the grass amen and then here comes the cow eating the grass amen so the elements that's in the cow is in the Earth but the cow cannot eat straight the Earth the soil amen so it has to pass through the grass and then the cow will eat the grass and the substance from it will be coming up to the beef and here comes a Filipino Minister who wants a steak amen so the life the the substance that was in the earth is coming up to the grass now it comes up to the cow now it becomes steak and it goes to a man so the light was coming up the substance was coming up Hallelujah but where should it stop if the life stopped here amen I'm just looking to a man that are fond of eating steak but the life has to come up amen but still this is corruptable but it has to go up in a higher realm and what will bring us up there is the word of God Amen to bring us back to the perfect cycle so that we can go back brothers and Caesar do that Hallelujah where God is the substance that is in here not that just the natural amen but I'm just I'm just showing you that something is going higher and higher and higher until it cannot go higher because it has gone up to the highest which is the Lord Jesus Christ himself amen thank you Lord now when this day when this Mortal takes on immortality death is swallowed up in Victory that then we shall see him as he is and everybody like his own glorious body what a time to come amen hallelujah so we come we go higher and higher now he said in the message perfection now this great chain of perfection was broken by time and space this perfect chain of perfection or this great chain of perfection was broken by time space time came because of sin there was no time there was no time prior to sin Adam and Eve were immortal but when sin came they started to count years amen they started to remember their birthdays amen so now I start to forget my birthday brother on [Laughter] young people they always wait for their birthday but one day you will realize when you come to a point you don't want to reach your birthday because you're going old amen so prior to sin there was no birthday amen I'm not again celebrating birthdays don't get me wrong okay don't get me wrong amen so time came because of sin let's draw a picture of time let's see A Perfect Circle he said forever forever and then all up at a once sin Dropped In and put a little and my wife calls it by the brand of a little hickey so it was a perfect circle and then because of sin a little hickey had dropped down he said came it keeps on going but it's no longer in its Perfect Circle because of sin it had a drop amen it's called hiki or a little drop in the chain so it comes down now eternity continues on but it's not in its perfect condition there's a little Gap comes down breaks over this way goes out this way God had to do because Satan caused it and it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and the perfecting and for the purging of the lost that God by his Sovereign Grace might Someday live that little hickey or Gap back into the perfect circle then she rolls on just the same amen so it's it's perfect but now because of sin there is now a drop down it's a little hickey or whatever we call it amen but God has a purpose in everything amen so continuing on no time now time is the little Loop that Loop down Jesus was from eternity to Eternity but he stepped into the time spaces made flesh and came through here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it back with God again for all eternity amen now that's all time is that God when it started here end of a little King in the perfect circle but made it a little kink in it when God started that he was he started there he was perfect everything he said was perfect everything he did does it perfect so then the Bible said that Christ Jesus was the lamb slain from the beginning of the little King the beginning of the word Christ was slain at the beginning so he said in that little Loop down amen there was a streak of blood amen if not for God there will be a gap and the the circle will not be connected amen just like the ring you know you can cut it there's no more connection but you see God in his Sovereign Grace God is rich in Mercy he said God the Lord Jesus Christ stepped into time so that little Loop was called time and in that time he stepped into it and he was working something inside amen he's trying to working out to work it out amen and so little by little by his blood little by little it is going up he wanted to restore it so that we can go back to Eternity and so you can see how privileged we are realize what Grace is we realized why brother Branham said when we say grace we have nothing to do with it but what we are doing right now the joy whatever we do we support the mission we support our pastor we we come here even though we are tired we serve the Lord why we do that we do that not because we can save ourselves not because we can restore back ourselves to God Amen but we do that in appreciation of God's grace applied to you and I amen hallelujah now in closing let me just remind you of that you know that woman at the well you know you know pretty well that woman at the well amen and you know it was it was it it's that it she was a type of the Bride and here comes the Lord and and he said how come you know he he asked water to drink and he said how come you being a Jew speak to me being a Samaritan amen so she knew naturally who she was she knew the strain he was a Samaritan and close to being hopeless amen and here comes the first thing is that he realized she realized him as a natural Jew and so she approached or she she responded to her to him Amen in that manner in that level that she was a Samaritan and he was a Jew amen they were in that cycle it was the little Loop down but he the son of man Son of God came down the Lord of Lord came down in that little Loop hickey drop down he entered into that Realm and he said whoever drinks of this water will be thirsty again but with the water that I'm going to give out of him shall flow rivers of water it's a cycle you drink of that water you thirsty again amen but there is another higher level of water amen where there's no more thirsting amen but it's always satisfaction when you drink it and now of you shall blow rivers of water so he she he entered into that realm and that woman said hey I need that water I haven't tried that before amen and so the Lord okay so he was entering into the triang of the spirit to a condition of that woman's life amen and he said okay call your husband and she said I have no husband and the Lord said you said right if the disciples were there probably they would have said see Lord she's a liar and many men in her life but the Lord was working in that little King amen and she said you said right because you had five and the man you're living with now is the sixth and still not your husband first time amen and the woman said how did you know my my forefathers our father said something similar will happen amen that when the prophet comes he will say just like what you're saying right now coming to the restoration amen amen so she met the seventh man in her life and in that manner the seventh man was introducing who she was not on the level of being a Samaritan come on but restoring her because of that seat because the prophet said the difference between that woman at the well and the people in this in the in the temples amen those people at the temples that did not recognize the Lord Jesus Christ they didn't have representation in heaven but this woman she never knew who she was but she had representation in heaven and God cares for those who are being represented up there in heaven amen and so he was working on that and he said amen hallelujah don't worry amen nothing you know you're being Samaritan has nothing to do with the seed that is in you amen your father your mother our natural lineage has nothing to do with the seed that is in US if our Prophet said now I realize who my real father is I am not the son of Charles amen and her mother you know Brandon but I am a Son of God I want you to realize this afternoon amen that you are a son and daughter of God and our lateral lineages we appreciate our parents we appreciate our natural lineage but God does not doesn't carry that but he's caring so much on the seed that is in you because you have a representation in heaven that's why you are reacting the way you are reacting right now because of that seed amen God is working on daci to bring it back because when that seed is being connected back to the original word back to the mind of God it will not turn down Hallelujah you will not turn your back against this message of the hour those people who said we believe that message before no they didn't believe this message in the first place because those real Believers will stay in the word of God because they're connected they're being anchored Hallelujah to the pure word being manifested in this day Hallelujah that woman she met the seventh man and she didn't stop there amen he said no not only that you're not just a prophet you're a messiah Hallelujah and the real prophet of God is the sign he will always point us to the word he will always point that to us to the Lord Jesus Christ not to himself but the Brandon said I have no intention amen of people you know I have no intention of building organization I have no interest in those things amen my interest is for the people Amen to have a genuine relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ aren't you glad we have a prophet that has restored us that has broken the wrong Cycles in everything this organizational thinking and everything God has broken it down by the message of the hour Hallelujah and when she realized who she was amen you know she left that part in that Jacob's Well amen because Jacob is not converted she experienced that Israel well in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ amen every day of her life you know she had the first man she was only looking for somebody to lead him ahead amen she was sincere in her heart to be a faithful wife but she met the wrong men until so those men before did not broke the wrong cycle in her life but when she met the seventh man she was pointed to the perfect cycle and she was rejoicing come see the man and that simple City Hallelujah was also converted those people in the man they were able to witness who Jesus Christ was they went there amen and that changed the situation of that City amen remember at one one Soul as I told you I told you I was the first one who received this message in her family amen and then later on I let my mother and Then followed by my uh my brothers and sisters you know I got you know I'm not ashamed to say that we're also I'm a brother also a broken family amen and then I've got half Brothers and sister amen but you know what even these have brothers and sister of mine they're in the message believing this message of the hour amen it changed everything Hallelujah and the Lord didn't stop there I got three living I got two aunties and one uncle and they have children they have grandchildren amen and this one Uncle of mine and these two aunties of mine they receive the message of the hour and now following amen their sons their daughters and now amen last last two uh last or probably two weeks ago amen their granddaughters amen they were offering songs to the Lord we're happy family just one just one it will change if we're if we're actually hooked to the word of God it will it will change the uh the cycle it will break the wrong cycle amen the chain in the family Hallelujah amen thank you Lord you love him oh we love him amen I believe we have been in many situations before Hallelujah and things have been hopeless we've been helpless also just like what have happened to Abraham and Sarah Isaac and Rebecca but then nothing is to be done because your son and daughter of God God will make something out of it and correct the error and when we realize he's the only one who did it we will serve him with much appreciation because we recognize his grace it's not me Lord I'm not good enough amen but your mercy that is Rich Your Grace have done all these things Hallelujah and who we are not to worship Him to the fullest God bless you amen hallelujah you just pray for us pray for brother Danny and the Mission Works that we are doing amen and you know in uh in Japan which we we were supposed to visit also we have a very stable Church in Japan it's not that big amen but they're stable they're strong and now it's coming in and Lord willing uh uh there's a there's a brother a Filipino brother a minister in the denomination and he was sent to to South Korea by their denomination a presbyterian group sent them to the to South Korea and then during the pandemic uh they watch our live streaming in the church and never realized that and then suddenly they they get in touch they contacted me and then they went back to the Philippines just to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so they went back they went back to South Korea and said will you not have a problem with your organization he said I'm preparing myself amen I'm prepared to what the Lord will uh uh the Lord has called us and he knows what he is doing we will just yield ourselves so Lord willing before the end of the year amen if there's opportunity amen we will be in South Korea me and my wife will be will be coming over there and once again this group amen being pastored by a Filipino Minister from the denomination will hear the message continued on Amen the Lord is doing he keeps on calling and we just have to do what we have to do amen so just believe in what you're doing in the mission works as I always say you wouldn't realize that but because you support the cause you believe what we're doing on the other side of the on the other side when we meet there there we will be people who will be approaching you amen because you've been part you don't know it here but just the way you support your pastor you love your pastor Amen to my church I always say every time I meet brother Ron I see a miracle I see God doing a miracle every day that he is alive and well in our midst God bless you my brother amen thank you Lord so you just pray for brother Danny you just promised me that on the other side you will be looking for me because I will be looking for you Hallelujah amen Douglas Give the Lord a good hand [Applause] maybe you didn't know brother Danny before tonight but I want you to know he's one of the greatest men in the message of the hour and when I get there and maybe we hear his name called I want a chair I want a chair when his wife takes him and they walk up that golden stairway I can say I knew him that man that led tens of thousands to the Lord Jesus Christ and amen we thank you we thank you just think about the hours yesterday morning he texts me and said I'm preparing to get on

favorite subjects so you preached right to me I'm glad we were able to break that cycle he told me in the office just a few moments ago he said I came on a mission and he said I want to have you in the Philippines so if God sent him here on a mission for me to go to the Philippines then God sent him here to pray for me isn't that correct isn't that correct because without a miracle I can never make that trip but if he sent you here he's got plans [Music] would you come and pray for me today [Music] Warrior a living testimony O Lord of your power so God you're the same yesterday today and
