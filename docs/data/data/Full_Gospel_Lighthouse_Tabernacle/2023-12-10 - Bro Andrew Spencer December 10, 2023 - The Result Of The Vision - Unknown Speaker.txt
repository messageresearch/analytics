mocking when Jesus did speak he said your daughter's not dead she's just asleep then he turned to the unbelievers and he told them all go home they heard him say leave me in death [Music] alone then he laid his hand upon the child and he looked at right in the eye he said all power in Heaven and Earth it belongs to me and with a voice that sound like thunder he heard death the Thunder and he said

us with some wonderful singers and and we could go on and on and on and call on people that don't want to be called on but uh we're very thankful that for a house that loves to worship and just want to make a few mention uh a few dates mention to you here uh just a reminder as we move forward into the uh crunching hours of of December here uh our play our Christmas play will be on December the 23rd and uh that'll be Saturday night then there'll be regular service there on that Sunday morning December the 24th and brother Ron will be speaking that our church dinner will be on December the 31st and we'll get you all the dates and everything and the times and all of that it'll be after the church service that morning it'll be at we's cave and the very next day if you can be remembering us I'll be flying out to uh preach in Belgium there with Brother David ion in a youth camp there with also a few Brothers uh brother Matthew Watson they're from South Carolina so I I would definitely covet your prayers upon that and also want to make mention this is a few months out but it's something that we've we've longed to do for quite some time and longed to have and just never have worked out but we're going to have brother Bisal son-in-law brother Tom Ray and brother Michael Ray here with us in March uh March 16th and 17th and so we just wanted to put that down on your calendar for you we're very ecstatic about that and uh and uh so we just know that the Lord's got some great things in in store for us amen did you enjoy the word of the Lord last night amen amen thank you brother R amen if you have your Bibles today we'd like to look over in the scriptures here today in Luke chap 1 and verse 13 Luke 1 and verse 13 and would just like to take a thought that the lord has laid upon our heart for this service today on the result of the vision the result of the vision amen him remembering all those the needs are Brother David Farmer and the other needs here locally we know that we're very needy people but our Lord Jesus Christ is the one that supplies all of our needs amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we read the word today Heavenly Father we approach you father Lord in the most humble way that we know how father Lord we humble our hearts before the great I am and we recognize that we're insufficient on our own Lord Jesus and any man that has power father in their in their human might would be able to pull back the pages of this Bible but Lord it takes you father to come and reveal the very things that are laying there for many people have read it for many a years and read it like a newspaper but they miss what you're saying God I'm so thankful to know that you've given us an hour where we can see the things that are clearly given unto us in this generation and father the Bible would say the secret things that are the secret things belong to the Lord but the things that are revealed belong unto us and father we have such an inheritance here Lord to recognize Lord that you have not held back the Revelation for this hour but you have given it out freely to your your children in this hour to give us a rapturing faith to leave this whole world and to pull us aside father Lord as it as it is Lord it laid out in the scriptures to come out of her my people we recognize the pole of the Holy Spirit drawing us away from the things of the world but closer to you and we invite you father today as we've studied these thoughts looked over them we ask that the anointing of almighty God that we've stayed under that we've prayed to be in Lord to for you to come and take the the the hearer and the speaker and you begin to manifest your power with healing and demonstrations I know that there are many that are listening by the way of the internet today that have a need in their body and I would ask that the angel of the Lord would rise with healing in his wings and would go by the ones that are laid up on a couch or on a bed there maybe sick and different different afflictions in their body maybe they'll archive this and have needs father I pray that while they're hearing these words may they feel the touch of the mighty one restoring their bodies back to them Lord we give it to you father today to have your preeminence in this service so father we'll be careful to serve you and praise you and give you all the glory and honor that is due unto your name so in the name of Jesus Christ we pray these things and ask your blessings upon the word today in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Luke chap 1 and verse 13 and the Bible said that but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine or strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elias to turn the hearts of the father to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just and to make ready a people prepared for the Lord and Zachariah said unto the angel whereby shall I know this for I am an old man and my wife well stricken in years and the angel answering said unto him I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God and I am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these Glad Tidings and behold Thou shalt be dumb and not be able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season and the people waited for Zacharias and marveled that he had carried so long in the temple and when he come out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remain speechless may God bless his word you may be seated today in the presence of the Lord as we stated it we' like to speak to you upon this thought on the result the result of the vision and we know that by the scripture and by the message message that we recognize that Zacharias had every reason to believe what God was saying unto him because he had many examples that were laying there he had won the father of faith our Father Abraham that had had been changed back and and and and had received a supernatural Miracle by a an acquaintance with meeting with MDC there but yet there was something on the inside of Zacharias that could not allow him to believe and we recognize that that that that God is calling calling for in this hour he is asking for a people to believe him and that's what Jesus would say that when the son of man will return will he find Faith because God is looking for somebody that is going to believe his word and if there's going to be somebody to believe the word there's going to be a word that is prepared for them to believe in and the Bible says here in Revelations 1 and verse 10 that I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice at of a trumpet and I saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it under the seven churches which are in Asia under Ephesus and under Samia and under pergamus and under thara and Sardis and Philadelphia and under Le Osa and I turned to see the voice isn't that amazing I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one lik un to the son of a man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the patch with a golden girdle and his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like a Define brass as if they were burned in a furnace and his voice and the and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two- wided sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength and when I saw saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death that scripture right there is absolutely amazing right there is that he had the ability to say that I am he that liveth and I was dead but I am alive forever more I think that's amazing script scripture that nobody nobody has ever been able to say those things except for our Lord Jesus Christ but notice what he says to John write these things which thou Hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter and the Mystery of the Seven Stars which th sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches so John was seeing John was was caught up into a day that was not his day but it was the Lord's day as the Bible is said here but we recognize that that that John was in the spirit and we recognize that if we're ever going to get anything from God we've got to be in the spirit of of God at that moment to catch the Revelation because John had to be in the spirit of the Lord to catch these Revelations from Jesus Christ and we recognize that what John was looking at was something that was not necessarily pertaining to the the hour that he was living in but he was looking at Jesus in the forecast of the future events of his churches of all the way from the Ephesian Church age all the way to the Le Osan Church age and that's what a vision is it is the forecast of future events that are setting out there and that's I think it's a wonderful thing that we are living in the hour that we're living in is because we are able to look and see and for tell things we have tomorrow's newspaper laying right here in front of of us by because of a word that was given unto us in this generation by Malachi 4 that we're not just pondering on these things we're not just wondering about these things but we have tomorrow's newspaper and it's it's very it's very disturbing for our for our enemy and his aspect of looking upon Upon Our Lives is that we already know what's coming ahead of us before it ever gets there and it gives us great courage and faith and it gives us great knowledge to know that we're not here alone tonight we're not here facing these things that we're looking out upon Sodom and Gomorrah that are that we're looking out there and we see the wickedness of the world but we already have somebody that has told us that these things are going to be and we know that the Bible said in habac Chapter 2 that the Lord and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time and that's the thing that a lot of times people get caught up in God's process of time or in what we would say in the delay of time but God has a certain season in which a vision is going to be made manifest and you know God is God Is Not shook by by World by world events he's he's simply working at his timeline according to his plan and I think it's a wonderful thing to know that God has got great compassion upon his people he's got great compassion upon his people that he's not going to let anything happen to them that he doesn't already know and he he's got great compassion in bringing the word of God to pass so we recognize that that if as brother Williams said it last night that God had locked up on the inside of him attributes that had to be released so we recognize that that that we're living in an hour that we are called for a body change so we recognize that there are things that are locked up in almighty God that God has got to release to us in this generation to get us out of the condition that we're in so it tells us if God's got those things locked up on the inside of him then he must be the key to unlock the door to a Rapture for us so it gives us great courage to know that our God is a god of compassion Hallelujah he's a god of compassion this is not just this is not just a book that that we read as a newspaper but this is our book Hallelujah this is our inheritance this is our love letter I know a lot of people read it but I I want to make it personal to you this morning this is my book this is your book this morning and to think that today that we're not just another class of people we're a Divinity class of people we're a people that's called to come up a little bit higher a people that have been given a key Hallelujah we have been given a key to take a step one of these days hallelujah people that are built to enter in to the promises of almighty God I think it's wonderful thing to know that God has a bride that is completely one with him because the word on the inside of them when it's wrote and it becomes on the inside of you it makes the word for the hour made manifest in the generation that we're living in and we recognize as the body of Jesus Christ that we are literally living out the vision of almighty God and that's the thing about God is that God God he he he sometimes we look at it and we see the cogs of God's prophecy and we see them and we know that God's prophecy see they brother Brandon would say it like this that the cogs of Prophecy they grind slow but they're true so don't get caught up in the delay and don't get caught up in time because God has an appointed time for the vision to come to pass it's just like in our scripture reading when Zacharias was sitting there he was already laid out there here he was a priest he was supposed to know the scriptures but there an angel was speaking to him about his son that was going to come forth that was laying there seven 112 years before Zacharias ever met this Angel Gabriel there was one that had a conversation Isaiah had had a conversation with almighty God and said look there's going to be one and he's going to be crying in the wilderness he's going to be crying in the wilderness his voice is going to attract the generation that is elected to hear it to think that there Zacharias was in the moment maybe he couldn't see it with his eyes but there it was laying in letter form for him but then when the angel begin to release these certain seeds at a certain time he had to recognize that prophecy was in fulfillment in the moments and I think is a lot of times people miss or they the presence of God is unrecognized and they don't miss they miss where the seat of God is being deposited and Zacharias Hallelujah was sitting in a moment of time and the vision was for that appointed time and there Zacharias was in the moment Hallelujah he was in the moment of the Fulfillment of Prophecy but he doubted it but this is the generation where seeds have been deposited where prophecy has been been spoken over you but you're not a people that are going to doubt the promises of God you're stepping right into the fruition of it you're stepping right into it if Gabriel was there with Zacharias Gabriel was here with William brandham and he stood there and said I am sent from the presence of all almighty God it's that same one that stood there on the right hand side of the altar while he was talking about John coming and fulfilling Isaiah 40 and3 it was the same one that stood by the altar at the right hand side of William brandham and stood right there and told him I am the one that was sent don't you worry about your strange birth you are sent here you're not just an ordinary man you're a prophetic man you're a messenger to this generation because I've got an elect lady out there that is waiting on you William brandom what was it William Brandon was stepping in to the into his position of Malachi th things that had been laying there for thousands of years seeds that had been deposited into the ground and William bram's in a cave talking with an angel what is he getting he's getting a commission to gather these seeds together yeah woo come on somebody he wasn't up there by himself he was up there with prophecy hanging over top of him and I think it's amazing thing to think about tonight or today is that there were seeds that was deposited that was going to come to pass we could look out there and see we could see sister Brenda Thon before she was a CLI and there God had saw her God had saw her as she was but he was not going to leave her where she was but he had something that was going to come forth I'd say this that God had you in his mind in that cave ah yes sir he had you in his mind what was it John when John stepped into the position a prophecy what was it he looked like Elijah he dressed like Elijah he preached like Elijah he ate like Elijah he was a wild man up there eating honey and and Locust things that I wouldn't dare think about eating but yet it was his it was under I think it's amazing that maybe people don't understand your position as the body of Jesus Christ and maybe men didn't understand why John was doing like he was doing but he was under the anointing of the hour that he was living in John could have been anything but yet there was prophecy that was sitting over top of him that he was going to have the spirit of Elijah upon his ministry that he was going to forun the first coming of Christ now William Brandon with that gift upon his life could have done anything with that he could have set on presidential boards but because there was anointing upon his life he had to stay true to the anointing that was there there's a lot of people that are sitting here that could have been something in this world in the aspect of the world of what they see men could have been lawyers men could have been politicians but because there's an anointing on your life you take brother Gabriel you think about how the Lord got a hold of him and he rose from the bottom all the way to the top in a matter of moments when men that have spent years upon years trying to get to that position but he had an anointing upon his life now that's just a sign in the natural but how much greater is it in the spiritual that we rise to our position come on somebody if you see something working in the natural it's a sign that God is working in the spiritual as well come on somebody if God blesses you on your job and you turn around and bless God with it then God can turn around and bless you in the spiritual with it well you see there was an elect generation that John was going to preach to John was going to preach to a people you see what he was under he was under that Elijah Ministry and he was going to preach to them and his ministry was going to turn the hearts of the father to the children but John could not fulfill Malachi 45 and six of turning the heart of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers but he was going to fulfill one portion of that why it's because he was under his message he was under his anointing it was the power of Prophecy I think it's amazing to think about the power of the pool of Prophecy when you think about prophecies that were laying there in the scripture before John ever got there to think about it that it literally pulled John to it it pulled him to it it it pulled Zacharias to it what was it it was laying there so we had to fulfill it you think about this that that John was the voice of one crying in the wilderness and that John literally had the ability by the preaching of his message to pull people out of their cities to pull people out of their sin and make them go down there and wash in the muddy rivers of Jordan it was a pool of Prophecy that he was under and the Els always catch it and that's what William brandom said in things that are are inin made clear by prophecy he said not one time has it ever missed he said for who are predestinated will see it to see it we see it he said Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father's given me will come he said it's the word joining with the word he said it can't do nothing else so you can't do nothing else whether you want to or whether you want whether you try you can't do nothing else but join up to this word brother Steven Byers come to me when he first when he first come to the message here and he'd come here a few times and then you wouldn't see him for a little bit he'd come here a few times and he wouldn't see him for a little bit and he come to me at one of these Church dinners that a lot of people say you shouldn't have in churches praise God but he come to me he come to me and told me he said look he said I want you to know something he had one of them he had he had that face on like I need to talk business with you for a minute this ain't just one of them casual acquaintances this ain't just one of them passing by a moment I got to have a moment with you he said I want you to know he said when I when I first started seeking the Lord he said I went to all he said I made up in my mind I was going to go to all of these churches and I was going to find one that had the truth and he said I I went to about every one that I knew of is that right I went to all the ones in this community he said but God kept leading me right back here you see it was a word joining up with a word there's a lot of people that walked in here and they couldn't connect with it but because there's prophecy hallah because there's prophecy that's laying right here it was something that was attracting the attention of Steven bers but God was not finished with stepen he went after his wife sister Tara now there's no man that can make how that works up but the vision how many times did you pray for how many prayer lines did you come through but God had a time for the season when the vision was going to be made manifest and when God reveals it there ain't one devil in hell that can rock you off of that Revelation it's because the vision don't get shook up about it the vision's for an appointed [Applause] time the Bible said in Samuel 1st Samuel 3 that that the word of the Lord was precious in those days because there was no open Vision we know that by the Bible Solomon told us that where there is no vision that the people perish you see that's what a vision is it's the direct word of the lord it's the direct word of the Lord and think I don't I don't want to spend much time right here but to think that the word of God was being left alone in the days of Samuel because men were going out and making mockery of The Voice or making mockery of the House of almighty God but God had promised that he was going to meet the need of that hour so God gave Samuel a vision and to think that today that God is not going to let his word just lay there uneffective he's not going to just he's not just going to let it lay there but God has promised that he was going to meet the need of the hour and he always does that and it's always the voice of God that meets the need of the hour and I'll say it's like this we don't need some emotional workup to meet the need of the hour today we don't need some we don't need some music or we don't need something to work us up we don't need some man to to come and try to pump us up it's the word of God that is Raising this generation it's seed life that's coming to life what is it it's the seed being deposited again when you think about it begin to talk about these things with my girls this week we begin to think about we were talking about the about the martyrs that had in the Dark Ages how that they gave their life and they they would sit there in those coliseums and things and and and the and the enemy would feed these feed these Christians to lions and they would they would they would take their clothes off of them and they would and you look at it and you look out through look out through the fox's book of Martyrs and you see all those things laying there that that short hair actually started in Rome and there when when when Christian sisters would walk down the street with their long flowing hair that is perfectly in line with First Corinthians 11 that there they those they they identified themselves as being Christians and when those when those men and those women would see those sisters with that long hair though those Romans would take them and they would dip them Sisters hair in tar and they would light it on fire so that it would burn from the burn all the way up from their roots to their scalp they would feed them to Lions they would they would try to scare them to death and if you go to reading the fox's booking mors Martyrs there you'll see that it said that those Christians when they were fed to the lions that they died with a smile on their face you that really must upset the enemy we're trying to put fear tactics upon them to make them cause them not to be a Christian but the more they did the more they were happy to give themselves over because you see what it was you would think in your own mind there's no way that I there's no way I could do that but you see they were under the anointing of the ox anointing they were sitting there under that anointing so they were able to give their lives over to that it's because of the anointing that they were under and it's a lot of people that can't understand why you preach or why you live the way that you live it's because you are under a different anointing of the hour you are under the anointing of a vision the anointing of an egole you see you can't preach you can't live what Wesley lived you can't live out what Luther lived they can't run like you ran because they can't fly like you're flying you see you've got a message to run with because you think about this that God had in this hour an anointing that was going to be released over over this generation and prophetic Insight one that had the ability to see past the dark dismal days of denominational Brokenness that had broke up the body of Jesus Christ in such a way so God had to have a prophetic Ministry that would come in this generation and take a broken body and bind it back up together that's what William Brandon would say over and over again the sickest body that I know of is the body of Jesus Christ denominations had broke her down but this prophetic Ministry took the Seven Seals and wound back up those things that were broken and tied them back together that's why Satan hates a people of vision is because hallelujah it's because this word has tied back together the body of Jesus Christ and brought healing to the body that's why you can stand there and say John 14:12 Mark 16 John 15 and 7 and all of these things line back up together it's because the word has become the word what was it when Paul was standing there as a murderer but in the next spot in Acts chapter n he's standing there and the word saw the word you'd have been in the same shape you'd have crucify Jesus if you could have but there's no way you could have gave up on Jesus there's no way you could turn your back on Jesus because the word saw the word on the inside of you what is it what is it you're anointed for the hour that you're living and you're anointed for the moment brother random would talk about just to capture capture some things here as we move forward is that brother Brandon would tell us about visions and and we know that in the message there's over 8,300 visions that are caught on tape and brother random would tell us about a vision how that it how that it would completely weaken his body and he said it's kind of like it's kind of like a man from a circus like looking in a circus he said he said if I'm standing up on my toes he said and looking through a peephole and I could tell you that on the inside of there he said he said if I'm doing that on my own and I'm standing up there and I'm looking through this peephole I could tell you there's a man in there and he's got a giraffe he's leading around a tiger or a lion and different things he's working through this circus he said but if the man of the Arena came and lifted me up so that I could see those things he said it wouldn't weaken me like that he said that's the way he said that's the way he said when you get to pulling on me he said it pulls he said it pulls the very it pulls the very strength of the very virtue out of me I think it's amazing thing to watch the interpretation of the vision begin to come to pass you can see you can there's there's thousands of visions that we could go over today about where William brandham was and but to think about that there were visions that was laying there about a body that would come a body that would be without spot a body that would be without blemish a body that would be bone of his bone life of his life word of his word power of his power and to watch that come in manifestation because Jesus would say in John 5 and 24 that verily verily I say unto you that he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and brother manam said he said that word heareth he said it doesn't mean hear with your ear he said it means to understand with your heart it means to be revealed to and he that heareth or understandeth or it's been revealed to and believeth on me hath everlasting life so it shows right there that he was depositing Mysteries to a certain people it's Christ in you the hope of glory is that right that's the mystery now notice what brother random said he said how that those great mysteries of those fulfilling of God taking and bringing it to himself he said manifested in the age of human beings and in the Stream of human beings and in the company of human beings to make his word made manifested in the day notice he did not he did not deposit this to Angels he did not deposit this to principalities he did not deposit this to Demons they knew who he was the Angels know who he is but he deposited these Mysteries to human beings that needed Redemption notice what he said he said it started in the Easter rising of the sun he said but to do the same thing as the sun sets in the west what is it it is the attraction on the mountain it's God fulfilling prophecy up there what happened on Mount sh it was God fulfilling prophecy what happened up there what happened up there when Jesus come riding up there on the F the coat of an ass what was it he was fulfilling prophecy that's what William brandham said in the attraction on the mountain he said what happened on Mount Sunset it was God fulfilling prophecy right there again that is what the attraction is it's Isaiah 53 Hallelujah hallelujah what is it it was things that was laying there he said but now he said we can say it's history he said because these events have been made clear unto us what was it it was once prophecy but now it's history and one of these days God has spoke that there's going to be a people that go by the way that go by the way of the air you're not going by the way of the Grave you give me you give me me he give me some Liberty and next weekend I'm going to preach to you on a thought on the much awaited departure but there is a people that have been longing for this moment they've been longing and there's such Agony on the inside of this body they're waiting for it but he didn't manifest it to angels He didn't manifest it to Trump he didn't manifest it to Putin but he manifested to a little bitty old insignificant woman that was throwing out the wash one day but she saw the ranch standing there Hallelujah and he saw something on the inside of that little body that exhibited a part of himself Hallelujah you might think yourself so insignificant but do you realize you're fulfilling prophecy William Brandon said that when that little girl took that wash water out there he says she was barefooted well says a sign of humility it was a sign of humility she didn't think herself worthy and you find people that think theirself something you can find them walking out the door you can find people that think they need to be called on to preach or called on to sing or called on to do this that or the other and if they don't get called on they don't get to they don't get elected to go to this camp or that camp or that meeting or that meeting they get they get that they thought thems a little bit higher than somebody else but that's not to weit almighty God the way to get to God is to humble yourself and this little lady is a humble lady and when she was doing what nobody else wanted to do Hallelujah there he found her he found her what did the woman say in songs The Song of Solomon I have longed for him I have long for him on my bed but if you're going to find him you got to get up off of your bed and you got to go searching for him throughout the city and he said ask and you shall receive knock and it shall be open it's time Hallelujah that this little body recognizes your humility has brought you to Divinity hallelujah hallelujah this okay this morning I'm enjoying it what is it it's prophecy that's being fulfilled you think about when William Bram would stand there he'd be dealing with a patient and you're looking for the outcome of the vision and he would often times he would sit there and he would pray for patience and he would tell them now in just three days you're going to get sick like never before he said because corruption is leaving your body he said just a little bit of time he said you're going to get sicker than ever before he said what is it he said it's the result of that cancer dying on the inside of you what is it you see now notice that sin that sickness is a result of sin so we understand that that that sickness is because there was sin that that happened in the Garden of Eden but William brandham said this he said if sickness is a result of sin he said then healing is a result of your salvation at Calvary so that you can look upon this that one sacrifice at the cross of Calvary your results I don't need your doctor's Resorts I don't need what the doctor says or I don't need what the scan says about you all I need to know is what the results of Calvary has said about you I was listening I was listening to to a tape this morning on the way to church and listen to it with purpose on this day the scripture is fulfilled and and and and brother Bram brother Bram calls out two people that were personally identified with and that's that's brother Charlie Mitchell that was there at brother fur's fur's congregation there in Christiansburg and and he would become Bosom Buddies with him and there Charlie Mitchell had had this tumor where he' worked down there in them coal mines all them years and he had this tumor on his left on his left in his left lung there and and and there brother random brother Brandon was at this at this convention at uh Park Park Middle School there and brother brandham is preaching and and many many of us have never been to the building I've been there before but many of us don't understand that brother brandham is actually preaching he's actually preaching there's one side of the audience on this side and there's a wall down the middle and there's there's people that are sitting on this side and brother bram's actually preaching in this direction so he's standing there and he doesn't see he doesn't see either side of them but he's preaching to them and there brother fer is on this side of the of this wall and Charlie Mitchell's on that side brother fure said that Charlie Mitchell was so sick the night before that he couldn't even make it into the building but then when William Brandon was preaching this day the scripture is fulfilled Charlie Mitchell is sitting on that side of the building and the rest of the other the of the brothers that came with Brother fure on that side of the building he said but when they heard William bham say I see you got that tumor on the inside of your left lung he said tears begin to roll down her eyes but notice notice he didn't just he didn't just say to him where it was he told him you're absolutely healed from it what was it you can either take the word of a prophet or you can deny the word of a prophet but Charlie Mitchell accepted William brandham didn't know Charlie Mitchell but the angel knew him Charlie Mitchell had a tumor in his lung but when that moment transpired the vision showed the result that the turmer was gone and he went back to the doctor and he took x-rays and the nurse brought the x-rays to the doctor and the doctor said you brought me the wrong x-rays Charlie Mitchell said no sir I've been to a healing meeting the results lined up with a vision hallelujah hallelujah if I can only capture your attention today whether you're on this side or on that side your results of the body change is in the [Applause] vision I don't have to see you and you don't have to see me but the results of Calvary has said that you're worthy to go in this body change you're worthy for the Rapture who cares what the devil says who cares what the mockers say Noah keep building that boat Moses keep preaching that message David keep dancing your way come on Daniel keep writing the scripture who care what they say the the proof is in the pudding the Vindication cannot be [Applause] mocked I feel so good I can speak in Tong wo Hallelujah you can't argue with this Vindicated word we had a man stand up in this building one time you excuse me but I'm preaching today when a man stand up in this building one time and tried to mock the Vindication but Jason Jackson was standing behind this pulpit and preached on the Vindication of the word of the hour that man stood up and mocked this message I'm sorry but the pillar fire stood up behind Jason Jackson and Vindicated what the man of God had spoke this ain't just William Brandon's Pillar of Fire this is your Pillar of Fire come on somebody this ain't just William bram's message this is your message and I have been Vindicated by the same Pillar of Fire living on the inside of my soul you may not see it on the over head you may not see it over your life but let your life prove Moses had been raised in a goodly home and a Godly home he'd been raised there under under his mom Jose bed prophecy had been told to him there's coming to deliver she believed it was him why did she believe that it's because her husband had spent some time in prayer he spent some time in prayer he'd been out there making brick and been making mortar but he come in at the night time brother brandham said that Joseph bed was real worried about him she was worried about amram because he he'd work all day and he'd pray all night he'd work all day and he'd pray all night brother bam said you could actually see it up his face that he was beginning to get pale because he wasn't eating enough and wasn't drinking enough and Joseph had a right he said but honey I'm praying about this because God said that there was a deliverer that was coming and how did josed talk to Moses and tell him said son I believe your him I believe your him now maybe you don't understand what I'm talking about right now because I'm talking about Moses but I'm trying to get the same thing to you you're the bride you're the bride and you may not say it that but you're the bride you're the bride God's body you are part of him you're the Royal bride of Jesus Christ maybe you don't see it right now but if you'll just take my word there's something that's been deposited on the inside of you little bride and the father has seen it that's why he's calling to you that's why there's a deep call it to the Deep come on Moses it's in you come on Moses he tried by his own intellectual conception and you tried going to an altar and you tried boohoo and but it didn't come but when Moses was standing before the pillar of fire he realized I'm the Vindication of Abraham's prophecy I'm the interpretation of a deliverer that's coming to deliver this children when you begin to read Zechariah Chapter 4 and he starts seeing those things how that the voice wakes up the Virgin and you can look at Matthew 25 and you can see that there's an Awakening that is happening to a lady as she fell asleep but the major difference between her and the others is that she's got oil the others are searching for it but even though she may have slumbered and slept for a little bit there was something that was laying there and that was these seven Thunders that woke up this sleeping body and now you don't have to worry you got a generation that's crying to say they're they're getting woke up to the fact that slavery slavery getting woke up to the fact that the LGBT qz is a part of is a part of God's plan they're getting trying to get woke up to those Saints but this body has been woke up by the Seven Seals that had thundered out and voice to her that you're another people you're a generation that's not going to taste death [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah what was it Isaiah was just a man like you were but the spirit of God could deal with him in such a way and inspiration would strike him and he would say that he that you're going to receive a sign that a virgin's going to conceive what is it it's a super sign it's a super sign it's the same way that prophecy has struck William brandham that I'm not not going to no longer call you church but I'm going to call you bride it's the same inspiration it's the same anointing it's the same Spirit of Christ that was working on Isaiah that was working in this generation inspiration would strike Isaiah and he would say Behold a virgin shall conceive behold you can call his name you shall call his name Emmanuel he'll be the Prince of Peace he'll be the Mighty God what was it it was the inspiration that was striking him at 800 years later the results were made manifest in a virsion well was it it was a seed forming had laying there all those times had been waiting for this moment when waiting what is it it's a seed that's building a body it's building a body it's just like in Luke 17:30 that in the last days a son of man he shall arise and when the son of man is being revealed these things are going to take place and you certainly see Luke 17:29 and 17 30 when you look out there and you see Sodom out there and they receive their Messengers they received their Messengers Billy Graham and or Roberts are down there preaching to them but there's been one that stayed up here with this elect lady there's been one that stayed up here and told her that you're not going to have to go down there you're not going to have to worry about that you're not a part of that group you ain't got to worry about if there's 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 you're my people I'm staying up here with you and mecdc has been sitting up here eating honey and milk and he's eating and feasting upon the seven seal and it's feasting on the seven trumpets and it's telling you that this is your border this is your inheritance this is your promise come on somebody you say why you keep preaching about them prodical coming back because they are why you keep preaching that cancer is defeated because it is this is my border this is my inheritance this is my Throne this is my domain hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what was it William Brown said that that word had been circling for 800 years it had been circling the earth for 800 years he said but when it found Mary he said that prophecy hooked in the womb of Mary it hooked in her womb now notice Not only was she virgin in her body but she was virgin in her faith she had not been manhandled in her faith she had a childlike faith that she could believe this was so Supernatural the supernatural was just natural to God It's Supernatural to us this girl this girl ain't heard anything about this this girl ain't seen anything like this ain't nobody else talking about this but this girl had such a virgin Faith about her that she could look upon the same angel that Zachariah had looked at and he turned down because he slightly doubted the word but her virgin Faith said be it unto me according to Thy word that's the same way with this little body right here you may not be big in number you may may not be like the rest of the dominations of thousands of people but you are so much more powerful because you have aligned yourself with prophecy prophecy that is not laying there and has left there unfulfilled but it's prophecy that you're riding on you're riding on it I sent it to my family this week my brother man is preaching there and trying to do God a service and being outside of his wheel and brother BR was talking about Elijah and he's going up on them terets of fire and he said one of these days he said you're going to go up there and unhook the horses from the bushes that are waiting on you you this prophecy that was waiting on Mary had been circling and looking for her now you think about this you think about it in this light that their prophecy was hunting for her but she was hunting for it as well there's something on the inside of you that keeps calling you to come up a little bit higher what is it it's the holy spirit that is building a body and you watch as Mary received that word what did it do it was not part God and part Mary he was all God and it built a body a body that did not know sin a body that didn't understand a body that did not have to know it but it was building a body a body that could understand and be Redemption that's the same thing that is happening right now the elect of every generation you can look you can look in there and you can see the elect under Paul that there polycarp polycarp ran and he caught the message under Paul and he preached a message you can look under Wesley and you can see men like Spurgeon and Finny and Wigglesworth and they catch it and they run with it it's because it was their message to run with it so if William brandham ran his race then there's got to be a body that attaches herself to a vision actually runs this race because William brand said he said if I taught you a Methodist message he said it wouldn't take no effect upon you he because this is bride time because the predes at seed are laying there that will only be watered by the type of water that's GI for that seed notice what he says and what Visions are he said a vision is God by a word of knowledge dropping to the person to foresee or foresee or something tell something that has been or something that will be again he would say again he would say this that a vision never heals anyone a vision only brings the reality of a supernatural being present and then in doing this it brings Faith to the people if you've ever if you ever in quaint uh uh uh ever been a part of that many of you understand Deja Vu that you you feel like you're in this moment right now and you've seen it before but a vision is something that you have clearly seen before it ever happens and you can go around and tell people that this is is going to happen this is this is how it's going to happen that's why William brandom could say there he said now I can't move the Hat because the vision said that the Hat's got to be in this certain spot he said I could go do that he said but it would interrupt the vision so things have got to be in their particular spot and you you you try to do that sometimes you try to move people in their position you try to put them there and you try your very best come on now we got a Rapture to take come on now but if you did it on your own then Satan can talk them out of it but if the vision happens according to the will of God then there's not one devil in hell that can rob the Revelation out of that person so you ain't got to work them up to it you ain't got to make it happen Isaiah 53 says he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes I am healed it's not my job to make it come to pass it's myob job to believe it it's not my job to make the vision it's my job to step into it but it's like it's you're seeing something in the future something that's going to happen you already you you know it you ever you ever had that Deja Vu it's a funny feeling when you're sitting there like man I've been here before but to see a vision and you can whisper it to somebody and tell them that this is going to happen exactly like this this person's going to walk to the Altar and that person's going to come up and they're going to ask for prayer like this and there are certain things there are certain things that the Lord will drive to you and you think what does that matter like but it's to show that God's God one of one one instance there's there's several but I'll just tell like this there's one instance that one time we was walking in at a gas station and there and there was we walked in we walked in and there was this blond-headed girl that was hanging out there dad walks in beside me and said now look he said this is going to happen when these he said when that woman walks out there's going to be two homosexuals that attach thems to that woman they get in the same car and we watched that thing we stepped outside we watched that thing it happened exactly like that and I always thought about that why in the world did that matter it was to show that God is still God it was like the time that dad was at Disney World and and there Whitney and Davey had had the Lord had showed him that he was going to that they were going to buy him this certain gift and they come out without that gift he thought well maybe I was wrong but Ms went by but months went by and they were sitting down at the table and I was sitting there and dad had already told me that this is what the Lord had showed me I think it's pretty amazing that God knows where you're at no matter where you are if you're in Disney World or where whatever it is is but there there he he told me he said now he said there going to be this certain piece it's it's got bail and the Beast in it you don't believe in Disney World let me show you a vision that happened in Disney World so we're sitting at the table and this is months later months later there sitting down and David Whitney said we got a gift for you Dad said I can tell you exactly what it is laid out told everything about it how it was and everything how'd you know he said the Lord showed me that and you think well what does that got to do it's to show that God is God over every little circumstance of your life if he cares about a little bitty fishy he surely cares about your job situation if he cares about a little trinket he surely cares about the sickness that he's already paid for you all he's wanting you to do is capture that the vision has already been made manifest and all you got to do is step into the vision come on now when those priests when they've been told to March down there and judge Joshua chapter 3 and step into the river and it was going to open up unto them it's not going to open until you step into it now God is not that kind of a god that is going to push you through a pre and say blessed is he that overcome but he's wanting you to do something so you got to take a leap of faith he's wanting you to take a leap of faith well I'm too sick to come to church and there's too many people down there that cause too much drama I'll tell you the people that say that there's too much drama in places are the people that cause drama you know my back's been hurting me my head's been hurting me and I've got this awful sickness let me ask you something what message are we living under when they brought them in there in wheelchairs and carts and and they took them in there and they brought them in there in stretchers well I got the flu brother Andrew I understand that I'm not trying to I'm talking about people that feel like they can't well I I I've been out for three months and you know this thing still bother me let me tell you the greatest place you can be in is the house of God if they brought them in there in wheelchairs and William brandom's meeting and were still under the mighty Angel's message then they ought to be able to come in here in wheelchairs and no matter your complex no matter your stigmas no matter your situations I don't care where you are and I don't care what church you're going to I don't care if you're 10,000 Mi away from me and you gave up on God get back in church well don't talk about me like that brother Andrew I ain't talking about you I'm talking about somebody on the other side of the world they gave up on God because they ain't seen God moving on Australia like it's moving here why don't you get back in church and let yourself be the Revival come on somebody you ain't got to move here to be a part of the Revival start the Revival in your home come on come on somebody don't leave these people down here in Virginia worshiping alone

wish brother George Quinn a happy birthday we love you we love you brother George the Revival starts with you and if you were seen a part of that Vision Marching In Step then we need you we need you we can run this race with hard as hard as we can but we need you come on somebody this ain't the army with a poster of a man that's got a top hat on his head saying the Army need you this is the body of Jesus Christ and these are general orders we need you here we need you is strong like never before because we are facing demons on every side 200,000,000 demons that have been released against this generation but we need you and the vision says you're there and we've telling you that we love you and we need you and we're fighting for [Applause] you the Rapture is the word of the lord it's a vision it's going to transpire exactly how God has saw it it's exactly it's exactly like it's easy for you to look back and see William Brandon sitting there and he starts talking about he starts talking about a sister or he's he's there in the prayer line and he starts talking and he said now I see I see a doctor that's working on a on a cuddler girl back there and she's she's having surgery on her tonsil and when the doctor's having the surgery on her the the doctor actually paralyzes her and while William brandom was saying this this sister this sister comes screaming out of the congregation said that's my baby that's my baby and she healed William brand he said all I can tell you is what I saw brother random said I went back to saying as I was saying faith is the substance of things hoped for and he said as I was saying that as I was saying that he said they're materializing in the building he said was cars running through the building and I rode before me and he said I looked out there and I saw a little bitty girl with a baby doll in her hand coming down there walking with her mama he said thus sayith the Lord your baby's healed and in that moment that little girl received her healing it's just like your rapture your vision you're going to Simply sit there and you're going to walk right into it how did it happen that quick that quick that's where the Rapture is in a moment and a twinkling of an eye quicker than you can blink your eye you can't imagine it you can't imagine it quick enough and it's going to happen to you it's that quick sister Bruce one time sister Bruce was one time was praying for a sister she it ain't just it ain't just for everybody it ain't just for the preacher it ain't just for the prophet but sister Bruce you can go hear this on tape the sister Bruce is sitting there she's praying she's praying for this lady's got a cancer in her throat and and brother BR brother brand sees her and she's sitting there she praying for brother Chris and got her hands upon her then all of a sudden all of a sudden brother brandom the spirit of the Lord begins to discern and tells exactly where that thing is that woman that woman had that cancer in her throat brother mam said that cancer got scared and jumped out of her throat throat you talking about powerful people that you are could you imagine if cancer got a jumping fit in this place today and started jumping its way out of this church well what about Sin what about the attributes of the fall when you go to lay in your hands on people you better expect the impossible to be fulfilled because we're not just a wimpy people we're not just a school lady we're the Queen of Heaven and we're talking to almighty God the most powerful being that there ever has been that rolled worlds off of his fingertips we are approaching the Majesty of Heaven you got a few more minutes Isaiah prophesied that a virgin was going to conceive and the Shepherds were a result of Isaiah's prophecy the angel singing at Jesus's birth was a result of Isaiah's prophecy the wise men that found that found Jesus when he was 2 years old was a result of the prophecy that was laying there when when when balum stood there and prophesied that a star was going to rise out of Jacob and a scepter would rise out of Judah to think that there they were as a result of the prophecy and you may not realize these wise men may not have realized they were simply following a star but William brandham said in the message we have seen a star and came to worship him he said that star went across every observatory in the land but nobody else seen it but those that were elected to see it that same star that seven star has been raised over this generation and they missed it but you have saw his star and you've come to worship the King of Kings and the Lord of lords to think how he felt as a son of man is holding Paul in his hand and he's holding irenius and he's holding Martin he's holding Luther and he's holding Wesley and he comes down the last star and he's got him in his hand and he comes to Le oosa and he sends him out in his power under his anointing brother Chris can you imagine how we feel maybe we'll get to it next weekend on the longer way for departure and he's got him in his hand and the Bible says in Revelations that the time is at hand and he says now it's time to go there's a lot of people talking about stars there's a lot of a lot of people breaking out their telescopes and looking at new stars looking at new galaxies but you've seen a star in this generation I ain't talking about some Hollywood wood star I ain't talking about some movie star and I ain't talking about some basketball star but I'm talking about the seven star that's got the power on the inside of him because the son of man has been standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he's standing right here you're not alone the son of man is standing here that's why William Bam could stand there under you the authority of it and he could release a message because the son of man said if it wasn't for him about coming to my room and about 12 o'l in the day i' have made a horrible mistake but because of you but because of where you were and because what you were going to go through the angel would not allow a man to make a mistake so he had to release it the son of man had to release the right revelation of the moment because God had a people that needed full Deliverance you imagine William brandom seen thousands of Visions he spent his whole life in it but he would say the the greatest the greatest and the most significant we standing there and you hear it on tape is Sir is this a sign of the end and he starts taking you through the vision he start taking you through that there couldn't be no more than seven no less than five five angels that are coming he he starts telling all these things he thought it was his death and he he thought it was these certain things and he flipped over his Bible he flipped over his Bible to Romans 9 33 behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone a rock a stumbling Stone and these men had stumbled at this they they they'd fell at this they couldn't get past this but this was the great stone that had been rejected but notice it was in this hour that it was going to be received and William bham is sitting there and he's telling us about these things if you're a newcomer and you don't know where to start at listening the message go to 1962 and listen to the last two services in 1962 and listen to it all the way to 1965 and then start over you'll get a full Comm culmination of the Elijah Ministry from right there and William brandham takes us through 1962 and he takes us through the vision and three month later he's sitting up there at Mount Sunset and the King sword appears in his hand not a king sword but the king sword you can go to listen to Fred sofman and them brother's testimonies people get mixed up on them dates that happened up there in March the 10th and 24th and all those things but William brandham told them that them seven angels had appeared and they were waiting for him right there in that moment they're waiting on him don't you understand they were waiting for the prophet to get there don't you understand those angels are gathered in this room waiting for you to get to your spot they're here brother bandham said in a church age book the angels are in heaven breathlessly awaiting your arrival maybe I'm preaching you next week's service right now today but they're breathlessly awaiting your if angels are awaiting it can you imagine almighty God he's awaiting your arrival I've held it to this time now go back it's time you've had your first pole you've had your second pole but this is the great pole you caught some little fishies in the first caught some decent ones and the second one but it attracted too many crowds but this one's going to attract the rainbow trout kind of people genuine Believers what is it he was bringing back evidence from that world and William brandham said William brandham said that if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're an candidate for the association of the Unseen World and if you do not have the Holy Ghost you are not a candidate to understand the Unseen World that's why it passes over so many observatories and they miss it but you're a candidate for it you're right here in this moment right here in this hour he's waited for you and you're here he's brought back evidence is is a good land them themselves up there they're holding your name those Mysteries they're holding who you are what is this what is this this is marriage and divorce you have divorced your old man and you'll be married to almighty God what is it it's the invisible Union with the Christ and his bride right here on Earth it's invisible because a lot of people are missing what's happening but the vision said that you're going to be a part of it when I when when when Moses had said that it was a good land that it was a land that was flowing with milk honey and you read when Isaiah when mil excuse me when mecdc came and he sat down what did he eat he ate butter milk and honey and what did they go in there Caleb and Joshua when 10 other spies denied what was happening they denied they denied that they could receive it brother Barham said that they had a pent Pentecostal cocktail up there he said they had the wine they had the fruit of the vine he said they had wine and they had they had they had they had milk and honey over there he said it was a Pentecostal cocktail he said it was every bait that a Pentecostal needed right there he said they had stimulation they had butter and they had honey and they had milk well let me tell you something they come back and a lot of them said you can't take it a lot of them said you can't have the Holy Ghost a lot of them said he ain't for you but there was somebody that was of another spirit that was one of Caleb and Joshua and said it's a good land and he stealed the people and said we're well able to overcome it and we've had a job will stand in this generation and said you're more than able to make a Rapture you're more than able to overcome you're more than able to make it I don't care where your prodal are but they're coming I don't care how sick you are but your healing is coming I don't care how far you are down sin but the rapture's got your name on it come on stand with me this morning somebody bless the name of almighty God hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah blessed be the name
