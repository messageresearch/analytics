our precious brother thank you for invitation and and we certainly praying for you and we know we are in a battle amen but we are on the winning side and before i go any further i bring you greetings from the church beg home from our pastor brother yatzek and all the congregation our assembly is in poland but half of the church comes from czech across the border and uh we love this message forgive me my english it's far from perfection you know so so take what i think okay so if i do a mistake there is a spirit of god amen because the god we serve is the same in our country he's the same here and this message is equipped from the power from above hallelujah praise the lord we know satan is warring against that little group that is called the bride of jesus christ but brothers and sisters we're so close we are overcomers we are not quitters we are overcomers there is another nature inside of us and this message revealed that nature hallelujah praise the lord and and i thank the lord for the message of this hour you know nobody talked me into that message i am so thankful for that because if somebody would talk me in there would be maybe somebody else to talk me out but i realize more and more that i am part of that message aren't you happy for that you know there is something inside of the bride of jesus christ that was quickened by the message of that hour praise the lord just if you can open john chapter four uh two of us came you know my brother robert he's from poland i am from czech and uh we're trying to bring you one one meeting or one sermon praise the lord because we all preach from the open book the book of redemption was opened aren't you happy for that all the mysteries were finished praise the lord not for our heads to be puffed up and so that we might have a intellectual knowledge of that message that's not enough what we need is the new birth what we need is the revelation that comes from above praise the lord that's why brother branham said what the church ought to be praying for the most is for the revelation because when the revelation strikes your heart you cannot be the same then the old things are passed away everything becomes new how come because of the revelation not that you know here but you know here hallelujah praise the lord amen oh hallelujah i felt a little bit tired we we came five hours and brother jackie benton he wanted to be here with us and he sent his worm christian greetings to you but it was just a little bit too much for him so uh so he stayed home and and i was feeling a little bit you know uh tired but uh when we came here and i heard you worship and now when we can speak about the lord and the message of the hour you know it quickens me from the inside hallelujah praise the lord we have something to be happy about let me take my coat off praise the lord you know i am a little evangelist i am not a smart person i don't know i cannot memorize all the quotes that i would like to know but there is something happening in my heart and i thank the lord for that it never left me it's always with me because it's in me praise the lord aren't you happy for that brother and sisters we're not talking about the message we're not only referring to the message we are the message of the hour because by the grace of god you know we must become word in flesh because the word always come to the flesh praise the lord and the spoken word is the original seed hallelujah john chapter 4 verse 24 god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth can you say amen to that god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth let's bow our heads heavenly father we come to you this evening lord we are a needy people father i need you lord and i ask you that you will take me out of the way and quicken this little thought that i have upon my heart let it be for encouragement for someone here lord lord bless our families and our church back home lord we thank you for the precious message of this our lord that there is something inside of our hearts that was quickened father and there are no devils no demons in hell that can take it away lord thank you father and bless this service we committed into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated praise the lord i just have a little thought upon my heart about true worshipers the true worshippers and and uh i'm i'm so thankful you know that we live in the hour that we live it's the golden age can you say amen because all that the bible was prophesying about and all that that was written there as a prophecy we are living at the end time when all those prophecies are being fulfilled before our eyes and you know when we see that happening there is something in the hearts of the bride because she is procrastinated to believe that message can you say amen and i'm so thankful to that that that's we are not believing men's ideas it was the prophet of god who was vindicated by the pillar of fire and it was he was the mouthpiece of god that spoke to us and we are here now in 2021 there is someone that is believing that there is an inner voice praise the lord for that oh glory to god there are some true worshipers hallelujah you know this is a special hour this is a rapture time this is a going home time how many of you feels like like that we can see the world is falling apart we in europe you know they said germany what a great economic they say it's the engine of the european union and they said well they they are so high there is nothing that can shake it the engine is choking they cannot go any further there is something happening all around the world because everything what can be shaken must be shaken but there is something that cannot be shaken oh glory to god satan sends some diseases he sends you know sicknesses he sends his demons but there is something that he cannot say brother and sisters how privileged people we are that we are not talking about it there is message inside of us living through us praise the lord for that hallelujah it's going home time amen this message came you know it's not the reformation age that we are living in amen they were under the men's anointing but today we received a message from above that is equipped with the power from above it's anointed with the anointing of the flying eagle it's not an eagle that is sitting somewhere you know a sitting eagle and you know the devil comes he's hammering on your on your feelings hey man how many of you can say amen to that he hammers me he comes to my head he sends thoughts amen but there is something inside of us brother branham said you cannot stop those thoughts coming but there is something that you can do you can shake it off and you can say i am a son of god i am a daughter of god there is something inside of my heart that answered the eagle scream glory to god praise the lord we were protesting to to to believe that message amen praise the lord this is a revelation time the time of the revealed word amen the time of the open book hallelujah when john heard his name when he was taken up before the throne of god you know his weeping was over because he heard his name something inside of her of him started to rejoice because the voice said weep not john and john was typing the pride praise the lord for that amen you know when and i was looking here in chapter of john you know that story very well but it's dear to my heart there is nothing new that i'm talking to you but it's coming from my heart as a part of my testimony you know why i was i was going i was born in the message family and and uh my dad was one of the first to accept the message back in 1968 in czech republic and uh he came out of the pentecostal church and and uh i was the last boy in the family and and you know the satan wanted to push me to the world and i said well i i'm gonna go to the world and enjoy it but i thank the lord that god had another plan praise the lord aren't you happy god had another plan and there was there was something that i wanted to do but there was something greater in me than he that is in the world praise the lord there was a pull in my heart there was something in my soul that i didn't know and there is what there was a you know in chapter of john there is jesus and just for a moment i want to thank you for a journey amen it's not a fairy tale story that really happened there was jesus and he called his disciples they were with him and remember they were jews amen full blooded jews and they were very proud of that that's how jews were you know they were very uh they wanted a pure blood amen that's why they call themselves we are jews everything pertain to us yeah we have the law of moses you know we are pure blooded amen we have our temple they're in jerusalem there is our place of worship we go there every year you know they kept all the laws everything all the tradition they kept my many times in the message the folks you know we keep all the traditions amen brothers and sisters when we have it all in our head it's not enough you know but there were also samaritans i just want to like a little background you know the the jews they hated samaritans for one reason that they were a mixture they were not pure blood amen they could not trace themselves purely amen in their flesh in their blood the natural blood they were mixture between jews and gentiles hallelujah aren't you heavy for the grace of god you know those jews were so proud they could say my dad was a jew my mother was a pure blood jew that's why i am a pure blood jew but samaritans they couldn't say that they were a mixture that's why jews hated samaritan so much that when they wanted to go from judea to galilee the shortest way was through samaria but they would take a bypass through jericho and then and you know maybe go at 10 hours more but they said our food didn't step on that you know filthy land of samaria nothing good can come out of samaria that's what they thought but when jesus came he was a god in flesh and he came to redeem those that was lost it was a son of man ministry amen praise the lord and there in this filthy land of samaria the jews didn't even look upon them but there was a predestinated seed laying somewhere there glory to god and jesus was in his son of man ministry and he came to seek for those that were lost the message of the hour brothers and sisters the son of man ministry again in the prophet william branham can you say amen the ministry came at the very end time to call out the bride of every nation every tongue glory to god to give us rapturing faith because we're going home you know i feel really liberty brother you don't come from elkton virginia i don't come from czech republic brother robert doesn't come from poland we come from the glory we have a heavenly citizenship amen we come from god and we are on our way back to god hallelujah praise the lord we were born into the kingdom because we were in him in the beginning that's why we believe that message glory to god we didn't become a seed when we heard about this message amen because we were seed from the beginning that's why we believe that message praise the lord i know it's nothing new but i came to encourage you along the way that you have brothers and sisters back in czech republic and poland that believe the same message amen maybe we don't speak your language maybe we cannot know all your songs but we love the message of the hour the same spirit of god is falling upon us how he falls upon you thank you lord praise the lord amen so i i think it was quite of a statement when when jesus you know he said he was coming he was heading towards galilee they were in judea the shortest way through samaria but all the jews they go bypass so when jesus said let's go the disciples in their mind they said okay we go through jericho we take a longer route for sure we're not stepping in samaria but jesus hallelujah chapter four verse four and he must needs go through samaria can you say amen can we see the grace of god maybe maybe the disciples ask can you repeat that master are we really sure we're going through samaria all the preachers before all the all the pharisees sinuses they were bypassing that all the big preachers but jesus was there in his son of man ministry praise the lord it was the special hour it was an hour of deliverance for those that were seed of god at that time praise the lord hallelujah he received the visa vision from his father amen that's why he had a need to go through samaria amen there was someone in that filthy land hallelujah forgotten her life was in ruins can you say man she had five husbands the one she was living with was not her husband amen she was ashamed her life was full of sin she didn't know how to straight that out but brothers and sisters i want to tell you god knows how to straighten it out amen we have our own conceptions people have their own judging amen but the word of god praise the lord you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free amen praise the lord god knows how to do that praise the lord so he said let's go through samaria aren't you happy that he had a need to go through elkton virginia he had a need to go through czech republic to go through poland we were somewhere you were somewhere but god has found you because he knew you will be here he can never do a mistake this woman there so they go through samaria maybe the disciples they're looking you know to the left to the right what we're doing here in this country amen but jesus was going he knew there is a seed laying praise the lord he was god in flesh he was going there and he knew there is my seed she had an op she had a uh how do you call that she she had a certain testimony among the you know people because they looked on their fl on her flesh and they said my goodness you know the pharisees didn't want to do nothing with her pharisees didn't want it to do nothing with her but jesus oh glory aren't you happy for the grace of god you know when when the time of a capstone when the capstone is coming down in zechariah there are some shoutings going on amen what are the shoutings grace grace not i have done that i have done that you know today is the hour when the most popular picture there is is a selfie you know how people take it you know that's the most popular picture it's all about me amen not somebody else me i am important no i am most important so people take you know time to to get the best selfie they can because that's the time we're living in amen the people are so selfish if there was a cat or someone else that marked the picture they said go away i want a selfie well there was one selfie that was the true one god took a picture of himself did you see the cloud that's the hour we're living in devil can only copy something but god has the original amen god make a picture of him amen praise the lord we don't need our selfie because we are included in his selfie praise the lord hallelujah satan is only copying amen that's why there is a spirit upon the earth they're taking selfies but we have our first selfie back there glory to god in 1963 this little prophet met with the seven angels glory to god praise the lord aren't you happy for that that that's the time we're living in hallelujah jesus went there and you know there in samaria there was a mount gerizim and samaritans they had their own temple on the top of mount gerizim amen it was built about 30 years later than the temple in jerusalem and they said samaritans they said on that mountain that's our place of worship jews said no no no no my hour place of worship is on the mountain in jerusalem that's our true place of worship hallelujah but the time of transition came they were attaching the playoffs of worship with one geographical place but now the time came glory to god time of a change of a great church and jesus was introducing a new way of worship glory to god you know what amazes me it was not announced in some of the big churches or or or to a big pharisee or to caiaphas or oh i don't know the famous preachers of the day no the first one who heard about the change was a woman of a bad reputation oh glory to god can you say amen isn't our god wonderful those people would not even look at her email but jesus was there he met that woman at the well of jacob glory to god at the bottom of the mount of garrison she came to draw water from the whale at different times so that she will not meet other people because she was ashamed of her life she didn't know how to straight it out but god had a plan sometimes we don't know what how can i straight up my things god knows god knows maybe it's a sickness maybe it's something that is bothering you god knows praise the lord because we are overcomers we are his attributes that came into existence in this day praise the lord hallelujah i'm just closing i have seven minutes praise the lord aren't you happy for the grace of god one of the greatest changes that is right about to happen in that time glory to god here are these religious people of the day here is the woman of a bad reputation that god himself bailed in flesh comes through samaria brothers and sisters glory to god he came to redeem her back to reveal to her who she really is to reveal to her her origin and where she's going to praise the lord amen so he sent the disciples they go to buy something and he's there alone because the new birth is the personal revelation of christ to you can you say amen your pastor cannot do that for you your parents cannot do that for you you must meet with the lord and when you do when he reveals himself to you you're a different person praise the lord for that so she comes there and she she comes to that to that well and and she looks at him and he looks at her that must have been a look brother she was maybe thinking what about my life it's a total mess she was heavy laden she was sad she didn't know who she is she was just stored up but there was the lord he looked at her down through that veil of darkness of unbelief there was a light inside of her can you say amen the seed of god and god saw it there the lord saw it in your heart wherever you were that's why the message came to redeem those that are the lords amen praise the lord hallelujah and he said give me a drink she looked at him she said you are a jew how come you ask me for water i am a samaritan woman we know that this church these believers from these believers they have nothing to do we never talk with those believers from that church jesus was there to introduce a new way of worship praise the lord amen give me a drink praise the lord and we know the conversation i don't want to go through it do that but you know jesus went right to the point amen that's what i love that's what i love about the truth it's not only the tapping on the back you know yeah everything is okay yeah jesus loves you you know that you know all the denominations they pray jesus loves you but there is a truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free do we want to be free hallelujah the truth shall set you free set your life in honor praise the lord gives you power to bring deliverance into your life that's what the truth shall do for you that's what the truth did for this woman because the truth was speaking to her glory to god you know and he was talking about you know if you knew about the water that i can give to you now she was thinking about a natural water she said might be good not to come no more to this well because she was coming you know to draw water to work but give me that water give me that water but now the words came you said go call thy husband and come to either jesus was not playing around he said right to the point you know what was there a problem too many husbands and the truth is the two-edged sword it comes right there to a problem to make an operation i'm just closing to make an operation praise the lord from the inside to cut away the unbelief sin and things of the world and give you a new life new desires amen praise the lord you know she was sincere she was standing in the presence of god she said i have no husband he said you said the truth you had five and the one that you are living with is your not your husband she had six but there was standing the seventh one can you say amen hallelujah she said my i perceive you are a prophet amen something was open up to her and he was talking more he said our father said we worship in that mountain the jews in jerusalem they said we worshipping that mountain in jerusalem but jesus said the hour cometh and it's now hallelujah that neither on that mountain neither dare but jesus was introducing a new way of worship hallelujah praise the lord not attached with the geographical place not attached with your certain conditions amen but you the true worshipers no matter where you are you can be in a garage you can be in a hospital you can wash the dishes sister praise the lord but god introduced to us a new way of worship in spirit and in the truth hallelujah aren't you happy for that you don't have to go to jerusalem to be in the place of worship you don't even have to go to jeffersonville to be in the place of worship hallelujah because you are the temple of the living god amen you are the vessel where god wants to dwell praise the lord and you become a true worshiper in spirit and in the truth you know just last thing this woman had so many problems in her life is that the truth she didn't know how to make it right maybe she went to this psychologist to that psychologist they when they heard her story they said man we're sorry we can't help you we don't know how to straight up this mess but when jesus started to talk to her something started to happen with her was afraid to talk to anybody she was afraid to meet the people but after she talked with jesus she was not afraid to go back to the city and said oh come and see not me not my life but a man that told me all about my life it must be the messiah can you say well brother and sisters the message of this hour that's messiah of our day can you say man the seals were broken to her amen the truth set her free praise the lord that's what i had upon my heart i wanted to bless it to you may god bless you just forgive me my grammatics mistakes but i just wanted to encourage you we are family of god this message came to reveal a true family of god if we'll never meet again i will be looking for you there hallelujah aren't you thankful that same one came by your way that you left your water pot and you ran glory be to god brother that's my kind of preaching amen amen i know you enjoyed it this evening let me sing that song let the worshipers arise amen father

as yours even is not as good as his really but i want to tell you one secret one mystery although i am from poland and everyone there speak polish polish is not my first language my first language is the language of the revealed word of god amen praise the lord so i am pastor of small church maybe 55 people but people they love the message for this hour they love the revealed word of the lord amen and i am husband just of one wife and still the same wife for 28 years oh thank you thank you and i am father of three children and grandfather of five grandchildren and my children they told me that it is not finished so probably i will be next time maybe grandfather of six or seven i don't know it's not on me so praise the lord so we are here with brother dave with brother daniel i will turn my uh my timer on okay to be not too long because you are tired we are tired praise the lord so we are here just to encourage you and encourage ourselves because if i can see you as you came this you had a long day and you came here anyhow to listen to the word of god it is encouraging me so brother and sister is great battle we are going through but we are not alone our bridegroom is with us and he is more than able to do everything what we need amen because he already he has done it amen so okay i want to ask you to stand up and to open our bibles in the very familiar scripture it is written thank you brother andrew it is written in the first verse of 17th chapter of first kings so first book of kings and 17th chapter and first versed and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word amen can you say amen praise the lord you may be seated so you know we have there in my local church we have on pulpit notebook and we write down in this notebook special needs of the bride of jesus christ and i want to let you know and brother ron especially you that i could write down your name and the need of total healing for brother on spencer and we believe that god is more than able to do it because we are his children and we are believers and god is more than able to do it and he will do we believe he will praise the lord so brothers and sisters and this is very very familiar scripture but before this scripture is written the last last verse of 16 chapter of first kings amen and in this 16th chapter is written in these days did he hear the battleite built jericho he laid the foundation thereof in abiram his first firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son segup according to the word of the lord which he spake by joshua the son of noon amen so we see that the the time came maybe that was after 500 years since time when god said by joshua he said against jericho he cursed jericho and we see that what was cursed was rebuilt again amen and we can see the same right now out of this world outside that was was cursed the sin is rebuilt again and in the same time amen according to the word of god in the same time that was a man from gilead and that was elijah and he came to ahab amen so that was special time because we can see darkness outside but we have to see light inside amen praise the lord we cannot be focused only on the dark side we have to be focused on the light lightheart light side which is in us praise the lord somebody say amen hallelujah so brothers and sisters so the the biggest problem in that time for israel was king ahab amen he was the biggest problem for them but elijah because before this chapter we cannot read something about elijah maybe in that time elijah was in his house listening to the tapes to recognize his position but when the prophecy was fulfilled hallelujah as prophecy is fulfilled in our days the king's purple and this lady everything is fulfilled so this is time for you and me to recognize our position just to go out to stay before your greatest biggest problem and to be like elijah and what he said to ahab he didn't mention ahab name he didn't say anything about ahab but he said as the lord god of israel leave it before whom i stand it is your testimony tonight you can come brother on you can come to your greatest greatest problem greatest enemy the biggest problem to the cancer or to illness some what is what is what it is and you can say before because i am standing before the lord be because i am standing not before you my problem but because i am standing before the lord of god praise the lord and he said praise the lord i like it there shall not be due no rain these years but according to my word praise the lord we are stepping in the time of spoken word not only of the spoken word by william branham but spoken word by the bride of jesus christ in 2021 in 2022 somebody say hallelujah in the message of things prophet said god hates a powerless religion can you imagine god but he is love yes but he hates a powerless religion and any religion today that hasn't got christ in it is powerless amen any religion if we will have just religion in our churches we will be without power but we need christ and christ it is very life of jesus and his life is here tonight i believe it somebody say hallelujah somebody say i believe it praise the lord and prophet said but any religion that christ in is under his own blood and it's got power in it god hates powerless religion it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity are you with me if god to have sincerity sincerity brings power sincerity brings power we have to be more and more sincere the angel of the lord came to prophet william branham and he said you have to be more and more sincere and it is the same for us maybe we are for 48 years or maybe 30 years 20 years in the message but we have to be more and more sincere with every day to say father i failed i was wrong forgive me and he will forgive you and he will give you power to rule over this sin in your life to rule over this problem in your life are you with me hallelujah and prophet said sincerity brings real worship as we could as as we could hear about the real worshipers true worshipers amen so prophet said sincerity brings the real worship not forms but genuine power worship to know that you've passed from death and to life somebody say hallelujah the real worship is not just okay father i am here but real worship is to know that you came from the dead to life to very life of jesus christ and now you can be true worshipper praise the lord hallelujah and prophet said and when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word here is what's happened god wants to perform by the holy ghost and vindicate his word and the church wants to perform amen so one hand side god he wants to perform if you want just to wait on him he will see his answer because his answer is on the way so you can stand before your problem as as as elijah as he did and he stood before he stand before ahab and he said as the lord leave it as the lord leave it before whom i stand amen praise the lord so john gospel of john 8 and 31 then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed hallelujah so he said to jews which believed not to jews there on the streets in jerusalem or in galilee but he said to jews which believed in him and but he said if you will remain in my world hallelujah it is what is needed for us to remain in the every promise of god he promised to heal you brother ron and you have just to remain and you will see the whole victory in your life and i will see the whole victory in my life i will see all my kids saved because they are already saved amen we have promise we have something what is real it is not like you know something unreal just today is people they want to have cryptocurrency something what is unreal it's not real it's just like something any code today it is tomorrow will will be no no more but we have something real we have true gold true character of jesus christ hallelujah we can touch it we can take it praise the lord so he said if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and it is not finished but he's at end and praise the lord you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free praise the lord so we have to be to remain in his word in the message for this hour and we will be his disciples indeed and then next step we will know not maybe he said not probably but he said and you shall know praise the lord and you shall know the truth and if you shall know the truth the truth hallelujah not you not your pastor not brother and you not brother robert but the truth hallelujah shall make you free so christ he is here tonight to make you free to make me free from my sickness from my sins for everything what is wrong with me hallelujah and the next position of the seven church ages prophet said now remember this and this very very familiar quote christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts praise the lord he didn't say jesus but he said christ in true church amen christ it is very life of jesus right now is in his true church praise the lord we are his true church only his bride is his true church pray the lord and he said if they get the true revelation i just keep if they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern at withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her praise the lord we didn't receive a powerless religion we receive the religion something more than religion we receive the life of jesus christ with his full of power power hallelujah praise the lord and he said yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them are you with me i want to tell you my personal testimony can i do it can i do it so i have three keys as i mentioned my daughter she is the oldest one and when when she was 13 years old she decided to be baptized in the name of jesus christ and she was baptized by the grace of the lord and then i had second i have two sons thomas he is right now 22 years old and the jonah he's 19 years old so then thomas when he was just maybe 8 10 even 12 years old he was so good boy he was so interested in the message in the word of god he loved to sing songs for the glory of god he loved to pray with us he loved to sing with us you know to read bible with us but when he started to be like 15 years old something wrong happened i didn't know but i saw that something wrong is with him he still sang with us he still went with us to church he prayed with us but something wrong was in his spirit and i as a father i could feel it so i said thomas what wrong is with you and he was 15 maybe in that time he was 16 years old and he was in his high school and he said nothing daddy i am good i said no and he said yes i have planned to go to university to for studying i said it is not my question i am thinking about your soul tell me what wrong is with you and he said okay daddy i will tell you the truth i don't want to be like you i want to be normal i said what do you try to tell me that i am abnormal and he said no daddy but i want to be like my friends in school i said okay son but you are not like them you are son of god so it it happened in this way and that was in the same condition i prayed my wife prayed we cried before the lord and brother john andes do you know brother jonathan is from clover dale he came for convention in poland and he said okay this meeting i i feel i feel something on my heart to make a prayer line so i want to ask every pastor at every end and every preacher to go to go out that was in at the end of the service to go out to the front and to form two lines so there was once one line one brother stayed here and another stood here and he said okay so people just if you have any need you can come this way from the left and go through the line prayer line brothers will just put hands on you and you will go through so maybe two maybe 250 250 people went through this prayer line i was there but you know i am i am a father i taught about my sons especially i taught about thomas because he was a teenager and in that time and you that was very very dangerous you know so the last person went through and there was no thomas but holy spirit fell down and we started to praise to worship god i was there in the front and i i i raised my hands and i started to pray and i started to feel holy ghost atmosphere as real as i can see you tonight and i said that was i'm sincere with you i'm honest that was what i said lord jesus i want to bring into your hands my two unsaved sons thomas and jonas and the same moment i just said those words holy spirit came to me to correct me and he said that was so real brothers and sisters i am saying here here is the bible and he was so real and he said you are my son you are preacher you know the message and every promise how you can express how you can confess that your sons are unsafe and i said father forgive me forgive me i want to thank you for my saved sons thomas and jonas and the very moment i said the last word i just i just heard any noise and i saw that the lie the prayer line is formed again and that was just two person going through that was my son thomas and in that time his bride and now his wife damaris they went through the prayer line and i said thank you father thank you father you are so real we didn't receive powerless religion we received something something real full of power after a few months he came to my office and he said daddy i want to give my life to the lord jesus christ can you baptize me in the name of jesus christ i said son it will be my greatest honor my greatest privilege so i could baptize him in the name of jesus christ and now he is one of preachers in my in my church brothers sisters this is what we received what we got praise the lord if it was for me it is the same for you and for you maybe you pray for your children maybe for for your brother or sister or parents god is the same and he is still on time he will never come too late he will be on all the time on time always amen so so satan hates revelation but we love it we true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen and now prophet said in the message calling jesus on the scene he said and that hybriding has got into the church too instead of having a real rugged bunch of bible believers they've hybrid it by denominations and they have two i got this i got that and i belong to this and i belong to that it is hybrid and the thing cannot produce itself again we need a book of acts again amen we need a book of acts again but the only way listen closely only way you will do it is god back to the bible and away from some of this hybrid religion amen so we are going to the bible again so just the last last example the book of acts 12th chapter and from the beginning from the first verse now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to break certain of the church and he killed james the brother of john with the sword and because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further to take peter also amen so we see that that was attitude amongst jews and herod he saw that if he will do this this or it will play please jews and we see that they try to give wrong kind of attitude amongst people can you notice that everything about covet lockdowns and vaccinations is to divide people is to divide people there is one professor of oxford university and his friend they are in the same office they are very good friends they have the same titles and one day one of them he say he's saying okay the vaccination is very good it's for your health just go and take the shots and next week his friend from the same office he's staying and he he's saying no vaccination is very bad it against your health is to kill you don't do it so tell me why to give to give people attitude of uncertainty there is nothing certain here on desert only what is certain solid ground is the word of god brothers and sisters so if you will make your decision to take vaccination or not you have the bible you have the message and you have your niece and you have to pray but don't don't take your decision don't don't make your decision according to the youtube or internet just according to the message to the bible amen praise the lord hallelujah so we see peter in this story very familiar story then were the days on unleavened bread and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people if you say about problems and troubles and tests just ask peter how he felt in that time that was full lockdown for him in the prison for quaternions of soldiers everywhere and he were inside there but praise the lord we have another verse verse 5 peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made with without ceasing of the church unto god for him praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah god knew that peter will need help of his brothers and sisters so just keep your pastor keep your ministers in prayer without ceasing how is possible without ceasing for example you're here this is the evening time but there in poland is the day so you when you will sleep here we will pray there in poland and we can because we are one body brothers and sisters praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah we need each other praise the lord hallelujah it is not that oh we don't need people from africa yes we need them also they need us and we need them you need us and we need you brothers and sisters we are one family there will be there will be prayer without ceasing help my brothers there in elkton how it is atom okay here in the states okay but brothers and sisters and when herod would have brought him forth the same night the same night not too late but the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers burned with the two two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison can you imagine peter he has he had kiss of the kingdom can you imagine the man with the kiss of the kingdom he was there okay and peter said okay this is my last night maybe tomorrow i will be killed it is my last hour and i have to have very good rest that was peter man with with promise the man of this message with keys can you imagine peter but brother and sisters there was something happening in heaven praise the lord the same time when peter he slept there without help without hope but there was something hallelujah praise the lord oh okay okay i will just read it to the end with do maybe two minutes can i do it really thank you i'm sorry and the keepers before the door kept the prison there was lockdown time of day of the s or the most serious lockdown for peter but not for god hallelujah praise the lord and behold the angel of the lord not just an angel but the angel of the lord christ himself he came there hallelujah came upon him and the light shined in the prison so there was no more darkness in the prison so is no more darkness for you and for me because the angel of the lord is with us tonight praise the lord somebody say hallelujah hallelujah and the light shined in the prison but peter he slept he still slept can you imagine the man win key with kiss slept but praise the lord that god had another plan for peter and he has another plan for you and for me we will not perish we will be ruptured in the twinkling of an eye brothers and sisters the time is at hand that time is at hand i say you that time is at hand praise the lord why because the angel of the lord is here tonight the angel with his light and we know that in christ in him was life and the life was light for the for the people amen so still his life is true light for us without his life we cannot see light brother and sister we are still in darkness but praise the lord that she is here somebody say hallelujah somebody say thank you jesus praise the lord and he smote peter and he smote peter on the side and raise him up saying he rised up quickly it is our time brothers and sisters and rise up the bride of jesus christ here arise up quickly why because the angel of the lord is here his light is here he want to give you the full deliverance amen praise the lord and his chains fell off from his hands in the same time when the angel came the light came and the chains fell off of his hands amen praise the lord so devil maybe he tried to tell him you are still bonded but he was free because of the angel of the lord because there was a church and they were praying for peter praise the lord what the power is in prayer what the power is in in prayer and the angel said unto him girl thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and he said unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me hallelujah and follow me that was not enough to be there and not follow the angel of the lord okay he was without his chains without his sweaters but he was still in the prison so he needed to follow the angel of the lord to the total deliverance praise the lord so maybe you feel something better tonight maybe when brother wrong he is preaching you feel something be better but you have to remain in his word you have to follow the angel of the lord to your full deliverance amen praise the lord hallelujah and we are on the way to our true deliverance our bodies the old bodies brother on the old bodies will be changed totally changed and we will receive a new body praise the lord it will happen in the twinkling of an eye brothers and sisters what the privilege is tonight for us hallelujah and he went out and followed him and with know that this was true which was done by the angel but told he saw a vision he he told he saw a vision but it didn't stop the angel of the lord he didn't stop and say peter why you just cannot believe that this what is happening is reality for you he didn't stop and he will not stop with you and with me till the total deliverance for you and for me brothers and sisters i feel really i feel really religious right now in the good meaning of this world i feel feeling holy spirit here tonight hallelujah when they were past the first and the second world they came unto the iron gate the iron gate not just the wooden gate that was iron gate before them maybe you will come to your biggest to your biggest problem in your life brother and sister but if you are following the angel of the lord there will be nothing for you because it's something it is any impossible for for the lord no brothers and sisters everything is possible for him so they went to the uh to the iron gate to the iron gate that lead leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord automatically hallelujah and they went out and passed on through one street and forward the angel departed from him brothers and sisters maybe you have problem maybe your problem is so big as ahab for israel in the time of elijah maybe your problem is as big as the iron gate was for peter in his time but i
