for being here with us and amen each and every one of you brother and sisters CB so always so good to see you and amen God bless you if you will turn with me to Luke chapter 17 this morning Luke chapter 17 something that's been on my heart for a couple of months and I thought well I I don't know if I'll ever get to preach it but it's been on my heart and and it just keeps coming and keeps coming and and week and a half ago it just dropped solid in my heart and I said well I'm going to get to speak it today and so so here we are Luke chapter 17 and verse 20 and when he was de demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say Lo here or low there or behold the kingdom of God is within you and he said unto the disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and shall not see it and they shall say unto you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as a lightning that lightthe of the one part under Heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all and likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat and they bought and they sold and they planted and they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and in that day he shall he which is shall be upon the Housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back this is a powerful scripture right now remember Lot's wife and whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and who whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it and I tell you that in that night there shall be two men in one bed and one shall be taken and the other shall be left and two men shall be grinding together and one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinded together the one shall be taken the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left and they answered and said unto him where Lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the Eagles be gathered together maybe you have a need on your heart this morning you just like say Lord would you just remember me today Heavenly Father we love you today with all of our hearts thank you for the desire to come to the house of the Lord and hear from your word now Lord we we have already felt your presence in so many ways we ask you now that you'd speak to our hearts and anoint the lips of a speaker for Lord there's no man that can take the word of life and deliver it in a way like you can now Lord I just pray that you would anoint it strengthen us give us strength for the for preaching of the word and Lord take the words and may it go to the hearers today minister to our hearts in a supernatural way we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen amen God bless you you can be seated amen I would like to speak to you this morning and just take a thought and expand from that thought Dead Men Walking Dead Men Walking and for a subtitle I would like to take a thought on left behind this is something that none of us want to fulfill none of us want to fulfill the we as the Bride of Jesus Christ we have become we have become by the revelation of the word to realize that we're leaving we're leaving it's going to be in the moment and the twinkling of an eye it's a Rapture and that Rapture is going to take us from this world to another world we're going to get a change of our bodies and it's a Victorious time for the Bride of Jesus Christ we will see resurrected saints come back and moms and dads and uncles and we will see those that have went on before that has lived Victorious lives that were looking for the Rapture in their day but but now that they'll be coming back to us and oh what a reunion that's going to be and I can't wait to see my father can't wait to see brother Homer can't wait to hear him sing the songs of Glory again and the many of our loved ones that have went on before and to not just see them but see them in young bodies that's a statement within ourselves to see them young and not be fighting sickness or brother Homer with with one amputated leg or even brother that that was in a wheelchair for many years in his life and and to see him and young and in health and to know that now when that when that gear begins to happen we know that our homegoing is getting ready to happen we know once we see them that the next gear is for us to be going home and we're going home to the marriage supper of the lamb and we'll spend three and a half years and and you think about three and a half years that's that's also the time of the tribulation period it's also the time when Jesus was here on the earth and he spent three and a half years I was just sharing some things with brother William just a few moments ago and three and A2 years isn't very long I F I have fought cancer for over over three and a half years and and it just seems like yesterday that we started this battle but we begin to think the church World they've got their thoughts of rapture and in their thoughts of rapture because they did not hear the message of the hour they got thoughts of the coming of the Lord many of them believe that it will happen after the tribulation period can you imagine preaching to to a world to where that you're going to have to overcome the tribulation period amen and then we'll get a Rapture they talk about planes crashing and trains crashing hospitals being emptied cars going down the road without somebody driving it and people leaving the Earth and and but we know that Jesus is coming according to Revelations chapter 17 he's coming as a thief in the night and we realize that the reason that we have seen the message of the power that God blinded the eyes of the Gentiles but he opened your eyes now it's just not this church but its churches all over the world that heard the message of the hour and the message of the hour has prepared us amen for the wedding gown it's prepared us for our homegoing the thought that I would like to deliver to you this morning is we're going to leave we're going to leave and and for us it's a phenomenal day but somebody's going to stay why would you preach such a sermon that had this kind of darkness in it brother Ron I just want to say this to you there's still time there's still hope there's still hope for you get on [Music] board I was I was speaking I was speaking with brother Kim denal at at the at the meeting when we were in Canada the other day the first time that I ever went to Canada and and uh spoke there it' be about 94 95 year uh that would be and and we was out in a it was out in a building it was on a camp and brother King Kim dingwall was responsible uh of of of put putting together a theatrical performance and it was phenomenal that I had a front row seat and and brother Chad and his wife that have been here many times actually just wrote me this morning been here many times and it was a it was a phenomenal theme and that was a theme of who will you be Jesus toen and so in the light of that I I've I've thought of that so many times of I was at that setting and I was there and they put that play on it was a phenomenal and and and brother Kim had designed this the setting of the of the place and and he he had designed the theatrical stage and it had all kind of me Mechanicals and as I was standing there speaking with him he seemed like now we've both got a little gray in her hair and and and and he just shared with brother Andrew the first night that I spent there at his place and I I I I stayed in his home and he had a he had a set of drums and being a drummer as a as a young boy uh I uh I always have been attached to drums and so you know if you don't believe in Drums where you're probably not going to enjoy heaven and so and so the next morning you know everybody was doing their thing and kind maybe even asleep cuz I was on a different time zone and I went downstairs and and I got on those drums and brother Kim was sharing that he said I heard those drums being beat he said the last person I I thought that would be playing the drums was brother Ron Hallelujah you know he be to share with me and he said brother Ron he said I'm at a spot now that I feel like that I can just share the message with people and just talk to them and and just go up and talk to them he said they're so lost in their thoughts and he said but we have truth and and he began to give me one after another another and after another of talking to them about truth and and and things and their eyes becoming open and they just begin to talk and as he begin to talk this message just kept laying in my heart we are the final light we're the final light to a very dark age now we can see we can see the the message of the hour and how it's working I begin to think about what all God is doing so many many people are waiting for God to do something we're waiting for a supernatural move of God and so I thought I'd just write a couple things down we can see a lan of butts that was suffering deeply with cancer her lungs were dark and in one service when the pastor brother Tim PR is singing leaning on the Everlasting Arms of Jesus and she's just starts running around the building and the next day in an x-ray those lungs were clear we can see Mariah that that that's now married and she had lost all of her hair and and and she was she came to a meeting brother Tim had prayed for her months before and she was praying for the restoration of her hair and she came through the prayer line that we was being a part of and when she came through the prayer line she had three bobby pins on and she was believing that she was going to use them and today she stands with a with a head full of hair and I said then God is showing us that the bride has been restored not only her but we have been restored to our position brother Tim PR is speaking just a couple of weeks ago and while he's speaking there's a man that has come to the church he's a new he's a new man not even a convert at that time and he and he's smoking multiple packs of cigarettes today you can imagine what kind of cost that was and brother Tim is talking to them about just fall in love with Jesus and he went home that evening about four hours later and his wife said you haven't had a smoke yet no no no I haven't and then the week went by and the two weeks went by listen listen there's not a program in the world that can do it just like that brother Donnie Reagan shared Miracles that were happening and things happening around the world on Wednesday night brother George Quinn he shared with me a story of his travels this the last couple of weeks of being in America brother George Quinn from Ireland and talked to to me about phenomenal experiences that he saw brother kin sing that from is from South Africa that watches our that is a powerful Minister there his travels have just been of late to to Zimbabwe and he he sent me a several different clips of people shouting and dancing as the word went forth last night I went home and I I just flipped on YouTube and looking for services that might still be going on there's a young man preaching in South Carolina last night and you know he's just a young boy and he's preaching preaching this message with all of his heart and he's just delivering the word of God and they were shouting and being delivered listen this just isn't some little little group the high camp meeting last week that many was at those that were there were I know blessed brother Wayne shared with me this week he said in a call phone conversation he said brother Ron he said there was a prayer line and he you were in there and in that prayer line he said there was a blast that took place and people were slain in the spirit he said brother Ron I have never witnessed anything like that before listen brother Wayne and all of us has been in some powerful prayer lines we've been an incredible powerful services for a man of that caliber to say I've never witnessed anything like that before what I want to say to you folks it's happening I want to make a declaration to you I don't know what you're looking for but it's happening in spite of our humanity and our faults and our failures God's got a bigger plan and I want to just repeat a couple of things brother Brandon would say don't miss it don't miss it pinch your conscience Shake Yourself he would scream in the vision stay in line who was he screaming that to the Bride of Jesus Christ stay in line get back in Step amen now with all of that in mind we must understand I was in a meeting with brother Tim PR in Florida and brother Tim is speaking and he comes to a Sunday morning and he asked the question is Mercy over and he said mercy no amen let me just say this to you while there is Mercy while there is Mercy I want you to pray for your prodal like never before we must realize that the mer day of Mercy will close for the Gentile generation understand this Noah had no control of shutting the door that's right Noah had no control over shutting the door I'm going to borrow brother Homer's Bible this morning hey brother homer I'm going do the best I can Noah had no control of shutting the door neither do we neither do we there's going to come a time that we're going to speak our last Saturday night service we're going to gather our last Sunday service for the last time we are seeing the signs we we're very we're very aware of the signs that are here not going to go there this morning but we are the only only continuation of the message brother brandom just didn't preach the message and leave it there there are men around the world under a five-fold Ministry that are preaching the message with everything that is within us I want to use my energies as much as I've got to preach this message with everything because we have the king's sword in our hands amen are you with me now now I want you to understand there came a time that Lazarus was dead no more but he had to die again can you imagine Legion that was walking in the tombs but there came a time after he met Jesus that he could go home that he was no longer a haunted house for everybody to be afraid of listen once you meet Jesus you're going to be changed you cannot meet him and ever be the same are you with me now in Mark chapter 10 and verse 17 and I I just want to share something with you before I read that scripture Spurgeon told us powerful story he told a story of a man that that moved under a very Scenic Place he moved at the bottom of a cliff that had a huge facial Stone Face on it and everybody knew that one day that that stone was going to fall it was huge it was absolutely huge that man moved there and people warned him they warned him over and over again that's going to fall one of these days and and he moved under it anyway it was beautiful it was scenic everybody loved the place but but after a while he become numb to the danger am had a wife she become numb to the danger you know after a couple Generations a 100 people are living under the Rock and after just a little while a thousand people are living under the Rock and before long America's living under the Rock and listen they know the danger that it's coming to an end and one day that rock face fell on that that that small group or that Township but they knew the danger so many people know the danger drunks on the street know the danger I was at the fair this week you can't imagine how many people walked up to me and said boy we're living in the end time we're coming to an end how horrible that looks and how what our situation is America is rotten now amen but the but listen we need more than just having a feeling that it's over with we got to do something about it you got to do something about it you got to get your right your life right with God you got to get the token I want to read to you somebody that that got real close in Revelation or Mark chap 10 vers 17 and when he was gone forth into the way there come one running and kneel to him and saying good Master what shall I do that I I may inherit eternal life what an incredible question and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these things have I observed from my youth and then Jesus beholding him loved him I always thought that so powerful Jesus loved him but it didn't save him oh come on think about this Jesus loved him yeah but it didn't save him and said unto him one thing that thou loest go thy way and sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor that thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me notice now and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions and Jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God quite a statement most of us don't have that problem but a lot of people love the world more than they love of God that's right I I cannot imagine anything that I would trade for [Music] God I I couldn't imagine nothing that I would trade for this walk with God I want that to be sober CU people are going to watch this in Revelations chapter three and unto the angel of the Church of the Le oans write these things sayith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of god notice what he says I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot and so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth god let's just put it like it is vomited amen this church world that's right come on are you with me now notice what they say because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing listen they can have church without god let's just be honest they can have church without God they can have pre a pre-prepared sermon that that is is palatable to the audience that is a a psychological speech that will move them in their spirit and on their flesh but they can go back Monday and be the same guy they were Saturday their dress code never changes their desires never change come on Church let's should be honest with you but if you take this message of the hour and deliver it in any of their audiences and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and of white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isap that thou mayest see now notice what he says as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zelous therefore and repent we have a Zeal to repent amen behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice what a thought if any any man hear my voice open the door and I will come into him and Sh with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and is sat down with my father in his throne and he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches I want to just give you a few quotes real quick he said look at the scriptures piled in here could it be is the third poll to preach to the Eternal doomed that's rejected the message of Salvation brother Brandon would make a statement even to where that we'll get to a point be no more saved amen says well the church is going yeah they will they'll go right on just the same but remember all this time Noah was in the ark and the bride is sealed with Christ and the the last member has been redeemed and the six seal has produced itself and the Seven seal brings him back to the earth and the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand and sat down and claimed what he owned what he has redeemed it's always been that third pull three is perfection the ministry come to its Perfection when it reproduce Christ again in natural amongst human beings listen Christ is not just in books and tapes and in your Bible it's in flesh it's in flesh I want you to get it you're the last representation to this Lost Generation oh think of it people could right on go or right on preaching he said people could go right on preaching thinking they're getting saved believing they're doing right believing their organizations are growing sure not even a ray of Hope and if that Vision was that it's been so hard against the women we have come to that hour the door is closed and gone already the book is in his hands you know this morning I I was up early and and I just I just I went back and I I I found a sermon 15 years ago brother bisc preached and brother Jason Jackson was all he was sitting on the platform I think I sent you the picture and had more hair then and so brother bis's preaching and when I turned it on I went over to a certain spot and I just reel forward not knowing what was getting ready to s be said and he comes out to the side of his pull pit and he says imagine When We're Gone they'll use this as a church and people will walk to this altar believing they're getting saved and I'm I come and I've got I've got this in my hands listen this church will be used of course we know brother B said some Churches become nothing but storehouses cobwebs on the ceiling be vacant buildings haunted places are you with me now listen the church is you it's not this building I want it to be as nice as we can have it but you're the church you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you're you are what makes this place special listen I appreciate every nail that went and every glue that went in every piece of wood but you're what makes this place special when he himself comes down but there will come a time when he takes you off of the earth and all of this will still be here think about it people coming here and come to the altar thinking they're being saved are you with me he said the sleeping virgin coming in trying to buy all this is that that when you that last of the Bride will come come in went in the rest of them was left there did you ever think what happened they went right on ahead preaching and thinking that they were getting Souls saved and everything and did not know it they knew nothing about it the church will go on thinking souls are being saved and everything else and the church the bride sealed away and don't know it that's EX L the scripture Noah went in the ark and God sealed it out the time will come when men and women will try will cry to God and even think that they're they've got something when they haven't folks I I let me just say this to you we don't want to miss it now this poem I put on my which was Danny Henry the spoken tongues and three interpreted because thou H has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has walked in your own choosing thou has picked the correct and the precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await thee we're part of that we're a part of that and he said what a glorious decision thou has made and this in itself is that which will give and make to come to pass that tremendous victory in the love divine now last night as Andrew spoke this dropped in my heart cuz I've been working with it all week in my mind as we stand here and preach we know that we're finishing up we know we're finishing up we we don't have 40 years left or 50 years left we know that we're finishing up and I'm honestly I pray that while I preach the spirit of God has conveyed across this audience and on the internet to where that people if they're not right with God will get right with God Amen I don't have any parameters God wrote the book he wrote the book I just have to preach the book and and and listen as we preach the word of God we preach the power of forgiveness and we preach the power of of his love let me just say I can't explain forgiveness for how great it is I can't explain how great the blood of Jesus Christ is in the moment that you ask God to forgive you you that's right you remember all of the things that you did that you've done the last years but when you ask God to forgive you God is as good as his word and it's REM it's removed from the memory it's removed from the memory and let me just say this you when God forgives you he forgives you don't pick up Stones when he forgives you he forgives you how deep is his love brother Marcus how deep is his love even while you're in sin while you're in the deepest of horrible situations God knows where you're going to wind up there's no Angels coming up and say look how bad they are look what a situation look at their failures God can say I got a plan I've got a blood for that and I got a [Applause] plan but can you imagine Through The Years 120 years preaching knowing that God's going to destroy the Earth amen right listen this isn't Small Potatoes here God's going to wash the the Earth and he going to clean he's going to clean it because God has repented that he has made man how many seen the rainbow lately how many seen a rainbow lately is this thing working at all I know we haven't had rain for a while but how many's ever seen a rainbow let me just put it like that seven colors in the rainbow they're perfect it's seven colors in the rainbow and I'm not going to go there it it's not part of the sermon but it's a promise it's a promise I'll not destroy the Earth with water but what is he going to destroy it with fire god writes a sermon in the heavens he writes a sermon in the heavens every time it rains oh I didn't never hear a preacher did you look up I never heard brother brandham did you look up God had a sermon in the heavens every time that it rained God preaches our Eternal God preaches he makes a promise but we're getting close to the promise surely I will do nothing except I reveal my servants to the prophets I'll not destroy the Earth but I'll send a prophet he sent Elijah he sent Noah he sent John the Baptist he sent William brandom I don't believe it's a prophet you will brother Ron I I've got so many things against brother brandom you will our critics will don't don't cut me off yet don't cut me off yet you will can you imagine making videos against the message on and how bad you hate the message you really don't hate the message you hate the word of God you don't just hate the preachers but you hate you you not only hate ha the preachers but you hate the prophet and then you you hate brother brandom and then you hate God because you have to have a new Bible you got to write a new Bible cuz the one that you got it burned your head so you got to write another Bible why do you think there's 44,000 denominations even the smallest churches split are you with me no no notice now notice Noah got out there and preached the same message for 120 years 120 years what if Andrew got up and preached the same message every [Music] night every night you go is he studying Noah preached the same message message every day and he knew it was right nor was a man like me and you he felt for those people he loved his cousins he loved the nation he loved the people he loved Humanity or he wouldn't have preached he'd have said it's for me in my house bless God it's all that's coming in sorry bunch of Sinners out there let them die I don't think we can understand the devastation amen we got six or seven inches of rain the other day it washed my driveway you know it got muddy trees fell but can you imagine rain coming that won't stop the billers of the deep opening up I wanted to just share this quote to you it means a lot to me he said there is always borderline Believers I call them people that will come to church they'll enjoy the message maybe the maybe from the choir the singers or from the minister or the testimony they'll enjoy it but to come in and be a part of it they just won't do it they like to listen but they won't be a part of it they do not want to be identified with them they want to stay off on one side that's always been that way he said no doubt that was in that day that when the dark door closed many of those people said well let's go up and stand around if it comes to pass for instance the old man was right we all kind of thought that the old fell was a little bit off and I enjoyed listening to him pretty preach a little standing there at the door and now we we know that something's closed the door now he's a good old man and if it would happen some water would come while he'd take us in he said you don't want to strain God's goodness amen you want to be sure that you come in while there's a chance to come in now listen brother Brandon W just throwing off words here he could see Sodom and Gomorrah amen he could see the end taking place he could see the wedding supper he could see the war of Gog and MOG amen and listen he's telling us something you don't want to be a borderline believer now the first thing you know the first day look God strains his people once in a while sometimes I'd imagine the first day and Noah said to his family all right now we'll climb up to the into the stair upstairs and now in the morning the skies are going to going to be dark and there never was dark before and we've never seen it rain was going to fall and lightning will sweep across the skies and next morning up Comes the Sun and no sign and all day long no one his family looked things went on exactly the same way that they did I imagine border line Believers said the old fellow was wrong they went back downtown eating and drinking and being married and I imagine his family what a strain it must have been on on the man but he didn't give up and start knocking on the door and say people pry the door open I was wrong he knew he had truth I want to say that he knew he had truth and he held on to it and if it didn't rain today it'll rain tomorrow and then the second day come and we notice the sun came up and it crossed over it like it did every day no sign of rain still he was persistent 7 days and Noah was sitting right there if it don't rain today it'll come tomorrow and he was anchored he was persistent he was perseverant because he know God said so if I don't see a resurrection today I'll look for it tomorrow if I don't see the Rapture today I'll look for it tomorrow I'm going to be persistent and finally on the seventh day when he looked out the window the skies were blackening the wind was blowing across the hills the trees were bending over people were screaming not knowing what to do and after a while great big drops of rain be to break down for For the First Time striking upon the streets sewers filled up all the Springs begin to break up water begin to rise up people got in their boats and they sank winds were rough and they got deeper and deeper and deeper and after a while it began to come upon the ship and he watched out the window and finally the people screaming there's no way for him to reach out and get them he was way up in the upper story they had send away their day of Grace and there was no more left for them and it's too late then finally what a feeling it must have been to Noah when he watched out on the street and see SE those little boats whether they were God trusted or not you see people today they construct their own Ark they make their own salvation you can't do that God made salvation for us you've got to accept it just a man constructed Ark will not stand anything that man can achieve that's contrary to the will and the word of God it will not stand my grandbabies I want you to know this there's rapture in this message and if I die and go by the way of the Grave you stay with this message with everything that's within you you eat it morning day and night it'll change your bodies but how would it just be when Mrs Noah and her's daughter-in-laws and Sons and when they seen that Ark coming up on the that water coming up on the ark and yet the ark was still sitting flat but after a while they begin to feel it cut loose what a day it'll be what a day it will be when you look down at your hands and your hands will be mov when you feel your legs and they're strong again and your back is strong what a feeling it'll be hallelujah hallelujah Noah knew that all of what of his what he had tried to achieve and what he had done his message was paying off then you say brother Ron I've been here 50 Years it'll pay off it'll pay off brother Vernon it'll pay off yes I want you to thank you for your faithfulness it'll pay off but all how the devil gets in you years look how many decades y'all been going to church still don't see no change hang around just hang around Old Devil just hang around all the torment that you've caused me it's going to come back on you every day that you've made me sick God's kept a record of it he's going to send you and your imps and all your demons to Hell Hallelujah there'll come a time that there's no more demons and no more devil and no more sickness and no more pain God's keeping record Hallelujah God is keeping record are you with me now after the taking away of the Holy Spirit out of the earth now remember this when God takes the bride off of the earth brother R said God takes love off of the earth what you're seeing in these rights and what you're seeing in this Lawless Society is on the the preemptive it's only preemptive just let your prayers leave the Earth I don't know much about you but I pray for peace I pray for safety and for me to have peace and safety that means this area has to be under the Dominion of almighty God and there's going to be a lot of sin he ain't changed that but listen God's going to watch over us and protect us and everyone of you are guarded by the angels of God listen we're not saying something myth this is not Hollywood God Is Watching Over You your company is blessed because you're a part of it your bank is blessed because you come in there you put your money there they're blessed the restaurant that you eat in you ever walk into a restaurant and it's empty and you sit down for a little while start eating and before long there will come dozens of people start walking in that restaurant is blessed because you have walked in their door are you with me now your neighbors are blessed your neighbors are blessed Amen brother Ron that's something fictitious well can we believe brother brandom George he's told me this a couple times George said there was a man next door that sat on his back porch and drank beer and throwed his bottles his cans out out in the yard and George said that this is his son-in-law said how disrespectful knowing you're a preacher and he does that and brother Brown said leave him alone leave him alone he's been kind to me down hereall brother bham didn't damn him to hell he didn't Dam him to hell he said I'll stand for him over there can I bring it to you your neighbors are blessed because you are there now let's just imagine something for a moment you leave you leave you just don't leave you take your atmosphere with you my house is just a house it's just a house if I'm if I'm in it it's just a house but listen take me out of it take me out of it that atmosphere leaves you take you out of your house atmosphere that you carry leaves cuz you pray there you read your Bible you call out to God you create an atmosphere I'm just I'm just

few more years there's Wars that's going to happen but listen when you leave Brother David your prayers leave and when you pray you create an atmosphere schools are going to be different government's going to be different you mean government's going to be different you don't know this but there's a congressman writes me every week to want to know what I think amen listen they want to hear truth they want to hear truth and I tell them well brother Ron that's part of the government it's part of the devil Hey listen let there be a little bit light one of these days I'm not going to be hereen don't let that make you mad brother brother William gave me me this quotee this morning he said now that's what it was after the taking away of the Holy Spirit out of the earth that formal Church religion will go right on Amen not knowing the difference not knowing the difference so your televangelist will have services and they'll go right on not knowing the difference did you ever how many ever heard wasn't that astounding they don't know the holy spirit so they won't know when it's gone right I want you to think I want you to think real hard on this they don't know the holy spirit so they won't know when it's gone that's right they'll just go right on just the same and when the last one is sealed into when the last one is sealed into the body of Christ they'll still be going on trying to bring in converts because they don't know what it is and their formal religions will continue on just like they were now it might not sink into you like it did me but that was really an astounding statement they'll just go be go so far just in their religious rituals until they will not miss the holy spirit because they don't know what it is amen I'm sorry I I just buried Uncle this week brother Kenny just buried an uncle my uncle was a good man he was a phenomenal man I was living a very vulgar lifestyle pre-marriage and that Uncle he was a handsome man he he had one of them curly cues in the front of his head and he was a he was a pretty man because somebody told him that and he believed it ever meet somebody they think they're pretty you know better but they believed it we were setting we were setting the other day having a having a dinner and this girl came in and she was she was all dolled up and she was by herself she could tell she was a business woman she sat just across from us she got her computer she got all of her papers out and she went to work her breakfast came and it got cold and and uh I told Andrew I said Andrew you know why she's like that I said somebody told her she was pretty and she believed it now brother Ron that's an ugly statement but if you take all that Jezebel stuff off of her you take all that nonsense off of her that's that's only temporary and you realize that she's nothing but a bag of worms and if you realize what she really is is a bag of worms and she'll be guilty think about this she'll be guilty of causing men to lust after her and commit adultery with her in her heart and she'll go to hell without the blood of Jesus Christ on her amen I pray to God that she hears the message but if she hears it she's going to change listen the message will give you power to change I want you to think about this oh but brother Ron that's difficult I want you to think about this Noah and his family were saved yes how many million and maybe billion of humans not just livestock humans that had jobs and were Millionaires and were Hollywood ites and were had every realm of life but when the flood came none of that mattered I want you to think about another place let me just preach when the blood was applied over the lentil of the door if that blood was not applied in Moses's day if it was not applied the death angel was coming to your house it was coming to you and your oldest child was going to die your your animals some of them were going to die listen death was going to be everywhere to even change the heart of pharaoh amen listen what you and I are witnessing today and I I don't I'm sorry is Canon father amen people give you a hard time or you're seeing them naked and you listening to them and you see blue hair you see all of that this is their Heaven that's right this is their heaven and in a few days it's going to rain Hellfire and there's no message to get a hold of listen I believe there's good people in the earth and I'm talking about good people I spoke with brother Tom Hills Uncle Jerry that has pancreatic cancer I saw his wife looking over at him it was a look like I get from my wife once in a while and she was looking at him and she had that look in her eyes like I'm just glad I can share this moment with you I get that look once in a while maybe once a week just joke that look that special look and I saw her looking at him and brother Terry I walked over to him and you know things were going on at the wedding I walked over to him and you know you're in a battle he's in a battle you're in a battle and you know you you can just talk because you're in the same battle his is his pancreas and it's a death sentence and and you know when you're stage four it's a death sentence and you either believe the doctor's report or you believe God's report and so we just start talking we start talking about life and how much he loves his family and he and he said you know the greatest thing is is I love God I just love God and he just started talking about the love of God and I just felt the presence of the Lord as we talked and these were the thoughts that I came to God has a special place for people like this the Earth will be filled with redeemed bride and redeemed is way different are you with me like a wedding the Bride Comes but there's a whole lot of people comes to see the wedding and on this Earth there's been phenomenal people you delivered a dumpster the other day and you know I I'm playing my dad's part now Matthew's delivered and doing all the work and I'm getting out 90y old man 88y old woman and they're standing there and they're holding hands and he's telling me how much he loves her and and she's just reciprocating and she's just rubbing his shoulder and down his back you know and they were they both had been married and their their spouses died and they had children and and he looked up his he looked up her because she was a sweetheart when they was in high school he hadn't seen her for decades and he asked her if he could come see her he was from he was from up in Pittsburgh somewhere or another and she's down in Florida he goes to see her he said I tell you what when I got out of the car it was love at first sight and we stood there and started talking about the Lord and he kind of G me his life story and she gave me her life story and I thought you know they don't know brother Joe I'm going to use your I'm going to use your analogy they don't know the most important person they ever met in their life was me isn't that right brother Joe brother Joe would tell me that over and over I got it written down a lot of places and he would say the most important person that that person ever meets right is me why you're the link to the blood brother Ron but sin's got a hold of me I'm going to tell One More Story story and then I'll I I may finish this in a couple of weeks we've all been through through some Wars we've all been through some Wars no a couple weeks is going to be Labor Day and I'm definitely not going to preach Andrew and Matthew will do all of the guiding I'm just going to be there to pay bills it's a good place to be you pay the bills that means you got money to pay the bills Amen brother Homer's favorite sermon sister Nancy's watching but his favorite sermon was spiritual Amnesia you'll not believe how many books that he printed off and gave to people gave it to the auctioneer actually he gave it to your uncle I was there when he handed it to your uncle he gave it to a lot of different people people spiritual Amnesia brother brandom is telling Pentecost you forgot where you came from he's telling the denominational the world don't forget where you come from and brother brandham was he come to about three qus the way through the sermon and he goes overseas and he starts talking about they had a a train and he says the story was told he said they had a train that was carrying Soldiers Home and he said these soldiers had lost their minding at War said it comes to a place to where you you lose your mind you just can't handle it no more so they were sending them to an institution and the and the train would go on and it would come to a stop and they would let them get off and they'd watch him and said on this one stop he said this one soldier was looking at a water tower he called it water tank he said he was looking at that water tank and said he began to walk and after a little while he he found a familiar path and the guard was watching him he was watching him because people in the wrong mind will walk off but this one had a different purpose and he's walking up that path and as he's walking up the path he's walking he goes up over the hill and then he goes over another Hill And the guard's walking along behind him not letting the Soldier know what he's doing now Marcus it's hard to be very private with you but when I wrote this note down I said Marcus will be here to hear it this morning and I'll tell this story for him I didn't know you was going to be here but he did did brother Ron that's just way off okay last year at the fair I was in the chicken house where the little chickens and the peees are and I was watching an auction I had no intentions to buy Hot Wheel cars and the Lord spoke to him he said byy them David Dexter collects them and he will be at the Labor Day meeting well I bought them I bought about a hundred of them if I do something I do it really well now I didn't know that and you don't know what it means when I walked in and there set David Dexter and the next night I went and got a bag and I fill that bag full of Hot Wheel cars and I comeing I said Hey listen the Lord spoke to me to buy these for you and he told me that you would be here you can imagine what his face is looking like now here's what what I'm telling you God's got a Rapture for you and he's prepared a place for you he knows you're going to be there and so he walked up over the second Hill And the guard's following him can you imagine how intriguing this was he's following him there's hundreds of soldiers there but he's following this one and this one has a purpose something's coming back to him something's coming back to him he going across the hill there a little house with a picked fence a tree smoke coming up out of the chimney there's an old man sitting on the porch he walks up to that picket fence and there stands his daddy he said Son they told me that you were dead but I didn't believe it welcome home I've experienced that in my life welcome home brother Jimmy you've experienced it now each and every one of you have experienced it brother Andy we've been a long road now we've experienced it and there's no place like home this world makes us very sick makes us nauseated makes us tormented we we get so disgusted with it but this ain't home the missionary got off of the ship and all the celebrities they had a parade for him and calling their names and he gets off the ship and he just start walking as he walks along the boardwalk he's now kind of disappointed even depressed a bit there's no parade for me I've been on the mission field all of these years and nobody came to welcome me home you can imagine what loneliness feels like and God spoke to him said you're not home yet [Applause] I believe I'll use that more don't you love the Lord let's stand this morning amen maybe you just don't know the Lord maybe you just like to say brother Ryan would you remember me remember me can I tell you just one more as the musicians come as a little boy I heard this message all my life never never knew what Pentecost the world Pentecost is or Methodist or Baptist any of those denominations I knew what the message was so I heard the message is in fourth grade and I jumped up on a desk and told them that the world was coming to an end in 1977 Los Angeles dropping beneath the ocean yeah I got detention for that but that's what I knew that's what I believe that's what I was being taught but you know we lived in a trailer we lived in a 70 by 14 trailer and Dad built Wings off of it everywhere it was home it was nice and you know I lived on the other end of the trailer and you know I go up that hallway in the night I'd wake up I'd wake up and it was Pitch Black dad didn't believe in having lights on in the night and so I'd struggle my way up through the the trailer and I'd get to the kitchen then i' get to the living room and i' I'd get up to that their bedroom door and I would think nothing I can't hear anything and I think oh I pray that Rapture didn't happen and I'm left behind but I get to that door brother Jim and my mother was a real good snore my daddy too but my mother was a champ and I could hear that echo of that bear you don't know how it felt that I wasn't alone I never want to walk into this building and everybody be gone on a Sunday morning I don't want to be a part of that feeling I want you to think about deeply on that heart what are you doing with your life what are you doing with your life you're on you're on the internet what are you doing with your life give it to Jesus give it to Jesus and Let Jesus change your life just invite him into your heart even right now where you're sitting won't you just let him come and touch your heart you say brother Ron but I just need him well he'll come if you invite him he'll come and that warm presence that comes and begins to change your life you just follow that day by day by day and listen this isn't this isn't a this isn't a a a quick run run this is a marathon and he'll be with you and when you fall down get up may be hard to get up but get back up may be a little while getting yourself together but get up on your knees and there pray and after a while you get your feet under you start walking with him again let's just pray now Heavenly Father there's just none like you I preached a lot of different sermons in my life but today I kind of feel like Noah Noah had preached 120 years but it must have been so passionate when he sees two by two animals coming cuz he knew then it's just going to be a few [Music] days so now he sermons take a higher octave and he preaches like never before Lord we as message beli in Preachers our octave has went up another level cuz we can see the signs we're not seeing two by two we can see our governments and we can see the conditions of Sodom we can see the world taking its turns but we can see the bride in Revival it's been going on a long time but it's taking a higher octave Lord come and touch our hearts now Lord I want to be like Moses I don't want to leave one hoof behind I don't want to leave one child behind I'm kind of selfish I don't want to leave one person behind in this building Lord touch our hearts touch our lives in the name of Jesus Christ God we just pray amen and amen is it more of [Music] you brother Andrew he came to me [Music]

building in 1965 and a prophet is preaching one of the greatest messages on the choosing of a bride and he's speaking to his wife speaking to God's wife and there's the elect lady and she's she's finding out that she's found her place in him but there are those that get so upset at the prophet for the preaching of the word that they begin to chew gum they begin to make mockeries in front of the word of God they begin to light up cigarettes they were so upset at the word of God they walked out brother brandom right there condemns that generation and condemns the city called the city of Angels you know what he said about that you know what he said about Los Angeles could you imagine sitting there in that condition getting so mad at the word of God that you just want to walk out how grateful are we this morning that we could sit here under the preaching of the word not with that kind of a spirit but with a spirit of humility say God whatever I've got to do to match the word of this hour I want that kind of a heart can you I can't even put myself in that kind of mindset of the people to get that upset at the word because it's not in me it's not in me but if it's in you to be able to say Lord forgive me of my faults forgive me where I let down my word I think you ought to lift your hands I think you ought to lift your voice I ought to I think you ought to just Express the
