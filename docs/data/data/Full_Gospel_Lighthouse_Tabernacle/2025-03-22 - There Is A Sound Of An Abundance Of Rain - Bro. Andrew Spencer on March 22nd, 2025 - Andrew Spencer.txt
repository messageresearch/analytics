of our needs ain't that right brother Ron he sees every one of them so just commit these needs unto the Lord just now father God we come before you lord lord we are your children and we count it's such an honor Lord to call Upon Our [Music] Father we say hallowed are thy name God what an honor it is Lord Jesus to realize Lord what power there is laying under thy name God and we have committed ourselves unto you father there's uplifted hands here there's hearts that are needy for the Holy Ghost to come and Minister unto them in a very specific way father more than just in a human realm we need the mighty Angel himself to slip into this room just now and speak lift your ear to us that we could recognize that that's the sound of our father that is speaking unto us even though we might be a far off even in our faith some might but God I pray that you would allow the the drawing power of Thy word to be able to bring us back into a place where we can receive father that which you have for us I know that LE osia has a way father of of just breaking us down and pushing us out God we are here to resist the devil father we're here to lift up the Holy Name of Jesus and father I pray your blessings would be poured out here in this place father there's so many needs Lord God that we need to see you move on Father there's so many we could go over and over and over again in of the list father and that even even isn't half of what's been told but father if we could just spend a little bit of time and than about how much you have done we would spend more time giving thanks to what you have done than what we have on our list in front of us so father may we return and give thanks father Lord I pray God that as you receive our faith just now father that our bodies would receive healing Lord that our Spirits Lord would receive Joy unspe speakable and full of glory and God we just ask that your kingdom would receive the Liberty father that this body is calling for so God we yield ourselves to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ we pray these things and ask your blessings upon this service tonight in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in First Kings chapter 18 verse 41 man it's good to have brother Williams family here with us it's brother Josh and sister Hannah can we just say God bless you tonight and I know you've had a wonderful time uh with your family here and we thank you for allowing brother William sister Gabrielle to be our family and and uh hey you can't get much greater around here brother Ron calls him an angel so so amen that's that's that's a pretty good deal I'm still working on that myself yeah that's right it's good to have brother Timothy back in the house of the Lord this evening God bless you buddy amen what a meeting we had last weekend there's not enough words we could say about that I I know it was just a two who a two-day meeting but my goodness it felt like it was so impactful in such a way the Lord just blessed us abundantly didn't he amen I'd like to just speak to you uh from these text here tonight from First Kings chap 18 and verse 41 something that the Lord just laid on my heart yesterday morning I just like to follow the inspiration of the Lord here and Elijah said unto Ahab get thee up and eat and drink for there is a sound of an abundance of rain so Ahab went up and eat to drink eat and to drink and Elijah went up to mount to the top of caramel and he cast himself down upon the Earth and he put his face between his knees and said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing how many times have we looked for God and there's nothing and he said go again seven times now that word seven it sure means something to you and me don't it amen and it came to pass at the seventh age or seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a little Cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up and say unto Ahab prepare thy Chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee not and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and Ahab rode and went went to jezel and the Hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he gted up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of jezrael may God bless his word you may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord from this this text tonight I'd like to just take a thought from from the scriptures here there is a sound of an abundance of rain a sound of an abundance of rain and when you begin to look at that word sound in the in the Hebrew you mind it's it's very simple that word sound means voice it means a voice and we realize that that we are living in an hour we realize that we've had a voice that has spoken unto us and it's not a it's not a it's not a voice that has that has dimmed Away by over 60 some years but we realize that that voice is ever prominent even right now and we realize that you and I you and I's words have much power in it that there there is there is some very very powerful things that come out of our lips but we realize but what the power of the sound that you and I are living in because we realize that words have power they have the ability to transform they have the ability to hurt they have the ability to bring about a healing in that in that way but we realize that in the very beginning you'll find that in the very first of the Bible you'll see that sound is mentioned right there in the Book of Genesis is when God said let there be light so we begin to see that God's spoken word as it comes as it comes into fruition we begin to see that that God begins to manifest the creation of sound and the prophet would teach us that that a word is a thought expressed and we realize that God had thoughts in his mind that all of a sudden he begin to express those thoughts and he begin to speak those things out and you begin to see what God had in his mind but for you and I in humanity we realize that there are a lot of thoughts that we just have in our mind and thank God that sometimes those thoughts are not expressed but there are a lot of times that there is that side of the carnal of humanity there are thoughts that are never expressed and they never become a word as you see as long as it's a thought it never becomes it never is expressed and there's no action that can form behind it but in our relationship to the almighty there's got to be some sound behind our relationship is that right if there's if there's never if there's never no sound behind a husband and wife relationship you'll find that you'll begin to see a coldness slip in but if there is some sound that is behind that relationship you'll find that there is a gratitude from the humanity to the almighty that sounds off gratitude it sounds off that he's greater than us you see you see the Bible tells us that he is the high priest of our profession he is the high priest of our confession so we realized that there's got to be some confession questions there's got to be some things that are revolving around our sound that are literally coming out of our lips that sometimes it it may not look like it's there it may not feel like it's there but you've got to sound off some things I was listening to a tape today and brother Brandon was talking about he said he said he had told me that if I ate one bite if I took one bite of certain things of a of a hard meal he said it would kill me right away he said but I just kept on confession and I kept on eating them beans and I I kept eating that cornbread he said I kept eating it he said he said he said people said I was lying he said no he said I was saying by the word that I was healed you see you see the sound that comes out of our mouth might seem a little bit strange to the world but to you and I as Believers we realize that our sound has got some victory behind it our sounds got some power behind it and we realize that all the way back there we begin to see that the blood that all things have a sound that the Bible said that the blood has a sound to it you remember when when when the Lord when Elohim is looking for for Cain after he's walking there he finds out that Cain that Cain is slew his his his brother Abel and the Bible said that the voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground so the we realize that the blood has a sound but Paul picks that up in Hebrews chap 12 and 24 and it said unto Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of the sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of a it speaks better things can we say that together the blood speaks better things you say well what does that mean brother Andrew you see the blood of Abel was was cried out it cried out in Vengeance but the blood of Jesus Christ it has a sound of Mercy it has a sound of Pardon so there is a sound that comes with the blood and you and I we realize that brother Brandon would preach a preach a message and he would title it all things he said he said if I could he said I would preach a today on all things he said we realize that we can't preach all things he said so I'll just preach on this one thing I'll preach on a pardon so a pardon has a sound with it is that right but before a pardon can be received it's got to be accepted as a pardon before you can accept this message and the power that becomes this behind this message of Grace you've got to have put some sound to it come on somebody we're not just we're not just Devils here we're not just a bunch of people that that believe that he's God because the devil even believes that he's God there's a lot of Baptists that believe that he's God but you what makes the difference between you and I is that there's some sound on the other side of our belief we went up and we took the Rays last week and uh we took them up there or a couple weeks ago week and a half ago we took them up there to see the play Noah and and and many I I'm not going to give any too too much Det details cuz I realized that there's going to be some of you that will go but something that just that that that really labored in my heart was how that how that Noah and his family are on the inside of the Ark and they start hearing a sound for the very first time it had never been heard before but they hear this sound but on the other side of that sound was a voice a voice of saying let me get in there let me let me get in whatever I got to do let just open up the door let me get in there there was a sound there there was a sound there that Noah realized that he couldn't help them no more he had prepared an ark for them but now he's hearing this sound the sound of rain that was going to allow him to be able to go into Liberty and to take him across the Judgment but there was a sound there was a sound of voices that were that close to Noah that was his that was his friends that that he talked to and said let me in there what pushes you brother Andrew it's a it's the thought of hearing those sounds I don't want to be that obligated tunity to tell somebody about this sound I don't want to tell them about I don't want to miss an opportunity to get them on the inside of this Ark and Noah preached his message for 120 years and they couldn't accept the vision of it but it was a reality to him because it had the voice that was speaking to him had a sound of Heaven behind it there's a lot of people that don't even realize what has happened today they said they they said it was never going to happen to Noah and they said the same thing about an EG egg shaped car they said the seven they said the seventh thing they said the same thing about the seventh angel they said those things that they didn't realize that there was a reality behind that Vision come on somebody we're way past the egg shaped car we're way past women getting their rights to vote but we are living in the reality of a bride that has a sound behind her Voice Hallelujah I don't think we truly realize the importance of sound and how we use it every day but sound's very powerful the power of sound is in Creation The Sound I it is fundamental to life everything in nature produces a sound wind and water has a sound animals have a sound even your own human heartbeat has a sound and even scientists have discovered that they can use sound waves to can affect the matter and it proves its power by shaping its environment my sound sound is also in our communication and language a spoken language is our primary communication is that right but the way that we sound it off it can mean a lot of things you see you can say one thing and somebody receive it another way you see you have the ability by language and by different tones and pictures and volumes it can change the meaning of what we say I could say come here and it'll strike fear in your heart or I could say come here I want you to see this come here it it can cause an excitement or I could say it in the darkness Daddy come here you see it has the ability to to have different influences because of the way that you use use the sound are you with me sound is also used in Warfare in in battlecries and in trumpets and when when men are setting forth for for for armies and settling up their battle for Warfare even Joshua used and realized the power of sound of trumpets to begin to alarm that this was a time to release your sound today we we hear all kinds of sounds of of alarms and sirens and and emergency signals and even sound free frequencies that you and I wouldn't know but men in military they understand the technology and they use different forms of sound to be able to alert that there's an enemy at hand even we realize that science has tapped in to sound we use what we call sonar an echolocation it helps our submaro submarines and animals and bats be able to navigate at the night time or in the darkness of water we are thankful for good speakers and microphones and amplifiers here but they also use an instrument called an ultrasound that helps a doctor be able to use use that to be able to see on the inside of the body I had the opportunity to to have one of those just a couple weeks ago not because I was pregnant but because they was checking some things on the inside of me I told her I told that little lady that was doing that ultrasound I said you see a baby in there you go ahead and call you call the right people call my wife and call The Undertaker but all of a sudden while I'm having this done I I don't realiz I don't think that God allows us to go through anything without having a having a a double a compound meaning to it he he begins to allow us to just kind of tap in to be able to see what he's meaning but there that ultrasound it is built and it's built in such a way that they they use it that it has this tranducer that it uses these high frequencies that are Way Beyond what the human's ability is to be able to hear and they take it and they place it on maybe maybe a a pregnant mother and they place it there and they can look and they use they use the Echoes of how many times that it bounces off and they use these Wes sister Julie is a ultrasound technician and could definitely give a whole lot better in illustration than what I can but because of the sound that is there it produces an image so that you can see right into the body I want to say this that this voice in this age has given us an ability to be able to look on the inside of a body I I remember going there with with Katie and looking at the ultrasounds and different things as as a mother I always you know you ever had one you get that they squeeze that jail on you know that's that jail scars the fire out of me cuz you know good and well it's cold as as a Dickens but thank God when this woman sprayed sprayed that gel on me it she had the she had the fortitude to warm that gel and I I tell you what that's a blessing right there you was getting ready to take my breath I said what in the world is that jail even used for and she said without that jail we can't see in your body I said wait a minute wait a minute you mean to tell me without that barrier there you can't see into my body you see there's got to be a barrier barer between you and the sound and if you're not hearing this message cor correct it'll depend where what kind of barrier is standing between you and the sound you see the Bible says in Romans 10:1 17 that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so we realize it depends how you're hearing the sound you see there's got to be something that is standing between you a barrier between you and that sound that's the reason why a lot of people hear this message and they said well he called me a buzzard but because they had that kind of unbelief barrier they heard a buzzard but because you had a faith barrier you hear that you're an eagle you see this sound has given you the ability to be able to look past what you see and think past what you can see and feel brother bandham would would deal over and over over again with with deaf people you can hear brother brandom and I just I just picked this this one instance up brother brand in the message love and Saskatoon he said he said that little girl that little de mut he said I don't I don't say that she'll receive her conditions here he said now are you her father are you a Christian he said you believe that he'll do it you do does the audience believe that this little mute will be healed he said now remember I'm not asking God for miracles no but if he desires to do them all right he will come into this audience and take and do the things that he's done he said that's a miracle enough to convince that he's here don't you believe it he said but the reason that I'm asking these things is this this little child right here he said they're too little to have faith for themselves he said but if they can just say one little word you see if you can just say one little word you may not have the faith of brother R you may not have the faith of brother brother William but if you can just say say one little word like Hattie said that's nothing but the truth it wasn't a great big paragraph she just simply put herself in harmony with what a prophet said you see if they can just say one little word he said when Elijah sent up gahaz up there to take a look at the cloud he said I seen one about the size of a hand of a man he said I hear the sound of an abundance of rain you see you don't see it yet but you hear it come on somebody had he spoke it and the things wasn't there yet but she was going to see it because she heard it come on somebody if squirrels could produce prodical to give their heart back to God what about what about Jim Noel what about Dylan shiffley what about Tom Hill what about Denny Vance one little word one little woman of [Applause] faith I hear the sound of the abundance of rain he said now if God will just give this little girl and he stops and said I noticed that Death woman out there nodding her head to me ain't it powerful if they could just hear one little hurt and he doesn't talk about one getting the rain but he talks about the abundance of rain and all of a sudden when he speaks that thing there's a death Spirit right here at the platform but there's a death Spirit back there he said I see that little Death woman back there nodding her head to me can you hear me all right sister if you are wave your hand well I may not have heard the message throughout the first time but there was a prophet that stood there and broke the spirit off of my life and now I can hear come on somebody I ain't hearing this through the devil's language I ain't hearing this through Lea's language I'm hearing this through the Sound Of Heaven the power of Heaven is behind this message and if you will allow it now what did Brother Bram do you watch him he goes in there he said now what it is he said it's a spirit that's on this little bitty girl he said but if he said it's kind of like a little band that's wrapped around those those nerves in there he said he said now it wasn't nothing that she would do or this one would do he said it's a spirit that's there and brother bham goes in there he said if I can break the spirit then you'll be able to hear and all of a sudden you hear a prophet calling out and calling Satan said you're nothing but a bluff I break that Spirit In The Name of Jesus Christ and all of a sudden those nerves that had been blocked up where she couldn't hear that that sound she couldn't hear her daddy say I love you she couldn't hear her mama say go fix this or go do that but all of a sudden because the spirit was broken she could hear a sound I'm so thankful that this voice got a hold of me but for the spirit of the world got a hold of me so now I'm not listening through a filter of man's ideas but I'm hearing it through a thinking man's filter Christ Jesus and it builds Supernatural powerhouses I tell you what I don't care who you are I don't care how far you are away from this message your identity is greater than that spirit I don't care what kind of influence that you're under I don't care what kind of creed that you're under your identity as a gene seed of God is greater than the spirit of hell that would try to hold you back from this message and all the blessings that are poured out I say your identity has the ability to break that Spirit there's also a spiritual power to sound you begin to read in Exodus chapter 28 is one of my favorite things to study Brother Jay is about the about the high priest going into the temple there in the wilderness and it tells us that the high priest had to have a sound he was dressed right he had he had the robes on and everything all the blue and Scarlets and all the things perfectly in place but you see there on the bottom of his robe was golden bells and pomegranates of of of a certain color of blue and when they would bounce back and forth these were not just noise they may have been a noise to a lot of people but this was not just a noise to almighty God this noise that some people heard was just gibberish but to almighty God the sound that was coming off of that Bell and that pomegranate was holy holy holy there's a lot of people that don't understand why you quote quote quote quote quote but unto almighty God it screams holy holy holy unto the Lord Almighty you see the major difference between that sound and no sound was when there was no sound in the temple then it showed that the priest had died in the presence of God but as long as there was some sound in the Tabernacle come on somebody as long as there was some sound in that Tabernacle you proved that there was life in that Tabernacle that's why God cannot have no quiet [Music] [Applause] Church it matters what sound that you're hearing because Jesus said my sheep hear my sound we we always keep something and I got a little TV in my garage monitor for those of you it's a TV I don't care but we always keep instrumental music because I realize the power of music there we always keep some music that's going on that thing maybe some art and some different things and and we listen to those those sounds and I we just keep it going all the time the girls turn it on they play it and they realizes that music creates an atmosphere and I had brother Michael and Sister Abigail there in my there in my garage and we were just walking in and all of a sudden I walk in there and on the TV it done it didn't change off of this art and this instrumental music and it was just like this humming noise and all it was odd because it was like a black screen and then there was these bowls that was lit up a and out of out of that screen was his hand and I was like man what in the world you know if you just leave something on it it just keep replaying I thought man the world it's here I am trying to do something right and got a preacher one of my best friendss staying up in my garage and I got Voodoo playing out here and I was like man I'm sorry I I I I don't know how that happened and all of a sudden brother Michael said now wait a minute wait a minute he said that's not maybe what you think it is he said I he said what it is he said there have been studies that are done on the elements of healing with sound that all of those they begin to take this little rod and they roll it around them bowls and it it produces certain frequencies that produce healing in the body now I'll just say it like this if it had not been for that sound I would have cut off this sound I'd have cut that thing off because I didn't understand what that sound was about you see if it had not been for some gospel preachers I may not have heard the sound that was there for my healing that was there for my peace that was there to drive away fear but because there was a sound that said you need to listen to this thank God for some mamas and daddies that say children stay right here in this sound I thank God for mamas and daddies that still believe and applying the token I thank God for mamies and daddies that keep their children in the atmosphere of the Holy sound you know we've never been surrounded by sound as much as we are today just reading over a study the this study that was produced in 2021 it it said that Beyond positive and uplifting sounds of singing and music there is also noise pollution which researchers say is one of the leading causes of health issues worldwide and in this study had estimated that people living close to busy roads were more likely to have high experience High cortisol the stress hormone levels than to have and to have hypertens ion and heart disease and up to 40 million people in the US suffer from hearing impairment due to excessive noise exposure they said it doesn't have to be a loud or disturbing noise that affects us however he said they they study said the Bing and beep of notifications can also increase our stress levels when our phones or our computers make a sound to notify us of a message I brains might re release dopamine the motivation and desire hormone but they can also release cortisol which in excess is a detrimental to our health so it matters what kind of sound you see if it's if it I'll just be I just say like this if I text you it can create it can create fear and it can create happiness depending on who's receiving it why ain't you been in church probably going to release some cortisol I seen you down there enjoying the presence of the Lord it's probably going to release some dopamine it depends on how you beeping now let me let me preach I've been I I've been laboring real real hard right here and hope I ain't lost you too much but let me preach just for a minute the prophet said said the voice of God is a rare thing today he said it's smothered out by so many different voices so many things that Dem and take away he said if other voices are contrary to the voice of God then it must be the voice of our enemy to go in there and confuse us that we would not understand the voice of God when it spoke he said there's so many voices in the Earth today that it's absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural there is so many intellectual voices and great voices of mighty men who are intellectual that in their intellectual conditions even shake the nation it's powerful it's powerful that it deadens a supernatural it causes the voice of God actually to be placed off somewhere so for you and I in a in a world filled with noise it is important that we be intentional and conscious about the sounds that are surrounding us I say it's important I say it's important who's sounding off around you you let negativity constantly be I'll tell you what you let somebody be negative all their life they're negative about the stock market they're negative about their taxes they're negative about their flat tire they're negative about their husband and before long you'll get under the influence of that negativity it matters what sound that you're under but if you can get around somebody in the positive side it'll be complete opposite now how much greater in the spiritual is that if you get around somebody that's full of unbelief that don't believe in the moving of the spirit that doesn't believe that God sent a prophet it'll bring you down but if you can get around Hallelujah if you can get around some Eagles get around some Eagles and you can start flying to another level it'll take you to another spot it matters what kind of sound you're listening to I tell you what I tell you the world's got full of chicken sounds but I'm so far in the heavens I don't even hear the chicken no more that's why the message should never be background noise it should be our foreground noise come on somebody there's power in this seventh angel sound because it brings healing it relieves stress it relieves nervous tension upon your life it matters what kind of sound you're listening to music has a powerful sound music has the ability to go in and slip in and create deep emotional and spiritual impacts sound of praise and worship is built so that you can glorify almighty God and we use sound to create an atmosphere you see it matters it matters what kind of sound you're listening to you see if if if a minister is preaching you got to have the right kind of a sound to go after the preaching of the word to make sure that the rainfalls to sew the seed that had been just been sewn you see if you're trying to create an atmosphere for a an altar call you would begin to speak out and you begin to sing I feel the pool or you begin to play Nearer My God to thee or or or just as I am and you start playing those songs that that creates an inviting inviting atmosphere and it's all done by sound there's healing power in this sound but the prophet said now if you're wanting to create an atmosphere for a dance he said you don't play near my God to thee but you'll play that song I'm one of them or there's going to be a meeting in the air you see it depends on what kind of an atmosphere that you're trying to produce it matters what sound's coming out to be honest if the preaching of the word Goes Forth and all of a sudden it's time for an Altra call and you can feel the net has drawn been thrown out across a congregation and you can feel the spirit begin to move and all of a sudden there could be a a sound there could be a guy that's on the sound or or over top of the music or over top of the singing and all of a sudden all of a sudden he just starts singing there's going to be a meeting in the air it can break the atmosphere it matters that you have somebody that is in tune with sound but it also matters that there's somebody in tune with the spirit that captures where the spirit of God is going that's why I I absolutely love good worship worship leaders we're not song leaders around here we're worship leaders around here but it creates an atmosphere where God can hear our sound you know brother Ram said about David that David was a Divine healer by music music because there was there was no no way that was the only way to cast out Devils was by playing the healing words that the Lord is my shepherd and he played that over top of Saul with those evil spirits and those evil spirits heard that sound there's a lot of people that can play music it mattered what David was playing across it he wasn't playing he wasn't playing there ain't nothing but a hound dog he was was playing the Lord is my shepherd and that evil spirit brother Bram said it it Disturbed that evil spirit and it drove him away so brother brandham said that music has the ability to cast out Devils he said shame on you people that don't believe in string music he said no wonder evil spirits never like it he said they have to get away from it because David cast out Devils by playing on a string instrument I'll be honest I don't want any musician up here that don't feel what they're doing I'll just be honest I don't want a man up here singing that doesn't feel what he's doing I had a great friend of mine a sound tech he told me he told me like this he said sound is no good until you can feel it and for a preacher I sure enjoy statements like that cuz it ain't no good until you can feel it if you've ever been on this side of it a lot of people don't understand why a preachers got to hear a lot of people don't understand why a singers got to hear himself they got to feel it they got to hear it they got to feel it you see there's something powerful about sound when you begin to feel it you see when you can begin to shake the very foundations of hell with your praise you see let me say it like this that the message is more than just a sound but it's an impact it has a feeling to it it's more than just feeling but there is a sound behind it that creates a feeling I'll say I'll say this kind of message that we're preaching has got so much power that you can feel it we we had some I ain't going to call what they were but we had some guys that was working on our on our property one time he was building us a barn and they's up there working that if you ever been up there where we live at we got that great big old power line it runs right through the middle of that thing I mean ginormous it's it's big you get underneath that thing in the middle of the rain you can hear that thing popping up there and hear he that rain hitting that hitting that power up there it starts sizzling these guys up there they had been around power like that before and they got up there and they they reaching over that sheet metal and they they was getting lit up brother Jim they hadn't been used to that kind of power and so they up there and they said we don't know what that's like what is that we said well what you're feeling is the power off them lines and there's a little bit of moisture up there on That Metal that you are and every time they was touching it they got shocked and that's the way a lot of people they've been around some water down gospel and when they get around a little power are you with me there's going to be some vibrations there going to be some impact of this sound I tell you they they got these things I I think it's a beautiful thing they call them Jawbone earbuds y'all ever y'all ever know what I'm talking about I know these kids do but they don't go in your ears but they literally sit right over top of you and they literally transfer the sound into your Jawbone ain't that crazy it ain't no it's sitting right there in your Jawbone but because of the vibrations you can hear it in your ear canal you know there was a composer before he was 20 years old he was one of the greatest composer that completely went death and he he lost all Hearing in his left eye he heard he lost all hearing and he and he couldn't and some of his best compulsions was after he had been death so what they said is what what a uh beten would do is he would take this stick and he place it in his mouth and he put it up there against the piano and he would play it and he would feel the vibrations from that stick and the music that he was playing and it was vibrating into his ear connect now and he was being able to produce some of the greatest music even when he couldn't do that he would lay on the floor and he would feel the vibrations of it I say this message is powerful enough to hear and to feel well you say well you don't know what you're talking about brother Andrew I absolutely do know what I'm talking about because I realize that with the more we sound off this message the more scared hell gets [Applause] well I'm going to need some examples brother Andrew a prophet in his first poll is standing there with patience he doesn't he doesn't have he's not giving the he's not giv a second sign at the time but he takes the patience by his left hand and the Lord gives him a sign and he's able to tell by the vibrations on his hands what kind of disease and what kind of spirit he said now I do not have the ability to heal you all I have the ability to do is tell you what disease that you have he said but if almighty God wants to heal you it's him that heals you if it's almighty God that wants to stop those vibrations it'll be God that stops the vibrations he said it's not me and he would deal with patience he said now you've got this you've got cancer in your lung ain't that right I can see it by the vibrations on my hand and all of a sudden he said now bow your head and be real reverent and every time brother brandom is dealing with an epileptic demon he asked people to be super reverent he said that's that one demon that always gets away from me it pays to be reverent in the presence of God and all of a sudden he says I can see that the vibrations have stopped what does that mean brother Andrew it means that spirit that was upon that life had lost its sound it lost its sound that it has no more voice to be able to say you're going to die with this you're going to go to an early grave with this that sound that devil lost its sound Hallelujah let me go on now God never speaks a word unless he's got a reason for speaking that word he's not like you and I that we just especially myself that speak so many foolish things God speaks every word with a meaning something that he's trying to achieve and we achieve by his word sound there's a voice behind it just like in the Garden of Eden or just like in the beginning you can look at every every example where there is sound out and you begin to watch how that sound separates Darkness from light and light from Darkness there is a sound that has the ability to break the power of Darkness if it went out of his mouth then it's got to be manifested is that right if there's going to be a bride that's going to be spotless then it's got to be manifested so there's got to be some evening light that breaks the darkness that's why when Jesus is standing there with Nicodemus he begins to tell him he said Marvel not that I say unto you except you be born that you must be born again he goes on to say the wind bloweth where it listeth and now Hearth a sound thereof but you can't tell where it come from and whether it goeth he said so is everyone that is born of the spirit so there is a sound behind the spirit and brother Gabriel knows brother Gabriel knows that if he's got a good witness lined up he better be a sound witness and he better have some sound with him because if he doesn't if he's willing to say something in front of somebody but he's not willing to say it in front of a judge his sound has no power is that right you see there's a lot of people that have the ability to say things maybe in an altar but they're not afraid they're afraid to say it in front of the public or in front of the enemy when he comes in like a flood again you see it matters you you see there is a sound behind the spirit and that's when Jesus when he's getting ready to be taken up at his Ascension he said go into Judea and they receive power you shall receive power and you shall be Witnesses unto me there's going to be some power that comes behind this witness that it's not going to be Peter and it's not going to be Mary but they're going to be under the Fulfillment of what Jesus done in John chapter 20 that he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost now to them it was just sound and they didn't understand it but when they were up there on the day of Pentecost and the Bible said that all of a sudden there was a sound a sound from Heaven Like A rushan Mighty Wind the voice of Heaven has a sound behind it Hallelujah you say well what are you saying I'm saying it puts perfectly in line what the prophet taught us on hearing receiving recognizing and acting on the word of God we say well what was what was Peter up there doing he was holding on to it he heard it with his ears he recognized it come from God and he acted on it we said what are you talking about I'm saying they're doing exactly what Paul did and they were holding on to some sound Doctrine they were holding on to a form of sound Doctrine and anything that ain't sound it's unsound and it's weak and it's unstable and it's dangerous but if you can get on the right side of the sound then it's strong then it's powerful then it's stable you see that's why so many people in Le Osa have a problem overcoming the Le osia age and the Antichrist spirit in this hour is because they're not trained to a sound but you and I we're not we're not hearing an uncertain sound but we are certain of almighty God and we've heard this sound and we've heard some sound Doctrine we're trained to a message and it's got a sound that sounds like we're going out of here it sounds like we're going to win the battle it sounds like cancer can't win it sounds like tuberculosis ain't enough it sounds like sin can't win this prophet's message has got some sound to it what is sound it's a voice and in the last days and in the last days there will be a voice in this generation what about the hour that you're living in what voice have you been under you ain't under the sound of Billy Graham you're not under the sound of old Roberts you're under the sound of the seventh angel you're under a sound that'll produce a body change you're under a sound I want you to eat this quote in the voice of God in the last days the prophet said the voice of God he said how will will we know it's the voice of God because for today then it was in he said then it was in a Vindicated Prophet but now today how we know it's the voice of God it's because of the manifestation of the prophet's word it's because of the manifestation of the prophet's word this is God's prophet and a true voice of God only brings back that real living Supernatural god with a supernatural word with a supern supernatural manifestation of the true word that we know it's the voice of God sound it's silent silence scares a lot of people but silence does not scare God Even Silence is a sound but silence is over because it's no longer in a prophet's mouth it's now a supernatural manifested voice of almighty God you see that's what scares Satan is you have become the manifested town let me let me say it like this that the the greater the obstacles and the greater the trial the greater the victory the greater the the greater that Satan is fighting you the greater there is a Triumph that is in front of you when you look at job's life and all that he went through how he lost his children how he lost his cattle how he lost his business then God poured blessings on top of blessings on top of blessings on top of blessings but when job goes back to talking to God he does not talk to him about his problems he talks to him about who God is his wife tried to make Job Curse him he said woman you speak like a foolish man a foolish woman there's a whole lot of people that's tried to turn your sound into something that you didn't want to say come on somebody there's a lot of doctors that tried to kill you by sound off things that they said you're going to go with this you're going to die with that but because you refuse that kind of a sound I heard a sound from heaven and said blessed is he that believeth in him said well I'm G get I'm GNA get away from this sound brother Andrew I'm get away from this voice you ain't getting away from this voice there were some men that went down into Spain in the deepest of caves in Spain closest part to the Center of the Earth that you can possibly go and they wanted to see if there was any sound there they went all the way down in there and they got in there and they said if you sat there you couldn't hear anything at at a certain rate you could hear water dripping as you went down and down it was completely dry and there was Zero sound zero sound you and I ain't used to that but they are sitting in there you can completely lose your mind setting where there is no sound but these men took some instruments down in on the inside of that cave and even when you can't hear with your human ear these instruments could hear the sound of the Moon they could hear the sound of the Moon underneath there and even though they couldn't hear it the Earth could hear the very power of the Bride calling to that Earth and it was speaking and it was turning and it had the ability you see there's a lot of people that don't hear the bride sound but you have the ability because a jean Sheed of God by the instrumentality of almighty God you hear this sound people say brother Andrew there's no way I can live an overcoming life and I can tell you haven't been in the message people said I'm still dealing with the the problems I dealt with five and 10 years ago brother angw how do I get rid of them get in the message what are you saying I'm saying there's an abundance of overcoming life in the message there's healing in the message there's the holy ghost power in the message is well I don't know how to get the I don't know how to get the Holy Ghost get in the message it'll teach you how to get the Holy Ghost it'll teach you about how to love thy neighbor there's a sound behind it and it ain't a limited sound but it's an abundance abundance when you study that word out abundance in the Hebrew I tell you it's powerful because the word abundance in the Hebrew it means to roar like a line surely the Lord Our God will do nothing except he reveals these special Revelations To His prophets that a Lon hath roared in this generation and a juted did seven voices what have we heard we've heard a roar come on somebody Satan's going around like a roaring line but I say there's another voice that's got more power that's got more interest in you falling by the way of a grave there's a voice that's got an abundance of sound behind it when brother R Taps into pergam and church Ag and I I I'm coming real quick but when he Taps into the pergam and church AG in Revelations 2:1 17 the Bible said to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and brother Ron picks that up he said the hidden Mana he said it's a little something special he said what is the special he said he said no it's not something the blessings of the Holy Ghost oh no that's for the whole congregation he said but the hidden Mana was a special Revelation cuz he had to teach others you see was a little more knowledge of the scripture that he could teach others he's supposed to be you see the man the man that begins to teach you he better have some Revelation he better have some abilities brother random said now you're never going to live any higher than your pastor he said because he was the one that was ordained to teach you these things you see you'll never live no higher than your pastor I say you're never going to live any higher than what you're feeding on and if you're feeding on this message you are built to fly are you with me because in this message has the ability to take you to unlimited power because this message breaks a sound barrier it breaks a sound barrier and this bride has been given access to spiritual food and due season and it's not just a little bit here to get you through on Monday but it's an abundance of spiritual food when the rest of the world is in a drought and the rest of the world hasn't experience the power of the Holy Ghost there's a people that are experienced the reign of the Holy Ghost like never before Elijah stood there the tishbite and he called for the Heavens to be shut up and all of Israel was Without Rain for three and a half years neither Dew nor rain fell but Elijah had a special had some hidden Mana because he had somebody that talked to him and said you go up there to the brook of terth and you sat right there and the prophet said he had Porters he had Angels coming in there he was sipping from the water from the brook he was eating on the he was eating on that on that Heavenly Mana that had come down and brother random said in the uncertain sound I think that's a powerful place to draw this from he said there Elijah went up on top of that mountain for three and a half years and they was all up there the rest of them was up there gnawing their tongues for pain but he was sitting up there by that little Brook little spring had spiritual Revelation all the time Waters of Life pouring up he said you see he was called and he stayed there remember he never left that Brook until God Called to him what he saying I'm saying stay in this message I'd say I'd say Elijah has stood in this generation and said there's an abundance of the sound of rain that's coming you may not you may not see it yet but I I hear it coming you think Elijah up there on Mount carel you just just read in MA in First Kings 18 he's up there on Mount Cara you know all the story there they are they ain't got no rain for three and a half years but he miraculously provides 12 barrels of rain of rain water and he goes up there after this and the Bible says unto us that Elijah goes and lays before the Lord on this mountain he ain't got enough strength to get up the mountain but he's got enough power to get down and pray he's got enough power to get down and pray a lot of people didn't understand while they was praying but before he got down and prayed he said Ahab I hear the sound of the abundance of rain coming he saider go up there and look he said ain't nothing there prophet he said go again and he kept on praying and he prayed six times and there was nothing there he said but go up again you see you never seen The Cloud of the son of man until the seventh age but in this hour we hear more than a sea we see more than the size of a man's hand we see a cloud lack unto the son of man and it's got an abundance of Revelation it's got an abundance of spiritual Revelation it's got an abundance of healing in it come on somebody it's more than just for Georgie Carter it's more than just for a little fishy that little fishy had the ability to hear a sound and I heard the prophet say it like this one time he said it showed that God was interested in the Small Things God's interested in the small things but what about you what about you turning around and letting your sound sound off and say God I'm interested in you I'm interested if there could come a sound out of them Hills and said it's time to speak to that little fishy I think it's time that we start speaking of the abundance of rain that has been poured out when the Book of Joel said that in the last days I will pour out my spirit that I have given unto you rejoice I've given unto you the former rain moderately and the latter rain brother Bram just said he said we could not receive the latter rain until we receive the teaching rain because the Harvest rain is the latter rain the holy ghost that comes upon the teaching rain the teacher hadn't sowed the seeds but when the teaching rain came and the seeds have been sowed what is that teaching rain it's a restoration rain it has restored a people back to believe that the Holy Ghost is not just for days gone by but it's restored our faith to believe there's an abundance of it right now that's why the prophet said that the latter rain is rapturing faith that this rain that's being poured out it's an abundance of it come on somebody he's not leaving one of his Jean seeds behind but there's an unlimited power of an abundance of the Holy Spirit that's being poured out in this generation he didn't say I just give out a little bit he said I'll pour out my spirit I'm going to empty what I am in my own flesh upon my people and they shall never be ashamed what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying I hear a sound and it's a sound of the abundance of rain but you ain't got to climb the hill for it you had a prophet stand here in this generation said it's here little bride there it is there it is he said you heard me say I'll keep this until that comes he said but no this is that that the prophet Joel spoke of that in the last days I will pour out my spirit I say it's a sound of rain now I want to come I want to bring this in the sound that you have heard when you hear brother brandom he's coming to the closing hours of his ministry and his lips are going to be sealed and he starts sounding off some revelation he starts breaking into the Rapture he starts breaking into things that are to be he starts breaking into modern events made clear by prophecy he starts breaking in he starts breaking into communion and he starts going into those things what is brother bandham doing he realizes that his lips are getting ready to be closed and he realizes that Satan is trying his best and he's been on your Trail the whole entire time but this message has exposed that Serpent's Trail this message has exposed where he is you see you see that what they what Satan tried to do when he had a drunk driver come down the road and smash into a prophet's vehicle it was the one thing that William Brandon fought so hard against was alcohol he had fought against it but Satan used some boys that had been drunk on alcohol to seal the lips of a prophet and I want to say this Satan you showed up too late you showed up too late because a message got through let me say this they will reject the teaching Reign but if the sword has already been sown then Satan can't stop it they said there's no power in this message I say Satan you showed up too late you say you children can't get the Holy Ghost I say you showed up too late you say you can't get healed you showed up too late I hear the sound of rain what if somebody could shout out I hear the sound of perfect healing I hear the sound of a sound mind I hear the sound of prodical coming back I hear a [Applause] sound I hear a sound I hear a sound even when Elijah didn't see it he was looking at the Unseen parents I want to say this to you when you don't see your young people and your children getting in line with this message you keep looking at the Unseen don't you get disappointed in them you keep your eyes on him you keep your eyes on this message let me say it like this I was I was a bad boy I bet I was a preacher son but that didn't give me rights to the Holy Ghost but because there was an abundance of the rain in this generation that God was able to wash away my sin he was able to fill me with his holy spirit there's a voice behind this message is for you it's for your children it's for them that's a far off there's a lot of people they not understand this voice but it speaks something to you I know a lot of people that that go to sleep with sound machines I know a personal friend of mine a traveling evangelist he goes everywhere doesn't matter where he's going he travels with a box fan he's got used to sleeping with it many of you sleep with sounds of rain at night time what is it is that rain brings calming it brings peace some people hear them sounds I hear and they say it sounds like fried chicken bans fried up that's what somebody told me about but there's something about the sound of rain that it brings healing it brings peace what is this rain now what is this rain that's poured out in this day what is this message it's not a message of disgrace it's a message of Grace what is his rain it's a whole Holy Ghost rain I don't say that the rain that's being poured out has got peace behind it I want to say this that you are on the cusp of peace I want somebody say this I hear the sound of rain now you're not just hearing it with your ears but you're hearing it from an understanding that God give you because you see The Voice and the person are the same thing so they got to line up so what he is has got to be coming out of that sound so if if I stood up here and tried to tell you that he's the same yesterday today and forever but I told you that he doesn't heal no more then you would tell me that there's something wrong with my sound and if you try to tell me that you can't have peace I say there's something wrong with the sound that you're listening to if you tell me that your family is not not not having calmness and not having healing and there's not having Liberty and they're not having Victory I said there's something wrong with this sound but if I could tell you if you can listen to this sound it's unlimited it's got power it's got anointing to me what is so amazing about this sound and I I I'm closing I know I I probably cooked you Goose again but to me is what amazing about this message is the refreshing it has I'll just be dead honest with you brother Ron I get sick and tired of waking up and seeing the news so just don't read it when I get sick and tired you can't hide just because you don't read the news you can't hide from Le Osa it's right in your face I hate having to tell my children about Sodom and Gomorrah I hate after teaching them them things are wrong I I hate seeing no Saints but this message has brought about a rain to it that has given us an escape that's given us an escape out of this thing it's a refreshing in it because you can get so bound up by the things of this world but Elijah had so much refreshing by the sound when Jezebel had took a lot out of him when Israel would not repent it took a lot out of Elijah he just got done dealing with all these shouting baale worshippers it took a lot out of it I'll be honest leot can take a lot out of you people can wear you out your boss can wear you out your family matters can wear you out but this message has got some refreshing in it because Elijah was looking at something he couldn't see but all of a sudden brother Bram said that one Cloud became two clouds and that two clouds became a hill and that Hill became a mountain and that mountain became two mountains and before long the clouds were rolling he said something struck Elijah that it sent a refreshing on the inside of him that he outran ahab's heart say 17 miles and I tell you what that's some refreshing right there I'll be honest I'm going to run 17 miles I better get some of that kind of refreshing I'm probably going to pass out after number two let me say this and I'm closing on this powerful point but we ain't in this thing just for one mile or two miles we're going to run our last mile home come on musicians let's run this message M has got some refreshing in it and even though they ought to see has beat us down let's re receive a refreshing from the Lord God bless [Music]
