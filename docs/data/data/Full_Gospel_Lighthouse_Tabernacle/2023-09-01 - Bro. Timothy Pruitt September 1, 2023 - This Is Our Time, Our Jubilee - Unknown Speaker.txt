just expecting the Lord to do great things and we again thank you for being here and we so appreciate you for being here we are here this weekend because our our former Pastor brother Homer Frazier who came from what seemed was an impossible situation as a bootlegger son and was running from the presence of the Lord one day he heard the voice of the Lord and the Lord got a hold of him in such a way that our Lord Jesus Christ took a boy and made him into a general and made him into a prince of preachers and and just uh just a great man our grandfather here and we just appreciate him we're we're here because God brought him out of a Pentecostal church and gave him a vision to have a lighthouse here in Elkton Virginia and under the leadership of brother Homer Frazier and now our pastor brother Ronald Spencer for 20 these past 23 years 50 years have come and gone so quickly it seems and and like a lighthouse this church has seen and weathered many storms but in all of that it has brought shelter and it's brought safe passage to many a Wandering souls to our Lord Jesus Christ and in these 50 years this church has been a lighthouse for the message shining its light on the Wonder working power of almighty God a lighthouse to prove that God is still a Healer a lighthouse to prove that he still opens the blind eyes that the dead can come back to life a lighthouse to prove that there's liberty in this message a lighthouse that is not ashamed of the outpourings of the Holy Ghost and the moving of the spirit of the Living God this Lighthouse is here to prove that prodigals can and have come back and made the return back home Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah this lighthouse this Lighthouse is here to prove that stroke victims can be made well this Lighthouse is here to prove that paralytics can walk again this Lighthouse is here to show that burnt patients can walk through the fire and come out on the other side without any smoke on them this Lighthouse is here to prove that cancer-ridden patients that were condemned to die can be made whole in the presence of the light this lighthouse this Lighthouse is here as a sign that Jesus is and still will remain to be the mighty conqueror and we are a lighthouse Still Standing 50 years later stronger than we've ever been because our God is the man on the inside of the lighthouse and this one thing that I know that our Lord Jesus Christ is still amongst us doing the miraculous and The Marvelous and there's one thing this church is and has stood for and that's the miraculous power of Jesus Christ but I'm here to tell you our story ain't finished yet and it ain't over and there's more coming there's more coming we've seen Mighty Miracles before but there's more coming we've seen cancer healed before but there's more coming we've seen prodigals return but there's more coming I want you tonight as we invite brother Timothy to take the limits off of your faith and ask God to do the exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ever ask or think so as we invite brother Timothy to come tonight let's move into our inheritance and let's take what's rightfully ours this weekend key of G sister Cassie well the weapon may be formed but it won't prosper [Music] Prevail cause the God I serve knows [Music] oh my God will never fail oh my God we'll never fail oh I'm gonna see a victory well I'm gonna see a

tonight in the house of the Lord and just have some things Lord put on my heart and as we heard already it's it's uh the Jubilee year for this church and I say what a what a testimony amen of a lighthouse that has stood the test of time and stood for the righteousness and Holiness and amen stood for worship and spirit and truth and amen stood for the things of God and the work of God and the Holy Ghost to be free and amen stood for the word and I I appreciate a a a church that'll stand in this dark time that we live in as a lighthouse as a beam of light to say God's not dead but he's still alive amen we sure the low brother Ron Brother Andrew amen the family we sure appreciate them they're they're more than just friends or family amen and we just thank the Lord for them and all that they've done for us in our lives and encouragement that they give to us and amen to Church you don't know many times you don't understand and I I know how that is where we're at sometimes you don't understand how many watch how many look how many see how many uh gather courage from from you as you would Worship the Lord and and and and and and give honor unto him and and respond to his word it means a lot to many around the world and you're indeed a lighthouse and we thank the Lord for you Isaiah 61 and verse 1. uh how many can say it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen hey man just I want to speak a few moments on this is our time our Jubilee amen I believe that I believe it is the hard time it's the bride's time amen Isaiah 61 and verse 1 says the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives the open of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year we know that's the Jubilee year the Year of Jubilee of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn and Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified amen God bless you can be seated a man to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord you know Bill Branham would take this scripture and he would break it up into and begin to speak about it he said Jesus came and he took the scripture and read it to forewarn the people of the coming year of Jubilee He went into the synagogue at Capernaum and sat down and took the scripture and turned it over to Isaiah 61 and 1. and he read this the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he anointed me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord to set the captives at Liberty to give sight to the Blind and when he got through Reading he sat down and handed the scripture back to the priests and he said this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ears and eyes you see he was given forth the warning of the coming forth of the great gusher of Pentecost to set at Liberty everyone that was slaves to sin and were bound as said now at the going forth of that Jubilee it was sounded throughout all the land a trumpet was the sound and every slave that had been bought or become poor and could not take care of their debts and and fell beneath the load and his master and the master for his dead had bought him and had placed him in the field as a slave he had to serve him for he was too poor to redeem himself but God said remember one time you were slaves yourself and down in Egypt and I freed you therefore the sound of the trumpet every slave no matter how long he's been a slave or how short a time he is at Liberty to return to his family to return to his people to be free of every debt for it is the time of Jubilee even you wasn't to plant any corn and that the field was not we're not to be planning you would and you would not trim your Vineyard anything the poor the land was to eat of it a very beautiful type of the Millennium he says but every slave when he heard the trumpet sound he threw down his hoe no matter what he was doing what he was working with and he would say these words I am a free man I couldn't redeem myself but God through his grace has declared this a Year of Jubilee therefore I believe God and I don't have to work anymore the laws of the Lamb land had now claimed him free he said what a beautiful type of the day we were poor we were aliens we had nothing we could do if we kept ever Sabbath we ever knew Moon we quit eating meat if we had all kind of days done all kind of religious sacrifices we were still under a load we were sold in sin our parents sold us out to sin in the Garden of Eden and we're Laden on the bonds of sin as a slave to the devil because wherever one of us was born in sin shaped in iniquity came into this world speaking lies there was nothing we could do to help ourselves because our all whole makeup our whole nature and everything we are is sin he said but when the juvenile any time come we were free and the trumpet now is the gospel the good news amen the trumpet was the Gospel then the good news it is the gospel now the good news you are no longer bound you no longer have to live in sin you can go home and be free you don't owe any debt at all hallelujah hallelujah the whole Emancipation Proclamation is signed and you are free I'm thankful to hear a word tonight that says I'm free amen I once was bound I once was a slave to sin but I heard the gospel sounding out and it sounded into my ear and I heard I didn't have to remain who I was I I didn't have to remain an old sinner I didn't have to remain an old old slum in the slums of sin and iniquity but I heard a sound amen a gospel trumpet sounded in my ear and I can be free maybe tonight you're bound but let me tell you you don't have to leave here bound amen there is a word for your deliverance there is a word for your healing there's a word amen to turn your sadness into Joy it'll turn your your sorrow into gladness there is a word for your deliverance amen the devil wants to come and put sadness and put Gloom upon us but I say tonight away with Satan and his glue and wind up with the Praises of almighty God Amen our God is here among us and we know amen we're not serving a dead God we're not serving a dead letter we're not serving a god of history or a book of history but I'm serving a god who's still the same yesterday today and forever I'm serving of God if he once healed he always heals if he wants saved he always say I'm serving a God who has the power to move in this moment and in this time in a gospel Tropic and sound and you can walk out of here delivery Hallelujah that's the kind of God I serve this is not a god of History this is not a god of yesterday this is not a god of 60 years ago this is our time Hallelujah This is Our Moment you know brother Adam said I was reading sometime about the Emancipation Proclamation when the slaves are colored Brethren sisters in the South used to have slavery and it but it was signed they had been whipped they had been beat and so forth been slaves and we know what happened they said on a certain morning he said I don't remember the date just now but that morning you're going to be free and you're free at Sun up when the Sun rises all the slaves could go free those poor decrepit hard being slaves were so anxious to be free Hallelujah so anxious to be healed so anxious to be delivered so anxious amen for God to fulfill his word to the strongest of them climbed up on the top of the hill and all the others down and they said begin to see is that as that Darkness began to give way to life and they begin to be streaks of the sun coming across and it was it was so dark down in the valley where the others was but those that were on top began to relay it down and one from the top said we're free amen and the next one hollered down we're free all the way down to the valley we're free why are we free because the Sun is up I don't know that was the s u in he said but oh brother now the s-o-n is up we are free hallelujah what happened in our generation there was a prophet of God who climbed into the portals of heaven and he saw a word that had been restored and he said the Sun is up Hallelujah and if the Sun is up it has the same power as it had yesterday it has the same life-giving streak as it has yesterday I'm here to tell you this evening the Sun is up I've got good news for you you might have come in here with glue he might have come in here with towel you may have come in here with unbelief but the Sun is up and he's up in the stress same strength as he had yesterday he has the same power he has the same ability he has the same life he has the same healing he has the same Joy the Sun is up Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's not dead but He's Alive forevermore the Sun is up therefore because he's up we can shout and praise God because the Sun is up [Applause] why is there so much noise cause the Sun is up [Applause] why is there so much noise because the sun is Among Us amen he is risen with healing in his wings the Sun is up you once we're slaves to sin he once were slaves to church denominations and church energy and all those things but now you're free am I talking to any free people [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah you know what it once was to have that sleigh belt on you I don't know hey there's some people that comes to the house of God and they think man they ain't nothing but a bunch of holy people no listen we know what it was like to be slaves of sin we know what it was like to be bound but now we also know what it's like to be free we also know what it's like to be healed and delivered amen because why the Sun is up and it's our morning it's our time [Applause] Hallelujah the gospel trumpet is sounded in our day proclaiming the good news we're no longer slaves we're no longer slaves to sin we're no longer slaves to sickness slaves are spirits of any kind we don't have to bow down to any devil no more [Music] Hallelujah you've been dragging that hole around you've been dragging it around it's time you realize a gospel sounding throw it down [Applause] oh my we are the trumpet sound and his power it's brought a freedom to the people of God I just went through a few of them what you can throw down quotes ready to have a throw down all right you can throw down that hole you can throw down your crutches you can throw down your cots you can throw down your Traditions you can throw down your own thoughts you can throw down your own unbeliefs and you can stand in the freedom of almighty God all right it's our turn in the Jubilee it's our turn to be delivered it's our turn to be set free it's my turn to be healed it's my turn to experience all things are possible [Applause] you are in a line for a miracle thank you [Music] the word the trumpet has sounded in power and demonstration Hallelujah listens I believe that the age has come now can you say now all right I believe the age has come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit with power signs and wonders this great pouring out of God's spirit in the last days that's the thing that'll bring Faith into the people that'll take a Rapture in faith to take to church in the glory I believe it laughs that is what's been released in this age it's the power of the Holy Ghost as it was in that day amen the day of Pentecost amen the phenomenal the miraculous came with it the phenomenal the miraculous comes with it now the baptism the Holy Ghost released again in this day it is poured out with it the miraculous listen when the spirit of God moved in the first Exodus it moved with signs and great wonders the pillar of fire there was a light in every Exodus there was an angel in every Exodus it was a killing of the other children in every Exodus amen those are if you'll notice his types and this is all the same through every Exodus but a pillar of fire appeared in a message and it said let my people go and he came and showed himself personally with signs and great wonders Amen in the first Exodus and signs and great wonders in the second Exodus and a light appeared on the banks of the Jordan River and it said let my people go and a light is also come in this Third Exodus and with it the miraculous the holy spirit is being poured out and his Gathering of people to believe all things are possible and a pillar of fire appeared again in our day and a message with it it said let my people go thank you Hallelujah Let My People Go amen what it was that he said the holy spirit in the form of the pillar of fire god coming down in manifestation brought out the first Texas brought the Israel out of Egypt the second Exodus which was Christ bringing the church out of Judaism the third exes is the same Pillar of Fire it takes the bride from the church the supernatural working in a supernatural people God fulfilling his word and backing it up by the miraculous you say well we have the word wonderful but you can't separate the word from the miraculous where he is the miraculous is always present Amen in this generation under the third Pearl It produced miracles amen the Antichrist Spirit wants to put the miraculous and the supernatural in a day going by saying it's not the day of Miracles that's the devil at work he may not can talk you out of what God can do but what he'll try to tell you is not for today [Applause] he just wants to tell you that it's for another day it's for another moment your deliverance is not tonight it's another time no it's when you're here the gospel trumpet the third poll brought nothing but miraculous dead fish was raised files created storms spoke out of existence tumor spoke out of existence hatties boys prodigals came home is still among us today care how many dead preachers get up and say it ain't so I say it's for a day gone by it's still for today [Applause] what the devil don't care is if somebody else gets their time or somebody else gets their turn he just don't want you having yours but today is my day of visitation today I will see a victory in my life God be glorified foreign [Applause] the day of Miracles has not passed as says the theologians the day of Miracles is if the day of Miracles has passed the day of God has passed God is a miracle we got message preachers supposedly message preachers I think they're more like Church of Christ preachers saying that we're not in the season of Miracles no more what you're saying is you're not in the season of God no more Ichabod has been wrote over the door remember where God is Miracles take place where God is healings takes place deliverances take place there's joy that comes I'll just reading back there I should have brought it with me said when we get over there on the other side he said we want to look back and say why did I fear so much he said look at all the joy I missed Hallelujah God wants you to have joy and not just when you're on a Mountaintop not just wings are going good and ain't nobody's sick there ain't nobody doing everything just Rosy Rosy Rosy no God wants you to have joy no matter what [Applause] listen we're not having Joy because times are good we're having Joy because this word is true what his word said that's all that matters is there a brother Timothy I need a preacher to tell me something I need something like that to happen let me tell you what you need to do is hear the word of God the word said I don't have to I'm not going to be healed because somebody told me I'm Healed because the word said I can have joy because the word said I can have peace I can have happiness I can have it all because the word said I could well in the days of Miracles has passed oh you say Well when the days of Miracles past the day of God has passed for God is miracles quote the days of Miracles will never be passed and never was and never will be see my God told Moses you go and I'll send an angel before you to keep in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared and don't notice how he tells them what's going to happen I'm going to send an angel and he's coming I'm going to lead you and he's going to lead you to the place I have prepared in other words when God leads somebody he's got a place in mind already for their destination and all the little stuff in between does not matter to God is not concerned about a Red Sea because he'll open it and make a way through it he is not concerned about bitter Waters because he got a tree it'll go down in it and make it sweet he's not concerned about no water no food because he's got he's Jehovah jira he's more than enough he's not concerned about the Wilderness he's not concerned about none of that it's like I was telling her church the other day they said the scripture says the word of God is a light unto my path now we think in terms of Q beams right big spotlights see a long ways down there um there ain't no problems in between here and there but David David said that you know what they had they had these little vessels it was a little Cruise of all and had a little Wick and it had just a little lamp on the end of it they would light and you know what to do it light up just enough to show their next step and the next step and the next step see God's intention is to get you to victory but you may not see all those pitfalls or things that's in the way don't worry God's going to make a way through it God's going to make a way through that sickness God's going to make a way through that trial just let the word lead you and guide you all the way we love the spotlights that ain't the way God works because God wants you to have faith in what he says he told Moses I'm going to take you to a prepared place and the angel we know is Angel of Covenant which was Christ Jesus he said the people many of them did not believe it so those who did not believe perished those who did believe went into the promised land and Men Who reject reject light went into total darkness and he said I believe today those who reject the Holy Spirit In The Light Of God the days of Miracles and so forth will go back into total darkness do you see how Pharaoh's heart what happened it got dark why because he rejected God amen and he said listen brother and sister the name of our Lord please get me right now what I'm trying to say to you that God who came out and led the Church of God out of Egypt the bondative the bondage into Freedom has come again in the same manner to lead his church spiritual out of the bondage of sin first by the Holy Spirit sickness next and the third step is to go into Glory so he has a place prepared for us and there's an angel who's guiding this church Hallelujah God called in Exodus of separation from where they were at the present time and God is making ready to fulfill his Divine promised word that he gave to Abraham Isaac and Jacob here years hundreds of years had passed but yet God never forgets his promise hello somebody is I've been waiting a long time God never forgets his promise [Applause] I doubt very seriously anybody in this building been waiting 400 years but God never forgets his promise amen I in the season the due time God will bring his promises right he says therefore you can rest assured that what God has promised in this Bible he's going to do it hallelujah hallelujah hallah put on the garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness the devil's been wanting to anoint you with some Spirit of heaviness because of some issue you're in or some situation what you need to do right now and say Lord I'm going to put on my body the Garment of Praise hey you chose what church you would wear what pants you would put on what shoes you would wear what skirt you would wear tonight you chose it you pulled it out of her closet and you put it on ain't it amazing that God alive he he he brings it to the same place that you could take the Garment of Praise you can leave it in the closet if you want to you can carry on in your bitterness and your sorrow and glue if you want to amen but you don't have to amen because there's a Garment of Praise that's been extended to the Bride of Jesus Christ [Applause] Hallelujah and she can praise him when all hell is hell crazy when all sickness is coming on every side and seeking praise it when trials on every hand she can praise him when she don't feel like it she can praise him when the devil tells her not to [Applause] Hallelujah I don't believe there's a lid in here to blow off amen let's just let's just let the heavens open up and let God fill this room [Applause] Hallelujah there's been a lot of you that's been under trials for a long time but I'm here to tell you this is your Jubilee [Applause] there's been some of you the devil has told time and time and time you'll never get it you'll never make it it'll never happen but this is your Jubilee oh Hallelujah this is your Jubilee thank you how do you know because I heard the word I have come down I I have heard their cry I remember my promise I've seen what the taskmasters has done I've seen what cancer has done I've seen what that only Slew Foot devil has done to my people but this is their moment [Applause] there's an anointing there's a power there's a Grace of almighty God that'll go to you right now you say brother Timothy I don't even know what I believe I'm gonna tell you right now there's a liberty for you you say I don't even know how I got here tonight there's a liberty for you like you've never experienced before I'm going to be with you and my never failing presence oh Hallelujah now we'll be with you wherever you go don't be afraid I'm coming down to deliver come on [Music] I'm sure the spiritual mind catches that he says I'm coming down to the liver he says you know he said how can how we can rest and have faith and can catch a hold there God is going to do it he promised it no matter what circumstances is or what anybody says God is going to do it doesn't matter what a doctor says God is going to do it because we're not dependent on just the tree of knowledge and Good and Evil there's a tree of life to step onto [Music] amen he said I I said you know he said he said A man does it so simple he says or he said God does it so simple it goes over the understanding of the cultured mind who try to reason about how can it be I don't mean to say what a man that a man now with a good strong mind find education that that man won't understand it that's all right wonderful as long as he don't use that man that mind to reason it but that culture that he's got to believe God he said let it be converted unto the Simplicity of listening to what God Said and believe what he said he said then his culture will help him then notice he said when a man tries to reason it can't be done then that drives him away from God constantly all the time listen to what his own understanding if you don't understand and the Bible says a certain thing just punctuate it with an amen just let it go like that amen I don't know what it means amen I don't know how to put it all together but amen but in the first Exodus why they were down in Egypt why why would God's people be out of that land after all God promised it right where the beginning was with Isaac Abraham Isaac and Jacob Palestine God gave him the land This Is It said this is it oh then why were the people not be in the place that God provided them he said that's the question of today also God give us Pentecost God give us the book of Acts he'd give us the Holy Spirit to lead us and guide us he'd give us a land so why would you be out of it he said why is the church out of it why isn't the great church today living again like the book of Acts bringing forth the same thing what is the book of Acts the acts of the Holy Ghost they went down into Egypt all because the jealousy of a brother he said that's the reason Israel was in Egypt was because jealousy of a brother remember God promised us was only as long as they stayed in that land but we know the story he says they had taken from his brothers they taken from from Joseph because he was spiritual he was a great man homeless of the bunch the least of the bunch and they hated him without a cause they should not have hated him they should have respected him because why did they hate him because he was brother not exactly that they hated him because God dealt with them more than he did the rest of them he gave them a spiritual understanding he can interpret dreams perfectly he could foretell things that would come to pass perfectly just exactly the way that he didn't pull no punches he saw dreams of those cheese being but bound before his sheep and his brother got angry and said I guess then you little Holy Roller and in other words we'll have to bow down before you someday well yeah matter of fact you will it's what happened it wasn't Joseph's attitude but that's what happened he said but that's the way it happened how were these great big giants ever bowing before that little insignificant fellow standing there but they didn't sure and pleaded for mercy we find out about doing this Joseph was taken from among the Brethren and set out to himself we know the story went had went down to Egypt he said the story of this jealous brother is certainly a great comparison with the spiritual side of it today we are all aware of that that old dirty filthy jealousy they see the same Bible the nature of the same God that wrote the Bible vindicating himself and turned that down without a reason he said pure well not pure it's dirty jealousy Watching God heal the sick raise the Dead the same God that lived in the days of the Apostles is the same gospel that they wrote and for the spiritual journey is the same God that does the same thing today now there's nothing but jealousy and it's excommuted and said we'll not have it among our people they taught the Brethren that they'd never have used for a man like that why why don't we just get rid of her that's the same thing that's happening today because our churches have become intellectual and the best dressed crowds and the biggest organization and the smartest ministers that we have no use of the holy spirit in the way that it was back there foreign they are full in other words actions speak louder than words they're seminaries their brain their being they're coming together and discussing this thing or more able with their own intellectual Minds to set a church in order better than what the Holy Spirit can do it they don't need it no longer it's something we don't need today it's days of that has passed we don't need the Holy Ghost to heal the Holy Spirit to heal the sick we got doctors we don't need the Holy Spirit to speak with tongues we're all intelligent people and when you do you take right from your framework the lifeline come on somebody Jesus said them Jews in his day have you not read the stone that was rejected as the Chief Cornerstone and the building is setting upon you see what I mean sure you can catch it the reason of it is now is because they thought they never have need of it we don't need speakers with tongues we don't need interpreters of tongues we no longer need an Old Testament Prophet we no longer need the ministry but we don't need none of that by the Holy Spirit we have adopted a man-made system to take the place of the Holy Spirit therefore there is a but therefore there is a people that's elected it has their names on the lamb Book of Life they can't go for that they can't go for that they are spiritually minded therefore they will never go for that they can't stand it no matter how much their mothers and fathers lived in organizational Church he said but the church feels they don't need the Holy Spirit the church will tell you that and man will stand up and give you this is a quote man will stand up and give you such an intellectual talk can almost make you believe it he said now let's stop there a minute didn't Jesus say the two would be so close together it would deceive the very elected if possible the congregation says amen the intellectual talks would be so smooth it would deceive people it's gospel it's men who can handle the word in such a way that he could almost make any intellectual person if you're trusting in your intellects that they would condemn the Holy Spirit and take the way of man we see that now that's the same thing they thought about Joseph they got rid of him but all down in Egypt how we can think how I could spend hours you could stay here for three years and never leave that subject day and night and still that that burns your 45 minutes of don't you and still be finding the great Colonels of the Holy Spirit the spiritual mind can look down in Egypt and see that persecution rise can see Joseph taken out of the way and so it could rise and then see God wills and the wheels everything moving exactly right see potiphar reject Joseph see Joseph in prison and his beard growing out and excommunicated but all of a sudden God Moves In Hallelujah ah we can see the wheel in the middle of the wheel moving God's great plan moving everything up to this Exodus right here right here oh brother Timothy I'm down to my last thread of Hope but all of a sudden God Moves In brother Timothy the doctors don't give up on me but all of a sudden God Moves In brother Timothy's done got so dark how are we going to make it through any of this time and take a body change all of a sudden God Moves In okay I like it when he moves in changes the whole scene go through the scriptures immediately and suddenly scripture is full of them immediately the leper was healed immediately they received their sight and suddenly there was a sound from heaven all of a sudden God moved in that changes the whole equation our brother job been spent some time on that maybe some of you saw an impossible math listen with math can sometimes be impossible well what changes the whole equation of life is when all of a sudden God Moves In change it for the three Uber children they were heading right down to their death and they took their last step into the fire but all of a sudden amen that's the way God moves sometimes he waited but brother Brown would bring it out time go listen to it in the darkest moments that's when Jesus comes by amen is right at those moments of Despair it's right at those moments that you're ready to give up it's right it'll just hold on just hold on I hear the sound of abundance of rain I hear the sound of a mighty Russian way amen I can blow through your life and change everything in just a moment Hallelujah Romans 8 11 said to the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you Jesus had the word of his resurrection he spoke and he said if you destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up again but if it had not been no Dynamics had not been no spark to make that word live it has still been dead in a tomb amen but I'ma tell you this word is not a dead word it's a Living Word it's a breathing word it changes people it changes people this word heals it delivers you say you got scripture for that I sure do Psalms 107 19 then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and they saved them out of their distresses he sent his word and healed them and deliver them from their destruction all that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works of the Children of Men the word has movement in it it has breath in it it has life in it and when it's anointed by the spirit of the Living God if it's not anointed by the spirit then his dead letter he's got scripture for that sure do second Corinthians 3 and verse 2 said your Epistles written are hard known and read of all men for as much as you have manifestedly declared to be the Epistles of Christ ministered by US Written not of ink but the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart that's where he wanted to write it is in your heart amen and such trust have we through Christ to God we're not that we're sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life Hallelujah but Lord let's keep on reading but if the administration of death ridden and Engraving in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel should not could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countless which Glory has been was to be done away with how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious come on now if he was glorious in the Old Testament how much more glorious is he now because his word is not written on tables of stone it's written in living hearts hallelujah amen well that's why he would say to those who wanted to keep the noise down and wanted to keep the noise down he said if I tell them to hold their peace The Rock's gonna cry out he already ridden a rock and The Rock didn't have no breath but he said if I tell these Living Stones if I tell these ones who have breath in their life who can hear the word of God to hold their peace then these rocks are going to cry out I'm here to tell you they ain't a rock gonna take my place I have heard the word of the God I have hired the ministration of the spirit and his life I said it's life it has spread it has power when this ministration of the spirit Goes Forth it heals the sick it races a dead it says the captive free it is even more glorious [Music] [Applause] ain't no table of stone gonna take my place ah it's done been written here you are free he don't ever have to write on me no more Thou shalt not and thou shalt not Thou shalt not he writes on you you're free you're delivered it's over with the devil lost his power he don't have no power this is what is riding on your heart Hallelujah I remember when it was written on a little lady's heart about 90 pounds she was ate up with cancer but it got written on her hearts and said you are healed and around and around that building she went oh God right on our hearts this weekend right on our hearts this weekend I'm delivered I am a child of God I am a blood-bought Southern Living God I never belong to the devil he might have had me down in the pawn shop but there was a blood that paid the price and I am free I said I'm free whatever you need to do is look at that devil who's been a Taskmaster of your life and he's beat you over the head with Gloom you need to throw that hair hold down and say devil you can't touch me now one more time cause I have heard that gospel trumpet if that Spirit they raised Jesus up from the dead it dwell in you it also Quicken your mortal body if he walked out of the Grave you can walk out too oh if he walked over sickness I can walk over it too if he walked over depression I can walk over it too Hallelujah if he walked over hell I can walk over it too he's under my feet [Applause] now the Lord is at Spirit and we're the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty all right go ahead this is your time this is your Jubilee hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah what he did I can do too hallelujah what a mighty God we serve the word alone is a dead letter but if there's a light a spark it'll make it live and the same spirit that raised that dead body up from the grave is now again dwelling in human bodies and if it took that dead body and raised it up and walked out of a crave it'll take he who is dead and sins and iniquity and he'll walk out of that gray I'm here to tell you this evening amen the spirit of Resurrection in life is Among Us the same one that walked to the Grave called Lazarus when he laid there it's the same one here tonight and he has the same power thank you here's why I don't know of anybody laying in that kind of grave maybe not right here in this building but there's Graves of sin there's Graves of unbelief there's Graves of doubt there's Graves of sickness there's Graves of of the depression and anxieties and fears there's all kinds of griefs but there's a voice of Resurrection and it says to you tonight come forth come forth come forth come forth pride of Jesus Christ walk out of it and some of you tonight need to walk out of your Dow walk out of your fear walk out of your unbelief you might come walking out like this and Jesus didn't leave Lazarus like that he said loose him and let him go [Music] so you know what it is he loosed his feet so he could dance he loosed his hands so he could clap and he loosed his mouth so he could speak I'll say it tonight woman they want loose Hallelujah those grave codes can't hold you that pass can't hold you the devil that's kind of held over your life it's over with there is a power in this building that'll defeat every sin it'll defeat every disease every trick and every trap of the devil [Applause] you know brother Brandon would say he said we but we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the Dynamics we need the dynamic power of God the resurrected power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline you can have a gas can but it can be full of water but what determines whether it's gas or whether it's water is a spark [Music] amen you let a spark go through and it'll blow up that's what we need in our churches is the spark of the Holy Ghost [Applause] he said that's Sonic come up and the dirt will lay there and that sun and say man that sun is so hot this sermon is so long I'm so bored can't wait to go watch my sport removal but that sees this this is what I'm looking for [Music] this is my time to come to life this is my moment to rise up out of this old dirty place hahaha hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I got to read near the other day about those giant sequoias largest trees on Earth they can grow for more than 3 000 years but without fire they cannot produce reproduce amen the great Sequoias are really born in the fire the fire gives them three things first it punches a hole in that Forest where light can shine through greater than it's ever shown I see why they don't want to let the fire loose because they don't want holes punched through their dogmas and through their Creeds that's kept people bound [Applause] but I say turn the fire loose the second thing that adult that fire does it heats up the seeds so the cones that are in those mature trees it Heats them up enough that they can drop down the seeds to the ground hello you old trees you need fire too [Music] amen for the final thing is done it clears away all the leaves or all the dead matter that's laying on the ground [Music] so when that seed Falls it has some rich soul to fall into [Applause] Hallelujah I was up and bath there with my wife or brother Jerry Fury and his wife and we were on a lake and we're going on this tour and on one side was this old burn over and on this other side was the most beautiful Grove of trees you ever seen and there was this guy that was on that boat he said hey let me ask y'all a question he said hi which one of y'all knows where the life is where the animals are where where life and birds and Things Are and I was just sitting back and watching and listening because I know what brother Branham said and so others oh man it's got to be over there with that beautiful Forest is it's so pretty that over there's nothing but a bunch of burn over look it's just ugly he said no matter of fact he said every bit of life is right over there he said to me you know why those trees are still standing he said because at the end of that is Bap he said so men have regulated fires to such a place that they have now made it to where we try not to let a fire get out because it's going to burn down the town and he said but if what needs to happen to that Force to bring life again there needs to be a fire get out [Music] he said but man it regulated and men have made it to such a place they've actually taken the life out well I'm gonna tell you what he was preaching to me I thought God how many men have stood behind pulpits and regulated the fire of God don't want her to get out I'm afraid of wildfire I'm afraid of this that and the other and they regulate the fire of God amen I've seen men that have stood behind pulpits and try to preach balance and balance the spirit of God right out of the church hey man I can tell you a scripture that says quench not the spirit in other words don't be a spiritual fire extinguisher every time you see a little fire you want to throw your old wet blanket up I'm telling you one thing this fire is about to get so big it's about to get no great there ain't enough Winds of hell they could all it's gonna do is make it get hotter make it get greater make it get taller make it get bigger Oh Glory to God in the highest I say let the seed of God rejoice in the spirit of God Let the Fire Fall I said Let the Fire Fall your wet blanket up and throw it in the trash and let God move in the hearts [Applause] Hallelujah as we bring this down he said mechanics don't run the church it's the Dynamics that run it the holy ghost that gets into the word it's not a seminary that teaches you Theology and Greek interpretation but it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost that sets in a fire and brings the word to pass and will make it live exactly what the promised word is for this hour not mechanics the Dynamics it takes mechanics and it takes Dynamics it takes the word and it takes the spirit they are the one that gives life he said we've studied the mechanics until it's all mechanical Mercy let me go on down right here if we get down this what about the fire brother Timothy the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that is worked in small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and the body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up exactly like that the dead in Christ for hundreds and thousands of years will rise and the beauty of his Holiness and take the flight to the skies the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost amen so don't look for Less look for more let's not look for Less healings let's look for more let's not look for Less deliverances let's look for more let's not look for Less Chronicles let's look for more prodigals let's not look for last families to be reached for the Lord let's look for more to be restored let's look for sugar diabetes to be delivered it's her to be defeated every Spirit to go under our feet As We rise and rise and rise in the power of almighty God [Applause] brother Branham talked about those old trees and that burn over remember that I was in that place really Doug Baker sitting on the side of Mount Lemmon in the daylight and that wind began to blow up through the burn of Mount Baker Mountain limit had a bad burn
