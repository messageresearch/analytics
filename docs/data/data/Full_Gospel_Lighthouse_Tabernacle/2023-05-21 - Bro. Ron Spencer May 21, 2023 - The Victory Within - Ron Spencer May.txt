each every one of you not only this assembly but brother Reagan's assembly it's been such a triangle of strength for me um my son is a miracle I prayed for many times I didn't think about this just speak my heart I guess I prayed many times God you can give him a new heart you can do anything towards the time it came appropriate I guess the Lord moving this way for a transplant it just occurred to me as the way I began to speak to my son son none of us know the reasons none of us know the why but there's a testimony beholding of you in the future or somebody that may see you in that hospital was only shortly after that I heard brother Ron speaking of the time he had the stroke and the nurse catching him is praying and the testimony that was there's a reason for all these things I don't know them but he knew them before us my son your son is at home today he has challenges but I know God knows the future I know God has healed him I know with all my heart Marcus the symptoms are there this is that and the other wow he's with us he's fellowshipping while he was in the hospital he drew me close and said dad I don't know the timing and all but you know it's four hours from here he said but when when I can he says I talked to my my wife and I want my children we're going to make our way up to Full Gospel hopefully couple times a month he didn't have to tell me that I didn't ask him for that but I thank God for his healing power I know he's healed today and I've not sure here it's probably a congregational but it's on my heart when I look I can't see good things he's done for me I know I'm Unworthy of them all but it's blessings he freely gives I owe my life to him I've got so much I want to thank it with me let's make this together oh I've got so much I wanna thank him

bless you amen we'll live in a world one of these days without batteries wires or electricity or cell phones iPads a lot of stuff amen so good to see you this morning isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord amen trust you've had a good day already and good week and and he's been so good to us and and I went to my brother's daughter Charities graduation yesterday they had it late and and uh so we had a reception at the at Mark's Church at the fellowship hall they're redoing that church and and so probably 30 35 of us were gathered there and and kind of had a little catered meal and Mark said hey we need to try out the new system that we've got he said would you mind preaching so we just had a spontaneous service they sung for a bit and I preached for a bit and the Lord came down for a bet so amen he'll always show up when he he's not so he's not so concerned about how it is all set up and stuff everywhere you know he just listen he preached on the ship so borrowed a ship and stood there and preached for a while and so yeah he don't mind coming to where we're at so but Mark it's so good to see you here brother Marcus has done such a phenomenal job of keeping brother Donnie and myself in in contact of what's going on with Daniel we we don't say a prayer without calling Daniel's name and and um what a journey that he's been on and so we're we're just praying that God would just completely restore his body I tell you what you don't get a new heart physically and not have some complications and some issues and take a few days to get over it and you sent us a picture the other day he was had got home and he had his little boy in his arms and I tell you what that did me a world of good there's not a hospital in the world that can do for you what your home and your children in your lap can do and so Matthew don't sit in my lap no more but hey man but when my grandbabies call up in my lap that does me a world of good and when Zoe finally crawls up in my lap I'm going to say yeah she she's waving at me when Zoe crawls up in my lap one of these days like she does Alden and some of these uh there's she got my brother's lap yesterday and I thought what is the world is going on here I look like that and we have somewhat the same nature she never gets in my lap and she just went right straight to him and got into Israel happens so amen Marcus I would have really been praying for you and so we know not only is that a deal for Daniel but also for the entire family so amen God bless you we have a wedding here Tuesday and I don't know who all is invited that's not that's above my pay grade but Isaac and Jeannie is getting married at 1 30 and on Tuesday and we congratulate him one one if I show up at 1 30 we've all got issues but I'm writing with Connie and so I'll be here on time and so I knew she was tired last night she let me drive all the way home and so I figured she was right right ready to fall over so she trusts me driving Hallelujah to the lamb and so amen and so we're looking forward to your wedding I think we're is it okay to have a run through right after service today the choir is going to sing and then we're going to move the chairs and we'll get that taken care of and we want to do that right one thing you want to do right is a web and the other ones you wanna death in time testing testing one two let me just put it in my pocket and that way maybe it'll do better amen amen we want to pray I I spoke with brother Terry before service and I want to continue to remember him and he lost his foster mother this this week and and they had their funeral there and so the Terry is a real friend of mine and a real buddy and uh if you ever get a chance to hear Brother Terry's story it's a powerful story of predestination and the power of love and the Terry went through a lot of things as a child but God gave him Grace he gave him Brenda amen I mean that I really mean that Brenda's Brenda is an awesome person and so don't you cry on me but Brenda's an awesome person and we love her with all of her hearts and amen amen she's probably one of my biggest fans and so I better say good things about her and so gotta got a got a shower this week on Friday and uh sister Katie for her baby shower and uh so we just pray that that goes well as well and I will be speaking at my brothers they're having a rededication of the the church this coming week and on Friday night and I will be there on Friday night so I'll invite everybody that's not a sister Katie's baby shower and uh I'll be there service will start at seven o'clock and and uh Gabriel's gonna drive me up so don't worry it'll be okay Andrew is Andrew is going to be at brother Donnie Reagan's on Friday Saturday and Sunday and so we want to pray for her brother you may have announced this last night but we want to pray for brother Andrew we're really proud of him uh brother William is that brother uh Dales this week in Georgia he's got family there as well and so we pray that God would just bless brother William as he's there speaking as an extension of our church and so we're so glad that he's able to do that but Andrew is going to be there so he won't be at your shower I won't be either so amen and so uh we're we're looking we're looking we're looking forward to all of these things Mark and them has basically redid the church and repainted the church they started out going to paint one wall and they painted all of the walls and and they did a lot of things there put in a new sound system and that's actually what they were wanting to do just try out the sound system last night and so he said we need a preacher that'll preach and we can try out the sound system well they had one and so we preached and so God gave us rich in Mercy and blessed us there sister Mary Betty brother Harold's mother her funeral her wake is tomorrow night and that's at Tiger Funeral Home Kiger it's not Kiger well I'm going to send you the wrong one it's at Elkton Pentecostal church and so I you know who knows and so am I that's where they had her his Harold's Daddy's funeral yeah I went to that I was a speaker there at that funeral and uh can I share a couple things this morning I just kind of feel this relaxed and so my Sugar's been over 600 this morning so I felt like I've been in a blur all day so I'm coming down so I'm not going to go to sleep on you but at brother Harold's funeral Daddy's funeral brother Homer and I was invited to be speakers there along with about 18 other guys and so and so anyway I was sitting beside of the pastor and it was a huge crowd and said it like a minute so so anyway I was sitting beside the pastor and and all of the other ministers that were sitting with us and and I was sitting there and I was looking at all the pastors on the wall that had been there before and I I was looking around at how things were and and the pastor that I knew him and we were I was just chit chatting with him before the funeral and and I looked at The Pianist and I thought about what brother Branham said when that man when that man invited him to to meet his wife and and he called her a saint and brother Branham was just it was one of those truth mornings and brother Branham walked over and shook her hand said I thought you called her a saint she looks like a hand I thought of that and I didn't tell that man the story but I I reminded him that brother Branham actually preached in that pulpit and right here actually brother Brandon spoke right here and then he went to the Armory and spoke brother Brennan would come into an area and maybe speak at a couple of different Pentecostal groups and and then and then he would go to the Armory to speak I I think it was a several days there snowstorm came and and so anyway I just I just said brother Branham spoke here in this Pulpit he kind of just nodded his head yes I said can you imagine this congregation turned down brother Branham because he wore a watch and they called him Whirly and he just kind of set dumbfounded for a bit but if I could have told it the truth just up the road about a mile there's a group of people that still believe his message and we're really proud of that I had an event that happened and and some of some of you haven't heard some of these things and brother Chris was talking to me the other day said won't you share some of those stories so maybe maybe through life I'll just share a story now and then as we come to it I I woke up one morning and this was before Harold's father died several years before he died I woke up in a setup on the bed and I was just sitting there and I saw a vision and then the vision I saw brother Harold's father who was a singer I saw him strum in a guitar standing in the pulpit and I saw him drop with a heart attack and at the same time his mother was sitting back in the audience Mary Betty was sitting in the audience and she falls over with a heart attack I really didn't know what to do with it and the Lord impressed on me to to have lunch with Harold and Harold was a mama's boy a real real lover of his mother and father and so Harold worked with 4 million so it was convenient to do it and I said Harold we'll have dinner together and see we went to dinner and I just kind of I just kind of talked to him for a bit and I said Harold I need to share a story with you I said I I had a vision this morning and I told him exactly what the vision was and I said here's what I want me and you to do I want me and you to pray I don't want you to tell a soul but I want me and you to to pray I told sister Connie I've always want to have a vision I tell Connie and I tell the boys that I've had a vision so that's not you know some people go well I had a vision but they never told nobody so there's no Vindication for it everybody can have a vision after it happens and so as it would be that coming Sunday morning that whole thing happened he uh her his father stepped up in the pulpit and he began to strum the guitar and begin to talk and he fell over with a heart attack and at the same time Mary Betty fell over with a heart attack and they would get them to the hospital and actually Harold's father would code two different times that I know of on the way and so they were able to revive him and and I went to the hospital brother Homer and myself went to the hospital that evening of course the whole family was there Harold had shared this story we knew this was getting ready to happen God had control we had prayer for it before it happened I'll never forget what can you call me his name his name Amos Amos and uh I'm a little blurry this morning so anyway I I I shook his hand in the at the bedside I shook his hand and so I shook his hand and he said you're a prophet I said no but I know one I know one I just I just believe the same message and God just does his gifts and as it would be Mary Betty and Amos would live for many years and and uh and we love them with all of our hearts and cared for them and and so I won't be able to be at their funeral but we just are praying for him she lived 93 years that's quite a it's quite a life and so anything past 70 is your own strength and so once you get past 70 it's your own strength and so we're just praying that that God would just be merciful to them and the family and minister to them and and so many other things amen amen isn't he good to us we just love him with all of our hearts I want to share a I want to share something with you that that was dropped to me this week and it means a lot to me this journey is short an elderly woman got on a bus and sat down and at the next stop a strong grumpy young woman climbed up and sat down beside of the old woman hitting her with a numerous bunch of bags when she saw that elderly woman remained silent the young woman asked her said why she had not complained when she got hit with all of those bats the elderly woman replied with a smile there's no need to be rude or discuss something that's insignificant as my trip next to you is so short because I'm going to get off at the next stop this answer deserves to be written in Gold letters there is no need to discuss something insignificant because our journey together is is too short each of us must understand that our time in this world is so short that darkening it with useless arguments and jealousy and not forgiving others discontentment and bad attitudes are a ridiculous waste of time and energy did anyone break your heart stay calm life is short did someone betray you intimidate or cheat you or humiliate you relax don't be stressed this trip is too short did someone insult you without reason stay calm ignore it I think I'm going to put this on my forehead this trip is too short did a neighbor make a comment that you didn't like stay true stay calm ignore it this trip is too short whatever the problem someone has brought us remember that our journey together is is too short no one knows the length of our trip nobody knows when it will arrive and that it stop our trip together is too short let us appreciate friends and family let us be respectful and kind and forgiving because we will be filled with gratitude and joy after all our trip together is very short share a smile enjoy the day because you trip is way too short amen isn't it good Stonewall Jackson was standing in a Battlefield and at the battle of the American Civil War a general ask Stonewall Jackson how is it that you can keep so cool while the bullets are literally rained down around him and Jackson instantly became grave and earnestly answered my religions and belief teaches me to feel as safe in the battlefield as in my bed God has fixed the time of my death I do not concern myself about that but to be always ready after a pause he added and looked at the questioner in the face that is the way that all men should live and then all would be equally Brave I wanted to share that this morning in a very confused world for those that don't know in the outer outer world or maybe in other countries that are listening to this Stonewall Jackson is buried pretty close here and most likely on Resurrection morning he's coming up out of the grave and I I want to make it there's a lot of places that he's not welcome but he's welcome here our nation has tore down his statues and moved them all away I tried to buy one but anyway they've moved them all away and and they don't want anything to do with our ancestors or George Washington but I want to let it be Proclamation today I don't I'm never going to be politically correct but when they raise on Resurrection morning and they need to go to church [Applause] America you may not want them but we do [Applause] Hallelujah well if I've got your political air up all right good I'm going to preach to you amen let's stand to our feet this morning some glad morning when this life is or I'm Gonna Fly Away amen well some glad morning when this life is over real life Gonna Fly Away oh too I'm not Celestial show will I gonna flowers [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah I put a smile on your face I want you to bump one another and say we're going to have church this morning happy anniversary brother Danny sister shine amen how many years sister Sean 29. all right that's awesome hallelujah amen God bless you we love you with all of our hearts Mark chapter 4 and verse 35. Hallelujah Mark chapter 4 verse 35 I want to speak to you this morning on the victory Within brother Branham preaches about 15 sermons on this and so Mark chapter 4 and verse 35. and the same day when the evening was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into this ship and that it was now full and it was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him in saith unto him master cast not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he saith unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of a man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him quite a text didn't it let's just pray Lord Jesus we love you this morning Lord even now we feel your presence I'm so thankful to be here I ask you that you would anoint us speak to our hearts what a wonderful service was here last night brother Andrew as he delivered the word he could just feel the presence of God Lord we just ask you now that you touch our hearts many needs Lord brother Donnie Nicholson that's that's in a struggle now we pray that you touch him sister Erica Reagan we pray that you would touch her Lord God you're in our ship and we're thankful that you're there now we ask you to touch Our Lives every one of us here have needs minister to us now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you can be seated First Peter chapter 3 and verse 12. the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and the ears are open to their prayers that's a powerful scripture it reminds us that no matter how many billion people there on the Earth your prayer is important can we get a hundred percent amens in Psalms chapter 68 and verse 1. let God arise and let his enemies be scattered and let them that hate him flee before him can we read that together let God arise and let his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flee before him Allelujah perseverance brother Branham says he said this poor little woman she had never seen him but she had heard of him she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any hindrances because Faith don't have hindrances at all you could have a lot of hindrances you may have doctor's words the scientific man who who has examined you it might be that that he evidently the enemy don't want me to preach this you may have a lot of hindrances and you may have the doctor's words the scientific man who has examined you it might be that he that man told you that you're going to die that's all he knows that's what he has studied his scientific work shows that you must die your whole system is made up of a a kind of way that death death has to strike you and there is nothing can keep you keep from going on you're going now that's as much as he knows no science has a medicine for it but you have found something you pick up a sword and now of course you've got a hindrance and you got something that's that's going to duel against you that devil that disease that affliction but when you strike the tip of the sword with the that devil Yonder it's thus saith the Lord and he's revealed it to me I am healed you see your faith don't have any hindrances he says in thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemy the the greatest experiences that I've ever had is to come against something that I couldn't get over it or under it and just stand there and watch God make a way through it can I can I read that again for you one of the greatest experiences I've had is to come up against something that I couldn't get over or under and just stand there and watch God make a way through it that's the way to do it just move keep moving press your nose against it just keep moving just keep going on God Will Make A Way Hallelujah aren't you glad of that this morning no matter what your situation is God Will Make A Way it may look dire but God Will Make A Way he says this he said but you would you you bump into something you got a sense of a Feeling but not sight you can't see it and all at once something somebody have opened their eyes and seen a complete different world they never had seen anything and if he and if then you would say well now that should feel real warmed on you that is the Sun what is the sun it's light and what it's like he he never lived maybe you see you you never lived in that state he doesn't know anything about it that you bump up against there's a certain certain thing brother Brahm is talking about living in two different worlds and and the supernatural World being with us and he said well well what's that he he never lived in that dimension it would be a strange thing to him to know it and he says and I just want to just say this and put this right here so many times you want to tell somebody else Supernatural event and they've never had a supernatural event in their life so it's difficult for them to believe or to understand or to step into it can you imagine a prophet I just shared a story with you about Amos and Mary Betty seeing a vision sharing it with their son then the event happens now we're standing here talking about it that actually happened we actually lived that that that phase out brother Branham no doubt stood in the Pulpit night after night after night and would tell Supernatural events to people with a carnal nature let me explain to you as carnal Believers carnal Believers are people that don't have the Holy Ghost and so what they will do is they'll come to church and so what will happen is they it'll be too hot it'll be too cold somebody's sitting in their seat preacher preaches too long why did she wear that why are they here why is that they don't get anything out of church one man's good in the Revival another man's yeah one man's getting in Rapture condition one man's getting ready for a tribulation one man says that's thus saith the Lord that's God's Prophet another man says he's a heretic brother Jeremy's got a couple of pictures I want to share with you I'm not going to tell you a whole lot about him we'll share I want to do that in a couple of weeks but there's a before picture if you can just this is what 99 of us see brother random is preaching we wasn't there but there was a picture taken and brother Adam's preaching and he's and he's talking about the presence of the Lord and and so the man the man is listening as he's preaching and then well the Graham said he's here 's the next picture and I want you to flip backwards and forwards for a moment couple sentences different maybe a minute or two different in the in the pictures being taken how many's ever saw the pillar of fire in this building yeah cloud maybe even the angel of the Lord so brother Branham is standing there is the angel in the upper left corner there's Christ there's the Brazen altar there's the licks of fire there's the spirits of God flowing down same service same service that's God's prophet God's Prophet is standing he's preaching the word of God listen it doesn't matter verse 52 000 critics are you with me it don't matter and there's there's a service going on and the lilies are grown in a in a supernatural way the pillar of fire is just in front there's a line of the tribe of Judah we'll we'll speak more on that in a couple of weeks because I really want you to get what's going on here I really want you to get what's getting on here because I'm preaching to two people one's going into tribulation period and you need to hear what I got to say one's going into rapture going in a Rapture you need to expect you need to expect you need to expect the supernatural because it's going to be more than in this church it's going to be in your home maybe you're drinking a little coffee and all of a sudden you feel a sweet come over you your hair is different you don't need your glasses no more somebody walks to your house that you haven't seen in decades let them in [Applause] [Music] now that's the phase that we're coming to why are we having such Supernatural Services it didn't just happen in here it is not just happening here it's happening around the world and what God is doing it's turn the corner these are the kind of services that brother Homer and I would talk about it's going to come it's going to come it's going to come and brother Homer said it's going to come it's going to come and it's here [Applause] it's here don't take these things for granted well now if God lets us live we are bodily here in five senses but there is another sense and then we wake up into that sense and that is the sense of vision and we see that thing that what it is that makes us feel these things that we do and try to tell somebody about it just be like telling a man that never did see in his life well he wouldn't understand because it's not acquainted with that sense that's the way it is in the gospel they don't understand it and it's hard for them to see it because they've never lived in there I know you work with people that don't live in this atmosphere they don't understand it it's hard for them to see it because they've never lived there they they know nothing about it they feel it they can have a reaction to it but to actually know what it is don't so when you see beyond that curtain where that comes from and then try to come back and tell people that's only felt it with a sense of feeling like and never been able to see it it's hard to tell a man but you just have to do the best that you can until we see face to face now we see Jesus here he's in this boat he's tired and weary and I can just imagine knowing there's a big job at the next day going to gonorrhea where there was one soul that was calling out to for God can you imagine Jesus being so weary and so tired he's been in the meeting and he's preached all day long and thousands of people have been there they've come to see Jesus they've come to see Miracles they've come to see this that everybody's talking about why the priest that preaches is just Dad and he he's quoting in in another language they really don't understand and you know and it's just a historical God but this Jesus may not be able to fit him all in your little box but this Jesus is preaching something that's so different his atmosphere is so changed it's it's like no other man that there's ever been have you heard the Miracles have you seen the things taking place and it would be shared from house to house and an expectation would be you know wherever Jesus is always good things happen and Jesus has talked about the sower that day oh I don't like to been there when he's just expounding the scriptures mustard seed why it's given unto you the most know the mysteries of God blessed are your eyes for you see blessed are for your ears that you hear no doubt even while he's preaching peoples being healed their their bodies are just literally being changed and touched and healed while they're there Jesus is now getting weary it's evening time and he's come to a spot to wear that now that he's got to slip away everybody wants to have an audience with him or maybe shake his hand but those disciples know their responsibility is to to get him into a boat now they got to take care of him because everybody wants to touch him because they've heard about the woman that touched the Hem of His Garment everybody wants to touch him and everybody wants him to look in their eyes and and you know they would be changed everybody wants to get near him but they don't understand that that one that could drive back the Demons of hell and could shake your hand and leprosy would leave you or maybe to Touch the Hem of the Garment you'd be well after all those years he would get tired because it didn't come as God he came as man and his man he would be weary as a man he would get tired as a man he would get angry he was a man oh there would be glimpses that you would see that very much deity but you see him get tired you'd see him Sat on a well and and even send you away to where you'd go get meat and groceries and you knew he had purpose sending you away because he's going to a town that we didn't think Jesus would go to mixed race Heathen religion town why is there any is there even a believer down there why would this great Messiah even go there and he would go to where that was a well and he wouldn't go in the morning or he wouldn't go in the evening but he went in the middle of the day and he said on that well and he was waiting on one predestinated seat and she all got religious on him Ray she got religious she got religious on him when he began to tell her about the Messiah coming why are you here why are you here in the middle of the day she immediately got defensive and then he he told her go get your husband well I have none did he miss it oh no he said you said right but you've had five and the one that you're living with he's not your husband in a moment she began to realize Now understand this quite an incredible thing while in all those other cities he never told them that he was a messiah he never told him he never revealed himself that I'm the Messiah but the first one on Earth that he revealed that I'm the Messiah was a woman that wasn't welcome in any church think about that you say my brother Ron I have such a stained past he come looking for you if you'll just stop and give him a drink he'll give you a drink of the Living Water that you'll never thirst again those disciples no doubt watched him as he steps off into the boat and they can see his unsteadiness as he steps he's wore out he's sweaty he's so tired he can't hardly put one foot in front of the other and they make a pillow for him and get him a place to lay down let me just say if I was one of those disciples I'd have been patting that pillow I'd have made sure that he'd have the best place in the world to lay down I'd have made sure that he had the best blanket available to wrap him up in and I'd have stood guard over top of him while he sleeped that's my respect for the Lord Jesus that's also my respect for other preachers you want to be successful in life is have respect respect for your teachers respect for the authorities respect for men of God show your children how to have respect for men of God don't you never talk down to about your pastor or your preachers because it's those preachers that's got to fight for your children one of these days and if you got the right kind of preacher he'll never give up on you maybe a lot of other people will give up on you but a right kind of man of God well you can go to the ends of the Earth but a real man of God will never judge you he will never try to throw a stone at you he'll be there standing he'll be there standing welcome home welcome home foreign he falls asleep quickly now they're familiar with their job because they were fishermen they grabbed those oars they've been following him now for a while but it feels comfortable to have a whole to those oars and they just start pedaling brother Brandon said it was like a popcorn meeting one after another begin to stand up and talk about it he's asleep but what brought me here what made him Messiah to you what made him real oh my my father told me that we would see the Messiah and the first time I saw him he he called me my name he didn't know me but he called me by name and I recognized to him I I was there when the woman at the well got it I'll tell you what did it for me you remember the other day when he fed those fishing loaves and we were all tore up with the crowd size we couldn't go into town to get enough vigils to take care of him why we didn't have enough money to to give to even go and buy it and the town that was nine miles away it was you know all those people are here at the meeting and if we raided every town every every house there wouldn't be enough food food to feed all these people and it was just something about it when he began to break that five blows in this fish and when he began to break them I watched it David when he broke the bread and he pulled it off and Brad wreath refilled I watched it I've given great thought to it the creator of Heaven as he broke the bread he didn't have to go get meal he didn't have to go get all he didn't have to have baking ovens he just blessed it and when it blessed it multiplied and then when the fish was there and he tore a little meat off and it just replenished itself if you'll remember that that fish was cooked the creator of Heaven could have only done that that creator he didn't have to send us out as parties to to have fish he didn't have to have it going by but he just spoke it it reminds me of when he was at a wedding and they didn't have enough wine and it was just water there in those barrels and and everybody was embarrassed because all the city was there at that great wedding very fitting it would be his first miracle and they would ask him to pray and when he prayed he didn't have to have a great Vineyard he didn't have to have great great Grinders to grind the grates down and time to ferment it he just he just blessed it it kind of reminds me of the scriptures of when he said let there be a son and let there be Stars and let there be moons brother Branham said that white light began to whirl and he said he spoke from that great white light and he spoke and said let there be a son and he said God believed his own word and the son came into existence and when he began to place the planets and the Stars he said he would call for a like a clinker to fall off of the Sun and he would watch it fall for maybe million million light years and he'll watch it fall and then he would stop it in just the right place because God was writing his first Bible into heavens and he would speak it it wasn't a big boom Theory it takes some real Faith to believe that wouldn't it oh brother Ron haven't you heard that Big Bang Theory yeah you take some faith I have to say it takes some real Faith to believe that for if the moon would get just a few inches out of cater just a few inches out of cater it would flood Florida and Hawaii but that Moon hangs there in its right spot just like all the stars of the heaven they hang in the right spot every one of them have a meaning if you remember Abraham was told that you're going to have a son brother Wayne said it lasts a couple last week he said he said God told him when it was not so of how it was going to be and he told him that you're the father of Nations and if you remember God did two things to him he told him about the sand can you count it that'd be an impossibility he said that's your natural seed but then he took him to the heavens and said look up can you count on Abraham you're talking about a con conversation with god and a man can you count on Abraham no it's possible count all this you know here here so much cloud and so much pollution you really can't see the stars quite well but you go you go out west to where the or maybe up north like to Brother Kelly's area and you go out and there's it's just crystal clear why it looks like millions of stars you can see the Milky Way you know one day when in heaven I'd like to I'd like to have a day with the Lord and I'd like for him to take me and just show me how he made it Ron would you like to would you like me to take you show me how you made it yes sir Lord I I'd like I'd like for you to just I'd say we won't be alone I believe we serve that kind of a god brother Ron do you believe that's going to kind of be how it is let me just say this to you God don't just talk about what you're doing here I believe that these feet that I have will walk on streets of gold I believe these hands will one day rub dates of pearl I believe that one day I'll live in a city 1500 miles high and it's so divinely architect until all you'll feel like you're standing on level ground God don't just see us here he sees us there these guys begin to talk about what they've seen what they felt no wonder people want to come to our meetings no wonder people want to come and see Jesus operate I've seen him do so many things do you see the other day when he touched that leopard did you see the other day when that woman screamed unclean did you see the other day when all of those events took place I was standing real close we was at the pool the other day and all of those sick people that was trying to get in the pool and he went to one man do you see the reaction of those Pharisees and Jesus just ignored them I'd like to stand and say you know I like how he does he's just so great yet he's so simple he's just so great he could have went to King's palaces but he came to my house to eat you know but Satan won't leave you in a good meeting he won't leave you having great testimony service he'll remind you of what's got to go on Monday he'll remind you the troubles that you got at home no longer matter how long you've been a believer he'll he'll remind you of the little things that you're wrestling with in your Humanity then as you begin to get older and your hair begins to turn gray used to be you talked about all the kind of work that you did and what your hobbies was and how your children were growing up and how great your children was and and you talked about the services after a while you said at a table same friends and you talk about what the doctor said and what kind of medicine that you're taking and a new herb that's on the scene and your bones are aching and your hips are aching in your I'm gonna have to get a new set of glasses I Have I Told You Lately That I got a tooth that's bothering me and before long you know that's your atmosphere so Satan don't leave you alone just because you've been a Christian for 65 years don't mean that he leaves you alone it was a storm came mountains were so that to where that storms would drop in on that on that sea to where that it would be it would just happen so quickly now these were well-trained men they knew how to turn that boat in a certain way to to get it right into the wave now sometimes waves on that sea would get 25 to 50 feet tall that's pretty intimidating you know when you're in a boat you're either on the top of the wave or you're at the bottom of the wave Now understand it's it's real intimidating to look at this this ceiling is 25 feet tall I know it's 25 feet tall it takes a tall ladder to get to the peak of that roof brother Alden it's really tall ladder to get there you guys Brother Ray you guys have worked up there it's tall way I have to be honest with you I don't like water if it's this high but when a seeds that big it's kind of like Satan's stocking the odds against you you know a lot of people are so great because they tell you that a lot of people are so big all they need somebody to take a PIN to them let a little air out foreign Harold Hildebrandt would say you know how we know he's great he told us he was I cannot imagine those waves being so high it seemed like the devil was in those waves not just natural ways but it seemed like that Satan had swore he's weak and he's tired and I've had enough with him now let me just say sometimes our storms are worse or maybe worse in our mind than they are in reality can I can I just give you a glimpse here those ways were so high and so rough but Jesus was still asleep so the water hadn't got to him or he would have been awake are you with me now so the waves to Peter and those guys was much worse than in reality are you with me now like and they they were so scared and so afraid and I'd have been right with them every one of you that are so brave sitting on these dry pews they just put you in that little bottle stopper of a ship and let Satan be swearing I'm going to destroy you I know where I'm talking about right now and he's breathing down and he's he's saying I'm going to destroy you this night this is the last night that I'm going but remember Jesus said let us go to the other side if you can just pay attention to his words [Applause] if you can just pay attention to his words we're gonna make it we're gonna make it I know there's a storm coming I'm going to sleep through it I need the rest we're going to get through the storm we're gonna make it to the other side [Applause] you out of bounds brother Ron if you trust me I'll use you like never before had he never said that to me I'd be a bag of nerves sitting here today but he spoke it to me [Applause] will run by the minute task God's counted you worthy to go through it don't fail to get it God has counted you Worthy to go through the test brother Brown says this he said when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found favor you have found favor with God I want that to sink in and God believes you'll stand the test notice brother Branham didn't say if you believe you'll stand the test there's a major difference here brother Doug there's a major difference here when When God says I believe that what I put in you will get you through your test it's not what you believe about it why are you saying that brother Ron because there'll be a lot of days on your Monday morning blues there's going to be things come out of your stinking mouth that's got to be careful what you confess because you can drive your faith Away by your doubt and by your negative words help me preach help me preach but if you can get the word coming out of your mouth with a positive confession I'm going to have a son I'm going to be the father of many nations Sarah you're going to have a son it's going to come through you are you with me now they finally come to a point to where they had forgot Jesus was in the boat listen there's a lot of times where we get into a problem when we forget who's with us Mary and Joseph forgot they've forgotten left Jesus brother Brown said that's what's happened to the church World they went off without Jesus that's why they have to have politics that's why they have to have all different kind of programs they went off without Jesus I'm glad God sent us a message that is Jesus finally they realize Jesus is in the boat and they and they went to him and said notice these words Karis not that we perish listen there's never a time that Jesus don't care for you there's never been a time that Jesus don't care then why would those words come out of their mouth an enemy an enemy well brother Ron I I was I'm not one of those disciples okay okay I'm gonna bring it to you brother Ron don't care the preachers they don't care well they haven't shook my hand in Forever he ain't told me listen you can't say this he ain't told me that he loved me listen I tell sister Connie I love her more than I've ever loved it before I tell her that multiple times a day for you that's having marriage trouble I'm gonna give you some tips here I tell her multiple times a day I love you more than I've ever loved you before I tell her how beautiful that she is whether she's in cars whether she's in a nice dress or she's in a robe I tell her how beautiful she is why you do that brother Ron I'm gonna make it hard on the next man [Applause] cares not that we perish we're going to die here 's not that we perish this trial is too great we're not going to live through it Jesus got up and he walked to the bow of the boat he didn't have a prayer meeting he looked at the storm and he said Peace be still peace of all of these sermons he just uses this this word peace because in that storm the devil was in your storm the devil is I don't care what your storm is this morning the devil stirs up circumstances around you he'll catch you off guard he'll make mountains out of mole Hills he'll make it look like you're at the end of your rope are you with me now you go to the doctor and he says it could be cancer and that's all you catch that's all you catch that c word it could be cancer and before long you realize you had just had an infection but you worried for you know dread is sometimes worse than the disease it could be it could be it could be then all of a sudden they tell you it is and it feels like somebody kicks you in your stomach and rips your heart out you've got brain tumors you're going to live about four four months Hey listen it's real when you there you've heard a lot of stories but now you're there cast not that we perish run peace peace I got your future here I got your future if you can look Joel I got your future just relax here I got you never been a day I wasn't out of your boat I'm here with you I'm here with you I'm not going to leave you I'm never going to leave you it's going to look like I'm leaving but I'm never going to leave you I'll go with you and your job I'll go you with you to school I'll go with you in your situations I'm with you don't forget Marcus I'm with you don't forget brother Ron but I've had a bump that's hurt my feelings I I've had a bump I've got bitter in my spirit about it I'm at a spot to work I just feel so contaminated wash wash wash bitterness creeps into you forgive but they did wrong forgive forget what's it going to mean in a hundred years anyway forgive you if I don't mow my grass today I don't know what's going to happen brother Ron quit preaching so I can go mow my grass who's going to mow it in a few years [Music] who's gonna paint your house who's gonna take care of it when we're gone I could care less who's gonna feed my dog don't worry about your dog [Music] somebody told me one time said if you'd quit preaching so long I wouldn't have to have my dog in the kennel if you love your dog more than God you need to get rid of that dog [Applause] I'm sorry I haven't got off of page two here yet I got a letter this week at the end of the letter they said they wanted to write my life story I don't know these people I don't know how you write somebody else's life story but you don't even know I told the boys I said you know I don't want nobody writing a life story we only halfway through you can't put the last chapter in the middle of the book I'm impressed somebody wants to write it it must be something that somebody enjoys but hey I ain't done you know Jesus didn't turn it around and tell those disciples you're full of the devil that's the reason you don't have no faith you know it's in those moments that you think God's going to whip me he tells us we need more faith but it reminds us that the victory is in you now he reminds us that we've got all the equipment we need to speak to the storm you didn't have to wake me up you could have did this job I preaching to you yeah I gotta I gotta call the preacher and get him to pray immediately wait a minute just before you call the preacher I don't mind you calling me I don't mind you texting me I'm talking to you guys here now I don't mind you calling me I don't mind you texting me I got a call this week and this guy's talking to me and he said well brother Ron he said only thing I know is it's probably sin in your life while that cancer hasn't left yeah I blocked his number but you know you know if Peter would have only realized Jesus told us was going to get to the other side he told us he's got a plan we're going to Galleria I don't know what's going to go on but there's Legion there and he's going to get well and there's people that are going to be touched as he leaves the tombs whole political system is going to get upside down and all the priests are going to get mad and there's a hog farmer that's going to lose all of his picks Haven don't you get mad now don't get mad because Jesus cast those Devils into pigs there's good pigs a little Haven back there two two three she's three she's three she loves pigs just remind her in Charlotte's Web there's a good pig and one night I'll preach on washing a pig I'll preach on washing a pig she's waving at me now but always remember if you don't get a lamb nature on your pig you go right back to the slop now you say well brother Ron the victory was within he could have spoke to the storm you remember the same guy that's scared of the storm in only just a short time is going to go by the a man that is lame all of his life and I want you to just notice he don't take him to church he don't take him to a hospital but he said such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk the victory was Within sometimes your storms reveal the true Victory that's on the inside of you so God has to send the storm to push that character out of you Hallelujah because God knows it's in there never stop believing never turn around and run never be a coward strong and see the salvation of the lord we are winners we are winners we are winners I may be getting wet from the storm but I'm a winner because I got Jesus in my boat he's in my boat don't you worry all I got to do is call Jesus on the scene you can tell Daniel that Jesus is in his boat is in his boat brother Donnie Nicholson he's in your boat may seem tough but he's in your boat Erica Reagan he's in your boat he's in your boat you know the doctors may be telling her some really difficult things that's for the family to tell but let me just say he's in her boat and if if you forget that God don't still do with Iran will be preaching next Sunday morning because Jesus is in the boat won't you tell your children right there where you're standing you got small children once you tell them don't worry honey Jesus is in my boat amen Katie you'll have one here for long and we'll see you going in and out in now it'd be a great thing [Music] it's going to be times when that baby's got a fever a baby's sick and you'll pray you may not call me but you'll pray and you'll remember what it was like for your mother to pray for you when you was a sick baby your mother trusted God now it's your turn your turn to trust the Lord aren't you glad that he's that kind of a personal God to you [Music] feels like only a few days ago that sister Nancy was being chased around to church I was a guy that wanted to kiss her [Music] looks back a long time ago now but in the span of life life is short now Sister Nancy sees a lot of people in this church she never knew she was going to be a preacher's wife she never knew that her husband's going to be a pastor we celebrate 50 years this year many of you don't know those Original Stories but you see Jesus has been in our boat a long time [Music] we've had some real storms there's been some rocky times there's been some times where I stayed up all night and prayed on my knees feeling so alone some of your needs took me to my knees and I stayed there and prayed a long time [Music] but I want to remind you no matter your story he's with us maybe you'll be having a testimony service about maybe a couple Services ago when you saw the pillar of Fire some of you saw the angel brother Steve Thomas's funeral when all those flowers opened up in the presence of the Lord the people saw the pillar of fire in this building even unbelievers saw those flowers just opened in the presence of the Lord that happened at sister Karen Pruitt's funeral sometimes when you think he's a Million Miles Away [Music] he's actually right there with you he's right there with you while you're staring in the storm let us be reminded today that the victory that you need has already been planted right inside of here because brother Branham said everything that you need for life's journey he put in that seed inside of you let's just sing that today aren't you glad that he knows exactly what you need and brother Chris I got a prayer cloth I want to give to you and pray with you over Jesus knows [Music] I need oh yes [Music] oh my everything my God supplies [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music] or storms raging High the waters around them they were troubled that night
