you'd like to lift up to the Lord this evening we know our God can just meet each and every one of these don't we my last brother Gabriel Spencer if he would just come lead us to the throne of grace [Music] before we go to prayer I just want to give a testimony a testimony that I know that God lives and I know that God speaks through his servants and something that happened this week is a prayer that that I've been praying since I got saved and God changed my life brother Shane and this will be big for you because when you told your testimony back on December 19 2021 something struck in my life to text Brother Andrew and come up here and say a testimony before he preached and the only reason I know the date is because my sister-in-law was actually watching that day which I would not I was not expecting but that she testified this week that here in hearing God speak through brother Ron and say that they would be there is what caused her to start living a different life and I won't tell their testimony because I believe one day they'll tell it but I got a phone call Sunday night that my brother wanted to be baptized and so as he as he would speak with my dad about that he would go home and tell his wife that he wanted to be baptized she said that that's what she had been praying about and she wanted to be baptized together and he didn't know anything about that so we were able to baptize them at my dad's church this week on Thursday and as well as as well as a sister there that Charity she was able to be a witness to there and there in her life and there was a complete change in her life and she was baptized there as well and I just happen to believe that it doesn't matter where you're at or or where you're going to in your life or where your parents or Sons and Daughters may be at God has a way and he will make a change let's just take these needs to the Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just believe that you will come down in a mighty way tonight I believe that this is a this has been a week that you have forwardedained before before the foundation of the world and their sons and daughters coming back home there's there's parents to us here on Earth that will be coming home and and be taking on the blood of Jesus Christ over top of their life and and Lord Jesus I just happen to believe that that there are sons and daughters in seed that that you've placed and and they're they will become awakened and they will be placed in an atmosphere and they will begin to hunger and groan for more of you just as just as the Earth is groaning for a change I'm believing that you will come and you'll you will sweep across our life and they will believe they will see that there there's something more that they need in their life they need they need the baptism of the Holy Ghost in order to make it through what uh what is about to happen and when they get that baptism of the Holy Ghost this tribulation that is that is so amongst us and is right at our doorstep they will be able to miss that because they will be going in the Rapture and receive the token of Life Lord and we see all the all the prayer requests that have been brought forth and we believe that you were the same yesterday today and forever and as you would walk on earth and you would be here using and speaking through the bride today that you can come and you can heal every prayer request that's been brought no matter what the name of the demon that it is that that is fighting your people you can come and you can wipe every every sin clear you can wipe every disease clear and cast every demon back to hell where it came from doctors can give it a name in cancer doctors can give it a name in different depressions or anxieties but Lord Jesus you can come by in a fresh wind tonight a fresh wind that will that will speak the Holy Ghost across and give peace to every situation and Circumstance that we face and Lord Jesus we have we have mighty men that stand here Mighty Men of Valor that you've put as servants and Generals before us but Lord Jesus I ask that you were just anoint brother Kelly anoint him that that sermon that you have placed inside of his life that he will come and he will speak it like he's never spoken before and you'll be able to use him use him tonight and I believe that not only will Souls be returned but there will be healing and there will be cancer cast out of this place cast out of every soul that it tries to turn torment Lord and I just ask that you would just come and be with us anoint this service allow this not to be a gathering of people but allow this be a gathering of seed in a gathering where you come and anoint the service and we just thank you for what you are doing and what you are about to do in

this evening he's been with us in a lot of Trials a lot of a lot of things that's went on in life and and then he's been here for great services and but this evening we have brother Tim Pruitt here and he's a guest this evening he's a little bit on vacation I guess you could say it but I'm going to invite him to come and just greet you all this evening won't you come to the tent amen it's a joy to be here thank you so I appreciate you all amen my sister great to see each smiling face here to tonight I guess you think I'm going to preach so you're sitting down um but anyway we're we're here

Kelly be ministering tonight and I know that's a treat for us all and I'm just expecting to be recharged and refreshed in the presence of the Lord amen and then so yeah I think my son arranged this and sent me away for a weekend I don't know what's happening at home but um you know it's just good to be here and have this time together and it kind of reminiscent of um something that took place about three years ago and we're here in this meeting to celebrate those three years of victory that we've had amen I came in February like I said three years ago brother Ron had been just given days to live and I flew out here with my wife and met brother Donnie's sister Carol here and we had prayer with brother Ron and spirit of fear left him and um you know peace came over his life and we as I the last morning that I was there I woke up in the early morning before I flew out and heard the voice that was coming from another dimension singing that was coming forth that said we shall see Miracles we shall see Giants fall and we have seen Giants fall and we've seen miracles amen I preached that weekend while we were here it was a surprise visit and they graciously asked me to minister but I preached on who hath believed our report and I'll tell you I still believe that report amen I I still know the arm of the Lord his power is being revealed to his people and I'm looking for him to reveal his power even in this meeting this weekend this time that I'll have together amen with our brothers God bless you it's so great to be with you we love you in the Lord Hallelujah amen amen it's an honor to have honor to have our friends here with us this weekend so this this weekend is is a very special weekend to us and to have brother Kelly and brother Tim here together and and to just take in these things I think it's a wonderful thing to have generals to be able to come in and rally around a victory and it's one thing for soldiers to come in and they're they're battling but when generals Gather in it's a real sign of Victory is in the camp and I tell you what a wonderful privilege it is to be serving our Lord Jesus Christ in this in this age where we know that we're we're looked upon as as defeated by the enemy but we're The Undefeated and to be standing right now to know that our living God is right here right now and it's it's just a wonderful thing we thank you for praying for us in the weekend last weekend there in Oklahoma and the meetings there the Lord certainly moved in a very special way and it's a wonderful thing to watch as young people enjoy the outpouring of the whole Holy Ghost and we're just certainly privileged to be a part of the move of the this last day and and what uh what an honor it is and maybe we'll just change the order of the

pray father as we would approach this service today Lord that your grace Lord would overshadow it and father that you would use your servant Lord to minister your word Lord to your people father we're

would be listening to it we commit now ourselves unto you Jesus Christ preciously we pray amen and God bless you you may have your seats tonight just for a moment of time good evening it's good to be back in Virginia it's good to see each and every one of you that are here tonight and look across the audience and I see people that I've not seen before and a lot of old friends that are here today it's just a blessing to be here in the Shenandoah Valley amongst the saints of God here that love the Lord with all their heart and and that continued to serve him with all that's within them we appreciate the invitation of brother Ron Spencer to be here today and and we thank him for it and it's a kind of a little bit of a jubilee time I have brother Ron and brother Tim here with him as well certainly do appreciate both these men of God and they've been such an inspiration in our lives and in our church and our families lives that we we just thank God for a man of God like this and brother Andrew and it's been in our assembly ministering been a great blessing to our people and we really thank the Lord for it we are blessed in this hour to to have people of God in our lives I would give us strength and and encourage Us in the word of God and we thank the Lord for that and we certainly do have a deep appreciation for them and the only problem I have when I come to Virginia is I have to go on a diet a few weeks before I get here because I know for sure that something's going to happen and there's always not a good thing I always tell sister Mara sometimes I said maybe we need to drink two sizes of pants along that way once we get here with and ones we go home with they certainly do take good care of us and we certainly do appreciate their Hospitality they're wonderful people great friends great friends Brother Paul's sister roshani I don't know if I see them where they're sitting oh they're sitting right straight in the back diosi mendiga it's good to see you it's going to have been when I was in in Brazil it was such a blessing to see them in shopico and and got to know them really well there and it's just so nice to see you again and sister Mars looking forward to meeting you all as well amen lord is good sometimes I wonder my neighbors asked me many times where are you going and they said we're going here or there and they said do you know these people I said I might not know them but only take about five minutes and and we'll get to know them they have the same spirit in them that we have in our heart and they said aren't you afraid of it no I said I'm not afraid of them at all I said there's one thing I'm not afraid of I said they're they're wonderful people of the Lord amen aren't you thankful for that because of this message we know so many people around the world and we thank the Lord for it I I think sometimes what it will be like when we get on the other side and and we'll be changed and we'll start shaking hounds with those and say did you remember me here or did you remember me there and and it's just going to be such a glorious glorious time to to meet at that time they're on the table that's been spread for us amen if you have your Bibles this more this evening holler I'd like to turn to Psalms 44 verses 1 to 3 if we would stand tonight and there's three scripture readings I'd like to read if I may Romans 8 11 and First Corinthians 2 4 and 5. First Corinthians 2 4 and 5. are you happy it's good to be here we have heard with our ears oh God our fathers have told us what work thou didst in their day in the times of old how thou did us drive out the Heathen with thy hand and plant and plant as them how thy how thou did US afflict the people and cast them out for they got not the land in possession by their own sword we don't have our own word but we have the word of the Lord neither did their own arms save them we're no match for our enemy but our God is more than able but did their arms save them but thy right hand in thine arm and the light of thy continence because thou hadest a favor upon them is no wonder to be favored of the Lord Romans 8 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raise up Christ from the dead shall also quickened let's say Quicken tonight say it one more time Quicken Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and then over in First Corinthians 2. verses four and five and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that's your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God Amen God bless you you may have your seats this evening holler for a text tonight I'd like to excuse me look at just a little thought for a few moments of time the church is rising up the church is rising up we are all privileged to be able to live in one of the grandest times that a church people could ever live in that is at the ending of of the Gentile dispensation we're in a time when the weed can recognize very quickly around us through the news and through very different mediums that the coming of the Lord is nigh at hand we also realize that that we're in a season of time where our bodies will be changed from mortality to immortality we're thankful that God has given us a message that has been Vindicated in this last hour a message with the Church of the Living God has has a word of restoration and we have received that message into our lives that message has changed our lives that message has given us a faith in our lives that is unlike any other faith that people could have in any generation amen it's in the hour that we live in today that the Loose Ends that brother Brown who talked about that were left off by Luther and Wesley and even the outporting of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost in 1906 that's coming this hour to bring those to bring those loose ends back into a continuity of the word of God that our faith will not rest in the faith of a man but that our faith would rest in almighty God it is God is the one who is doing the work it's not it's not brother Tim or brother Ron or myself or brother Andrew or whoever the minister may be but it's a God and in his season of time that God will do certain things in order that our faith would actually rise in that hour for what is before the Church of the Living God and I say blessed be the name of the Lord I I look at it the wheels of God made may turn slowly but they turn true and they're on time all the time there is nothing out of kilter with God sometimes we look at it we may think well this seems like the coming of the Lord is a long ways off but and and maybe from many years ago when I grew up in the message it looked like the Lord would come any day but I want to say that he is coming and he's still coming and it could be today could be for any one of us but we know the Lord is coming we're looking for I'm looking for the change in my body I I don't know about you all but that's the only message I really have is a body change and I'm looking for that time when that would transpire and I say Lord increase my faith in the hour that we're living in in order to be able to stand on the hour and have my body change in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen I don't want to be left behind in this old world Amen I've got I've got on my running shoes so to speak I'm ready to move on Amen I'm no longer we are no longer Earthbound creatures we are creatures that are Heavenly bound creatures therefore in all of us situations of life no matter the difficulties in life in fact brother Branham says that God will actually allow tensions in our life and it brings certain things out of our life for purposes I believe it's that our faith will not rest in this world but our faith would rest in the word of God Amen if your faith is resting in this world it's going to be a real terrible place to live in I say tonight put your faith in Jesus Christ he's the only one that matters he's the one that that is going to see you through Amen in all the years that I've served the Lord I can say with the with all my heart that God has never disappointed me God has never dis I've disappointed him but he's never disappointed me he's always been on time in every crisis of life amen the bride is supposed to be and I believe the bride is moving under the unction of the holy spirit in this end time hour brother Branham says that if the bride will uh says it's in the hour and the Bride of Jesus Christ comes into full reality it's my words here who she is and that she will be an invincible Army I believe that we are an invinced visible Army amen I believe we are now I don't believe it's something afar off but I believe it's today we are an invincible Army and will continue to be Invincible Army because we are to stand against the powers of Hell in this hour and they're there in this hour and they're there to try to destroy us but I say greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world Amen and God has given us great power and authority in this hour but it's up to us up to us to put it into position and into play and I believe that we are doing that amen that she will be an invincible arm and be able to spiritual naturally discern the two Spirits which were which are within the framework of the Christian church amen and there is two Spirits in it and the spirit of the enemy comes in such a Sly way brother Brown said I read a quote Wednesday night back home where where the whole where the enemy will come in real slightly it seems like it's just barely moving in but he comes in to try to move us off the mark But if we're fortified let's say I'm fortified tonight if we're fortified in Jesus Christ we will never be moved off the Mark we're going to stand faithful to the things of God all the days of our life aim until the time of the catching away somebody say praise the Lord tonight amen the brightest should be moving under the unction of the Holy Spirit the word Invincible in the in the dictionary It ultimately means incapable of being conquered incapable of being conquered and capable of being overcome or incapable of being subdued amen and incapable is just simply it's impossible to be conquered therefore the bride will not be conquered if we would not have a prophecy in the word of God that says God was going to Jesus is going to have a bride and that bride is going to be us without spot and wrinkle and this second Eve will not fall like the first day fell amen if we do not have that promise we'd be in dire shape in this hour but I say tonight we do have a promise and that promise is this bride will not be defeat defeated in this hour she will not be deceived in this hour she's going to stand faithful to the word of God and there's nothing that will stand in her way because she is for a day to go through amen and I believe it with all that's within my heart amen God is not coming for our frivolous woman he's coming for a bride of Jesus Christ that will stand faithful to the word of God in this end time hour I believe we have some of those here tonight amen that are faithful to the cause of Christ it's not a time to play games it's a time to be exercised in the word of almighty God Amen we know when Satan came to tempt Jesus Jesus Jesus didn't use any Supernatural power at all to resist him to he just use the word of God he was the father's word to defeat him just the word of the father it is written it is written amen and when we become fortified we stand with the same thing it is written amen and that Spirit which was in Jesus Christ was poured out on the onto the church on the day of Pentecost and it has come upon the Same Spirit which is in every which is the same spirit and every born again son and daughter of God Amen when Jesus gave his life for us and that Spirit came back on the day of Pentecost that's the same spirit that is still here with us tonight amen I know sometimes back home people want to see the Church of God so subdued and and brought down so low and don't get too excited and and don't say praise God too louder or say hallelujah too loud amen but I want to say here tonight I resist those spirits in the name of the Lord I stand on the word of almighty God Amen and there's nobody's gonna take my joy from me amen God gave you the joy and it's him that gave you the joy amen I stand with that joy in my heart amen no preacher will take it from me amen I see it's time to shine it's time to lift ourselves up and fly and soar into the heavenlies Hallelujah it's time to move on amen I say let the critics be the critics and if they're streaming tonight I say let you be the critic amen it don't matter to me as long as I know where I am with God as long as you know where you are with God what does it matter what the critics have to say let them say what they want to say payment it's time to be Warriors in this hour it's time to be an invincible Army in this hour it's time to shun all those things what does it matter what they say in the Sardinian Church age brother Brown says yes the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same and the Seven Messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power no he says here and if the church is the true church let's say we're the true church say it one more time we're the true church it will have the same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost amen so I say what they have there we have it today he said by experience it will be a Pentecostal church and there will be tongues and interpretations and prophecies and healings God will be in the midst of her and God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has he says hallelujah we say hallelujah and she will be unorganized and then he says three words don't forget that so when they try to organize the the spirit of the Living God or the word of almighty God I say our God cannot be organized amen you cannot put God In A Box in this hour amen and say he can only move here I say our God can move whenever he wants to move it's a time for him to move it's the time for the church to rise in the glory of almighty God and the power of almighty God Amen we're not the church when brother Brown saw the preview of the Bride we're not the one that came up and went down where the bride that went on into glory and will continue to march on into glory in all the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord we have a sure word of Prophecy it's not just a half word it's a sure word it's something it's something that we hold in our heart it's something that's real in our lives something happened in our hearts something happened in our lives some people say explain it to me I can't explain it all I know is that something happened and when that happened in my life I've never been the same after that time amen something changed and my faith is not in us in a man but my faith is in the power and the word of almighty God that's where my faith my faith lies how sometimes they they're trying to shut down preachers they're trying to shut down a lot of things but I'll say they're never going to shut down the true five-fold Ministry you let the people can go and do what they want to do but the people of the that are the Bride of Jesus Christ will not be shut down by any organization by anything that would come against the power of the Church of the Living God it's in this hour that we stand faithful to the cause of Christ amen it's not time to back up it's time to go forward in the name of the Lord and the power of the Holy Spirit amen we should be expecting God to move in every service we should be expecting God to move in our houses we should expect God to move on the job and we're working on the job ain't it because some Dynamics has got a hold of our soul and has changed us in this hour Amen Let the Church of the Lord's redeem say so Hallelujah in the message which is a very familiar quote I know you all know these quotes that I'm reading but just let me let me share them with you and the rising of the Sun the first sheath came up from all the prophets which was the son of God he was the king of all the prophets there's been churches churches and Brides brides and churches and Brides brides but there's got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride I believe thou with all my heart there must come one that's not only got mechanics but the Dynamics of it it makes the church live I like that when he says that it makes the church live amen I'm brother Tim I'm going to share this from him that God gave us a car I mean excuse me brother brownham had a car running but it's been all the quack preachers excuse me mechanics have been working on it caused that car not to run and I'll tell you if you get everything in order on a car it's going to start and it's going to run I I did some mechanical work one time that was not a good idea I'll finish this in a moment here it was not a good idea I thought I could be a mechanic too that was before YouTube of course YouTube bails you out if you're not a mechanic it makes you a mechanic overnight just go to watch 10 minutes of it and all I'm a Certified mechanic well I didn't have that I was no Certified mechanic and I had all my my wires wrong I thought I'd remember which one went from the distributor maybe some people nor Distributors where the power comes through to the plug I thought I would remember him but I couldn't remember it and so I put those wires on the way I thought they were supposed to go on that car never started our truck never started it didn't run there was nothing to it but when there was a Certified mechanic that came by and he took and he put every spark plug on the right spot where it needed to go on in the right cylinder when you went into that car you just turned the ignition and that car started running hey man did I believe in this hour that's exactly what God is doing this hour through the fivefold ministry amen they're putting this car back in order again so this car can run in this hour hey man and it's gonna run all the way to glory land hallelujah it's not time to sit around and mope around it's time to turn on the car [Applause] and then let it run and I believe when we see the power of God moving to the church it changes people there must come one that's not gonna only got mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes that church live amen we we know that moving the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to do a polished job what good does it do to give it a facelift or a simonizing job when there's no Dynamics in him no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be a Dynamics to make it work hey man and I can we can say tonight the Dynamics are here to make the church move amen but Iowa we're not just moving on a road out so to speak we're we're moving up into glory land when he saw the preview of the Bride it was the church that went down but it was a bride that kept moving on Amen now there was a few out of out of place but he stood in his own room and he screamed out get back in line get back in line get back in line amen I say Lord if we're not in line then I say Lord then put us back in line in this hour it's time for a body chain it's time to rise and shine Hallelujah the church should be moving in the power of the Holy Spirit amen which will cause the church to rise into the heavenlies amen the angel of God didn't leave the church and the prophet left he's still here he's still here and he will be here until we're gone hey man some people think oh when brother Branham left in the pillar far left he said oh no it did not no it's still here they say well you got on a picture on a wall that really that's pictures on the wall just to testify that God was here and and he stood over his Prophet to vindicate that hey man I thank God for that picture amen but I don't need to see another picture to know if he's here or not I can feel him in that power of his resurrection I can feel the dynamic power of Jesus Christ moving he's here we were just in in Brazil in January at a youth convention and the peace on the people came up to me afterwards he said they visibly saw the pillar of fire in the meeting he's still here I know he's here with you as well but it's good to testify of it amen he's the Living God in the message hearing and recognizing he says look at the carnal Church look where they're they're going to farther and farther away look at the Spirit-filled church shaking off all its little nonsense coming up in the spirit in the minority of course coming in the spirit but moving up such a place still as God there to where the holy spirit's moving right through it working its way ready to receive her Lord ready to receive her Lord amen I just want to read that one more time look at the Spirit-filled church shaking off all its little nonsense coming up in the spirit I say shaking off a lot of nonsense a formality a lot of nonsense of intellectualism a lot of nonsense of lukewarmness because it was Satan's desire to make the church lukewarm formal and Powerless but it was God's desire to put a spirit in the church in the individual's lives amen and the spirit is greater than the lukewarmness and and the formalities and so forth amen and that's I don't I don't understand it why do people think they need five steps to get to get something out of their life would I hear that in the Church of the Living God it makes my heart want to scream out amen we don't need no five steps of this or ten steps of that or we don't need to have no psychology in the house of the Lord to get delivered I'll tell you what you need you need the power of the Holy Spirit just drop down one time it will change your life it will make you a new creature in Christ Jesus I read sometimes they gotta get rid of pornography let's have five steps or ten steps I say you don't need no steps well you need is one step at the altar and let the Holy Ghost come down and change your life that's what you need in this hour [Applause] but the problem of it is is they have taken the spirit of formality and the spirit of lukewarmness and they've lost the power of the Living God they don't want God to move anymore but I'm here to declare tonight that God still moves in this hour and will continue to move he's almighty God we should shake ourselves from these spirits of unbelief amen put into action what was left to the church which was a Holy Ghost Field Church Mark 16 in action I know you hear these things every week no doubt but just bear with me for a while let me share what's on my heart tonight hey man it's time that we realize who we are in Christ Jesus we're not we're not the denominational flavor we have been favored by almighty God we have the king's sword in our hand foreign don't don't take it personal I am happy Sister Sister Mara told me one time you need to smile a little more when you preach people think you're angry all the time it's good to have sister Myra with me I forgot to welcome her before good to have her here [Applause] she's my queen Mark 16 15 18. okay what are you done and he said unto them going to all the world preach the gospel of every creature I'm glad he said preach through the foolishness of the preaching men shall be saved he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved that's pretty simple but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs that say these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast all devils you know it's amazing Jesus never gave a form you'll have 10 steps he gave us Formula One Step One Moment in the presence of God amen cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues you know I grew up in in a time when they they thought all those things were on their Shelf but what I found out is that is that they didn't want them working in the church because they would call out sin in their life amen I remember when I started study in the message and I started to realize that brother Brown said and all what some preacher told me my brother Brown who said the gifts were put in the church to keep the church clean I'll tell you what you have that working in your church you're going to find a different atmosphere in all of our churches people aren't just going to slide in and just think they're going to stay underneath the underneath their sin thing they're going to get called up by the Holy Ghost amen God has a way of doing it there's a reason why there's nine spiritual gifts that are put into the body they're there to help the body amen they're gifts that are put into the church God maybe use the person one time but that may be the only time that he needs to use them for whatever the purpose may be amen they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing has shown all hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen and we believe that with all of our heart amen sometimes we think we always want to see things so so quickly but God has his own timing for everything amen I also want to read from infallibility of God's spoken word when he came he he came through a virgin God made his promise sure he was stuck he stuck with his word every word of it had to be so he made it perfect because he was God and couldn't do nothing else he had to stay with it notice the next thing that he next thing he had to do the church had to be anointed and sent out before he could keep his promise he had to make a way for this church to be anointed and the church after Walking With Jesus and knowing Jesus and had received power to heal the sick and do everything and all these ups and downs of things they had and yet walk with G and yet Walk With Jesus he know that he had to make a way to send his church out anointed amen it was why he was not just going to send them up without an anointing he was going to send them with an anointing amen when people want to take the anointing out of the church that church is just dead and gone he sent them up to Jerusalem and they went into the upper room and stayed there for ten days and nights until suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind that filled all the house where they were sitting God made a way to anoint his church and to spread her Gates across the ages excuse me and to spread her across the ages across the Nations rather and tonight today that same Mighty glorious church is marching on to Zion as she's moving up and down Anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost signs and wonders and Revival fires on every Hill everywhere he said it's not only in Chicago but I'll make it more personal it's not only just in Virginia or not just in the United States He support us through the Heathen lands and I say that's where we are is in Canada we're not known as a Christian Nation anymore we're just a heathen land a nation of a bunch of variety of of religions but but God is putting Revival in the hearts of the people amen sometimes people get scared when you talk about Revival I don't understand why we should be revived every day of our life amen we should be in Revival all the time amen sometimes that's not going to be maybe a big worldwide Revival but I want to have Revival in my life every day amen when I come to the house of God if I'm feeling down I want those Revival fires to burn in my soul Amen Let the revivals burn within our heart brother Bradham said us not necessarily bringing more people into the church but it's Reviving what's already in your heart sometimes through life things get difficult but when the Holy Spirit can come by and just revive what's already in our heart amen give us a new vision a new home in Christ Jesus amen to just let ourselves rise a little higher in God Satan's job is to bring us down it's the holy spirit's job that's trying to punch this church up foreign amen I say Lord move us higher he said Revival fires are burning great signs and wonders are taking place day is at hand and God has made a way of Escape he said to Joel and that day I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your young man shall see Vision upon my handmaidens and mates will that pour on my spirit I'll show signs in the heavens above and flying saucers everywhere all kinds of Mystic signs in the heavens above signs in the earth beneath there will be a sea of roaring tidal waves breaking along Chicago and all down along the place in great seas rolling men's Hearts failing perplexed the time distress between the Nations and do we ever see distress between the Nations right now in our in the time that we live in and in that day that great anointed church has to rise to her power amen let's say rise to her power and in that day the great anointed church has to rise to her power Jesus Christ has to come in when enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raised the standard against it and today when science is doing all their different things that God sending down Supernatural signs to show to his church take your mind off the things of the world and look up you're in the ladder now you're anchored both in glory and in heaven a ladder with two ends on it amen once anchored in God and with and he says one's anchor to God and the other anchor to Christ and we're caught between it with a great host of angels bringing Force ministering Spirits Supernatural gifts and things vindicating we're on our road marching up amen innocent not God's moving supernaturally when we hear of all the Miracles that have happened and in this assembly here brother Tim's Church our church and churches around the world I say the church is moving higher in Christ amen I say faith is building in the lives of the people Amen in one glorious day we're going to take our Road and we're going to be out of this place amen I say let it happen Lord let it happen hey man give me faith in this hour I don't want more intellectualism I want more faith in the word of God that has been given to us already amen that Lexi live right that makes you do right that heals you when you're sick amen faith in the word of God and that Faith one day will be supercharged as it were amen and God knows when to supercharge it amen and we're gonna take a rapture [Applause] Hallelujah do you love the Lord who all the Redemptive blessings that God Christ died for is is yours every believer has possession of it brother Brown says reach up and find what it's all about it all belongs to you right that's what the church ought to do be going moving up the road amen not Earthbound anymore but moving up the road moving up into the heavenlies where all things are possible amen the resurrection of Jesus power is given the church has it now but it's your faith that controls our power he said there's enough Holy Ghost believing people in here right now to turn the world upside down that's right I believe it's not wasn't just there but I believe it's right here right now there's enough Holy Ghost in this building in this church that's the turn the world upside down amen I've always wondered what we needed what would happen to the world the way things are happening in Canada and around the world I say Lord this is no doubt we're in the end of all time amen but there's something Supernatural in the lives of the people amen that's that's moving them higher because they believe what they've heard amen that's not oh that was a good sermon no they believe it it's anchored in our hearts it's something that's been given to us amen when they said to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we said amen amen when we saw in the word that it was serpent seed we say to every unto that amen when we saw the seals come unveiled and how God unveiled it we say Amen to that amen marriage and divorce we say Amen to that amen it doesn't matter what the prophet brought we say Amen to it amen what if we're washing our garments amen we're being clothed in white we believe the prophets report and it was a good report amen we believe it with all of our heart let's say I believe it tonight amen I'm not turning back on it no matter what anybody says about it amen I don't know about y'all I get criticized back home I'm known as a Pentecostal Church amongst other people but I say it's okay you can call me anything but you want to call me one day you call me gone because I'll be gone because it don't really matter to me amen I have my I get my my joy in the house of the Lord it's the time time to to shake off what's happened through the week amen praise and honor the Living God amen I know you you know these things but it's going to share it with you amen when I go to a ball game or hockey game I don't just sit there as a Wallflower I'll tell you that I'm not there for that I'm there to encourage the team and and they don't know if they're going to win or lose you don't either if they win it's like oh they did win this game we're down quite a bit in the series I know y'all like football here and all that and got quiet on me brother actors well I know you cheer for your teams that's just the truth of it but you know when we come to the house of the Lord this is my life this is our life I mean why why do we have to sit back and and say okay I can't I can't jump I can't show I can't I can't dance I can't I can't I go all this I can't I can't and as soon as you see him go outside they all get happy when they leave church they say oh you're not happy in the house of the Lord but when you leave the house of God and you stand outside and you sit there yeah did you see this movie I just saw the other day think what in the world where are the people at they're certainly not getting ready for a rapture they should be talking about what God's doing in their lives amen God's moving in our lives amen it's time to rise and shine Church hope this is okay tonight I was gonna go a little different way and the Lord kind of brought me this way and I thought well this is what it is tonight amen further down he said that's what he proved Hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics and the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold and stiff and dead in the grave shaken to life rise again and rolled away the stone I am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he was not only the mechanics God's word he was a Dynamics to prove it and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be met be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all let's say all tonight all the revelations that others have spoken of the Bride if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his blind life she is power of his power she is him in this hour and we can say that that's who we are we are him amen the bride becomes an exact uh reflection of Jesus Christ Our Lord whatever the scripture says it fulfilled who Jesus Christ was we are fulfilling our part in the word of God amen no matter how much we can sound and prove the message to be right but there has to be something in our lives to move us higher in Christ amen we can prove it I don't they can they can prove it it's all actually but you look at their life and they can they can't even live an overcoming life but if the power of the holy spirit is in our life amen and moving in our life we're we're not going to be Earthbound any longer we're going to be Heavenly bound we're going to move higher in Christ Jesus what keeps us bogged down is little besetting things in our in our lives amen and if we could ever lay those things down one time amen we'll realize how free we can be coming to Christ amen if God has ever done anything I can see why people can't show because they've never experienced God in a supernatural way but when you experience God in a supernatural way he became my healer amen he he's my see he became my salvation he became everything to me amen the least I can do is give glory and praise unto him for what he's done unto me amen people think well why do people want to run why do they want to show I'll tell you why they want to run and why they want to show up because because something has happened amen the things that used to bother them they don't bother them anymore amen because Christ came into their life in a supernatural way amen every one of us is a supernatural creation of God Amen and we should be glad and rejoice for what Jesus Christ has done excuse me for my coughing for what Christ has done for us amen when I was sick he became my healer amen when I was depressed he became everything and became my joy amen when I was down and out he lifted me up again amen and somebody wants to tell me I can't praise God I'm going to praise God in the morning I'm going to praise him at noon time I'm going to praise my God it's time to praise him it's time to worship him it's time to let your voices know what side you're on it's time to let the people know that Christ Is My All In All thank again happy and evolving I'm gonna get happy in the house of the Lord Hallelujah time to let God take control of Our Lives it's time to get out of the dumps and thank God for his grace you may say well I got problems in my life he makes it that way for us amen because he wants to see what side of the fence will we be on I know that's hard for us to take in this age of soft living that we have but it's good for us anyhow we gotta make decisions in this hour as for me and my house I'm gonna serve the Lord with all my heart [Applause] Hallelujah the Holy Ghost should be working in our lives we say oh if everything's going our way oh man we can get happy but we should be happy when things aren't going our way we want to move higher in Christ we want to get out of here hey man and we're gonna get out of here one of these days what will it take I don't know what it will take but I'm gonna start it in my life I say Lord let it begin with me hey man let my life be such amen no matter if I'm up or down we get up and we get down sometimes it takes us a few days to get over it amen but I want to say that our anchor holds in Christ hey man I'll never repeat all my love for Jesus Christ it holds in Christ the word Hallelujah when I hear the prophet saying you never did it in the first place hey man that ought to make somebody want to get happy amen when they when the by when he said the old Union is in the sea of God's forgetfulness you weren't married to to begin with he the bridegroom bore your shame he took your place for you you were predestinated from him to be in his bride from before the foundation World Bible said so you are the predestinated seed amen I am so thankful to God Amen I may fall a thousand times in a day but I say Lord forgive me for it people the Devil comes up to try to try to and try to tell the Lord something about it in my life and he becomes a one that would I can't get the word out me Jesus excuse me accuse me then God looks at my slate and it says forgiven all over it hey man I don't know about you church I'm trying to encourage you this morning this evening however amen that we can rise higher when it says it's forgiven is Forgiven it's never to be remembered no more amen it's all gone and let's see if it's forgetfulness it's over some brother told me brother Kelly I can't make it I said he has already made it for you what are we worrying about [Applause] it's gone let's go to big sign on it says no fishing the devil tried to accuse us somebody try to accuse us but it says no fishing he took my place he took your place amen that's why the bride has something to be rejoicing about it makes you want to jump and shout and thank God amen when I look at what I could have been and where I am today I'll tell you what church I I don't I can only see the grace of almighty God Amen yeah I was born in church but that doesn't make you a Christian being born in church is a wonderful thing to hear the word of the Lord but you've got to come down to a personal experience between you and almighty God Amen where you're anchored in him stable in him then let this come and let that go some people they there's the same other they could sit in a church for 20 years also just like that they throw it away I say they were never saved to begin with I know that's hard for some people to take but it's their truth anyhow if they were saying how how can you ever leave something that you never started yourself come on Church hey remember the Bible tells me that he which begun the good work in me amen it wasn't by my arm but it was by his sword it wasn't by my word but it was by his word and when he says it's gone it's gone I never started the work I won't finish but he will finish what he started in me he'll finish what he started in you amen amen hallelujah in the message search of thirst 65 he said brother Brown I shouted once I dance in the spirit he said don't don't don't take that no wait till that satisfaction comes the satisfaction portion or the fullness of the Holy Spirit comes in then though Joy Bells they're shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit will come you won't have to do it by the music amen I don't need music to make me get happy amen I can get happy just driving my car on the road hey man I'm working on the job you can get happy pounding nails amen whether you're sweeping the floor whether you're making apple pie you're going to make somebody happy but you can make apple pie you can get happy when you're making it hey man no matter what you're doing there's something to be happy about as simple today church but this is what it is amen we're not some old dried up church amen that's a dead flower or something like that but we're the Church of the Freeborn of Jesus Christ amen I say it's time to rise in this hour and move up with Claude in this hour Amen Let the Holy Spirit sweep over our souls as my prayer Amen to every person and rise in the power of the resurrection of Christ Easter is just around the corner from us one of the most beautiful times of the year is the resurrection of Our Lord amen because there speaks of of your change it speaks of what he's done for us amen and what he's going to do to the Church of the Living God Amen if if he raised himself up under the grave when he says on that day that those that sleep in the grave will come forth they're going to come forth somebody say are they going to come forth brother Kelly I said it's not up to me to know how they're coming forth I'm just saying what he says they're coming forward amen how's he going to change me I don't know how he's going to change me but I'm Gonna Change [Applause] the church should be full of power with 121 into the upper room they were cowards but when they came out they had something different in their heart they had some dynamics that were moving in their life amen God of this evil age for us that you're not germ of natural life is brought down germatized from father to father to father so is the Life of Christ German ties that's the reason God uses Elijah's Spirit five times what is it's a handing down just as your natural life and traits is handed down from the natural breeding of your father so is the spirit of God that was predestining before the foundation of the world that's why predestination is so important to us amen predestination is important because our names are written in the last book of life before the foundation of the world amen it's not oh there's a new name written down in heaven and it's mine brother Brown said that song sounded good but it was there all it was just wrong because there's no new new names written down in heaven and it's mine my name was written a long time ago before I even even knew about my name written down in heaven it was already written down in heaven amen and that name was written there Amen brother Brown took a picture of you how you would look in the Millennium and he put in the followers predestination we're on our way to that picture amen and one day that picture will be unveiled and revealed amen I'll be back in a young body you'll be back on a young body amen somebody say praise the Lord Hallelujah predestinated for a foundation world to win the entire word of God incomplete was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ and their God made me pay for my sins thank you Jesus and him there then he rose me and raised me up with him in the resurrection and now let's say now and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil oh if they can only believe what God has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it but if you are seated there let's say I'm seated there he says you will use it for your ordained to do what you do amen and I say this exactly we are ordained to do what we do amen this bride is going to be an invincible Army brother Brown says when she realizes it gets a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church he will be an invincible Army it's not if she will be we are an invisible Army and by and he says that by God's spirit desire to withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen I believe that with all my heart I believe it today he will be as definitely for it today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it we're true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail but we let's say we we will prevail over them amen the true the two Spirits Invincible Army our army that can't be beaten you know armies they test their strengths one uses one weapon the other one uses a bit of a weapon they keep tests and their strength but this Army has gotten already tested what will work through his son Christ Jesus and it's the spirit of Christ that came back on the church amen this arm this church WIll withstand the power I want to read I want to read one scripture how to cook 3 18 to 19. I'm going to read it out of the Amplified version and then just a few moments and we'll come to a conclusion praise the Lord have a cuck 3 18 to 19 the Amplified says yet I will rejoice in the Lord I will exalt in the glory and the Victorious God of my salvation that word exalt means to be extremely joyful to leap for joy yet I will rejoice in the Lord I will jump for joy in the Victorious God of my salvation verse 19 in the Amplified the Lord God is my strength my personal bravery and my Invincible Army he makes my feet like Heinz feet and will make me to walk not to stand still in Terror but to walk and make spiritual progress upon my high places of trouble suffering or responsibility for the chief musician with the string instruments amen the Lord God is my strength he's my personal bravery oh I don't have any bravery I'm scared of a dog I don't care for him too much one time I know if I ever told you this story here I went to get my mail one day man that was a roughest day of my life I opened my mailbox was right by by a yard we have those mailboxes you have to open them and get your mail out of them and uh the the door opened and here's two bulldogs they were standing right here and I was standing right here and I thought dear Lord now what do I do this is not a good idea that's not a good idea so I finally went and I got onto a good guy's truck he had a hardcover on the top I stood on top of his truck and I called here the guy walked out here's the guy we buy both some stuff from he said what are you doing on my truck Kelly I said well trust your dogs he says oh they're as tame as a kitten I said well I'm not going to find out if they are or they're not I'm not about to find out if I look at my own bravery I'm not going to get very far but when Christ becomes my personal bravery when he becomes your personal bravery that's a whole different thing he becomes your Invincible Army see on our own we're no Army but when Christ is behind us we become the Invincible Army he's the one that's going to move us he makes my feet like Heinz feet and will make me to walk amen we're so thankful for the word of God in this hour it's no longer just a little bride just a little church no it's the bride Universal of Jesus Christ and she's standing in Authority in this hour and she's moving higher and higher and higher in Christ Jesus amen it's not just an emotional workup but it's a bride full of the word of God amen some people think oh you're just emotional I said man if you if you think I'm emotional then you really don't know yet because when I get to thinking about what the Lord's done for me something just happens within my heart and in my soul it stirs me up to a place you hardly know what to do with yourself sometimes you shout sometimes you cry sometimes you don't know what to do something is moving and what is it doing it's moving us higher and higher in him all the time until one day we'll be ready to take our body change amen I say Lord keep us move us higher our young people need to see a living God living in the hearts of the people amen something that's alive something that's moving amen not just something just a bunch of words and all we we believe this but we don't live it on Monday and Tuesday but something we live Monday and Tuesday amen we have church on Wednesday but Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday amen God moving and his people amen I say you don't have to be bound by any evil spirits here tonight where you can go free in the name of Jesus Christ amen he's here to set the captive free and whom the son has set free is free indeed you don't have to live in family disputes you just need more of the Lord in your life amen sometimes we see marriage breakdowns and things of that and sometimes it's just it's a terrible situation but God is here to heal that marriage he's here to bring it back into a place again that you can have a love and respect for one another amen he's a living God amen he's concerned about us I I had a I had a young man brother Timothy was just at our church in February and there was a young man that came came to the service and and on on that that night Timothy preached on if I could only Touch the Hem of His Garment and this man his wife he's been out of church for 17 years and and he came to church that day his wife was diagnosed with with uh Ms and and in his house he screamed out if I could only Touch the Hem of His Garment and that night God moved brother Timothy to that exact service sermon and he preached that sermon and that brother stood there who hadn't been in church for 17 years with tears on his face and just in awe of the power of God he talked to me later he's coming to church every service right now on Sunday morning he lives about an hour and a half from church and he said brother Kelly I didn't know how to come back to the Lord he said but I said I'm I'm moving back to the Lord whether God moves on my wife or doesn't move on my wife God allowed that to catch my attention amen and we're seeing prodigals come back church amen it's happening around the world Amen God is moving in a supernatural way amongst his church amen I just want to move with him as he's moving amen I say Lord if there's some one here tonight in that condition you don't have to be here on the internet you don't have to be in that condition Jesus Christ is here today Amen to help you amen and to to reveal himself to you sometimes he told me really Kelly I just didn't know if I was good enough I said who of us are good enough there's none of us that are good enough amen by Christ is real in this hour and he welcomes you back with open arms amen and we are not there as a spectacle or some to be to me be made fun of no you're going back to the house of the Lord with arms open wide we embrace you and welcome you in the name of the Lord he says well I don't know very much I said you don't have to need to know very much just realize that Jesus Loves You amen and then the man is just on fire for God right now I gave him the church age book he read it in one week he said I can't get enough of it I said you'll never get enough of it when something stirring in your heart I say blessed be the name of the Lord for the grace of almighty God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord I was in Venezuela about the similar situation about 12 years ago at a convention and it was a it was the 45th anniversary the message came to that country and I hope this okay it was going to testify for a moment amen and I and I I was at the message and I was ministering on a just a simple subject line and about three quarters of the way through there was a scream that came out from the way back of the church there was a lot of people in that meeting and a scream came out and this sister came running forward with everything that she had and she she rededicated her life to the Lord I didn't know the situation after the meeting she found me amongst all the people she said brother Kelly I've been backflinted for 25 years for 25 years but when I heard what you had to speak today something stirred up in my heart and in a stirred up to a place that I realized there's a God that loves me and he said I could I didn't know how to come back to him but she said today I found my way back to the Lord amen I said blessed be the name of the Lord I said God can heal us from cancer God can heal us from a from asthma God can heal us from a lot of things but one soul is worth ten thousand worlds amen I say blessed be the name of the Lord verse Grace okay a year later I came back into the country at another meeting and the sister wasn't not that meeting but she sent word to me she said make sure you tell brother Kelly that I'm still serving the Lord with all my heart amen I say when God does something he doesn't could amen you may not know how to come back to the Lord but there's a God that welcomes you with open arms amen why we're ready to

different weather change and so forth but but God is my God Is My Healer amen he healed me so you talked to Sister Mara how I used to be 20 some years ago it was not a good thing but God is my healer and I know he's a Healer I was testifying of it with the people there and and she said her son was in that meeting he said if God can do that for brother Kelly he could do it for me and he took a hold of the word of God and from that day forward to this day today he has never had another asthma attack he don't take no more medications anymore God completely restored him and healed him in the power of the Holy Ghost amen I say our God is living amen I didn't even know about it until that time I was just amazed at the power of God Amen there's no doubt there's so many testimonies that could be spoken amen of the power of God but he's still a living God church amen sister roshani's brother told me and she did she did some translation work for me I was in a place in in Altamira that's the name of the city and in the Amazonian region on the river last year in July and and her brother was at that meeting you can talk to her at the end of the service and and the power of the Lord was moving through the meeting and and and and the power of God came on her brother he went to another meeting after that and there was a person in there that was so sick from from covet was in a in a just about a comatose state it was was very very ill and he went and laid his hands on that brother and God raised that brother up from that condition of completely no power or nor ability to move and the person from my recollection was in the church that night I say if God can do it then he could still do it today amen I don't know what your situation is today if the musicians could come forward
