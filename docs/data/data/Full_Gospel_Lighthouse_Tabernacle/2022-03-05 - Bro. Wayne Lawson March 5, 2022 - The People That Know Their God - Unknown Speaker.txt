people amen and we we appreciate that greatly amen and so we want to tonight i'm just about our hearts and i want to take a moment in a word of prayer and if it's okay with you i'd like to ask you to help me pray tonight and i want to invoke what i believe is the greatest power in the world it's the prayer of a believer so if you would just reach over and take somebody maybe lay your hand upon them take them by their hand and i want to ask you to pray with me and let's ask the holy spirit let's welcome him to come and take the meeting tonight lord jesus we bow our hearts before you and we call your name lord because that you have given us the privilege to put a name lord upon the earth whereby we might speak and lord to have the privilege of addressing you the lord your prophet taught us that if we would invite you that you would come and lord we invite you into this meeting we invite you into this church tonight lord father we're asking you that your great anointing lord would move upon this place blessing your people father i ask you lord tonight that if the sick or among us may you touch them lord and heal their bodies i asked you father that if there's one that's lost among us tonight lord may you lord may you put out the hand of salvation tonight lord and lead them to thy great mercies father one that's weak lord may you bring strength lord lord i just ask you for your mercy tonight and as we invite you into this meeting we invite you and all that you are and we'll worship you as the mighty god lord we are asking you now bring your word and lord make it live among us and we'll worship you and honor you for your grace that you have shown us father now lord we commit this meeting into thy faithful hands we thank you for it father in jesus mighty name we pray amen and amen and god bless you tonight and if you have your bibles we would like to turn into the word of the lord and i would look into the book of daniel uh if you can give me a little bit on the ear monitoring i'll turn it up as as i uh as i go in daniel the 11th chapter and uh i appreciate you keeping something on these down here i'm only wearing one of these as well so daniel 11 and 32 uh i want to look at this tonight i've been studying out of this portion of daniel for a little while uh but uh god's gave me a little bit of inspiration to build on it and i just wanted to maybe speak to you a little bit tonight from my heart concerning uh some things here and daniel verse 11 and 32 i believe it's a powerful scripture and it's amazing to me that these things were written hundreds of years before christ but they're talking about you you if you haven't read your name in the scripture lately we're about to read your name here uh and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries but the people can you say that with me the people that do know their god shall be strong and do exploits amen we ask the lord to bless his word as you could be seated tonight the people that do know their god i'd like to speak to you a little bit tonight from this the people that know their god the people that know their god to say the people that know their god would be a very broad statement it would be speaking of could be pretty much anybody to say the people but we realize that scripture sometimes gives something in a broad aspect and then later it's brought into a more precise meaning and you find out say say the woman's seed in the book of genesis turns out to be the abraham seed as well and then it turns out to be jesus christ so you can see sometimes something is said and seemed like a broad manner and many people could fit it but then it actually belongs to somebody now if you like to study this uh there's a lot of people trying to be the people of god they're trying to be that people amen but i believe that god had somebody on his mind when he said the people uh there is somebody he was thinking about there was a people uh when you look in the book of hosea the first chapter in the 10th verse there's a there's a place here uh where hosea as uh he's talking about as the children are being born and the bible said yet the number of the children of israel sabi is the sand of the sea which cannot be measured or numbered and it shall come to pass that in the place where it is said unto them ye are not my people there it shall be said unto them ye are the sons of the living god now prophecy now is being built to tell us that a people who are not a people shall be called the people of god now when you hear hosea say that of course he says the sons of the living god how many knows brother branham he actually separates servants as being israel and sons as being gentile so the sons and daughters of god so now we know the people he's talking about is going to be a gentile people when you go to the book of first peter the second chapter it's when peter says ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who called you out of darkness in the marvelous light now watch what he says a chosen generation a royal priesthood now this is what is said in the book of revelations the first chapter amen when the bible says that we are both kings and priests but now he puts them together and calls you a royal priesthood a peculiar nation now in in the next verse he'll say which in times past were not a people but now are the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy amen now this is apostle peter now applying this to the gentile church which has been elevated from darkness to light and has been brought into a royal priesthood through christ now of course in romans the 9th chapter paul is describing the same verse of scripture and he said that he might make known the riches of glory on the vessels of mercy which had for prepared unto glory even to us who am it called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles as saith in hosea i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall come to pass in the place where it is said unto them you're not my people they shall be called the children of the living god so paul then brings that to the jew gentiles as well so here hosea makes a statement according to daniel those people will also know their god and will do exploits but in revelations 18 john's going to narrow the section and he's going to say i heard a voice saying come out of her my people and be not partakers ever seeing that you receive not her plagues so apostle peter and paul makes it that it's the gentile people but here now john is going to show you that it's the called out people who are called out of the abominations in the last day in revelations the 18th chapter now it's a beautiful thing because this is what is told a prophet when it goes beyond the curtain of time and he sees millions of people coming to him and he said have you ever heard it said that you are gathered with your people and he said is all of these branhams he said no these are your converts amen and and to think now that the people that is in the book of daniel the 11th chapter is the self sanctuary people that is called out in the laodicean age which have become the converts of the message of the hour to think hey man many people say well you people make yourself a special group of people and i beg to differ we have not made ourselves anything amen but it's god that have made us what we are tonight we are what we are by the grace of god we are not making ourselves of a reputation but if our name is written in the scripture we got a right to read the bible we got to write to read what the scripture says about us tonight and i believe tonight is the sons and daughters of god that if the bible's got your name in it you've got to write everything the scripture says according to what you are i believe that i believe this is a generation amen i believe this is a joshua generation we've had a joshua among us amen that gave us our positions in the scripture and here's a prophet now identifying this disbelievers these people with what daniel wrote in daniel the 11th chapter now according to the bible these are a people and these people shall know their god according to ephesians chapter 1 paul said this that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may he give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him in the knowledge of him may god give this people revelation in the knowledge of him the prophecy over you is that you're going to know god the prophecy concerning you is there will be a people that will know their god i'll tell you this you'll only know him if he shows himself to you you'll only know him if you're living in the age of revelation but we are standing in the season of the divine revealer who reveals himself to the church of the living god amen to think this that amen david that paul would say this amen that we would receive unto him the wisdom and revelation of him the eyes of understanding being enlightened that you may know look at that again that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of the inheritance of his saints now now when i think about this tonight i think it's a powerful thing to know amen that god wants you to know that god wants you to know he wants you to know him god is desiring to be known that was the entire purpose of what happened in the garden of eden was that somebody would know him and you think about there was imperfection there was an eden but brother ram said god had a purpose in them leaving eden now all the denominations will preach to you a purpose-driven life and they'll say god has a purpose but here a prophet tells us what the threefold purpose of god was and it came to the fact that god wanted to be known he wants to be known as a healer he wants to be known as a savior he wants to be known as a deliverer god wants somebody to know him in the aspect of more than what he just says to them that he is but they would know him by revelation amen i'll tell you this god wants us to know him and when he makes himself known unto us that's why paul said that we should ask for understanding brother random said we should pray for revelation more than we pray for anything else because revelation gives us understanding of who god is and as our understanding increases our boldness increases our holy ghost boldness increases as we understand the god that we serve then there's a boldness that comes into our life and the things that are impossible starts becoming possible the things that are unseen starts becoming seeing you begin to move from glory to glory you begin to move into the exploits of the spirit of god as you know him beyond the current measure of your knowing him listen however you know him tonight god is intending that you would know him in a greater way than any other age since the time of the garden of eden there is a people that shall know their god amen do you know god could have released these at any age god could have let go of the seals he could have let go of the word at any age but you know why he didn't brother branham said he was waiting for a people to comprehend it he was waiting for somebody to understand it that's why you don't set a three-year-old down and tell them how to build a house they don't know how to that you could tell them all day long the master could reveal it but the understanding isn't there but there was coming of people and god was prophesying of a people that was going to understand their god and it was going to lift them up into measure above amen the understanding of other ages not in understanding just of knowledge amen but in the understanding of a relationship with a living and a merciful god we will know him i think of how that brother adam says it in the paradox we will know him and he said we won't have the identity of being smart men he said i don't even want to be a smart man he said i want to know him as paul said in the power of his resurrection when he calls us to come out from the dead that's all i want i want to know him amen isn't it something he says here in service that we would see jesus he says the cry of the world today is to know christ and i believe paul said to know christ as life and he knew him in the power of his resurrection not to knowing by the word now to know him see to him by the word that's all right but it's a long ways from being sufficient to know him by the word but we've got to know him by the person of his resurrection we've got to know him greater than just what we've read about him we've got to know him do you know that brother random says that a man cannot call jesus the christ except by the holy ghost he said you can say what the preacher said if the preacher said he's the lord you can say that and you can say what the teacher said or you can say what your mama said but before you can say that he's lord you're gonna have to receive jesus christ and which brings you the proof of the resurrection of almighty god i'll tell you tonight i believe i believe that it's it's a long ways from being sufficient just to be able to say that we know the word we've got to know him in the power of his resurrection in the message of the you must be born again brother adam said a true word comes to a true prophet and you'll follow a true word and get a true experience of that word because the word becomes flesh in you and you become god's son and the word of god is revolving right out of god into you because you are his nature his spirit is in you and you'll do his works so if you're following a prophet a true prophet you become to have a true experience with god and that that is that god's word will live right out of you you know that we're offered an experience in this age an experience with a living god in the message of a shame brother madam said see he said somebody will say they're a christian he said and it's a very popular thing to say now i'm a christian he said but do you believe the word of god when it said these signs shall follow them that believe he said even ministers faces will begin to blush he says see are you ashamed to say of divine healing are you ashamed of the full gospel are you ashamed of a pentecostal experience he said that's being ashamed of the word because that's the word made flesh in you a pentecostal experience is a true experience with a living god we can say that god is alive but until he makes himself known to us in the way of a pentecostal experience we do not know him in the fullness of his power god has one way to prove his resurrection how many knows that brother graham said science is not going to prove the resurrection it can't do it education can't prove the resurrection but there's one thing that can prove the resurrection and that is a pentecostal experience amen we are not pentecostal by denomination we are not pentecostal by doctrine but we are pentecostal by the experience of a living god because we believe that jesus is not in a tomb tonight but he raised up from the dead and his body sits in heaven tonight his spirit is coming to the church and here we are tonight and we can say he's alive not just because there's an empty tomb but because he's alive in this church he's alive in your worship he's alive in your songs he's alive and you're praised he's alive in your prayer he's alive in the ministry amen my god is not dead my god is alive i know him in the power of his living being tonight yes sir this is not a dead god this is not just a theological god this is not just the god of your moms and your dads and the former days this is a god who said i am that i am he is a god amen and i know now people say to me all the time i mean this this far along in the message they'll say to me brother wayne do you think it's necessary for us to be preaching on experiences at this point do you think it's necessary i think it's more necessary now than it was 20 years ago i think it's more necessary right now because what is happening in the world we're living in the only escape is god amen that's the only boat going out is god and you've got to meet god in a reality now some people say to me so brother wayne if you you you start preaching on that experience stuff you're that's that's that's a bunch of chickens you know well let me read something brother branham has to say eagle stereotypes in 1960 he said we need as ministers to preach the gospel and bring the church back to pentecost again isn't that something that people will say ministries will say we don't need that kind of preaching but a prophet said what we need to as ministers is to preach the gospel and bring the people back to pentecost he's not talking about azusa street he's talking about on the day of pentecost when the holy ghost came amen that's not a figment of imagination that's not some emotion that you make fun of that's an experience with a living god that comes down to the church and changes the being that's what it is amen brother branham said we need that kind of preaching he said we need to bring it back to an eagle experience you put that on your on your refrigerator and eagle experience is a pentecostal experience amen now now here's another one everybody said well by the way we're in the weed age now and we don't want the shuck of pentecost what's odd because brother branham don't call it shuck he calls it wheat the the zeus of pentecost was the shock is that right but it's the weed age now amen there's a ministry on the earth just like the one that went into the ground under a real pentecostal experience a weak experience an eagle experience is a real true pentecostal experience hey man you said well brother wayne you went back pentecost i always was pentecost amen i always was amen i've always been i believe a prophet taught us amen that we've got one going over here on fundamentals and we got others going out on fanatics he said but what we need is a church of the living god that can bring the two together where the word of god can be preached in its power and this manifestation i've heard people say to me well that's just a bunch of pentecostalism well i'll tell you why why don't you take this message and preach in a pentecostal church one time i tell you they'll be shouting and dancing on the singing but preach on the godhead and it'll quieten it down but not in the church here not in this assembly you preach on the power of the godhead and it'll bring a revival because this revival is not done by music it's not a singing revival this revival comes from the revealed word that's coming to the age we're in oh it'll quieten the pentecostals down but not here not full gospel lighthouse it don't quieten it down people get out of their chairs and begin to praise god and worship god amen it's not a pentecostal shuck it's the weed age it's a bride who's went back to the word of god oh yeah yeah i'll tell you what happened people have put a wet blanket on this word and they put out the experience of the word so they're preaching a word without an experience well you know what that is honestly you know what that is the word without experience is actually a painted fire that's all they've done is painted the fire they amen now this is sad to me while they're painting a fire of what it used to be like they're putting out the one that's now in they are they are exhibiting and talking about what happened in paul's day and what happened in brother branham's day but at the same moment we'll not allow the atmosphere to get to a place that the dynamics of god can take place in the church of god amen but i don't believe we need a painted fire tonight what i believe we need is the power of the holy ghost to fall in the church of the living god that this generation that is alive now will know what it's like to come face to face with a pillar of fire the angel of the mighty god i believe that's where we're at now i believe that god has a people a people that shall know their god oh my what is it i believe they shall know their god now it's odd to me the way brother branham says it and i just got to get to this quote before i continue but in daniel the 11th chapter it said of people shall know their god i'm going to read this from the feast of the trumpets brother brahms said the people that believe in him know it unless they're constantly in the word see he said how will they know how would they know the messiah unless they're in the word he said the wise shall know but the foolish and the unlives wouldn't know they shall know their god now he shall appear in the last days to bring the people back to the word so the bride will know her husband hey man i'll tell you what just take that section where it says the people shall know their god and put this in right on top of it the bride will know her mate the bride will know her husband the people of daniel 11 is the bride today amen it's not a different people you are not somebody like what god was talking about you are the people that god was talking about the bride will know their mate do you see what's in a season to know him when you when you look in the scripture amen you can go back to the book of genesis and you can go in the 18th chapter of genesis i think it's a one of the most tremendous moments in the life of abraham when elohim comes in genesis 18 and the bible said that three men come remember and as they begin to come amen abraham saw them coming and he went to the tent door and opened the door and sat down in the tent door and waited for them to approach and when he saw them coming the bible said he bowed his self to them and said my lords and my lord he said my lord amen if you would if you would allow me amen there it is i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant continue in that next one let a little water i pray you be fetched wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree the next verse and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort your hearts after that you shall pass on therefore you are come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said look at this after that you shall pass on for therefore ye are come to your servants amen brother ram said for this cause you have come to abraham the man said what was it he said he was going to let abraham be his servant he was going to let abraham wash his feet he was going to let abraham bring meat and bread he was going to allow it and of course when i started looking at this i thought dear god what kind of what kind of grace was it that the god of all creation would come down to the front of abraham's tent and sit down and fellowship with him a while you know when he visited him abraham did not hurry that situation you know what he did he meant he said to sarah sarah quit now quick now go go go need some bread he said to one of the young people go get some meat now and begin to cook the calf and and he started going over and getting a pail of water and put his feet in a pile of water now all those are symbologies you know but look at what he's going to do he's going to entertain that angel because he wants the presence of that angel in his house do you know the one that he's washing his feet is the one that's about to change his body the one he's washing his feet is the one that's there with the promise that he needs to hold on to he don't need it just to pass by he don't need the angel just to come and just to leave but he wants to do something to entertain the presence of that angel that he'll sit down and he'll stay a little while he said brother wayne what do we do do you remember washing feet you remember brother brown said that little woman went and washed jesus's feet you know what he said it was he said that was washing the dust off his feet but it was cleaning up his reputation among the people in other words when he washed the feet of jesus that little woman was saying to everybody in the room i believe this is god i believe this is a prophet i believe it's the fulfillment of the scripture them other men couldn't wash his feet because they couldn't identify with him they would lose their reputation well let me tell you i'm not interested in a reputation amen i'm interested in washing the feet of elohim that when he comes down in the church and i could pull up a bucket of water and begin to wash his feet glory to god [Applause] we're living in a generation you can have a prayer line now and when you lay your hand don't ask me why it happens but sometimes there's enough anointing that within just a human hand and a person cannot stand on their feet i don't know why but sometimes a human body cannot even contain the power that comes through a prayer of a human being it's god's way sometimes i've seen little young people i've seen sisters i've seen elders i've just seen them lay right out in the floor and there's no critics sitting back here saying well there ain't nothing to that and i tell you this ain't this and this thing but then you watch there are a few a few sisters there'll be a few brothers in that congregation it'll get up out of their chair and they'll go up to the front and they'll begin to pray with them young people what are they doing they're washing it up they're saying this is of god this is god moving among us this is the presence of god among us and what we need tonight is when we see the spirit of god moving in the church we don't want to criticize we want to wash the feet of it and say god we want this in our church we want shouting in our church we want the blessing of the holy ghost in our church hey to worship god is not just to the young people to worship god it's not just to the sisters but some of you aristocatic brothers need to break out of that shell that you let get on you and begin to worship god until the presence of elohim comes into the church and stays a little while [Applause] abraham was the captain of the house abraham was the captain he didn't let the servants do it brother he said bring me the water i'll clean it up i'll preach a message on the power of the holy ghost i'll preach the message of the hour on god and bean and skin you see what he was doing he was cleaning it up listen it was dusty it was old it was tired but by the time abraham got water and began to feed water he began to water the presence of god in his midst he began to feed it he put mead into it do you see that that's why the angel comes by here because you refresh him in your presence it's a welcoming presence i'll tell you what right there true word tabernacle amen the last couple of days the holy ghost amen the services that great anointing has been right there i'll tell you why because the welcome has come for that kind of move of god if you don't want that kind of move in your church don't worry it won't come but if you really want god to come by your way for this cause i have come to this place that the anointing of god might move in the church hello him elohim has come down and to dwell with us he's walked the aisles of this bill somebody said why ron spencer's church why in jerusalem wild food gospel why out of all the churches in this place all these little areas and all these did not why does it happen here it's because there's a tent door been opened there's some meat laying on the table there's water been drawn to wash the feet there's a fresh drink a pentecostal water for the power of the holy ghost i'll tell you if he's graceful enough to come by [Applause] oh we will refresh him in the presence of god what is it it's a people that welcomed god they cleaned him up you know that was a time i need a little water brother that was a time it was a time when that the pentecostal movement amen would have been for some people but all of a sudden he gets a bad name and people don't want to be identified with that but me i want to be identifiable him oh my do you see the visitation they were in was elohim now come down and sit with them and they were entertaining him he hung around now for a little while he'd been he'd been attending the fellowships with them he'd been receiving worship he had been think about this he's allowing abraham to worship him abraham has left over there in babylon because they got a bunch of gods and he's bowing to this one who is this man he's not just a man it's god in the man god had come down to them and he's worshipping there genesis 18 is a representative of what we are doing in this age the visitation of the great elohim has come down into this age and gave grace now brother branham says in the message anything too hard for the lord he sets and talks about when abraham was sitting in the tent door and he said it was a hot day he said sarah had been fussing about some of the fashions and how she didn't have certain things and brother man said the cattle wasn't getting the water they needed and the desert had become dry and the little water holes that began to dry up he said conditions were horrible he said see but that's what happens just before the blessing of god that's what happens just before a real move of the spirit is the conditions start getting horrible situations start rising up problems start happening everywhere but what is it it's only the devil trying to block the blessing for getting to the church listen what he'll do hey man you'll have a little situation rise up a little a little situation just before meetings really hey man they get really hot usually and situations start popping up in the church all kinds of problems and all of a sudden you'll ask yourself did i do something wrong brother man said if the devil can get you to thinking that you've done something to cause that he said he'll block your blessing right there he'll block your blessing right there but what you want to do is just remember that it's the season you're living in if it's hot outside and it's july you didn't cause it it's july it's hot outside you're used to it being hot this is laodicea get used to it it's dark everywhere troubles are everywhere but we are not camping in the odyssea we are pulled back into the presence of god where the anointing can come we still have to mingle we still have people around us amen but it's the devil trying to block the blessing now think of this what is it it's because it's like an ash heap that you're sitting on as abraham was sitting there in those conditions just before elohim comes brother madam brother baptize it and says of course amen of course what it is is the devil trying to block now if you know the word in the book of second corinthians the 10th chapter paul actually tells us he meant that the weapons of our warfare they are not carnal but mighty through god to pulling down the strongholds casting down imagination and every high thing what's this that exalt itself against the knowledge of god now the bible said the people shall know their god but imaginations and reasoning is going to come like never before but the scripture says you cast them down and remember what you know about god you got to remember what you know about god in the middle of trial in the middle of issues in the middle of problems remember what you know about god remember this is the very thing whenever the scripture declares this it talks about how uh that in the days of job when job was sitting on a nice sheep and remember as he's sitting on the ash sheep and his trials are getting on him his skin has been eaten up by boils his own wife begins to say just curse god and die how many knows who that job's wife was brother man said your flesh he said your own flesh tells you just to give up amen but look now job couldn't give up because job knew about god because of his knowledge of god he had to bring his imagination god's turned against me god don't love me god ain't with me amen every imagination he could have but he had to throw it down at the knowledge he had of the god that he served god had already said he would god had already told the devil you won't shake him off god had already told the devil hey man what you're going to do ain't going to work but you're going to do everything you can do to him but he had a knowledge of god but look at this job had had a question and that question is what happens to a man now i love how brother branham takes it he said of course that job sitting on the eye sheep saw the greatest revelation he saw the resurrection of jesus christ he saw the trial and he saw the resurrection of jesus through his trial then he jumps up you i love how it's written in job he said he jumped up from there and he said oh he said if this mountain were iron and my pen was led he said i'd ride into this mountain oh that i know my redeemer liveth now listen this if you know something that strong he's not going to write it down with a pencil to erase it in case things get hard he's not going to ride it in a place that could just be easily hidden or set aside when things don't go the way job thought they would go amen but job said if i had me a pen and that mountain was iron i would ride it in that mountain i know my redeemer liveth oh i'll tell you when job said i know brother branham asked the question he picks it up and he said job said i know he said old job what do you know what do you know job he said he knew he was god but he was his redeemer i thought oh my he knew about a personal god he knew a god that could redeem his life i tell you this young people amen i believe at some part you got to quit it being daddy's god it's got to become your god it's got to quit being the god of just somebody it's going to be your god the way you serve your god and job knew and job knew that this was god his knowledge was of god i'll tell you this amen i believe there's a people today that know god i know there's a people today that know god now let me ask you what do you know what do you know about your god well i'll tell you this i know he's a long time god i know he's an on time god i know he's a faithful god i know he's a healer i know my god is a savior hey he's a god who is a deliverer you know when when the god that i'm talking about is the same very god that was in the book of genesis introducing himself unto abraham the same one that said in his tent door is the same god that's right here in this building tonight it is not a different god it is the self-saying god in this building tonight i want you to see something when abraham begin to worship him he called him lord capital lordy hello him you see what he was a self-existent god if you if you follow the life of abraham he only believed in one god now he was that was his whole life's journey was about serving one god do you know he called that god when he met him he meant in genesis 14 he called him melchizedek he's met god and he said he's my king and he's my priest he knew him as melchizedek and he welcomed him as melchizedek as a king priest unto him it's amazing of just at the time that abraham separates from lot now look at this it does not help a lot but it helps abraham a lot goes on to the city but abraham goes on into the promises the moment that he begins to separate and he meets god on the road remember what he said to him he said you are blessed of the most high god abraham you are blessed of the most high god how many realizes the most high god is a hebrew word called elyon he was blessed of el yon the most high god in other words if the god who is the most high will bless you there's nobody else can come along and take that blessing off of you i don't care what you're going through tonight if god's blessed you you're blessed it doesn't matter to me what the situations are what the problems are i think it's time to cast down every imagination and say what you know about god what do i know about god i know he's my king i know he's my priest i know he's my very ill yawn there is no higher office let me say this to you we don't got to go to the secretary brother we go to the boss man we ain't going to the second person of the godhead or some mary to get our way we have received an entertainment from the god of all creation the one who is god this god who is called el john is the same very god i know we preached many sermons on it he's the same god who's killed el shaddai he was the breast of god how many knows he's a breasted god he's the strength given god is that right so he's also elohim the self-existent god now that god made some promises unto abraham and he told abraham i've given you a covenant and that covenant was unconditional in other words it was an unconditional promise made to abraham concerning god about abraham it wasn't abraham and and if you do this or do this this is going to happen god made that promise based on his ability to fulfill his word when god made a promise to abraham it was a it was an irrevocable promise well i wished i had time to preach on that tonight it's an irrevocable promise when god promises you and he can't take it back you see what i'm saying to you if your daddy promises you a thousand dollars and he can't lie to you you can shout all the way to the bank because it's an irrevocable word and our god didn't just promise us a prosperity of wealth he prospered us in our health and in our ability to serve him he is a prospering god who has blessed us through all spiritual blessing now think of this god who abraham served amen but but if he was just the god of abraham the story's short but it was more than the god of abraham but when abraham had a son amen his son's name was isaac now listen this god who was the god of abraham and isaac had met moses and had started telling moses what kind of god he was and he was the god of abraham and he was the god of isaac now he could not say he was the god of isaac until isaac had met him he could not say i'm the god of abraham and of isaac until isaac had come along and isaac had met him and isaac had experienced him i can imagine when god introduced himself as the god of abraham what it meant to the person that was hearing it was this is the god that changes the elements of the body this is the god that makes irrevocable promises of supernatural things that no man can perform listen to me tonight when god made that promise to abraham that you shall have a child and sarah shall bear it they could not do that within themselves it was an impossibility for it to happen if you don't know god you wouldn't believe my story you've got to know the god i'm talking about before you will believe what i have to say about you in this church tonight you've got to believe there is a god before i could say to you that you are the bride party of jesus christ you are the sinless virtuous body of the almighty god and god himself is dwelling in the church tonight unless you believe god you can't believe me because it ain't possible for you to be everything that i'm going to say you are now think about this because abraham wasn't able but he had a god and that god was using a man to identify what kind of god he was he took a man who couldn't he took a woman who couldn't and he did it through them anyhow i don't know if y'all ever stop and really thought about this but according to the message of the hour abraham and sarah were a hundred years old and they were barren even when sarah was young god didn't only make them new he didn't only make them young he had to change their bodies now look god can do that but god can't lie god couldn't tell abraham something and then back up on the promise if god told him something god could change the elements of his body but he couldn't lie to abraham so god the creator abraham's god came down and met with them and entertained them and after he left there was something beginning to stir around the camp of abraham elements and their bodies began to be energized they literally changed their body by the entertainment of the angel of almighty god that same angel is in this building tonight and is here to be entertained until there's a change a physical change comes into the body this angel will not leave the earth until this bride's body has been changed i will dwell with him i shall be their god and they shall be my people [Applause] you might not know who you are but i know who you are you're the people the bible prophesied that would know this god abraham knew him he knew him as a god that could breathe over a body and he could watch his wife in her late age stricken could see her melt back to a young woman her backbone would straighten up her gray hair would become black again her womb would become fertile her old heart would be made young because they entertained all right god was the one sitting there talking to moses out of that bush and he was introducing himself i'll tell you you can't know a man unless he's been introduced correctly to you you might know a man a certain way but somebody else that knows him in a different way could introduce him and it'll blow your mind i never will forget when sean and wendell martin's brother-in-law jonathan them boys brother-in-law brother matt mclearn he i just knew he was a country boy sitting at my table eating breakfast good old boy he was a gunsmith and one day sean says to me he said you know he's the world champion pistol shot in 1991 don't you i said i had no idea i was sitting in the presence of greatness and didn't know it until somebody introduced that to me i didn't know it now later he took me out to the range i could tell people that guy's good that guy's good because he had a champion you can't be good but you can't get that without being good sorry i had a right to call him good but i'd never personally experienced it i'm sorry i'm just going to preach while i'm preaching but but but we went up to the cafe one day and he's talking about deer hunting with me and we pulled it out i said well i had a little deer rifle we brush hunted like here just short shots you know 30 30s and things and i said i got a little deer rifle maybe 30 30 or something will get you he said i don't need that brother wayne said i got my pistol i said okay well i'll get you a deer rifle it'd be all right you can carry a pistol makes you feel better he said brother wayne he said i ain't shoot a quarter 200 yards of this gun well i'm from arkansas [Laughter] i'd heard a lot of wendy's in my day i actually told him a story about two buys floating down the river i said they were floating down the river and looked down on the bottom a guy seen a glow down there and he said what in the world is that the other guy threw his reel down there and hooked this thing and started reeling this thing up to the top and got it up and it was a coleman lantern and it was lit and it was still burning on the bottom of the of the river he said are you kidding i said i'll tell you what i'll do i'll blow out the fire on that lantern if you'll take 30 yards off that shot he said you got a range i said i do he said come on i took a quarter and laid it and traced it and drawed it in zach was probably with us he was probably the runner run that baby after 100 yards and hang it and matt walked back up there and pulled out his pistol and he didn't use a little rock though he put it right on there and drilled that quarter at 100 yards i said hi it's luck three out of three drilled that quarter i couldn't do it with my 30 30. see i had a right to call him good but then now i've got a personal testimony i've seen it with my eyes and i can read about god right here and say he's the god of somebody but i got another right tonight i've experienced the power of this god i've seen him raise the dead i've seen cripples get up and walk i've seen lives changed i've seen things happen right in the midst of us and i've got every right tonight to praise him and to say that he is the god of abraham oh yes sir i got a right to say it he is the god of abraham he's a change of things now look when he introduces himself to isaac he introduces himself as the god of his father but isaac amen when he's when he knows him god later comes to jacob you ever watched the scriptures and look how the consecutive of us goes when he introduces himself to jacob in the scripture in the book of genesis god comes to jacob and he says to him i'm the god of abraham and isaac now that same god to moses will say i'm the god of abraham isaac and jacob but he's not saying that to jacob he's talking to jacob i'm the god of abraham and isaac and i'm about to become your god you're about to become my symbol i'm about to make you a product of the god that i am but i got to deal with you i got to talk to you i got a fellowship with you and i'm going to use you to prove what kind of god i am uh jacob poor old jacob his name said it all he was a deceiver so planner wasn't he he was a bad boy amen but you know what in all of that deceiving and trouble there was something in jacob different than he saw jacob desired that birthright and he didn't know really how to get it but he knew he wanted it he knew it was worth anything and much more than anything else so whenever jacob amen actually meets the angel on the river that night the bible tells us amen that jacob got a hold of something that he knew was god oh there's a connection isn't it with abraham and jacob now he knew it was god dealing with him he knew god had come by the river you know what he said to him he said i'll let you go until you bless me i'll not i'll not just let you come and leave this meeting i'll not let you just pass by and not fulfill your wishes and your commands upon my life i want everybody to know you're my god i want to be identified with this kind of god and he held on the bible said unto that angel the angel said let me go he said i won't let you go till you bless me and the bible said they wrestled unto the horizon of the sun now i know i know sometimes that people will say to our young people i've seen our young people up laboring in prayer you know they're praying and they're asking god for help and they're praying and people are going so well just going back to your chair now there's no need and all this stuff you know just going back and everything will be all right it's okay listen if that young person is desiring an experience with a living god there had to be an experience first you couldn't desire it if there wasn't something somewhere that could fulfill it abraham couldn't desire the change unless there was a change somewhere jacob could not desire a blessing unless there was a blessing somewhere and he held on till he got what he was looking for and i'll tell you some people the reason they push this away they push the entertaining of the angel away is because they never entertained the angel they don't know what it's like to wrestle with the anointing until the anointing conquers you and you know you know you're laying there and you're arguing with that and you're saying well i know i need to forgive my sister i know i need to forgive my brother i know everybody needs forgiveness and lord i really want to serve you but i got to get revenge before i serve you i got something i got to do i got a little issue and you're wrestling with that thing but you're holding on to the angel at the same time because you do not want him to get away so after a little while the anointing begins to conquer amen it begins to conquer the old flesh called jacob after a while the conquering power of the anointing begins to move on you i've never in my life been able to fully grip it but i could only imagine when an angel pressed him in the thigh and he walked away and the angel said there you go you got what you were after but i can't call you jacob no more i'll have to call you israel i'll have to speak of you as israel because there's been a change the name jacob cannot represent you anymore you you're not the same person after this angel after this anointing after this has come you're not him anymore you can't even walk the same way if you wanted to maybe jacob walked in certain crowds and he tried to hide that experience he tried to hide that he had been laying with an angel and wrestling in the power of god he tried to hide he spent all night in prayer but he couldn't do it his walk was revealing it his stagger he walks in the room somebody said what's wrong with your leg did you fall off your horse no no well tell me what's wrong well if you're going to press me i'll tell you i was up at the river last night and the power of an angel came by my way and we wrestled all over the bank until i was muddy and wet and stinging and all of a sudden he pushed his thumb and my thigh and he made a promise to me and i tell you my name now is israel i am a prince with god he never was a prince brother he never was a prince andrew remember joseph come out of them loins amen it was a power of god that moved over him they said what he did joseph amen jacob got the feeling of that and god left there with a new identity he was being known as the god of jacob have you ever noticed that that whenever god goes to moses he introduces himself and he said i'm the god of abraham i'm the god of isaac and i'm the god of jacob his name ain't been jacob for years why is he introducing himself to moses as jacob why didn't he introduce himself as israel why didn't he introduce himself to moses before jacob because moses was a runaway prophet moses was a failure moses had made a lot of mistakes moses was up there hiding from the very call of god that was upon his life and god had come and found him and of course by now moses that stuttering prophet had begun to give up on the idea that god would ever deliver he began to lose the thought that the holy ghost would ever really deliver and come out in his life you see what was going on is while he was back there living under his failure living under his weakness he was not fulfilling the call of god but god had a call anyhow brother william and when he called him he said i'm the god of abraham i'm isaac and of jacob and the name jacob was the god who came to the man who was a failure and a deceiver an irreverent man but god could come to him anyhow let me say something to you tonight amen you might have been hiding from god you might have failed god in your call in your walk in your christian life but he's the god of jacob tonight and that god has come down in the church to introduce himself as the god of jacob listen as the god of jacob god would introduce himself he knew him as isaac he knew him as jacob now it was amazing to me how the scriptures are written because it's not very far from here when you're studying this line of thought you'll come across one where god will introduce himself upon mount carmel and up on mount carmel there's a people now there's an 11th hour people who was with a with with elijah on mount carmel but the name of baal has been so lifted until the true children of god had been pushed back and baal was being worshipped instead of jehovah but elijah was there for a showdown so he builds himself an altar and while this altar is being built he builds it according to the word and then he backs up and he said now let it be known today that the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of israel he doesn't call him jacob on that mountain he doesn't call him i wonder why he don't call him jacob on that mountain he called him israel because elijah is talking to god's enemies the god of baal and the prophets of baal and he will not reveal the weakness of jacob to the enemy he's talking to but rather he covers him and calls him the god of israel let me tell you the spirit of elijah amen in this day did not reveal your secrets to the world but he called you by another name to bring another grace over your lives you see where it's at tonight the god of israel come over you this is the same god this god of israel is the god of elijah oh i tell you i know about that god of elijah this god of elijah was a god that rang the fire down on the mountain and a group of people saw it and they began to scream with one voice god is god those people that saw the firefall was a type of the believer that is living today when they saw the fire of god they begin to say he is god because they knew him by the manifestation of the spirit of god you know what he did brother he didn't leave that quad up there on the mountain it was coming elijah's time to leave the scene god was fishing to carry him so what he did is he sent him on a journey to find a young man remember what he does he goes down there and finds elisha who's working and he goes by and drapes his mantle over him hey man and all of a sudden elijah jumps up and starts running after him he said what did i do to you go back to your about your mom and dad and go back to your work and he said no as the lord liveth i'll not go back you know what he did he went and burnt his oxen he went and destroyed all of his his former works and began to study and follow this man elijah now he began to follow him and one day elijah made him a promise and he said if you can see me when i go he said you'll get a double portion of the power that rests on me well i'll tell you after that day they went to different places they visited different schools they went to different theological centers and some of them said to elisha well this is far enough you shouldn't go any further than this and elisha said well as the lord liveth as the lord liveth i'll not stay here for my master will be taken from me you remember what he said they took him down the school of prophets and they said well this is a good place to stay brother bam said theology wasn't a good place to rest he said elisha couldn't be satisfied there because he had already seen the power ministrated he'd already seen the power of god so elisha wouldn't allow he meant that to stop there he was going to follow it until something changed now look what he'd done he followed him all the way down to the jordan and one of the greatest acts of elijah was when he took off his robe and he slapped the jordan river and when the jordan began to open up and they walked across the jordan on dry trop when they got to the other side there were chariots of fire that were tied in the bushes all around the banks of jordan and elisha watched as his master elijah went over and got into one of those chariots and let's say you know up through the air they went and they started going up into the sky as they were disappearing from sight now could now listen it's not a that's not disney this really happened it's not disney this really happened a man in a chariot of fire flying up through the sky and there was a man watching it happen he was watching his master disappear but there's something there's something coming all of a sudden the mantle that the man wore begin to fall on the ground in front of elisha now listen elisha didn't go grab that man off of elijah elisha didn't go up there and say well it's about that time and grab the mantle off of him and begin to try to make himself something no sir he let the mantle hit the ground he let god's servant and then he let that mantle hit the ground now watch what he did he didn't just go out there and walk around that mantle and say y'all god sent a prophet to the age god sent a prophet and he said this and he said this and he said this oh i tell you god sent elijah to us and we all seen the miracles of whoa glory god said amen you see what it is he meant after a little while of watching that he knew he was to pick that up he knew god had anointed him to pick that up and he walked over and picked that mantle up off of the ground listen to me now this bride today is not taking anything from elijah the prophet they are receiving what a prophet gave them they are receiving what elijah sent back upon them a mantle of the almighty god and when elijah picked up that mantle he walked over to the river now look where he started he started with the prophet stopped we had already been through three of those pools he started in that third pool he walked right up to that river brother andrew and he slapped that river and he said where is the lord god of elijah he didn't ask where is elijah he didn't ask can elijah come back and fix this problem he said where is the god of elijah and the waters begin to be parted because the god of elijah had stayed with the message of elijah and i'll tell you something tonight there's a bride that has received the message of almighty god and the very god that's with this message is the same god that was with william branham in their meetings the same angel is still in the house of god in the last days let me tell you this people say to me where is the god of elijah i'll tell you what he's here and the god of elijah is right here in this building tonight the god of elijah's here satan's trying to block your blessing but the god of elijah's here satan's trying to stop the entertaining of the angel but the elijah's god is in this building tonight the same god that was back there is the same god that's right here tonight let me tell you brother bam tells us the story of how elisha moved right on he said he moved right on and and remember when the shunamite built a little a little room by inspiration sometimes you do things and don't understand them but she just wanted to entertain the angel of god she just wanted god's prophet to be welcomed so she built him a little room but one day while the prophet was laying on the bed he said go get the woman and then the woman walked in the room he said let's say the lord you'll have a child and then in that barren womb you will produce a child remember that and that elisha gave her a baby because it was the god of elijah walking through elijah's ministry it was not a different god a few days later the child began to die remember what did they do with that child they brought him right back to the bed where elisha had laid and prophesied of the coming of the child and there was a revival of the child it was because god the god of elisha was still alive let me tell you something tonight that same god is still alive in this building it ain't been too long ago brother nathan erickson came to the church and him and cheyenne and they told me sir brother wayne we've been to the doctor and they have told us that it's nearly impossible that we could ever have another child it's just nearly impossible they said but we've been believing god's going to give us a boy and we just want to believe and of course you know what that is the rock and roll up and down up and down month to month are we going to have it are we not going to have just like this amen one day we were down uh down in i believe it was last june we were down in nathan bryant's meetings and we were preaching there and the holy spirit came in that building and the end of the service we had a prayer line and in that prayer line now it's not about me it's about these prayer lines and then and there was there was people sitting there in jeffersonville right right next to jeffersonville where nathan is and there was elders in that meeting that had been in those meetings in branham tabernacle in brother graham's prayer lines and they said brother nathan the same atmosphere that was in them prophets and prayer lines was in that prayer line tonight it was the same feeling in that building that was in that feeling back there in the 60s when the prophet prayed after we prayed brother nathan come to the prayer line that night he said brother wayne i want that baby and we laid hands preyed on him and sister and we go down into the we go down into the recesses of the office after the meeting when we go down there we're just sitting there weeping in the presence of god nathan walked up and he put his hand on his desk and he looked at me said well wayne it's done it's done tonight god has just touched our body we're gonna have that baby brother wayne and you know what hey man i don't know when's that baby do chris huh it's due next month amen that baby she comes over to the house there's nothing like seeing a woman walk in the door that they couldn't have a baby and they come walking in oh i tell you it's one of the prettiest sights you ever saw because the life that they're carrying came from a miracle working almighty god i tell you he's still the god of isaac isn't he come on where's david in this building tonight he's the god of isaac didn't he if there was no god there's no isaac in the days of abraham without god there was no isaac and tonight without a real god brother david there's no isaac but he's the god of isaac tonight because the supernatural god came on the scene now listen this stuff don't get a long ways from my brother adam said i'll prove to you he's the same god of elijah he said a barren woman come up in my prayer line the other night i laid hands he said we've just now dedicated the baby i tell you i love this i'll tell you what it's one of the greatest days of my life to sit here and tell you this a few years ago zechariah married anna sitting right over there and they was trying to have babies and problems started coming up i don't remember the i don't remember words well enough but some people were telling her that she had a certain problem and she wouldn't be able to have children maybe and just hereditary or something and it went rocked along a couple years i don't want to expose too much but maybe about three miscarriages was it three it was two miscarriages and they they were trying and trying and trying and brother ron had come over to our church in october meeting and then turned around and come right back in may which was odd usually he came every october and he said i got some unfinished business and he come over there and he was dealing with some things hey man but while i was sitting there i was sitting there praying for that for zach and anna and all of a sudden they got up and come out to the prayer line and we were standing there we started praying for him and brother ron he just looks up at him the oddest look and he says i believe he's speaking directly to anna and he said you're going to have that child sis god just showed me you're going to have that child well i'll tell you from that moment now i could go around and say brother ron said she going to have that baby i believe that with my heart i believed it but in september i think it was i was out working on a grader at brother wendell martin's church and while i was grading i was listening to a tape and the presence of god just came in the in the in the greater with me and god confirmed to me in my heart i'm gonna give you that grandbaby which is what which is what prompted in february two years ago i was here some of you seen the clip and i said i'm to be a grandpa and the whole crowd looked at me kind of funny y'all remember and i said now i don't have a pregnancy test but i got some faith and i believe i'm going to be a grandpa and brother ryan is sitting right there and he says to me what what did you say exactly i don't do you remember what would you say that's thus saith the lord you're going to have that's let's say if the lord you're going to have it and he was sitting right there and he said it and i turned around and did what i did i said now what did you say brother he said that's let's say it the lord you're going to have it and all of a sudden amen the spirit of god again just functioned like that well a few days later we go home and and then we're we're at the house well anyhow one year later when i come here we come here with a pregnancy test and a little picture announcing we're gonna have a baby amen now i'll tell you what by the grace of god we brought that baby the very next year and she just had her first birthday that's little evelyn marie right there can you stand up with her anna now that's pa paul's sunshine right there that's peppo's baby right there yes ma'am she knows who she's talking to that's papaw's baby right there you know why i got that baby because god is the god of elijah he's the god of abraham he's the god of isaac and he's the god of ron spencer he's the god of dwayne lawson he's the god of full gospel lighthouse he's the god of william branham he's my god tonight he's not just a god a million miles away he is our god and he deserves to be praised he deserves to be worshipped he deserves for us to
