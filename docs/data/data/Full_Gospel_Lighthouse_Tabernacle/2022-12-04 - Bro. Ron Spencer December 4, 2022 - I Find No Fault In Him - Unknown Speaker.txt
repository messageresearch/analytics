of talking going on but we'll we'll see thank the lord we made it thank the lord we made it amen and amen God bless you if you'll turn with me in your scriptures this morning Luke chapter 11 and verse 17. I'd like to continue the thought of no fault and I'd like to look today at two books every one of us have two books there was an old and there was a new that was awesome amen Luke Chapter 11 and verse 17. brother Stephen has already sung my sermon now I'm going to preach it to you Jesus now but he knowing their thoughts what a statement right there but he knowing their thoughts said unto them every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and A house divided against a house follow if Satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand because you say that I cast out Devils through Beelzebub but if I by Beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your sons cast them out quite a powerful twist therefore they shall be your judges but if I with the Finger of God cast out devils no doubt the kingdom of God is come unto you when a strong man armed keepeth his Palace his goods are in peace but when a stronger than he shall come unto him and overcometh him he taketh from him all of his armor wherein he trusted and divided is false he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth notice these next verses when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places and seeketh rest and findeth none and he saith I will return unto my house once I came out and when he cometh he findeth that swept and garnished then goeth he and take it took him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last estate of that man is worse than the first that is why we must have the Holy Ghost you have a need this morning I'd like to just if you just lift your hands before the Lord and let's just take it to God and say Lord come by and meet my needs Heavenly Father we love you with all of our hearts we have already felt Jesus in the room this morning what a day that lays before us as Sons and Daughters of God lord we ask you to come by and touch every need touch every heart touch the sickness of the people that have been sick this week and those that are that are have great needs and are at home we ask you that you'd stretch forth your hand of mercy and we pray this upon the authority of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amenity man let's have church amen you can be seated the scripture says in Romans chapter 8 in verse verse 1. verse chapter 7 talks about it divorced from our first nature talks about the old man being dead but in the next sermon or the next chapter he preaches and he starts out with this sentence there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit isn't it wonderful I read this the other day and I thought it was good and I'll bring it to you during the national observance of the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor I was I was stuck struck by the great emphasis of a number of immigrants who had often left their behind their country behind Coming To America with nothing but their clothes on their back they risked their lives for something that they valued more highly than everything that they left behind freedom they did not take their adopted country's hard-won freedom for granted neither do must we their experience is a picture of what we must do when we come to Jesus Christ we must forsake our alliance to this world and its Allegiance leave behind all that it offers and become citizens of the kingdom of God the kingdom of God the stature of Liberty is in the form of a cross the statue on New York Harbor lifts up her lamps beside of a golden door the statue of the Liberty on that Hill called Jerusalem lights up our way to eternal life Hallelujah we today stand here as redeemed we are not what we were we are not identified with the old nature anymore we have become divorced from that nature we have become changed and we stand here as new creatures in Christ Jesus many times we look like the same fella that sinned and did all those evil things while we were alienated from the Commonwealth of God that though now we're maybe gray or in her head our shoulders are a little bit more stooped our walk our gate is a little bit slower but there's a new king that's living on the inside of our heart our tongue doesn't speak the same our mind doesn't speak the say think the same our eyes don't look at things that we used to look at our feet don't carry us to bar rooms and dances and all different kind of things of the world but it carries us to church we become leaders in our homes women become real pastors there to where they teach their children the things of God children grow up in an environment not of drinking and cussing and fighting with moms and dads but they grow up in a home of Prayer they grow up in a home of an environment of peace when they go to school they hear a families that have great difficulties we're not those families but if those families had Jesus you see the difference is more than just a message the message is Jesus Christ revealed it's more than books and tapes pictures on the wall but it's a tabernacle of the Holy Ghost living inside of our lives Jeremiah says in chapter 1 and verse 5 before I form thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou cameest out of the womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations it was more than just Jeremiah but God watched over you in your mother's womb he watched over you all the way from Adam and protected your seed and if he could do that for thousands of years how much more can he help you today Jesus is preaching to Nicodemus Nicodemus being a secret believer the scripture says in verse 2 of Chapter 3 of John the saying came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him now Jesus turns Jesus answered and said unto him verily Burly I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of heaven kingdom of God God strictly spells out in several different places of the scriptures there'll be no idolaters in heaven there'll be no fornicators Heaven there'll be no murderers in heaven there'll be none of those kind what a place that that's going to be like there'll be no line there'll be no cheating there will be no Stealing In Heaven there'll be no adultery in heaven there'll be no murders in Heaven There not be a hospital there there'll be no need for a courtroom there will be no jail cells there what a place why wouldn't you want to go to a place like that Luke chapter 14 and verse 16. then saith unto him a certain man made a great supper and made many and since since servants at supper time to say to him that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they were all with one consent begin to make excuse these people were qualified Jesus is making an analogy of going to heaven these people were qualified but they made excuses there will be people that are more smart than you better looking than you have greater education to you have more money but they made excuses why not to serve God and the first set I bought a piece of ground and I must need to go see it and I pray that you have any excuse and another said I bought a five auctioned yoga box and I must go prove them and I pray they have an excuse and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come foreign came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servants go out quickly into the streets and the lanes of the city and bring them hither to the poor the man the heart and the blind he found us he found us in many cases we weren't qualified Hallelujah Brother Ray he found us he found where you were at and he gathered us to the table and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said go you into highways and hedges compel them to come that my house may be filled and I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper let's just look at it just for a moment with the woman at the well be qualified in many of the circles of the Pharisees and the sadducee I dare not the woman that washes Jesus's feet I dare say not a a naked preacher cursing using Blasphemous names that will will will will will literally try to cut a man's head off with a sword I'd say he wouldn't be welcoming the circles of the Pharisees or the Sadducees because in their circles they wouldn't be qualified Hallelujah watch this but you're just but you're just then did it in condition to find Jesus he's talking about Zacchaeus he said when you lose that reputation that you think that is so high and so classy and everything you're just about getting ready to find Jesus when you get that starch that has been taken out of you that is when you're getting ready to find Jesus Zach just said uh I'll get up in that tree before somebody else comes so he climbs and twists and he gets up in the tree and finally gets up there no that limb won't hold me and he looks there for two limbs to meet and he come to a place right there's the place where it meet me a good solid place that's the place where you sit that's the way meets you yours and God that's where your change comes and he sets down on the limb setting there garbage stink all over him splinters in his hands a businessman of the city Zacchaeus a great man but he's determined to see Jesus but his determined to see Jesus God can get you into some horrible shape sometimes but if you can get away get determined to see Jesus you'll see him and sometimes we come with a lot of garbage on us we got a history to us the prophet says here sometime ago they had the religions of the world to meet he said I was reading it in a book they had this little lady Maccabee from Oklahoma that was arrested out there might have been Tulsa or one of those places she's running through the streets driving stage coaches smoking a cigar breaking the speed limits with a stagecoach and all the religions of the world raised up and told their part of their religion how great it was the Muhammad priest told how great his religion was Buddha told how great his religion was a certain Minister I can't call his name now was represented the religion of America Christian Church when he got up at time for his platform he told the story of this great foul woman how low down that she was now she couldn't want nobody wanted her to be around her to even get so close to her they would turn and feather her she was immoral she was so degraded there's nothing that could help her and he said Gentlemen of the religions of this world and what your religions can produce can anything that you've got cleanse the hands of this vowel person everybody set tight set still right on the hands of their seats no one said nothing then jumping up in the air screaming and kicking his heels backwards and forwards he said the blood of Jesus Christ won't only cleanse her hands but it'll cleanse her heart and make her pure as a lily the blood of our Jesus Christ takes away sin and cleanses us from all of our iniquity and makes us creatures of Christ Jesus nothing else will do it Creeds won't do it former religion won't do it nothing else will make your play take its place it takes the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah Eve tried to hybrid the word in the beginning God told her the day you eat your thereof that day you die she tried to breed it with knowledge that Satan Giver and when she did she lost that whole human race to the devil when she tried to mix God's unadulterated word with knowledge it doesn't come from knowledge of the world it comes from the power of the Holy Ghost it is not by power it is not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord that's how God does it God's word is a seed of eternal life and you try to hybrid it let me just say this when you try to polish God's word up and bring Hollywood into it when you try to make it to where it will fit with the Society of today you hybrid it and take the life out of it he said that'll kill it it won't mix no more like oil and water won't mix it will not do it they have never in all the way tried to find anything better than God's way of doing it you know they've never found a way better than for a chicken to be born into this world than to Peck its way out of its shell we're country people we understand that if you if you let him pick his way out he'll live if you try to break it and make it easier for him he will have the strength to live it's the same way with the Holy Ghost birth you got to die out to yourself it's not by shaking a preacher's hand it's not by joining a church you'll go right back into the world the same you come and you'll be nothing but a mixture but when you die out to yourself brother Ron but I never smoked I never drank I never done anything in the world you're still as much all have sinned and come short of the glory of God you still need a new birth in your life where you pray to that old nature that old self Will dies out a real death to worry that first king of your heart dies and the new King Jesus comes and lives on the inside of your heart I'm afraid too many lazy soft suit watered-down preachers want to soft soap it so much until where there's no dying out anymore that's why churches look like the world walk like a world talk like the world but we need to die out to our own nature men of God we must display a life a life worthy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ let me just say this to you it comes to a point to where you can say from that time that point where you met him that anchor where something changed in your life every one of us will have a different experience and there's no way for us to explain a supernatural experience of God how did you get it well I really can't explain it it happened he came and when he came it just changed my life maybe you're standing on the street of Victoria when your life gets changed maybe it's on a Wednesday night that your life gets changed maybe it's a Saturday night after a service last night and you just know I'm not the same man no more in a moment of his presence it changes your life let me just say this to you whether you're the banker whether you're the lawyer whether you're the king you still need Jesus mother Brown goes down in pig island he walks through and he meets a man that's laying in the ditch he's a drunk and he began to ask him where it all started and he said he started out with one little social drink now he's lost his job he's lost his home he's lost his family and he finds himself in pig alley that man was standing before eternal life we don't have the end of that story but he was standing before a chance at eternal life let me just say don't miss your opportunity don't miss your opportunity in Hell tonight there are people that would love to take our places the celebrities of hell would like to have one service like we're sitting in today they would give it all up [Music] Jesus had a Rich Young Ruler come near him had a good home had a good family you can listen to it in leadership brother man who said he had a good father that taught him business had a good mother that taught him the word of God he had all the fundamentals down but he came to the right source of eternal life and when Jesus saw him he loved him Jesus loved him but he told him and told him said sell all that you have and give it to the poor and come follow me that was too much that was too much how many people have said in our churches all across the world and because of the rigidity of the life I don't find it hard but a lot of people find walking this way difficult but I want you to understand what brother Ron but it's difficult to dress like the sister's dress well I don't dress like the sisters but they become ladies ladies of society real queens walking on the Earth now we don't have to make our sisters we're not reformers Wesley and them were reformers they had to reform but we're Transformers we preach in the word and the word transforms your life listen it's easy when you get Jesus it's easy it changes your music it changes your lifestyle it changes what you watch changes the friends that you're with well brother Ron I'm afraid I'll lose my friends listen they're not your friends if they're leading you to hell they're not your friends [Applause] when the money runs out you'll find out who your friends are when you're no longer supplying the droughts you'll find out who your friends are when you're no longer drinking their booze You'll Find Out Who Your Friends Are a little girl was carrying her Bible in the school the biggest bully of the school came up to her and was making fun of her and she said I believe that I have more power than you do he laughed and made all manner of fun of her and she said carry this carry this and that's six foot six bully went to church where she went to he was so drunk he fell in the hedges when he walked into the build of about 12 people he found his way to Jesus Christ that man become a real Christian let me just save this to you when you find the real reason to live I'm afraid we preach way too many funerals where people have never lived they live 50 60 70 years but they never lived if you don't live for Jesus you've never lived I want to talk to you about when you came to the Earth sometimes I don't think this is fair but this God makes the rules when you're born you were born shaped in iniquity the sins of your father was automatically on you they were passed down from the generations and all of their nonsenses now you're guilty of because you're born of sexual desire and sexual makings and now the sins all the way since Adam through your heritage are you're now guilty of let me explain it to you if I'm going down the road and I'm doing 90 miles an hour and the law pulls me over and gives me a ticket then my son is responsible to pay for it I don't know who it would be it doesn't seem fair that the Bootleggers or the dope addicts of the family or the illegitimacy was pulled down into your life every family here had a lot of nonsense in your history so don't put on no wings right here every one of you were born in sin every one of you had a past book in your life and there was a lot written down on the inside of there and we were guilty we were guilty and had we died in that condition we would have went to a devil's Health but God rich in Mercy God rich in Mercy it wasn't by your Deeds it wasn't by your goodness had a predestinated seed that he elected in you before the foundation of the world it's kind of like a credit card when God rich in Mercy saves you it doesn't give you the license to go by consume we're not making Grace a disgrace it's just like a 25 000 credit card bill you'll never pay it off you'll never pay it off just paying the little bit that's the way the devil will do to you just try to reform yourself a little bit and just pay the minimum off you'll never get it paid off it's not designed that way but somebody came and paid your debt for you God left Heaven's glory and came to the Earth and died the sinner's death and God sent him to hell so you wouldn't have to go there when God takes us through the Old Testament when you think about the characters the outstanding characters of the Old Testament their names their life actually probably less is mentioned than his setting in this building but what if Rahab been welcome in the local church what a and a murderer named Moses be welcome in the local church what if David that took his best friend's wife and had a child by and it caused death to come all through his family would have Esther who hid her identification that she was a Jew but unwelcome at a lot of churches God who is rich in Mercy had a prophet to stand at an auction and built on a harlot and know about the critics stood there and said look over there the old preacher has come to the auction today and it's not only here but he's bidding on a harlot but God sent him there to tell him what the church world was like and that God had Redemption for her you ought to be preaching with me right now you ought to be preaching with me right now aren't you glad that in our condition God didn't look at what you were he was looking at the seed that was on the inside of you and it was like a deep calling to the deep and there was a deep to respond to it um mm-hmm Jesus turns to Simon Peter and he said Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you I'd like to say this to you Satan would desire to have our young people but we've made a declaration you can't have them but he says I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not foreign now he's been with him help me he's been with him for three years three and a half possibly you would think that Peter's converting most people sitting in church for three and a half years they assume that I'm converting and Jesus said you're not even converted yet foreign laying before this statement Peter's going to deny the Lord Thrice he's going to use abominable cursing that would condemn him to hell Stay With Me Now he's going to grab a sword out of the enemy and try to cut his head off and then Jesus is going to tell him get behind me Satan because God's Got A Plan and then he takes that man's ear and puts it back on his head and heals the man I don't know how that man can continue to be the critic of Jesus Christ after you see a phenomenal Miracle like that lay it on the ground and he puts his ear back on him and he and he's still is a Critic of Jesus Christ don't tell me how can you but Jesus didn't look at he knew his future but he didn't look at his mistakes aren't you glad tonight that when God looks at you he don't look at your mistakes he don't look at your failures he looks at your sacrifice [Applause] that ought to be a United unanimous hang on the chandelier moment God don't look at my mistakes God don't look at my face past present and future God looks at my lamb First Corinthians 6 and verse 9 know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators or adulterers our idolaters are feminine or abusers of themselves with mankind that's talking about Sodom if you really want to know nor thieves nor covenants or drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners or shall inherit the kingdom of God and search where some of you I want you to say that statement with me and search where some now look at your neighbor and such were some of you this time I want you to do it with your finger with you just like that right there I'll and search were some of you you know what you did you just pointed three fingers back at yourself [Applause] always remember when you're pointing your finger at somebody else three of them are pointing back at you you just outboarded yourself notice what he says but you are watched you're Justified but you're sanctified and you but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the spirit of our God Ezekiel 36 and verse 26 a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you cause you can cause you to walk in my statues and you shall keep my judgment and do them I want to just tell you this with God we have a red jury this is a completely rigged courtroom Jesus Christ became our lawyer our judge and our jury let me just think about this just for a moment what a difficulty that Satan must have you know let's just have a feel sorry for Satan moment so okay let's have a feel sorry for Satan moment then we're going to beat the fire out of him so here is he's got all the history of your forefathers and he's got it all written down he's kept Good Records and you've been a lot of nonsense in your life and then one mountain in his presence in the presence of Jesus Christ he takes all of that and erases it [Music] and then God says when the accuser of the Brethren comes up to him and he tells him all your thoughts and your failures and God says let me look at my book and he looks through the blood of Jesus Christ and then Satan says look at here and Jesus says look at here and Satan turns the page and he says look at here and Jesus said look at him [Applause] a man walked up to me in the in a funeral one time at the at the at the gravesite and he was standing there and he said I heard you preached something wrong this morning Preacher he said you know the almighty God can't find your sins he said he's God he can remember everything I said huh I said do you want a God Like That does your God remember all of your old nonsense I backed up from him and I said the woman that you've got standing beside of you you're living with her and I said you've been divorced twice yeah I said you better pray for a God that don't remember and here you're telling me that I'm wrong you better pray that you meet the God that I have that can take away your sins that you're not guilty of your history I don't want to know your history I don't need a five-hour conference with you to you to tell me all the nonsense in your life and to take me through Tin Can Alley all I want you to do is meet Jesus Christ and I'm talking about meaning and dying out of your old nature and getting filled with the Holy Ghost and get Washed by the Water of the word and get a change in a Sanctified and filled in Holy Ghost life and you come under the new identification that I'm not that man or woman anymore I I've been changed my identification is not there anymore I am a new man in Christ Jesus give him glory Los Angeles I think this morning give him glory in the house of God giving praise [Applause] I've been changed have been washed I'm not that man anymore I'm not that man anymore oh wow Hallelujah if you don't know Jesus today whether you're here in the scene audience or in the Unseen audience won't you just let him come in your life I'm not talking about a picture on the wall I'm not talking about a storybook historical Jesus Christ our Prophet would have been a murderer if God would have permitted it a man that could shoot holes with his shot with his gun literally one shot after another shot God would have committed he'd he'll kill six boys he'd have killed him standing preaching and the angel tells him he'll have a trial tonight and a man is making love to a girl and the angel said do with them what you will brother random could have spoke him out of existence but he said I forgive you he's in a little home he's telling a story about squirrels and a woman sitting across the room said that's absolutely the truth brother Branham brother Chris right there raise your hand brother Chris has the table or brother Branham ate those squirrels at he's actually got the table in his office came from Charlie Cox this ain't some makeshift you can't just make this stuff up but from that table brother Ram goes back home and tells that woman that's literally living with her mother and father and has a sister who is an invalid whom brother Branham said I prayed more prayers for than any other person and when she responded that's absolutely the truth she stepped into the rim of the third pull she stepped into a realm of the third pull remember the woman in Memphis she spoke a storm into existence that brother Brandon would be there for her son dying brother Graham said she used the same power that Jesus spoke that storm out of existence I got a point I want to drive here and had he stepped into a realm and he said whatever you desire whatever you can have it she said what do I ask for you can have all the money you're poor you're gonna have all the money you can have different things he presented to her and she spoke something into existence that was greater than all the third pull put together greater than a storm greater than brother branham's wife tumor going away right before the doctor in a surgery and she spoke spoken word Eternity for her two boys [Applause] what about your children what about your children what about your children you heard it last night more than the voice of Andrew more than the voice of your pastor what about your situation written in the new book the acts of God on the inside of you Billy Andrew said if there's only two boys in heaven those two's going to be there what about your children on the internet what about your children Adam and Eve could have had spoken word Sons but they stepped into the realm of sin and they came by the Fallen nature which put you under the first book but what about the second book when we speak eternal life it's what we're doing here this morning we're speaking to sinful flesh and telling you you don't have to stay that way no more you can have Jesus the same Jesus that lived in the prophet but the random couldn't die for himself but he could die to himself brother on I'm still struggling with things in my life just give it to God pray just now Lord Jesus no doubt there's 90 percent Christians real Christians dedicated here [Music] to steal the humanity Razzles Spirit wrestles because Satan can work on two realms you can work on flesh and he could work on spirit [Music] down on the inside or Satan can't get to a place about the size of a button eternal life lives there and it controls our flesh and our spirit and maybe there's a Warfare going on right now Maybe by an uplifted hand they could say brother Ron remember me remember me [Music] oh God [Music] if we give it to Jesus in
