amen god bless you we love you we're so proud of what god's doing in your lives and and we're so thankful there was brother jason watkins and brother matt and they send their greetings and so we'll see them soon too so amen i think they're coming back for our labor day meeting that'll be wonderful got word this week that brother david iverson is now a full-time pastor many years ago i sat with him at a had a little little lunch first time i ever met him and i just i just told him i said you'll be the pastor of this church and and now he's been the pastor for a while and and now he's full-time pastor and so so we just don't know where to say congratulations or or what right there but we're certainly proud of brother david iverson in belgium and now i i had an interesting thing with brother david i went and visited with him and when i was there and i went to his home and they were kind of in a three-story apartment it was kind of just how it is and so when i walked out i put my hand on the wall and i said god if it would be your will i ask you to grant them a house of their own and they now live in a house of their own and it was by a miracle of the lord and so we're just so thankful for that amen brother jonathan curlette let me know this morning that he's up in uh and it's gone but he's baptized his son 12 years old along with a couple of others and so he's just really happy and amen many years ago we were able to have a meeting there at brother harold's and and god just allowed things to be spoken to him that he would be used and so this morning he sent me those pictures and we're so happy for him as well amen this morning we we want to go to prayer and have a special prayer for sister karen pruitt sister karen is the queen in louisiana then our nation may not recognize it but that's what god called her to be the queen in louisiana and she's in dire need of a miracle and things are looking very very difficult and but we know a god that knows how to take care of difficult situations might i bet bear in mind with you just for a moment that four weeks ago i even told brother tim told my family that the lord woke me up and then waking me up he he spoke to me these words storm is coming storm is coming storm is coming you know i didn't sleep the rest of the night god not only shows us great things but he shows us difficult things but if he would tell us that a storm is coming he's reminding us i'm with you i'm with you i'm i'm with you we're not in hollywood we're not writing a childhood story here you know where everything is happy ever after but we have a god that made a promise to us i'll be with you i'll never leave you amen i'll never forsake you when all others have given up hope i'll be with you i want to remind you and i apologize for taking this time and even in both realms but i i want to say this to you when jesus was walking with jarius and his daughter he's at his last end to come to get jesus and he's willing to do whatever to get jesus to his house jesus told him to fear not and he looked at him and said fear not and even when they came to tell him that your daughter has died it didn't change the story with jesus it didn't change the story last year when i spoke we must get to jesus and then the following week we went to louisiana sister karen was in a brain bleed situation there we're in a much more dire situation even now but jesus is still the same he says absolutely the same so i would like for you if you would if you would join with me in prayer this morning and i want us to pray and i want you to pray from your position as a believer because that's where you have authority as a believer and i want you to talk to god right now amen almighty god we bow our heads before you even now [Music] lord we bring sister karen pruitt brother tim before you now as we've done so many times [Music] you're reminding me this morning that last year spoke the meeting on a must get to jesus [Music] now father there's nowhere else to turn to when doctors do all that they can do [Music] only the high physician [Music] can move on the scene now father you've known our past you know our presence and you know our future now satan you take your hands off of god's property she's a daughter of god you've done your best to destroy her [Music] god has an answer and you're still god today father and i asked you to step into her room right now as we pray lord we're an outpost here we raise our flag father in the name of jesus christ i ask you that you would send your word and heal and raise her up according to your word you have a plan you have a desire and i ask you that you administer right now strengthen brother tim lord lord and ask you now that you would just come on the scene for every need that might be lifted not just here but also in edmonton [Music] around the world now father you're a great god it hears and you don't just hear it you answer it every prayer you answer

father give me strength help us dear god we pray in jesus name we ask you amen and amen and amen amen god bless you god bless you we love you with all of our hearts this this day amen amen isn't he good to us isn't he so good to us amen amen if you will turn with me to john chapter 8 and verse 31 amen we love you with all of our hearts in john 3 8 31 and verse 32 then jesus to those jews which believed on him he said these words if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free verse 36 he says if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed you don't have to turn there but trust me romans 8 and verse verse 1 i'm sure they'll put it there quickly there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death you may be seated today very familiar scripture revelations chapter 5 and verse 2. and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne and when he had taken the books the book of redemption the the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vials full of orders which are the prayers of the saints notice these next words and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hath redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign upon the earth amen and amen and amen i'd like to just speak to you for a bit this morning i have found my freedom i have found my freedom against a backdrop of chaos kind of a complex thought but i want to convey it to you today is for americans we celebrate our freedom thank god for the freedom that we have we're losing it quickly but thank god for the freedom that we have we we raise our flag fireworks went off through the night last night and and uh we raise our flag and we are americans brother brandon said many things about us being americans and how that we we are entering our glory and we're in and our shame we're americans and we we have been able to have a prophet to come from this land and a message went forth out of her and and through that we've been able to send the message around the world especially brother harold's brother harold's group sent books by the millions to out throughout the earth and even when i was a young man coming into the message i grew up in the message but i didn't know jesus but when i met jesus and i became free i began to read those books many of those books would have three or four messages within a book and uh they was just powerful still in my study today but but we stand with freedom we we thank god for freedom but freedom comes with incredible cost young men have to go away to war they're they're at war and we as a nation we only had our civil war which cost literally tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands of people's lives i don't think they'll ever have an exact number of how many lives it took but let me just say war is war is when two demons rise against one another challenges whether it's a people or a nations or whatever they are we realize that we're coming to the end of all wars it's coming so we must enjoy our freedom even as we speak here today our freedom had a great cost to be a christian came at great cost to have the life of jesus living on the inside of us cost the greatest preacher the greatest king the greatest man that ever lived on earth the most innocent precious lamb of god god came to the earth to manifest and destroy the works of the devil and to proclaim that the prince of this world is judged and when he was on the cross he was redeeming every one of us i want you to know no man could save himself no prophet could save himself our prophet of this day could not save himself he was born of sinful flesh he couldn't even pay for his own sins much less the sins of others god had to take a redeemed man and give him a redeemed word that would be able to preach to a redeemed bride to get her ready for the marriage supper of the lamb and the rapture it came at great cost must remember we must remember i i i found this the other day and it just spoke volumes to to me if the son has made you free you're free indeed during the national observance of the 100th anniversary of the statue of liberty in a new york harbor i was struck by the great emphasis of on the number of immigrants who had often left everything behind coming to america with nothing but the clothes on their back they risked their lives for something that they valued more highly then everything that was left behind freedom amen they did not take their adopted country's hard-won freedom for granted neither must we their experience is a picture of what we must do when we come to christ we must forsake the allegiance of the world amen and leave behind all that it offers and become citizens of a new kingdom the kingdom of god his stature of liberty came in the form of a cross the statue of the new york harbor lifts her lamp beside the golden door the statue of liberty on that our hill is outside of jerusalem lights away to eternal love no one braves the treacherous journey to america in order to live as a as they would in their homeland likewise christ did not leave glory and suffering agonizing death so that you could live anything less than absolute freedom hallelujah our money tells us that in god we trust our nation has forgotten that but we as christians must never forget as i spoke last week on hold your position never forget who you trust in there's some fights that we're going to have to struggle with some spiritual wars some physical battles we're going to have to battle faith versus wisdom intellectual ability sometimes faith has to look at the unseen and the unproven things that you cannot explain some things that you just go it's in god's hands but you have faith that god's going to take care of it some way somehow we must remember that as christians we're no longer a slave to the world sometimes when we talk about slavery we think of of different races of people but i want you to understand to the world everybody's a slave just the conditions are different the egyptians became slave by circumstance in egypt but god had promised him the deliverance he promised them a deliverance there's where i would like to start this morning when moses is standing there before the greatest phenomena that ever happens he's standing in a red sea with a rod in his hands and the people begin to grumble and complain with good matter and reason by the things that you see they are getting ready to see a very complex miracle they have believed a message they have been let go out of egypt and they begin their journey and they come to the face of the red sea are you with me now and i want you to remember god had hardened pharaoh's heart and pharaoh turns all of his military loose and he sends them forth leading them to destroy the children of israel two million people let me just say this to you in the face of freedom if we could look the backdrop of that is the greatest army that has ever stood ready to destroy them in a moment's notice if only they can get to them [Applause] but god sent a pillar of fire and held them at bay while he could open open up a basically an ocean for them to be able to walk across on dry land in the phenomena of a phenomenal miracle to set them free from their slavery and set them free from the economy and the politics of egypt god has to hold the enemy at faith come on church for the believers you've got to anchor your soul in jesus christ behind every great story there's a backdrop caleb tells the people that we're more than able to take the land we're more than able god's dropped this in revelation i've been here 40 years and the promise is still true and he tells the people with victory in his heart you've heard these 10 spies tell them that how big the giants are and how horrible the conditions are but god's more than able he's more than able to take us through sure there's giants sure there's great adversary there but god's greater than that he's made us a promise he told abraham at the tent how make your seed possess the gates of their enemy wear his seed [Applause] [Music] amen to summarize abraham is a very complex story abraham's the richest of any any around you may not see it he looks like he's traveling like a nomad but god's with him sometimes whether you realize or not you're the richest in this world i'm not talking about your billfold your checking account your ira or whatever you've got but you've got jesus [Applause] and it's beneficial to your not only you but your family your children's children your children's children and there's a blessing that is pronounced upon them are you with me companies are blessed because of you this nation continues to be blessed because of you your prayers your prayers are you with me holes at bay the enemy holds at bay pestilences and torments it holds at bay bombs can't drop on america they're coming but they can't drop till you leave so men can build bombs and let me just say this you they're not just building them to put them in a warehouse they made better swords they made better knives they made better guns man is always evolving they made bombs and they made hydrogen bombs they made atomic bombs they're not making them just to store them in a warehouse or to make a threat it was like israel a few maybe a decade ago they had their enemy was going to try to overtake them they just simply pulled all of their atomic material planes of war fire out put them right on the air bases so the enemy could see them israel is determined i'm not going to lose a war they're determined i'm not going to lose a war are you with me they're not going to lose a war it's been promised that they'd be here jesus is coming back to that city one of these days they're not going to lose a war i'm going to tell you this gets to biting today i want you to know joe they're not going to lose a war you better take her aside she's not losing and i want to remind you as believers we're not gonna lose the law we're gonna stand and fight for our god-given rights our promises are the word of god we'll not lose a lord [Applause] first john chapter 3 and verse 7 let little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous and as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil but the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil and whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteous this is not of god and neither he that loveth not his brother we will destroy the works of the devil that's what we've been sent here to do in this age brother brandon makes a statement it just just burns on my heart even now he said the whole burden of all the world rested upon him calvary the dark hours of gethsemane laid before him and all as as he went he never noticed their scoffing what a background that's right you know when someone says something evil about you you want to take it up and get angry about it just shows you haven't went deep enough yet with god big men don't do those things but what made him god to me he was big he didn't have to notice their little scoffing he had a purpose what a background it was many years ago i was laying in my bed and i was i've been contemplating maybe for days of you know brother branham tied the loose ends together and he would go and grab from this and he would grab from this commentary and he'd grab from this this teaching of this man or this teaching from that man over there he'd go back into the 1700s or back martin luther or he would grab from wesley or he would grab from other great writers he would grab from them and they always kind of kind of made me kind of mind-boggled of in his short life how did he grab so many things that were so powerful and i went to bed that evening i had my hands behind my bed and i my head and i was just i was laying there and i have a collection of books it's uh it's a c c h m set of books and i think it was written in the 1800s maybe and it was a gift to me many years ago as a minister and i was just i was just laying there and the lord impressed on me to go to my library and so i went to my library and i knew you had a plan and they and these thoughts on my mind how did brother branham get certain things or how is he led or you know you just can't read volumes in a short lifetime and i'm standing there before it and i'm impressed to pick one book and i just opened it just like that and i let it just fall open to a page and i begin to read that page and and the writer is saying jesus's atmosphere what's so powerful amen he was so powerful until when he's standing before pilate the backdrop was the whole nation was screaming for his blood and they were screaming and only days before miracles had happened and miracles but they came under the realm of the demons of hell to kill jesus christ are you with me a few days ago they're screaming hosanna to the king but now now listen rights is no new thing the devil has stirred riots forever but that don't make god nervous [Music] i don't make him nervous and jesus is standing before pilate and all of them are screaming crucify him crucify him and it's literally mind boggling how they're screaming against jesus christ and the writer said jesus's presence was so deafening till he never heard the mob amen amen he was in control amen standing even right there before pilate and he has a conversation with him to which he would remind him of what kingdom he was from my kingdom is much more powerful than this one you think about where we are today when jesus was here israel wasn't even governed by jews amen when we think about his greatest moments he's literally in the hands of a roman government your freedom came with great cost with every demon in hell screaming at him trying to destroy his body we're praying for sister karen today but her healing her freedom from that stroke was paid for 2000 years ago and satan was full bore trying to destroy that body beating on it but satan couldn't realize the more he beat the more he set free we still need his healing touch we still need his miracle working power today to set us free from cancer to set us free from tuberculosis to set us free from the mms to set us free from anxieties of the world freedom came at much cost but it is paid for it's paid for [Applause] brother brown said one day when adam's race was backed into a corner the law had failed justice had failed prophets had failed the judges had failed everything that god sent to the earth had failed and adam's race stood defeated sickness among them death among them everything the death horrors in every place nothing could be done but in heaven there was one that stepped out the son of god and said this day i give my life for adam's race what will you do cried the angels what will you do he came to the earth he looked upon the bunch of men and women that wanted to serve the lord they couldn't there was so much temptation and so much sin and so much sickness and so much troubles on every hand they couldn't everything had failed he looked till he was found in the darkest place of man's field and that was death it's always been and he ran right to calvary and got the thickest spears and throwed him into his heart and cried back take what i leave you the baptism of the holy ghost and fight as hard as you can i take it as a mandate and i take it as commission of the word of god we won't be and we won't bow we won't turn back we won't give up we have been commissioned by the holy ghost to preach this word with all of our hearts jesus has the answer to every need that you've got brother and i mean if there ever was a time when those disciples picked up the baptism of the holy ghost one of the mightiest weapons that's ever been given into the hands of men and they cut a hole today through sin they defeated the devil and running him back with sickness and all of these things men wants to see heroism men are waiting for a gallop to stand the world's waiting to find a man who can step out what about you wherever you're listening to this sermon i heard a sermon one time and said lay aside every weight in the sin which just so easily beset you amen i was sitting in about 1500 people when i heard that it impacted me i didn't wait on somebody else to get the answer it impacted me what will you do with your life and what will you do with your 24 hours it's not about how much money you have i probably couldn't have afforded anything at that point but i want you to understand i committed my life i have preached with great passion through all of these decades now i have preached with great passion i have not been i have not bowed i have not turned around i've been preaching this message all of these years [Music] in the backdrop that is behind me even now i don't stand with fear storms come storms go on down into the regions of the demons on down to the very gates of hell he knocks on the doors of hell and when he did the devil come out and they said i can hear him say oh so finally you've you've arrived i thought you i had you when i killed abel you see when the seed was promised in the garden of eden the devil was constantly trying to destroy that seed and death and the death of abel and the coming of seth was just a death burial and resurrection of christ that's the seed must continue he tried to destroy it i thought i had you when i destroyed abel i thought i had you and i destroyed the prophets i was positive if i had you when i beheaded john and now after all you've arrived and i've got you now and i can hear him say satan come here and he reaches over and he grabs the keys of death hell off of his side and hung it on his own side i want to serve notice on you you've been a bluff long ago and i am the virgin born son of the living god and my blood is still wet on the cross and the full debt is paid you have no rights no more you are stripped give me those keys and he turns around and he gives them a good healthy kick and slams the door together and said stay in there i'm the boss from now on i like it when god reminds the devil i am the host i have the keys of death hell and the grave and you are nothing but a bluff here he starts up and where is job and where is abraham where are they at where are those fellows that trusted god in his word has he forgotten them did death annihilate them what was the what was the after all never never god has to keep his word and i see sarah and abraham walking around there and after a while something come the door abraham goes and opens up the door and he said honey come here look here look here the very same one that stood with me under that oak tree that day he's abraham's god and jesus i can see daniel over there over his shoulder and say that's the rock that was hewed out of a mountain just as certain as i'm standing here i see job raised up and said that's my redeemer that i see that lived that i knew and lived and someday i would stand upon the earth my body may not be but a little spoonful of ashes but i'm 15 minutes i'll be in and again that's him ezekiel looks over the top and said i see the same person as a will within the middle of the wheel turning way up in the middle of the air then enoch says i saw him coming ten thousand of his saints to execute judgment there was the old testament saints waiting sure they was under the atonement of the blood they could not go in until the presence of god god of heaven because goat and sheep blood could not take away sin but he said my brethren i'm the one that you think that i am i am the one that you think that i am you may be trapped in abraham's bosom for all of these hundreds of years look at the backdrop but today you are free [Applause] um the other day i was riding through my woods on a golf cart i needed a moment i was riding through the woods and this is going through the woods i just stopped i said lord i want to talk to you i want to thank you that i'm not even the same man that it was before you met me and i'm going to say some very deep things right now man that was born of charles and charlie and christine spencer that blood runs through my veins but it could not keep me amen because i was born of sin and that blood would have only taken me back to the earth and would have taken me into the realm of lost and all of their weakness i was i was sharing with the world life of party alcoholism the wrong kind of associates and friends the wrong kind of desires i was driven i was driven with a drive inside of me to go as hard as i could into the world you see i've been raising the message but i didn't know the author being raised in church is one thing but when you meet jesus when you meet jesus with a supernatural birth and let me just say for these preachers that want to explain a supernatural birth away you have admitted yourself this is more than a formula this is more than some recipe this is more than come under some preacher's anointing or some kingdom anointing this is more than any of that this is meeting this message is jesus christ himself that's not going to rapture your books and your tapes and your pictures he's going to rapture human flesh that he's come to dwell on the inside of us and yes you was a stinking caterpillar that nobody wanted but god by the transforming power of jesus christ [Applause] didn't just make you over he made you new [Applause] thank you so i thank him that i'm not the same man that's right that i used to be where'd he go he died i think sometimes we must think about those things it used to be you had a taste for beer a taste for wine taste for drugs takes for the wrong kind of associates when i come to jesus i'm going to have to leave so many friends oh no you got that wrong they're going to need you whether you realize that cool beer that you're drinking it's destroying your brain cells that drugs that's made you high today you'll need more of that tomorrow than what you had today to make you have and without jesus you can't keep your vows when you say i do oh you may now cheat with another woman but because of your lustful nature i'm preaching now you'll be a porn habit backslidden rotten human being that'll corrupt your wife and you'll fall right to your children come on that's why you need a new birth you can sit in a church view without a birth and you're still as rotten as you ever was but when you meet jesus you're free and you'll never be the same the rest of your life i must admit the man that sister connie married is very disappointing to me now but i want you to know the one that he became she can be proud of [Applause] we occasionally have some real conversations at our house maybe you don't have them but in the backdrop of what we're facing we have to have real conversations this ain't hollywood saints this ain't a fairy tale someone sent me a note the other day said it must not be as bad as what they say it is i just send them back a note glad it's not you [Music] you see i just had an eye seizure before i walked into the building this day you see satan is always at attack but i can preach with one eye as good as i can preach with two brother timothy pruitt was here with us the other day and he said something about sending a cannon fire said they were looked like they were crushed and was telling them to give up and so i responded with cannon fire so that's what i've done i'm only responding again with cannon fire this morning edmonton you may not have watched all the services in the last year and a half but i want you to know i've stood at my duties sometimes hanging on to this place many times not feeling like preaching but you got to look right square in the devil's eyes and spit right in his eyes pull it short against him and tell him he does not have that victory over top god is greater than cancer you see god is watching over everything there's a purpose in your life many years ago i was sitting studying in edmonton it was on a saturday i was studying at a little little tiny desk in the the hotel room i don't remember the the year i haven't conferred with matthew about this but i was sitting there and as i was sitting i saw a vision i saw a vision of matthew sitting beside the side of the road rubbing his knee and i saw his motorcycle on the mountain as and the wheels were still turning i called him brother matthew if you'll stand just now he's our song leader here now he's a preacher here now you see satan would like to destroy you because he knows there's potential inside of you but though i might be whatever two thousand twenty five hundred miles apart everything's just right together so god chose me the vision of matthew and iraq and i just i just called him i said how you doing good you know you can answer without telling everything good so we talked for just a couple moments and i said how was a wreck well he knew nobody knew but john that used to come here and he would have his shirt unbuttoned down to here a long bushy hair he called john you know you'll meet him again in heaven but god would have it so that he would give his heart totally to god the last service he was in [Applause] he said that nobody knows cassie knows cassie's you know andrew knew well then boys are inseparable so how was the wreck and he began to explain it to me hit a rock hit some rock in the road and the bike went one way and he went the other way he said how's the knee had his hand on his knee at that point he said well brother ron what does that got to do with it god was showing matthew amen i see you i see you i'm preaching a meeting for your congregation brother ed brother harold and that boy is on god's mind and he would have never told me had god not showed me that bite's gone now he wasn't a song leader nor a preacher at that time but god was watching over him give the lord a good hand brother shannon you were sitting at a table with a lot of bottles on your on your table but you're not that man anymore but that you might know god's got you where you are because there's a seed there you've been having a question about it there's a seed there and he's caused a lot of backdrop behind you but he's got a purpose hallelujah he's watching over your life he's got a hold of it amen he knows exactly the situation that's going on in your life how you know god spoke to me on that deal i was walking across the road with brother timothy pruitt the other day we're going across the road and and i just shared with him something that would be maybe of a little answer i said brother timothy i was kind of looking at kind of where i'm at and god took me to a quote about caesar and he was going to have a parade and he was looking for somebody to ride with him and all the officers got their their their all of their brass ready polished it their plumes ready they got everything just right and caesar makes a ride through them and he finally comes to a man that's got all kinds of scars on him really rough shape and he asked him where'd you get those scars and he said i got them in the battle for you my lord that's right amen and he said you'll ride with me amen god dropped that in my heart here's my consolation we might have to go through some very difficult things but god is telling us you're right with me can you give me just a little bit more to preach to you brother branham says these words he said oh he said trials come churches gets all shook up and gets so easy for a congregation to do when something don't seem to happen the way that it's supposed to do god makes a way god brings tensions into a church for every son that cometh to god must be tried and proven and tested listen to these words he let sickness strike you he lets diseases come on you to test you to prove you to show the world that you're truly the seed of abraham he permits it by his own will he permits disasters he permits at the friends to turn against you he permits all of these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you he'll do all but take your life he could throw you on the bed of affliction he could turn you over your your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you he could do almost anything and it's god's will for him to do it amen and we are taught it's more precious to us you're talking about a backdrop i've been preaching to you over the last few weeks praising him in the storm amen are you with me now it's not an easy thing when you go through a storm and it looks like all hell is turned loose on you but i want to remind you god's got an anchor for you when your bank account one won't hold you and your insurance won't hold you and the world turns against you you can hold on to god's word let me just say a few things here before we go this message that is so phenomenal amen let's just remind ourselves it was preached to us behind two world wars a battle in korea vietnam starting up it was delivered just after a depression industrialization begins to take off music begins to change from the good old boy hillbilly singing to rock and roll and all hell being turned loose through the beatles and elvis presley and those people that begin to let me just say they were inspired of health that might hurt your feelings but they should not be your hero to start off [Music] with brother brown points those spirits out seven visions comes forth i don't have to take you through it but adolf hitler would lead germany to world war ii let me just say you didn't need an ambassador we had a prophet to tell us we're getting ready to go into battle the world war it would tell about leaders that would hang and come to a shameful death call them out by name not wishy-washy call them out by name i'm never ever ever amazed at people that will go back to a man like nostradamus and say he was a great man and could see vague things he wasn't accurate on anything but you had a prophet of god in this day that called people by name their address the condition that they had what the doctors told them their children their children's children tell them where they live and yet people will set and question brother branham well i got a better idea or cut it apart or slice it apart who are you what vindication do you have stood there and told him about adolf hitler told him he told them about how the cars would be made like they are now we're even advanced to that so it's already fulfilled you don't have to wait on that it's already fulfilled when you see a tesla going down the road that that fulfilled that vision very well still with me also told us of women getting the right to vote are you with me then told us about a woman of purple are you with me now and the other day when you saw an inauguration she stood there in a purple [Music] dress i don't know if you paid any attention to your news this week that her staff don't even like to be around her of how cruel that that woman is listen she slept her way to the top go ahead go ahead and send it out on the media she slept her way to the top to become the governor of california she slept her way there let me just say don't you put your trust in no politics i'm not a coward i will preach in an open public pulpit where people will get behind a computer someone another and send out an anonymous text sodom and gomorrah is here against the backdrop of a gender that don't know who they are they're fighting for their rights brother branham stood there and preached the seals and then and went to almost seven times around the world and preached the message against the backdrop a martin luther king and this nation almost upside down and people being washed by fire hoses crawl listen all men were created equal we got no problems with none of that all men were created equal god's blood pays for every sin let me just say god will clean the worst harlot the worst homosexual and worse than all of that is these religious demons he can wash all of that away and set you free the book of revelations is written and we we read six phenomenal scriptures in the book of revelations it's our book it's close to the close to the minds of denominational systems around the world that have tried to open the book billy graham tried to open or roberts tried to open it many men tried to open it spurgeon actually had enough sense to say men leave this alone a prophet will come and reveal this warned all of these preachers don't fool with the book of revelations it is for a prophet to come and open up at least she had that much observation but let me just say this to you in the backdrop of all of that john was in the worst prison on the isle of patmos had been boiled at all it was known as the worst prison that there was and in the midst of all that backdrop he could write i was in the spirit of the lord's day i heard behind me a voice and i turned the scene and i fell in his feet it's dead his flesh was in prison but he was enjoying another room notice the scriptures and i see a new heaven and i see a new earth yet standing in prison oh i'm trying to behave i'm trying to behave there he may have been in a backdrop of the worst prison that there was not being fed well wasn't clothed well but god was giving him the greatest revelation ever given to man and god sends a prophet not out of the schools of humanity but his daddy's a bootlegger as a teenager brother branham would have been a murderer had the gun went off they had to change their name from uh six letters to seven letters because his daddy was on the run from the law so brother branham could not be proud so much of his mother and father and their earthly descendants but he met jesus neither was you neither was you i don't talk too much about the negative but it doesn't take long for you to search your family heritage to know you were a stinking rascal you were rotten you were this absolutely rotten roxy you were wrong ed hammer meister said he was a little boy listening to the brother harold sleeping sitting up against the wall but now operating as a pastor of the church god had a plan maybe even his family didn't believe it but god had a plan are you with me now god's got a plan for your life he's got a plan for your life what you may have thought was a mistake in your life god used it as a glory i'll never forget when i first met you sister connie should never forget that i'll never forget it satan whispered in my ear said she'll never believe this you talked about what a mess your life was remember that remember that conversation it's been a long time ago you're not even the same woman that's set back here you're not even that woman what happened jesus i could go all across this audience brother jim spent time with me telling me about his mom and their past the wrecks and moving this and moving there and moving here moving there moving here and moving there then he meet charlene is that an accident oh no oh no children had to be come forth you see in the lamb's book he knows you're coming you know there's things you can't understand but solomon had to come out of david and the sibo and against the backdrop of murdering a man solomon is born maybe you've even questioned your life and wanted to walk away if you could have reason things out how can i how can i possibly be his child just trust me you walked into a service you probably thought i'll never believe that and here you are decades later amen maybe you walked into this service today and you thought i'm just going to come through visit set through the service and think you know well this is just something i'll do to kind of see people or do this and you come and god speaks to your heart and he begins to explain and goes back through all the backdrop of your life and you look at the mistakes and you look at the failures and more than a preacher has discerned your heart and you sit and listen for about an hour and it wasn't a man it was god he can take care of your past and he's really interested in your future you see i'm not guessing now i'm on target and i'm taking my time it's kind of like sitting at the hospital waiting on a grandchild to be born you know it's coming you just don't know how long it's going to take and i'm preaching and watching god move and just waiting for the right time for you to get it is that all right is that all right sometimes our services are an hour hour and a half sometimes two hours sometimes two and a half hours who orchestrates the service he does you know sometimes we or even have the ability as humans to shake it off and go back out eat go back to our routine and then when we're preparing to lay down he begins to deal with us again amen you see he knows your future because you don't know you he knows your future while i'm waiting i want to share a story with you i was preaching in florida at a meeting and the lord woke me up and said go home today well my flight was tomorrow and so i called the airline and i told them my situation i needed to go home today i don't know who it was it must have been an angel on the other end of the line she said i've got you fixed up she actually asked me this words what time do you get out of service and i said well i'm going to preach till about one o'clock she said well you'll be able to make it to to orlando by three and so we'll we'll have you fly out of orlando at three so that should make it good and you'll land in charlotte and then you'll get home this afternoon somewhere around nine o'clock well i i told the pastor i walked in and i sat down at the pastor's office when i sit down in the pastor's office i set him there and and as i was sitting there i i was sitting with him and i i just i'm gonna i'm sitting with him and i'm just sitting he's behind his desk and i'm just sitting there with him and i said you know the lord woke me up this morning and and he told me to go home today and so i i've got a flight this afternoon it's three o'clock i'll meet someone to drive me to the airport and he said okay well he said well we had a big dinner for you planned this afternoon all of our people were coming together we had a big dinner planned this afternoon he said we had some things that we want to do with you in the morning i said well i i feel like i'm done with the meeting i feel like my purpose is over here i said but i do need to have a conversation with you and he said okay i said how long you been dating your deacon's wife [Music] you know that's a real man-to-man conversation the guy that drove me to the airport became the pastor of the church i got to charlotte and i walk off of the airplane there's two kids sitting there crying they're about in their 20s and they're just sitting there bellowing and crying and so i see them and i think well that might be why i'm here and so then i'd walk through the airport and i go i go get something to eat at charlotte airport and i sat down in a it's a huge place to eat there here come these two kids and i said lord if i'm to speak to them have them to walk right by my table and would you know here they came right by my table they walked over and sat down at the table and i said well that's why i'm here so i got up and i walked over and sat down with them and when i sat down with them i i just started talking to them i said you know this morning you don't know me but this morning i woke up and i said god told me that i needed to be here and all i know is i'm supposed to sit at this table i don't know you you don't know me but god has orchestrated all the events of today so i could sit at this table i said what do you need from god i had introduced myself and he said brother ron i've been looking for god i'm a bartender and he said somebody handed me a tape and i went home and i put it in my tape recorder and i tried to go to sleep and when brother branham said good evening friends he said i set up and he said that's a prophet he said i've been on a trip to colorado and i didn't find god i've been over here and i didn't find god and he said i'm sitting in this airport looking for god and i said well god's orchestrated this day he's orchestrated the service brother doug he knows how to orchestrate a service and have it in complete control because his see his seed against the backdrop brother donny you remember the day that you walked down this aisle and you said if i if i serve the lord it'll cost me my marriage i said god's greater than your marriage now years god's been greater than cancer for you he's greater than everything that there is wherever you're at you think well i'm doing my own thing god's watching over you and against the backdrop of everything that is facing against you it may be a horrendous storm it may be horrendous circumstances just like that young man at the table that day they give his heart to god and his wife give his heart to god god's got you in his hands he's got you in his hands i stand here free man today and i proclaim i'm free i don't know the future of sister karen but i know this i know the one that has it i don't know the future of the stands that i'm getting ready to face coming tuesday and coming coming in the

sedated coma for weeks god still got it he's greater than your problem he's greater than your situation and if i could call out to edmund tonight i don't know your situation but god laid on my heart to remind you you're free you'll have to fight to keep it but you're free [Applause] you'll have to fight to live it but you're free this word is your anchor when there's no other anchor in the entire world this is your income i want to proclaim to you today we are free glory to god we are free this blood has set us free this message has set us free [Applause] don't let no man put you in chains

hear me now as long as you believe what he's whispering in your ear you can't be what god wants you to be [Music] hallelujah hallelujah almighty god we bow our heads before you across this audience now captivity is a really rough thing having to live somebody else's desires is a really rough thing having to live under satan's lies a really rough thing he wants to make a slave he wants to make a prisoner he don't mind us coming to church as long as we don't get deliverance but the deliverers hear us this morning the captive has come to set us free today we have a liberator that's in the camp hallelujah the sound of jubilee trumpet has sounded and we can go free we don't have to live under that bondage another day i'm free i'm free today lord whatever the situation is from individual to individual no one's a lock no no trial is a lock no situation is a luck but god you're the answer to every one of them father [Music] just like goliath he could roar until david came into the camp

atonement of your word father search across this audience just now and we want to remind you satan you don't have the keys to your own house so you can't have this one you tried to corrupt us 2000

into the living room and we as a family would begin to pray [Music] the light came so strong in the room it was like a huge spotlight came into that room she confessed her sins to you her life changed
