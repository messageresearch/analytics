announcement that and I'm sure several of you have heard that camp meeting has uh now been uh cancelled for this upcoming week so we want to pray for brother Joe and their Church there uh they look forward to this and this is the second year straight they've not been able to have it for many years now and that's a disappointment for a church you know when you prepare and you you plan and make preparations so so we want to be remembering them uh I want to just go over some some just housekeeping stuff maybe this evening if y'all could just bear with me in all of it and as you've all seen we have new chairs so we thank the Lord for that we see there's a vision that's coming forth here and and there might be a couple more empty chairs that you can see right now but we're claiming prodal prodal to come home and we plan on filling every single one of them with all those prodal coming home so just bear with us as you know we have tried to set out as many as we can and they've given us a kind of a guidance of how that they could be set for the most of their ability so we we tried their best and uh if you don't like the the arrangement I'm sorry that was on me so blame me amen so uh I hope you enjoy them the the pews that we have or had was uh was well used there was a lot of uh lot of hide burning that went on in them pews so over a period of time they has to be changed out and then also there was stuff that you shouldn't want to be sitting over top of under the pews so I ask you to respect the chairs that we've provided here don't stack wads of gum underneath of them please respect the house of the Lord there was a w of gum about the size of a softball pulled out from underneath one of them your sins will find you out praise the Lord so that's what some of you were sitting under that you didn't know was there so we're glad we moved it just in time amen so please respect the the chairs that we have if you see someone putting a pencil down inside of the chairs please let one of the deacons know I mean in the cushions part so that they don't tear them up they were not cheap and we didn't have to take up a soup kitchen thing or a big yard sale to do this the Lord has provided so we thank the Lord for all of that we thank the Lord for everything that has been done around this church from the front of the the church from the gates all the way up we had the the gates done several years ago by Brother D Jackson brother Dwayne Jackson there at brother Joe's Church the outside buildings was removed from off the property to help look at nice look nicer the

Connie is going to come through the prayer line for sister Karen and uh we just want to pray want to create an atmosphere where the Lord would just feel absolutely comfortable to be here in the building this evening amen maybe you have a need on your heart you'd like to just take it to the Lord and say Lord Jesus come by my way tonight we pray Lord Jesus we love you with all of our hearts and we ask you just now that you would move in a mighty way Lord we invite you we ask you to forgive us of our sins and our mistakes and our failure and tonight now I just ask you that you would anoint this word in a very Supernatural way guide our thoughts guide our words the words that lay before me are already anointed now we ask you that you'd speak to our hearts father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen if you will turn with me to Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 and then Isaiah chapter 59 they asked me to speak at brother Tim's on Wednesday night and uh they kind of hinted at me on Monday that was going to go on and I begin to look at notes and just nothing seemed to to speak to my heart you know notes are powerful but you need inspiration and so I looked and I looked and I looked and Tuesday I looked and Wednesday morning I was starting to get desperate nothing seemed to come we were preparing to go to the church early after visiting sister Karen going to have a time of just a little bit of rest before the service and sister Connie was able to lay down and I was I was supposed to lay down as well but I couldn't lay down knowing that I needed something for for for that evening and so I was I was just sitting there and I was just praying I said Lord I need you to speak to my heart so tonight I want to speak part two of Wednesday night on this attack it's of the enemy but we have a response Hallelujah after this Mana pray ye Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen the angel told Mary when he was giv her the salutation for with God nothing shall be impossible can we say that together tonight full with God nothing shall be impossible let's say it again for with God nothing shall be impossible you may be seated this evening Isaiah chap 59 and verse 1 behold the Lord's hand is not shortened what powerful words that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear verse 19 so they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood now notice he's going to come he have his absolute right to come but now you have a response the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob sayeth the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them sayith the Lord my spirit is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed sayth the Lord from henceforth and forever brother brandom said this in a very short statement he said shamgar said I I am sick and tired of it every year the enemy came every year the enemy took most of his crop and only left him enough to survive on every year the enemy attack him and it would be about 600 men that would come armed soldiers that would come not just Jamar but people around even other seed of God but shamgar realized one day that he was a Son of God because remember God himself had said as MDC and as he sat there that day and he spoke to Abraham and he told him that thy seed shall possess the gates of her enemy if you remember where that actually was spoken he spoke that to Abraham after he was coming down from from offering Isaac his son amen God because of the victory Abraham's Victory God give him a promise that we as the children of God would possess the gates of our [Applause] enemy sir you brother Hallelujah he said I'm sick and tired of it I'm not a warrior the odds is against me no matter how much odds is against you God's for you if you take him at his word hallall sakaran is laying like a like a vegetable even now about nonresponsive for about the last 12 days other some than some twitches and those kinds of things brother Timothy sent me this on on Thursday we were in the room with sister Karen and and there was about 10 of us there we were in the room and as I slipped around and we were having prayer I sensed the presence of the Lord and I I I just shared with Timothy later that that the presence of the Lord seemed to be at the top of the bed and brother Timothy slipped around the bed and he said he could just feel him there we had already slipped away and we were going and we were we were moving out and and and uh I found it interesting that Esther was at the foot of the bed and his brother Timothy was standing there filled in that presence that presence moved and went right over top of Esther and Esther be to shout we're not alone in our battle when we're facing death and we're facing uncertain situations that lay just ahead of us we don't know what to do God's Sovereign in every situation but he makes a promise to us and it's still the same today I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the [Applause] world Timothy sent me this note today and I believe it's appropriate for the moment he said I'd been in there and been by her bed talking to her and i' had left to get Andrew he's not quite 18 but close enough he said that had been really close to him and Mom and and I got to talking to the receptionist and when I when I walked in brother Matt Dexter who is brother Michael Dexter's father was praying and you could feel the atmosphere that was in the room after he prayed we sang a little bit and the nurse came in to move uh sister Karen so we all went out and after a bit dad called us to the room for a prayer before we left and I walked around around her bed to where we stood the other day and I'd already been there earlier and I felt nothing but this time always like that but this time on this time I walked around and I felt such a presence till my knees started buckling I had to grab the bed to stay up it was totally unexpected almost an hour later he would say that his knees were still weak from that presence what an awesome God when it's out of doctor hands and out of humans hands it's in the hands of God and God has a response yeah come on are you with me remember she's a daughter of God she's a queen she's a queen in position she's still a queen her hosin is still going in her lungs she's still a queen we've got some Queens sitting in this building tonight they're Queens I'd rather be with them than any president's wife we talk about the ministers that are generals of the Gospel of Jesus Christ but you remember theyve got Wes amen they got wives that are that are great powerhouses and and let me just say this to you they'll stand there with us shoulder toos shoulder if you remember brother br and I just feel led to say this brother brandham as he was had his had his name called in that dream and he's walking and he hears his name William maram brandom and he begins to walk up up those steps toward Heaven he said I felt something under my arm it was sister hope and then it was Sister meia walking into that real with [Applause] you thank you Lord Brother said George Washington was persistent at Valley Forge all the odds was against him the enemy was across the river but after all night in prayer right and the American soldiers with no shoes on their feet about onethird of them had shoes and they crossed the river at Valley Forge through the ice and and the three musket bullet holes went through his coat but he had an answer from God I love that but he had an answer from God and there was no need of him backing down there's no need of us backing down tonight nothing could stop him then he crossed it because he was persistent he had heard from God and that's the way that we've got to be if God said so that settles it Daniel 12 and verse one and at that time shall Michael raise up stand up that great Prince which standeth for the children of my people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never since there was as a nation even to the same same time at the time of the people shall be delivered everyone shall be found written in the book I'm in that book and many of them that asleep in the dust the Earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt but they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the fent they shall turn of many to righteousness as stars forever and ever brother BR said every word of God is a seed and it must be that seed can be planted by the inexhaustible Fountain of Life I tell you what that's enough to shout about right there which is Christ the believer has to drink Beyond his imagination drink and push it out push out everything that you have need of CZ it's in you when you receive Christ and we are planted together in Christ and he is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life on [Music] hallu don't never be afraid to ask for big things I want to say it again don't never be afraid to ask for big things don't never be afraid to ask for big things you getting it not just to older people I'm talking to all of you tonight don't never be afraid we've been speaking on unle lied he don't want you to be some little old Petty juvenile he wants you to ask big things that your joy might be full you've heard it before I want to drop it again could you imagine a little fish about that big way out yonder in the Atlantic Ocean say I better drink just a little bit of this water I might run out that's nonsense could you imagine a mouse in that great big down there in the great big Garners of Egypt saying I I I I just better eat two grains a day cuz I might run out before summertime again that's nonsense if they had 1000,000 rats that size they' never eat it up if they had 10 had billions times billions ttimes of fish they' never drink the water up and how many times could we multiply you could never exhaust God in his [Applause] power in his mercies to his children he's the inexhaustable Fountain of Life on brother George Washington could be perseverant because he had heard from God and that believed that God was leading him to a victory for this great nation was with him so therefore Delaware froze over meant nothing to him no matter how much ice there was what the obstacles was still he could be perseverance because he felt he had God on his side are you with me I want you to understand tonight we can stand with our shoulders right back and believe with all of our hearts we're standing just before a resurrection we're standing just before a Rapture where our bodies are going to be changed in the moment and the twinkly of an ey people 2,000 years in the grave it's going to raise up in a well body Hallelujah so we should not feel like that we can ask anything too big for God there's nothing too big for my God Amen I heard this statement about prodical children a few moments ago no matter how far they've went God can go greater than your mercies and my mercies he can go further than your grace and my grace I think we ought this that's the angel of the Lord after our seed tonight let Chas him down let him chase him down tonight take God and His word brother on but I prayed and I prayed but just get into a position of prayer take your position of prayer this dispatch dispatch the angel of God to go after your son and go after your daughter and just tell him do what you got to do you do what you got to do you do what you got to do their flesh is important but you do what you got to do bring them home their souls worth more than 10 million worlds [Applause] how great it is that is when we can hear from God and rest assured that we're right in his Fellowship then there's nothing too great right there's nothing great enough that can stop that person man that's over amounted to anything at any time through any age has been men who believed in God and had faith in God and stood against the enemy on every side do you remember brother brandom had a vision it was tucked in his in his Bible and many people had wrote it out across the world about a vision of a little Finnish boy that had been hit by a car actually two boys were hit but that little boy had been hit by a car and he was dead and he was laying there bones sticking actually through his skin and he was laying there in a very morbid condition and God reminded him that that was the little boy the trees the soldiers the surroundings the people and when he realized that that was the vision and it was about to be fulfilled are you with me now listen I'm just going to fire paraphrase it for you he said you could have lined up every devil in hell you could have lined up every devil in hell and nothing was going to stop it from happening Hallelujah Satan has to witness that that's the truth he has to witness that that's the truth I'd say this to you the Rapture is getting ready to happen the resurrection's getting ready to happen all hell can't stop it oh hell can't stop it we were listening on our way to service this afternoon on what is the attraction of the mountain and uh we were we come to the part where brother brandham begins to talk about the events that happened in Arizona and he talks about the The Sword in the hand and he talks about when the Angels Came and and they came in a constellation and he said and they formed that that Wick and as they ascended up they formed a that wig that cloud said that cloud was made of angels wings and and he says and then later he would say that the angel the angel of the Lord told him to turn the picture right and there was Jesus and as I was sitting there brother R would after a while he begins to say now what was prophecy now it's history now what was prophecy now is history some of those things were foretold that they would happen since as brother brandom having a dream about the his gate how that when that gate would be they would tear down the gate and tear down tear up his front yard and the drive there and actually in the dream brother R sees himself hitting this man and he was a real smart Alec and he hit him and he hit him and he hit him he picked him up and hid him again and the angel told him said when you see this happening when they drive that steak down you avoid this am and go west and so and so when brother Brown sees that he goes west then he finds himself sitting there with a cocko bear on his trouser legs and they're hunting for halina Hawks amen you see as we have been saying over the last few weeks prophecy intercepts with time and as a prophet he's standing there and he's just being honest and he's telling us the human part of the story and I pulled it and and I pulled it up and I pulled that c that behead off of my off of my trouser and I was looking at it and I looked up and saw those Havalina Hogs and he began to run toward toward those HS and he heard a blast that shook the Earth that's as he's in that meeting just like we're in this meeting tonight and he's and he's standing there telling three kind of Believers the real believer the make believer and the unbeliever and he's telling them about these things taking place then he comes to the end of it and he says I've told you the truth and he comes to a spot and said now let him vindicate his word if three people if he can call three people in a row he'll vindicate what I told you to be the truth I finding it interesting that this [Music] audience has been graced by Thomas Brady that was sitting in that meeting amen and heard that promises and heard the truth and immediate believed that that was a Prophet Elijah to this generation and as he's sitting there his name is called his wife's condition in Jamaica that she's wrote him a about her feet shared with you you last week about this shared with it having trouble with her feet she couldn't walk having to be in a bed she sent a letter and he opened the letter and he read it if you're with a preacher would you just would you just would you just have them to pray and he was with several preachers but he didn't feel led to have them and he held that in his coat and he and he had it there of Sister Sister Brady's request God I knew it those stories were told and we would have a witness today that we've had a man stand in the pull pit are you with me this message is more than just Miracles that's right it's more than just doctrines but it's the same Jesus yesterday today and forever I would like to say this to you Satan knows he's trying to block every visitation that he can from you from me but there's nothing that he can do to block the visitation of almighty God your case might be like Daniel where you have to wait 21 days and God has to go back and get the mighty Angel to come and fight the battle don't you worry the mighty Angel's taking your case you were healed at Calvary you were forgiven at Calvary but you've got to make your claim brother I thought about the people in China as I would stand and preach to them about two years about two hours on we must get to Jesus sitting in cold damp conditions sitting huddled they came there knowing that if they got caught by the authorities they could be arrested and go to jail two pastors are still in prison now but to be to release one in September then one in November God give his family special bless don't worry god'll repay every bit of that don't you worry about them God God's got angels to watch over them God's a great provider he he will watch over them we may never get to go back to go to China again I'm sure we won't be able ever to I ever put my feet back on that that that country again but don't you worry the seed and the message got through and there's nothing that Satan can do to block that up I was thinking as I Was preparing today how much I would wish for those people to be in this building oh if they could feel these pews tonight during the service brother Murphy Wong as the power of the word just kept dropping and wave after wave after wave and he would just drop and fall across the pull pit and I've had to wait for him to be able to come to himself to continue to preach angel of God just swirling all around in that building and I would watch I would watch old women crawl old women old men crawl all the way from the back of that building all the way to front in reverence I don't want you to crawl tonight but I want you to have reverence before God some of the most phenomenal Miracles I ever witnessed would take place that prayer line would last about 6 hours that evening not expecting anything like that tonight but I'm expecting the same angel you're you're a wonderful audience to preach to and and I love coming home to preach to a wonderful audience and you may have to be sitting in new seats for for a service or two and it's kind of like getting a new tough toothbrush you'll get you'll get it ready but I want you to know we come with one thing in our minds we come to see Jesus and maybe your need would be like the woman that would that would make her way maybe she had to craw that's right but she said if I can only touch the hym of His Garment I know I'll be made well Jesus talks about the enemy then said Jesus unto them John 10 and verse 7 verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep all that ever come before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture right the thief cometh not but to steal and to kill and to destroy why would we negotiate with an enemy that all he wants to do is destroy our lives destroy our families destroy our homes are you with me today we realize that we're living in a Sodom condition and it's only getting worse and worse and worse on it's pressed upon us it's pressed on our children it's pressed in our neighborhoods but we were built to live in this age so God has overcoming power for you and I to stand like we've never stood before the thief cometh not to but for to steal and to kill and destroy but I am come that's it that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly sure Satan will whisper in your ear but you remember there was a enemy named Goliath he made a boast one day he had made many a boast but on this day he made a boast in the wrong ears Little David turned around and said you mean to tell me that you'll stand and let that uncircumcised Philistine defy the armies of the Living God Satan does not have a problem until [Music] somebody is built to respond his Nation his brothers his King yes sir had so much unbelief in a supernatural God don't tell me you don't believe in prayer lines preachers don't tell me you don't believe in a holy ghost that's got a real power in the side of it to transform lives those days are not pass but they're living you need to stand up with everything that's within you and believe in a supernatural God We believe We believe We believe that saying power one of these days will change our lives it'll change our bodies I don't care what the devil says come on that power can raise our bodies up [Applause] again Hallelujah but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep these are our promises that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them which sleep in Jesus Jesus will God bring with him our loved ones are step from that realm and we'll take a half a step that way and they'll take a half a step this way it don't matter what the critic says on that day they'll have three and a half years to think about that for the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord Brother Ron I don't know if I've heard from God you just did you just heard from God I don't know how to say it any clear and then he says wherefore Comfort one another with these words and I saw a new Heaven and I saw a new Earth for the first Earth Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people that's who we are sir and every nation has heard this message God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes Satan I want you to listen to this scripture RT as I quoted there shall be no more death that bee that's trying to whirl around sister Karen right now there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall be any more pain for the former things pass away brother Ron that's just hard to believe some of you were drunks some of you were dop addicts some of you were a lot of different things but you look back and you say that wasn't even me I'm not even the same person that I used to be come on Church this Earth that's rocking and shaking all over God has washed it in Noah's day he washed this Earth he baptized it with water and the critics were there that day they said there's no rain up there just stick around long enough then Jesus came and he bled on the cross and those blood drops left his body and he redeemed this sin cursed Earth and it's going to take his bride off of the earth and he going to remake it with a baptism of fire going to burn the SE off of this Earth and have a new Heaven and a new Earth just a couple more moments he took him up on the mountain set him down and he rebuked him again with the word of God he defeated Satan with the word of God showing that the weakest of Christian can defeat Satan with thus sayith the Lord it is written it is written it is written when the doctor tells me is cancer still there it is written by his stripes I'm Healed the doctor tells you all different kinds of things you just quote the word of God it's the most Supernatural thing about you it's God's covenant to you it is written by his stripes I am [Applause] healed there's no name at your disposal greater than the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Hallelujah the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures and he leadth me beside of the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the path of righteous for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me th th preparest a table before

hear your voice is that all right I want you to say it to where you hear your voice is all right who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor commonness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and he hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his trugs we are he Hallelujah C I want
