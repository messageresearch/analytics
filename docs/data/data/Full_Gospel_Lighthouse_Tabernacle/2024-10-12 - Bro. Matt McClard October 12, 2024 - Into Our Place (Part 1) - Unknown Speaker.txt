chapter 1 start reading verse 12 giving thanks unto the father who ha made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his this son in whom we have Redemption through the blood even the forgiveness of sin who is the image the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether it be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist he is the head of the body the church who's the beginning of the firstborn from the dead that in all things he may have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all the fullness dwell well and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to recognize all reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and ye that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works how many's thankful for this word yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through the death to present you holy unblameable unreprovable in his sight thank you how many loves that scripture now that thought in your mind that says you can't the word says He will that's good is it if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven wherefore I Paul and made a minister amen you may have your seats that's my buddy amen just want to take a text if I might by the help of the Lord of into our place into our place I believe each one of us has a place and nobody can take your place amen God ordained you to do something on the face of the Earth amen and it it's time for the Bride of Jesus Christ to come together to get into our place each one of you has a position that God has called you and nobody else can take your place your place is just an important as an next person your place is just in listen God sent William brandom for you to come into your place saints of God that's what this message came for amen it's time for the Bride of Jesus Christ to get into her place and let's go home in the Rapture amen it takes you to get in tune with God Amen not listening to your flesh not listening to your ideas but get in tune with the mind of God and this message of the hour is the mind of God and it's calling a bride into her place into her position that we may leave this earth I don't know about you I'm ready to go amen I'm tired of Co I'm tired to going to Walmart and having to turn my head I'm tired of it saints of God

yours let that sink in for brother brandom couldn't take my listen nobody else could preach Jonah's message but Jonah Jesus himself walking the shores of Galilee couldn't take Jonah's face it was Jonah's position and Jonah's come on somebody and Jonah's message to preach and I'm here to tell you nobody can take your position and it's your message to preach say of God this message is not just sent for you to say God sent a prophet but it's sent for you to feed on and become the very message that the whole world will see the effect of what the message did and it brought a bride into her place it called her from a denomination over here it called her out of the slums of the world over here it called her from a ball store over here it called her from nowhere but she came when she heard the voice and the voice is still calling to today and it's calling for you to come up higher come on it's calling for you to come higher I don't care if you've been sitting in a message church for 40

evangelist leave me alone this how I go you can't sit on Instagram you can't sit on Facebook all day every day you can't sit on ESPN come on somebody I know that's where you live I understand but let me ask you what is going to take you in a Rapture is the information that you're feeding on going to take you in a Rapture or is there a god that's been convicting your heart before brother Matt ever said anything come on somebody listen it's a mouth of two or three Witnesses on Tuesday he convicted you and I know Wednesday I got one too stupid thing on smart as it is how much time has it stole I know it hurts but it's all right it's time to come A P set it down for 15 minutes set it down for 15 minutes say Lord You've getting convicted me come on you know every story that's been going on you know everything that's going on and everybody else's life but do you know the master that's standing there all the time saying will you just give me 10 minutes I can do more listen if Abraham if if Moses could have more in five minutes time what would 10 minutes a double portion a double portion would set this Bride In Motion sints of God it's time we give back our time to Jesus Christ and watch us go higher give God his place Lord I pray this prayer right now Lord don't let us be hearers of the word only but father help us to be doers come on somebody come on help us to be doers I know each one of you I'm pray I'm saying this for me too Lord there's too much time I waste on that thing but father let me get in my prayer closet let me read my Bible come on somebody let me sing praises let me just raise my hand and give you praise for where you brought me cuz I'm not who I used to be you took me out of that place and you've translated me into the Glorious message of the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and whom we have Redemption through his blood listen saints of God the blood must be in its place they received a message from Moses but it's time they take the message and put it into action Moses didn't come to each one of their doorposts and be like all right here's how you do it I know a lot of us would be like well that would be really nice that would be a lot easier mhm but God has something for you to do that's why he's not pushing you through a pipe but even right here in this service you got overcoming to do and the one you got to overcome is you you want to know who's keeping you out of your place it ain't brother Ron it ain't brother Andrew come on it ain't brother Alden how many loves brother alen amen that guy's good as gold right there maybe Platinum I don't know I'm glad he's in his place right there that's right but it's you you're the problem I know you don't like preachers telling that but it's the truth anyway but it's time saints of God in order for us to go into our place the Way Up Is Down it's time we humble oursel and say father I need a refilling I need a good oldfashioned Revival I need a good oldfashioned sin killing I need Revival in my life not just on Sunday but father may I be so excited on Thursday I what I spend time with you on Wednesday that it just keeps [Music] growing ever ever somebody look at you what's wrong with you oh man you want to know what's wrong with me if you knew him like I knew him and when they when they went over there and they saw the W Revival where's the we survival you're looking at it right buddy hall yeah yeah sir don't gu by go don't go by your feelings right now I'm going to Le you're a part of this revival thanks of God we're going somewhere sometimes you don't realize you're going somewhere but I don't know about you in the last three or four years things are changing this bride is changing the direction is changing we're not concerned about what the world's doing we're not concerned so much about our job but there's a concern about talking to my Lord there's a concern about getting in the message of the hour there's a concern about getting closer to Jesus Christ it's that magnetic pole and once that magnet gets so close I work in him my ey I working in my ey so it's a big magnet I mean bigger than you ever seen a paperclip if I let that go at the right place we'll hit that magnet at 40 miles an hour oxygen tank like a missile I'm a big guy you ain't going to hold it but I tell you what when our Lord get so close like he is even right now one of these days we ain't going to leave out of those doors we're going that way I love church God's calling his people back to the spoken word come on he had Sons he had a son in Adam and Adam would speak to things tree I don't really like you over there EES a little cold how many sisters would love that all right we got an honest one there praise the lord it's a little cold warm this place up but let me tell you right now you are Sons and Daughters of God so what are you waiting for come onoo got a little sticky there didn't it you feel there's a certain sensation you got to have if you're a son and daughter of God begin to speak the word of God and you watch God come right behind your words come on little bride you got a voice he's called you into a place that you can speak the word he said why are you crying it's time for you to speak come on somebody you know the only reason we're in this place he took ours he became me he took my place I should have been the one on the cross but he took my place that now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I can stand as a son and stand as a Son of God and stand in my position in my place that he called me to that he brought me to I didn't do it for myself he did it for me but he brought me there he took my place but now it's time for us to stand in our place come on L see you you ain't L to see you I said come on little bride it's time for you to stand and overcome brother man would say this he says Bo I'd like to say something I can't forget what I was I remember what he was if I can remember Jesus I can remember him if I can remember Jesus I can remember him at the cross if I can remember what he done for me I can remember the hour that he washed away my sins and give me the holy spirit to guide me that I'm lifted above everything that holds this Earth I'm lifted above every Earthly thing in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus where I can fellowship with him there in his presence forgetting what I ever was how many ever got to that place where you just lost all sense of who you used to be well let me tell you he doesn't remember who you used to be he remembers who you are oh glory Lord let that sink in for just a minute he doesn't remember who you used to be justified as if you never did it in the first place his thoughts of you are pure that's the reason he could write it in the word unreprovable that means you can't correct Her She's Mine I paid the price for her I redeemed her she was a fallen bride but I came and I took her place on that cost you know one time listen don't that first quote I read talked of a football team trying to take somebody else's place not everybody's place is to stand behind this Pulpit that's right but this person can't stand behind a Pulpit and sit there too so it needs somebody to take their place there was one time Moses they were having a battle and he got weary and he needed somebody to come up beside him and help him and here comes Aaron and her you know who took part in that Victory Aaron and her that's right Moses could not have done what Moses needed to do if it had not been for others in their place so saints of God you may not think your place is important but you are causing more victories than you realize by coming up beside him and lifting him up in prayer and raising the weary hands Abra Moses said his hands got heavy heavy means weariness there's sometimes as a preacher I can't explain it you get weary you pour yourself out you pour yourself out you pour yourself out and sometimes there's not anything left to give and yet you come to the pull pit anyway and then the Church of the Living God begins to pull and God comes down it's because you're in your place brother said this he say he took my place that I had no right to go nowhere but to hell he took my place and lifted me up from hell he went there for me and he Lifted Me Up by his grace in abundance until now we are Sons and Daughters of God and we sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus every rejoicing remembering him who brought us safe thus far and with a Paul said faith in our souls pressing us and by Grace he'll take me on and the Bride of Jesus Christ begins to rejoice and say Amen let's say it again amen that's right brother I'm going to deal with something real quick your past your past tries to hold you from taking your position but let me tell you God has no record of your past if the blood is in his place go God has no record of your past that's nothing but a lying Spirit out of hell trying to keep you from your position because once you come into your position you begin to bless others come on somebody once you come into your place there's a supernatural that me to happen I can't breath brother William he can't be me but I tell you what we're in the same Army and when God calls him to get up here and fire away he going to give up here and fire away and I'm going to be right there sitting right there saying come on buddy preach it there is no big eyes and big little use in this message there is one body and this body is moving to a Rapture it's time we get in our place don't lift up no man but lift up the name of Jesus Christ and put him in his place and let's move body let's move Bud it takes you together and you know what Satan doesn't like you to hear that he doesn't like you to hear it say Amen so he'll try to cause a little Schism come here buddy you whatever you what's your name Isaiah right there what's your name huh Gavin Isaiah will be over here and he'll look over at Gavin and Gavin will look at him and shake his head and Deon Isaiah go you don't like me now Look see that look at his eyes man go and sit down go sit down and the devil begin to work just with the Simplicity of [Applause] that and before long these two won't don't even sit on the same Pew you ain't got that in you do you he's too sweet I'm speaking to older people more than I am anything well Glory you know he did me wrong M take that to the cross of Calvary and keep it let me ask you did you do him wrong what' he say father forgive him you want to go higher get rid of some of that [Applause] stuff it ain't got a place in the body it ain't got a place in the body I'm have myself a fit cuz the devil don't like that none bit but you know what just broke right there many years of things broke right there by the preaching of the word it cut it right off you now don't go back and pick it up you go hug their neck you going say I'm sorry break every bit of it off of the body of Jesus Christ let's move and let me tell you this it ain't this church against that church I ain't got time for that I need that to go to Hey Brother Tims against brother donies said that brother believes that if you're a Christian let's go in a Rapture come on somebody you know you can break things the power of your words come on don't Harbor it brother Matt that's how my family listen you're not a part of that family anymore you're back to your original place the family of God you might have come through a Smith you might have come through a Martin a Miller whoever you are and they might be the meanest Scoundrels that walked around the mountain but you know what there's a blood that breaks every bit of that and the blood's in its place so why are you claiming what happened in your past why are you claiming what happened how your granddaddy did this in granddau to that but let me tell you about our father and our father forgave so therefore I will well Glory thank you Lord thank you Lord hallelujah that was him that's how he's speaking to his bride he brought a five-fold Ministry for the affecting of the Saints that's right I forgot to start my timer this might be a two-parter I got part in the morning and it's early you won't be tired listen it's time we put Christ in his place that's right brother man we preach on the threefold purpose don't you love a simple message quick complicating it that's right quit making it super spiritual come I break that too I'm sorry that's how I am come on somebody we make it so complicated he called Sheep and you know what sheep do follow you know what sheep do they lay down everything they got come on sheep don't make it hard that's the devil trying to complicate it he can bring it to the little of child and make it so simple and that's how he wants you to come to him so quit coming with your intellect quit coming with your idea place that outside and say father can you just teach me what this message means Oh Glory right how many your fathers love it how many Grandpa love it when your little ones come hey Grandpa what's that do Grandpa got all the Time in the World to tell you how Works he been waiting on you to ask him listen young people you little ones your Grandpa got a lot of things that they can tell you that is really really cool amen that's right quit being so busy and go sit on her lap say hi to them they're not mean they love you more than you could ever understand amen right in fact you're the very heartbeat of them they look at you and their heart goes knock out the sun that's free I don't know where that came from praise the Lord threefold purpose the first is to express himself completely God in Christ did he do that here's a second to second to have preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have preeminence to express himself through them the whole body not just the preacher not just the singer but the whole body he wants to express himself through I'm going to speak to the quiet ones right now some of you quiet and sometimes you feel like you just can't even get out of your own way you have something to do too you can pray in the quietness of your closet and move mountains and not take any credit for it but yet you know it's God heing your prayers God made you the way he made you don't be ashamed because you can't dance and can't shout not all of us are that way and that's okay boo devil I know some of you that hurts you think oh I've done this and I've never done that it a matter what you doing you get along with God long enough it ain't no telling what you'll do come on somebody you might do it in I'll tell them myself I came home from a a camp meeting one time and I brother sent me a song his brother Donnie singing a song and man I tell you what it had a something beat I have my earbuds in and I'm in my garage there was a car in my garage and my garage was wide open and I live in the neighborhood and I had myself a dancing fit right there in my garage and nobody heard any music but me [Applause] I'm sure they drove by like that guy's Plum nuts and I don't care I knew who I was dancing for I was dancing for my Lord and he deserves every bit of Praise even if it's on a Monday on a Tuesday in my garage he deserves my praise nobody is going to take your place nobody preeminence means to hold the first place let him hold the first place let him hold the first place you know why he's convicting about Instagram and Facebook and all those things because he just wants the first place that's good isn't it that's all right we'll let it go you know the lord gave me a couple years ago I was driving down the road and this quote came up it says his great major events happens in Heavens before it happens on the earth he reflects him in in other words before Messiah came into his place where his ministry would start there came for the star out of heaven and guided the man to the place where he was to Wi them when I heard this my mind immediately went to the cloud oh Lord before there was a major event on Earth he always shows it in the heavens brother bam didn't even recognize what it was but what was it let me catch my scripture and then we'll they'll tie it together and he is the head of the body to the church right so when you look at this message the right way you got to turn it to the right brother M said turn I wish I had those pictures I should have gave them to you Adam or whoever's up there those pictures brother M had the picture and it was like this and he didn't really understand it I believe it's in the riseing the Sun or in one of those he says and then the Lord told me turn it to the right and what was right this is how it came up now turn it to the right buddy can you if you flip it oh Glory hallu it was the head but where was the body it was the head coming to the body listen sints of God this message the revelation of the Seven Seals was the mind of God it was not brother brandom's message it was the head coming to the body let's don't question the head let's don't question the mind of god let's don't question the vision that God gave us but let's say Amen to every word and the body will come right in step with the message of the hour the headship god coming down and moving this bride into a Rapture I begin to think on that it was the head coming to the body it was not brother ROM's thoughts it was not brother ROM's message come on somebody it was not his message how do you know that brother man the word says only the lamb could reveal the seals but God used William brandom don't lift him above his place and don't put him below his place but keep him in his place he was our Prophet to speak our message and let us know the head has come to the body amen makes this message all listen get into that message you know where that message is supposed to be in your mouth you're supposed to be eating it Revelations 10 89 go on down 10 1- 7's been fulfilled but there's going to be a people that are going to The Mighty Angel themselves hallah this is your message I can't give it to you but there's one in the room that can give it to you and you got to have a relationship with him and when you get in a relationship with him it's like that husband telling his wife all the secret things of his heart he's letting her know this is me Hallelujah go look at those quotes on the cloud you know why they don't like the cloud because they don't recognize what it is but we in Simplicity say well that's the head where's the body oh that was coming down down through the message of the hour the headship was coming that now the body would have the mechanics and the Dynamics and know what pleases her King she's not questioning listen Esther didn't question what God gave her she didn't question what he gave her to put on but she said you know the king I will wear what pleases the king this message pleases the king put it on put it on put it on say brother man I don't understand it all put it on anyway I believe it Lord give me Revelation and you watch God begin to open the book he'll send Andrew down here he'll put Andrew on a series that comes right down your Avenue and makes it so simple to you come on somebody he'll send Ron right behind him he'll send an evangelist is crazy and yell all over the place and it'll make you recognize your understanding more than you recognize your understanding this is your place so if you're understanding the book you know what you're doing you're seeing your place you're seeing your name in the revealed Book of Jesus Christ man so good glory sorry forgive me I enjoy these things you worrying Fred over a message get all there's going to be 200 people there you want to switch okay all right make fun of me I tried get gab to switch even him some buddies they are now they're my buddies you wor and your fret then God comes down and he says I got you amen I had you before the foundation of the world and I've got you right in your position right in your place and from this place you're going to do many wonderful things come on somebody you get to your place don't let anybody else take your place if God's impressing upon your heart to do something if God's impressing on your heart on a Tuesday night to go to prayer for sister Joy over here I don't know if there's a sister Joy but maybe there will be if they're wrting there will be well praise the Lord for a sister Joy over here that she would come into her place you see a sister struggling Let the Body meet that need it's time for the devil to realize I've bluffed them long enough that their prayers don't do anything he's bluffed you too long come on your prayers move mountains your prayers change things listen young people your prayers change things all right give me 10 minutes we'll pick this up tomorrow I think I didn't know where I was going anyway that's being led of God that's what you want behind a pull pit amen I'm not trying to uplift myself but you just want a man of God that'll say Lord lead me and you want a people that'll say Lord speak to me and then when you get together we have church and God be glorified because no man stand behind here and know he ain't going to say anything good but when God comes down and God begins to anoint the man of God and speak through his lips why don't you give praise in the house of God why don't you not let your voice they say listen I give thanks Lord I give you thanks for what you're speaking to me because from the word there's a supernatural change even now in my body let me let me find a place to close here I got 10 minutes amen we must put Christ in his place listen SS of God this message is not just another good good messages preached amen this message is Jesus Christ what did the headship reveal the face of Jesus and you know he's looking down in love tonight he's looking down saying I've got Grace for you I know you don't think you can ever walk in what brother Matt's talking about but that's not why you're sitting in this service you're sitting in this service because you're one of them that's going to walk on to the fullness of what I have for you you heard the call how many's hearing a call tonight come up higher come on little Bride come up higher you said by the matter I've been slacking well you don't stay that way then if you're hearing a call it's not the call from a preacher it's a call from God Almighty and if God is calling you then he'll make a way where there is no way I know what I'm talking about right now you'll make a way where there is no way he's a god he's a way maker I know maybe you've never figured out how he's going to do it why don't you quit trying because all you're thinking is just muddling it up that's right but if you can get in the presence of God and say father just speak your word Lord all I heard was come up higher yep that's all Noah heard build a boat oh yeah you know there was no way there was no instructions on how to
