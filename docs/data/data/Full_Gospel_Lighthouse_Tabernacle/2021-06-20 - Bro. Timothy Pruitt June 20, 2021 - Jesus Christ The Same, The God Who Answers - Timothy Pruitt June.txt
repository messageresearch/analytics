family it doesn't matter nationality language whatever whatever place that god put us on the earth we're part of the same family and every one of us are different and unique and he built us just that way but isn't it amazing that he can come and speak in an audience of people and speak around the world and in five minutes come and soothe your soul no matter how difficult the complex of issues that you're fighting today amen i thought last night was just absolutely incredible amen i i just really enjoyed that brother david we we so thank you guys for coming and being with us and he said he's coming back labor day and amen we're holding him to that as well amen the pruitt and spencer family you're intertwined in a lot of different ways there's been a lot of miracles that have happened among us and we believe that even today i'm standing in a miracle because satan designed it that i would be gone and maybe be in a hole somewhere another but what he doesn't realize that should i go by the way of the grave i'm standing with jesus anyway so amen so we thank the lord for his grace and mercy to us and we thank the lord that god is touching sister karen and and is with her and drew and lord we're just so thankful that he's made friends with gabriel amen he's going to be a police officer one of these days and so amen we certainly love you with all of our hearts i wanted to greet you before brother timothy comes brother timothy is a special young man to me and i remember many years ago i told his daddy i said he's going to make a great preacher he said don't tell him whatever you do don't you tell him well he did anyway somebody must have told him from up above and so amen i i like the way that timothy operates he looks like that he looks like that he's not doing anything and in a moment he cuts the devil's head off and so amen i like his style i wish i could preach more like that one day when i grow up i'll be a better preacher when you get there here's what i want to say this morning we came this weekend for father's day but we're going to have a party yeah yes sir it's a party of killing devils and uh i i said this before i i don't want sympathy because we're in this war because satan brought his best against us brother randy he brought his best he picked out his best to come against us but he still don't have enough and we're standing here this morning brother emmanuel to remind him he don't have enough because my heavenly father that is watching over me he has provided everything that i have need of in this life's journey i will not retreat i will not bend i will not bow i will not turn back i will not give up i refuse to give up i'm never never never never going back so we've got nothing to hang our heads about today victory is on our side so

hallelujah well i'd like to use the phrase right now boo devil mercy if you i hope you're feeling what i'm feeling right now i stepped into a supercharged who praise the lord amen you know i guess these are the days of first things um you know the weekend brother brother ron's been wanting to sing with sister bethany for a long time he had that opportunity last night you know this this week coming up is a really special week it's me and my wife's 25th anniversary and his brother ron's anniversary this week on the tour or this coming week on the 25th amen so a lot of good things are happening right now and you know i was um you know in a marriage there can be times that are good there'll be times that are bad you know it's tough times you go through and straight and and the devil puts pressures upon you and especially sometimes seemingly even more so in a ministry all the all the cannons of hell is pointed towards you but as we said last night we respond with a cannon shot and we're not going to surrender we're not going to retreat we're not going to give up but we're going to press forward so you got one more song in you amen you know that song give me your hand let's agree together we got the powers in b-flat i believe amen i'm asking my wife to come my wife and i have never sung together we're going to sing together this morning and we're going to bind together but i want you to help us sing it as well and i would like to read this scripture before we do matthew 18 and verse 18 says verily i say unto you this is jesus speaking to you whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask and it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered in my name there i am in the midst of them oh can you say praise the lord this morning he's in our midst he's in the midst of our storm he's in the midst of our our battles he's never left us alone amen so this morning i want you to as believers to grab one another's hand and let's sing this song together amen give me your hand and let's agree together that all of our enemies will crumble at our trees for whatever we buy on [Music] and at earth name of jesus satan has to free for we've got the [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] we will not be defeated cause we've got the power in the name of the lord and for many years now for satan's tried to stop us [Music] [Applause] [Music] and like a mighty [Music] [Applause] wow [Music] in the name of jesus [Music] we've got the power in the name of the lord oh though satan rages oh we will not be defeated [Music] we've got the power in the name of the lord almost sing that last verse again and for many years now oh satan's tried to stop him whoa but let me tell you devil ron spencer oh he's still alive and like a mighty tanner road he's gonna keep marching keep marching onward winning this battle of cancer oh why because [Applause] in the name of jesus oh we've got to power in the name of the lord [Music] but we will not be defeated cause we've got the power in the name of the lord hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord oh my now won't you just lay hands on one another let's go to him in prayer right now as we would start this service father we come to a special moment a special time in end time but has been played out in eternity you know lord the very things that upon our hearts this morning very things that you've directed us in this path lord that we've walked on we know you're here today to touch and to meet needs lord i also realize i'm here commissioned commissioned to let the devil know this cancer to know your time is over father we're here to know let's just stand up on the promises of god lord we're here even in this moment some thousands of miles away from evening like tabernacle and as they start their service there's a little woman sitting there lord been in a lot of confusion and a lot of anxiety and fear the devil of torment has come upon her but we go beyond what we see and we go beyond what we think we step into a heavenly atmosphere and we call out the name of jesus and we speak against that spirit and we command it to go in jesus name lord is not a maybe it's not a hope so but it's your word today as thus saith the lord satan you take your hands off of god's property you're defeated here and you're defeated there you will not have your way you will not you will not bring these down into defeat but we will arise and we'll go out of here victorious because god god has given it to us and what our god has given you can't take away we praise you now for these things and we glorify your name and we worship you almighty god i believe there's those here today lord that's got darkness upon them there's darkness upon their lives and they've got questions and they don't know where to turn to but lord there's a man here that can turn on the light there's a man here that can just reveal their thoughts to them and and their anxieties and their fears and their worries and spirits who would try to haunt them in the night would just dissipate and disappear by the mighty name of jesus we commit this service to your hands lord we committed for your glory and for your honor in jesus name amen amen let's turn to hebrews 13 and verse 8. and also we'll turn to first kings 18 and verse just like to say it's very just an honor to be with you today amen it's on father's day but i believe it's more that our our life is more than about just earthly fathers and we appreciate earthly fathers but i'm on here i'm here on business for the king amen the king of kings our father in heaven amen hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever first corinth first kings 18 and verse 21 and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt you between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baal's prophets are 450 men let them therefore give us two bullocks let them choose one bullock for themself and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on the wood and put no fire under it and call ye on the name of your gods but i will call on the name of the lord and the god that answers by fire let him be god and all the people answered and said it is well spoken down to verse 36 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel that i am thy servant that i have done all these things that thy word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou has turned their heart back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked the water up in the trench that was in the trench when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god amen there's gods but there is the god there's lords but there is the lord amen god bless you today you can be seated amen i'd like to speak to you on jesus christ the same the god that answers amen he is a god that answers he knows exactly what battles we're in he knows exactly you know i'm very thankful to serve a god that he's not surprised about where we are today he's not sitting back shocked at the political atmospheres and the and the spirits around and all the things that are going on around he's not shocked by any of that he knows exactly where we're at he knows exactly where you're at today he knows exactly your struggles he knows all the things that are going on but not only does he know about it he cares about it i'm very thankful to serve a god who cares amen because you know satan would try to let you try to tell you in your mind that nobody cares nobody understands what i'm going through nobody god don't care god don't know anything like that but that's nothing but a lie of the devil but god is coming this hour to show us over and over that he cares and he's a god that answers you know you know brother brown would say it like this he said when man what man calls great god calls foolish and what man calls foolish god calls great he said what we got to do is get back to the program of god and find out what god wants to do and he said the only thing i know to do is prayer prayer is the key that's the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings there's no atomic bomb there's no hydrogen bomb we could say nuclear bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will even change the mind of god amen we've got scripture for that we know the king that the prophet of god was told to go say get your things in order you're going to die and he would turn his head to the wall and he would cry out to god and he would ask and it was thus saith the lord that he had come and delivered to him and he would turn his head to the wall and he would cry out to god and ask for 15 more years and as the prophet was walking out god would speak to him and go back and tell him look you can have those 15 years amen because prayer can even change the mind of god god would say in matthew 7 and verse 7 he would say jesus would say ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened to you now he wouldn't put this in the scripture unless it was true he wouldn't he wouldn't say to ask unless it would be given to you otherwise it would be unjust he wouldn't say find or let or or to seek unless you would find it he wouldn't say knock and it would stay closed but it would have to open because it's declared in his word to be so amen for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open or what man is there a view of whom his son asked of bread will he give him a stone or if he would ask a fish would he give him a serpent will there be any father today that would do that to your child no you wouldn't do that you as an earthly father you got your your best the best interest of your child and heart and if they ask for something many times you'll try to do whatever you got to do amen to provide it to give it to them he said he said so if you then be an evil how much to know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask of him so i'm here to ask of him today i'm here to knock upon the door of heaven and say father i have a need i i'm here seeking healings and deliverances and salvations and i know if i ask i'm going to receive if i seek i'm going to find if i knock it's going to be open to me amen it's not my word it's not my wishes it's his word and his declaration that he put in the scripture that what he whatever i ask in his name it shall be given unto me hallelujah you say well i don't know about healing he's healing the will of god well he wouldn't put it in his word if it wasn't his will his word is his will so he put it in his word by his stripes you are healed amen therefore it is the will of god to heal you hallelujah amen you know as i was preparing this week uh uh for for wednesday night service at home and i actually ministered this at home and and and and just knowing the things that were going on and what was facing at home and i want to give you just a little background as we go into this for a moment i'll try not to be too long but i can't promise anything it's in his hands amen so uh but you know i i was thinking and we're here we're here we're moving into and to seem like a stormy time and i was wondering you know what what god was doing you always kind of thinking you know sometimes it takes you a moment to kind of get your bearings you know when the ship gets to rocking and rolling it takes a moment to steady yourself and so you know as david would say you know and when he went to zig lag and he found it burned and he found it uh and destroyed and all the women and his children everything was taking place it took a little bit for him to get himself together it took him a moment he would even his men it took them a moment to get themselves together because they was even thinking of stoning their leader and they was thinking of killing him amen because of all the destruction and things that had taken place but the scripture says david encouraged himself in the lord he went back to the word of god and he went back to the past victories and and the things that god had done for him and he began to call upon the name of god and was as we're speaking on in the god it answers god answered and he said pursue and you shall recover all amen i remember a sermon some time ago take it back amen we haven't forgot that we're pursuing the enemy and we're going to take it back he's the god that answers amen we've cried unto the lord for healing and deliverance and we're going after it in the name of jesus and we're going to take back every every part of our health god's not a it doesn't do something halfway and when he does it he does it perfectly hallelujah amen so when we're looking at these things we're going to call upon the name of the lord and we're going to encourage ourselves in what god has already said because what he said is what he does amen and so i was linked thinking of these things and i was reminded you know of actually of of of a accident that had happened in our family it was a moment that it was a very a very tried seemed like tragic moment that the the devil had come and struck my little daughter down adriana her name's adriana and she had been at a a park and she i probably told this but i just feel to tell it again and and she was at a park and and and they was playing frisbee golf and i was actually at home on this it was saturday morning beautiful days beautiful spring day and or maybe it's even the middle of the winter i don't remember but it just happened to be a beautiful day and just the weather was beautiful and so you know in louisiana we can have hot days but in louisiana we have 70 degrees weather right in the middle of winter hallelujah sunshine for weeks and i enjoy that i don't like cold weather amen so anyway uh you know it was happened to be that kind of day so a lot of the young people went out and they began to play that game and so i'm home studying supposed to be preaching sunday night on a god we can rely on and i was i it was just one of those days that couldn't get my thoughts in their line couldn't couldn't couldn't think you know get scriptures and all those things had a few things together but i could tell it wasn't really hitting the mark and so i looked at sister ruth i said let's go get some hamburger meat and let's get some fixings for hamburgers let's go out to that park and let's get ready to make them kids some hamburgers they're about done so let's do that so we gathered the rest of the children and this about eight years ago we gathered the rest of the children and we went to the park and andrew or one of them brought these little rip sticks and and they're like a skateboard but they're they're just on two wheels and i i i wouldn't dare get on one i like to stay all in one piece hey man but they they they've been riding them around but you know in louisiana we got flat ground it's not that big a deal and but over there at this park there's actually some pretty good hills there and you know and adriana was planning on going to a camp meeting with us up in uh cloverdale and and there she was dreaming of going snowboarding so somebody had told her he said you know this is similar to a snowboard and you just get on that hill and you ride it down and and and this you'll learn how to even you'll be able to snowboard and so but the difference is it's not snow in louisiana it's asphalt and so she gets you know i'm flipping hamburgers not really paying no attention and she gets up on this thing and her brother and another boy gets on two others and here they come down the hill and down at the bottom of this hill there's a curve and it's going around to the left and and they're flying and i'm just i've got my i'm just looking i'm like god have mercy what are y'all doing and i was like no don't do that and and next and then i sing they made the curve and they said you make the curve it went back up the hill and you slowed down and stopped well i no sooner got that out of my mouth here comes adriana now she was determined she's going to be tougher than the boys so she goes up a little higher on the hill and she takes off down this hill and i watch her and out of the corner of my eye catch her and here she comes down this hill and i'm thinking she's not going to make the curve she's not going to make it and sure enough she didn't she went down into a parking lot and there wasn't any cars there wasn't anything going on there that day is but just us believers was there and she went down probably another hundred yards down through that just straight on downhill catching speed going towards the lake but before you got to the lake there was there was sand and there was trees and there was concrete and there was poles and there was all kinds of stuff she hit the end of that asphalt and she flipped end over end over in we measured it about 30 feet she flew through the air and she would come to rest her head up against the steel pole and there was some young people that was down there walking on the beach down there at the lake and they began to scream for us to come and so we drove down to where she was and i knelt down beside her and i raided it raised her over on her back i rolled her over on her back and just trying to be as easy because i didn't know you know she'd broke something or what and i'm just beginning to talk to the lord and i talking to adrian as well saying adriana talk to daddy speak to me and she opened her eyes and her eyes just all rolling around in her head and and she was just moaning this terrible moan and i just bowed my head i said father we're out here enjoying some time in nature we're not out here just previously doing things where we're enjoying time with other believers and in nature but i believe you're the same god that when the prophet of god was fishing at a place and his friend got bit by a snake remember the story and he knelt down and he prayed and the very effect of that snake's bite was gone in just a minute and i'm believing you're that same god that the very effect of this wreck will be gone in just a moment and and then i looked and she would open her eyes and i watched as those crossed eyes would become straight and her first words were to me daddy i can't see you and i said lord i just watched these eyes come straight now give her back her sight her next words were daddy i see you now god was moving very very powerfully and very fast and i watched and just and we called for the ambulance to come and and it took about 20 minutes for them to get out to where we was and and and they they began to take her load her up and as they began to load her up she had been laying there for that time just in pain and suffering and why am i here and what's going on how did i get here all all her memory was gone of that day she did not remember being there playing any kind of uh frisbee she didn't remember none of the other things that had happened but as they began to load her up i watched her mind begin to come back she said oh we was here we're at the lake state park and we played frisbee golf and and we're just fixing it was going to eat hamburgers yes i remember now and god began to move very quickly sister ruth would get in the ambulance with her and go to the hospital with other brothers that would be was there would take my kids with them and i would follow them one of the brothers had called my dad and and told him what is going on and he laid the phone down he said lord let there not be one broke bone amen and so as we follow that ambulance there and i begin to pray and i begin to thank god for all that had happened and all that had taken place and as i had one hand on the wheel and one hand in the air be honest with you i don't know how i made it there to homer to meet with my father but i made it somehow but anyway i was praising god but i hurt my heart and in that moment i heard my voice speak and it said what you've seen in the natural you'll also see in the supernatural well right there on sunday night i gave the testimony of what had taken place that god had come on the scene that god in a moment had changed the whole scene that a little girl that had been dirty and dark darkened by the spots of and scarred up and all that lost her mind but god moved in such a way that we get to the hospital they x-ray after x-ray cat scan after cat scan every kind of thing that they could do to try to determine if there was broke the doctor come in and said sir he said we're going to keep her overnight but he said i want to tell you something we can't even find a sign of a concussion it's all gone hallelujah he's the same god this morning hallelujah if he can make it to where they can't find a sign of a concussion he'll make it to where they can't find a sign of cancer he's that kind of god amen and it just takes a moment in his presence to where it's all white you remember that moment when you was in his presence and every sign of cigarettes every sign of every kind of sign of sin was washed away from your life and the devil with every kind of x-ray and every kind of mr hell's mri could look at you and not find one side of it he's that kind of guard this morning i got up that night a sunday night and i told the testimony adriana was there in that service i went between services and picked her up at the hospital within just a few days every scar was gone it was a it was a miraculous working of the holy ghost amen of gods of power to come on the scene we witnessed it and i said now i've heard my voice i said it wasn't me i had no control of it but i heard my voice speak said what you've seen in the natural you'll also see in the supernatural i said i don't know what's about to happen but god's about to move on somebody that very next wednesday night brother philip roncalli that's at our church today amen had been away from god been out seven or eight years and thought the devil had told him the message wasn't for him he couldn't live it he couldn't do nothing with it he knew it was a truth but it wasn't for him told him all kind of lies and here he found himself in a scarred situation spiritual amnesia amen didn't know who he was anymore and lost his uh his ability to even even think that he could ever deserve anything from god but that night as his family had prayed for him and prayed for him and prayed for him amen later they would find piles of handkerchiefs under his bed where those kids would come to minister and say i want a handkerchief i want a prayer cloth for my daddy because i want my daddy back yeah amen and here he came that wednesday night as they were getting ready for church the spirit of god began to move upon him and he said hey if y'all don't mind if you'll wait a minute i'll get ready and i'll go with you he came to church but he didn't come in a time of expectation or an attitude of expectation he came in a bad move you know we me and him was raised up together and and so we had a lot of fights and we had a lot of tussles as young men growing up and he said of all things brother timothy's preaching but i began to speak on identity crisis from from what had happened and god gave me several services on that thought and and i began to speak on identity crisis and i would come down to the last part about the french soldier who had who had been out there in the war and been struck by this this bomb that went off close to him and it had happened to amnesia and it was taking them back on a train and they stopped for a little break and he gets out and brother brown talks about it said he gets out he begins to look around at things and he began to look her over and he said all of a sudden his his eyes caught a water tower and he said it was something very familiar about that and and the soldier began to watch him that was garden and he began to walk towards his water tower then he went down a little trail all the way down to a little house and there was a father that was sitting there waiting on him and said son i've been waiting for you to come and you're back now well at that moment that spirit that was on brother philip broke because you know in his mind he's saying well i didn't heard all this stuff i've been gone seven years and ain't got nothing new to preach and all all of a sudden i said about the water tower and he said brother branham didn't say that and at that moment that spirit broke you know why because he had just bought a house and he was going out on that front porch and in the front of his house was his water tower and he had been fixing his coffee and going on his front porch and looking at that water tower and thinking about his life and he needed to get right with god what i've seen in the natural i have now seen in the supernatural but i'm here to see it again this morning [Applause] hallelujah i'm here to see it again this morning amen amen my daughter adriana now amen god has brought her back from afar from a place that she was almost broken almost you know irreparable seem like but god came on the scene hallelujah i understand we got another adriana here this morning he's the same god for you this morning amen you may feel broken you may feel unreparable you may feel like there's no no hope for you and all hope is gone but what i've seen in the natural i'll also see in the supernatural he's a god who answers by fire he's a god who answers amen mamas have prayed daddies have prayed but your prayers have not went unheard god heard them on the first day and god is here to answer your prayer [Applause] as i was sitting there thinking that began to send out wednesday morning i began to send i was already getting ready for the night but god had actually gave me this sermon on the friday before it doesn't always happen like that i just felt the urge set down and god in just a few moments laid it all out on friday on saturday we'd take our my mother to the er not knowing what is going on with her and it seemingly had gotten worse and worse and worse and worse and here i am wednesday morning i began to send out texts to ministers to pray to believe to join us that god is going to move and i got up from my chair and i began to go to go to the restroom and and and i began to walk through my room and as i'm walking i'm crying and praying asking the lord to move on the scene and i heard my voice speak he said did not already give you the answer did i not already give you the sermon friday before any of this happened jesus christ the same the god that answers he is the god that answers he is the god so this morning this is my testimony he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and him what i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night oh hallelujah nor the arrow that flies by day nor the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor the destruction that wastes to that noon day a thousand shall fall by thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come now thee only with mine i shall i behold and see the reward of the wicked because i was made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up with their hands let's have dash their foot against the stone thou shall tread upon the line and the hatter and upon cancer and upon a brain bleed and upon every spirit of anxiety and fear thou shalt tread upon them because the spirit of the lord is anointed me this morning to tell you it's unto your faith hallelujah thou shalt tread upon this line and this hatter and the young lion and the dragon shall thou trample oh this morning let's have us a trampoline service hallelujah because he has set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he has known my name he has called upon me and i will answer i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation this ain't a doctor salvation this ain't my salvation this is god's salvation this ain't my healing this ain't a doctor's healing this is god's healing this is god's deliverance amen we're looking at god's deliverance this morning we're looking at god's answer this morning and what his answer is to this cancer and what his answer is to this disease and this torment spirit by my stripes you're healed by my strength you're delivered by my strength it's over with oh come on saints of god let's give god praise this morning hallelujah this battle's too big for me this battle is too big for bill iran this battle is too big for us but the prophet of god is spoken the prophet has spoken why stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord i am speaking this morning as a son of god stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord this is not your battle this is the lord's battle and the lord will fight your battle [Music] [Applause] [Music] god always answers [Applause] jesus said ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find everyone that asks will receive [Applause] we are in the atmosphere of receiving the promises of god right now we are in the atmosphere of faith and where faith is all things are possible we ask god to do something then he must do it oh hallelujah listen he may not do it the way you think you ought to do it he may not come and moment you think he ought to come but don't let that weaken your testimony don't let that weaken your faith remember god always answers he'll answer every question he'll answer every every desire he'll answer every heart's cry amen let me let you know this morning that i listen to that song on the way here your cries have woken the master oh hallelujah everyone that seeks shall find everyone that knocks it will be open to him that's the only way i've always find out that i can get anything from god is to take his word and believe it the way he sends it god met moses there's been a cry for a deliverer 400 years they cried 400 years of promises seemed to fall down to the ground but the time came for the promise to be fulfilled amen and there wasn't enough devils in hell that was going to keep it from coming to pass when the time comes for the promise to be fulfilled the devil don't have enough because if he had enough he would bring enough but he don't have enough and so if he had enough of it because he knew that this was god's children he had heard god's decree over their life he had heard all the things and so if he would have had enough to keep them in slavery he would have brought enough but he didn't have enough amen amen if god if the devil could keep you in sickness he would do it but he don't have enough if he had enough he would bring enough but he don't have enough because the prophet of god would say it like this he said when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose with it so when you see hell turning loose turn your eyes from hell and look to heaven because it's also turning loose it's also coming to pass it's also falling upon a heart to believe that all things are possible [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but god met moses in an unexpected age the prophet will say like this had an unexpected place in an unexpected way god didn't meet moses the way he usually met man meets men he met him in an unusual way the way he chose to meet moses i know people thinks well god only does it one way but they put them in a box and that's their box that ain't god's box right so so they try to put him in the only you know the baptist have got him where he only answers this way and this one got him the only answer this way and this one got him the only answer this way and even the messages got him where he only answers this way in a tape you know i was i was just out of place there by the nathan bryant and we was back again we spoke was there two years ago on memorial day and we was back again two years later supposed to been there the year before but you know coveted so anyway was there two years later me and brother aaron oglesby and brother joe adams had been called to minister there for a meeting and in the first service there was this little girl got up 16 year old girl i think 16 17 something like that got up she got she said i got a song to sing as a memorial she said two years ago she said i was a 14 year old girl she said i would their family had come from the tabernacle and said i i was in that in a place in a very dark place said that i'd been led into by some friends from church into pornography and and other things even homosexual things he didn't say all that but that's what had happened he said well you shouldn't bring that shame it ain't no shame no more because it's all gone amen i he don't accuse her neither do i accuse her to me it's an awesome thing because it gives somebody else the faith when she holds up that giant it gives somebody else to faith i can do it too she said i'm going to get up and i'm going to sing this song as a memorial and she said because two years ago i was in a dark place and said i was just about to take my life he said but i came to a meeting and god began to move on my heart and i found myself on a saturday night in a prayer line and brother aaron was praying different brothers around me so but i told brother aaron what was going on and all the things that were happening in my life and he looked me directly in the eyes he said i can't help you she said i almost fainted he said but i represent one who can [Applause] and she said i met that one who can she said my life ain't been the same for two years now god came on the scene and changed my whole life changed everything about me and i'm standing here as a memorial of a saving grace her father would later talk to me the next day he said brother timothy god did it that way for a reason he said because i was raised that it only came through a tape that it could only come through a certain way and it can only come through a tape he said i believe god still speaks through tapes but i realized that night god's got a fivefold ministry and god can come through that man to speak to my daughter and i'm a witness her life is not the same hallelujah so it'll come sometimes in an unexpected place in an unexpected time in an unexpected way but god's going to answer god's going to meet the need god's going to touch the heart amen he met moses not by an expected way all of a sudden one day moses without tending some sheep and he looks and he sees a bush that's on fire but it's not burning well that's kind of unexpected normally when the bush is on fire it's burning to the ground but this was unexpected so he said well i'm going to turn aside and i'm going to see this thing and so he walks up to it and a voice speaks out of that bush well that's real unexpected said moses take off your shoes because you're now on holy ground and the voice begins to speak to him and to touch his heart and to challenge him for the hour that was at hand but god answered it would so challenge him and so stir him to where he would take a rod a donkey and a wife and a child and he would go down to egypt and they said where you going moses i'm going down to take over i'm going down to destroy satan's kingdom i'm going down to destroy the tolls that's been on the lives of my brothers and sisters they've been slaves too long [Applause] oh hallelujah amen he's the same god that met me and i've come here with my slingshot of faith some of you been slaves too long you've been slaves to your anxiety and your fear and your depression and spirits of every kind but in the name of jesus today you're gonna walk out of here free from those things those things that once hold you and what's held you all their life and you've been tormented day after day god has come in an unexpected way in an unexpected time to bring you deliverance sometimes it may come as this is as a disguise per the scripture would say we entertain angels unaware it may come another way around about a way but no matter which way it comes it comes we've asked we shall receive god said so that's why that's all that matters what it and then when he speaks it's settled forever you hear me it's settled forever just like those two ladies that was there in a prayer line remember the story one had stomach trouble one had a quarter he told her that thus saith told them what their names was them where they lived all they said he said thus saith the lord you're healed well that one went right around she still had the order mother went home she still had the stomach problems but she began to testify and she began to praise the lord and she began to thank god and she began to glorify god and her husband was like honey i don't know said you you're still sick and you're still this and i you're my you bring in reproach you say how can i bring a reproach on what god said now god said it it ain't up to me it's up to god hallelujah amen brother ron what you're doing is not a reproach it's faith it's boons it's canon's being shot hallelujah responses to the devil amen what god says god will do hallelujah and brother rhino said it was a couple of weeks down the road she got up one morning and looked over there she said she felt a real cool sweet go over her she looked over at some toast and some oatmeal and some eggs and she got real hungry she's like well i gotta i gotta try this said she tried it said it felt so good so she just had herself a gastronomical jubilee and she began to eat on the things that was on that table and began to thank god for what was going on in her life hey man she ran well she said you know what i got to go tell my neighbor down there and she went running down the road and she found her shouting and carrying on she said oh my what's going on in here and she walked in there and that sister was shaking out the sheets said i got up this morning look at that border it ain't there no more it fell off it's gone now what was it it was an unexpected time at an unexpected way in an unexpected place but god answered and he came on the scene [Applause] hallelujah what brother banner said he said what happened he said that morning the healing angel was walking through the neighborhood and there happened to be two vessels that was in the atmosphere to receive his touch to receive him and believe him and hold on no matter how hard it looked how bad it looked lord i'm still knocking i'm still seeking i'm still asking you are the same yesterday today and forever and at any moment your healing angel is gonna walk through this place eating angel is going to walk through evening like tabernacle or seven watts 701 printfield tribe wherever it may be i'm not going to put limitations on you god i just know you're going to answer i just know you're going to bring it to pass i know you are god and you don't change i'm going to take a break right here god is god and he don't change oh god is god and he don't change what he does he did before he's the same yesterday forevermore god is god and he don't change i said god is god and he don't change oh god is god and he don't change what he does he did before he's the same yesterday forevermore god is god and he don't change god still heals and he don't change god still delivers and he don't change what he did does he did before he's the same yesterday forevermore god is god and he don't change well brandon would say it like this he said see there's something going on right now he said there's another realm that's beginning to try to speak to us he said you have to be in tune to receive what is what he's saying amen to preach the sermon on being in tune with the supernatural you know it's like you know we don't have it no more so much but numbers i know a lot of y'all remember them old dials and you're in your radio not talking about tvs this tonight this morning amen in the radio and you would have to turn it and today what was you doing you was tuning it in there was a receipt there was a sending station and a receiving station and they had to be in tune with one another to receive the signal and brother branham said this is how you get your heart in tomb he said you just begin to think god is god [Music] so right now let's cast down every imagination let's cast down every thought i'm casting down every thought about my mom i'm casting down every thought that's been going through my mind and i got one thought right now let's get it in our mind god is god when you realize he's god if he's still god he's still on the throne if he's still god he still answers by fire if he's still god he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's still god he still heals he's still god he still saves don't he brother he's still god he still delivers he's still god he still feels with the holy ghost he's still god he'll put families back together he's still god he'll bring your children back won't it amen he's still god and so if god is god and he won't change that's all that matters as long as god comes and answers and as long as we recognize it to be god because sometimes it comes unexpected and he speaks and you thought well that's just something but it was god got to be in tune with it say god this morning tune my dial tune it to the supernatural when i walk in this doors right here i got one thing on my mind god is god when i walk out of this door i got one thing in my mind god is god and he don't change he said even jacob one time ready made him an unexpected place in an unexpected way at an unexpected time he met god in a wrestling match but it was god regardless of whether he's in a burning bush or a wrestling match it was god the main thing god came and changed jacob from a deceiver into a prince jacob got a hold of something that he could look at and hold with his hands and sing that was god and he wasn't going to tell it turn it loose he said you lay your hands on hold something that's real you catch a vision from god and see his presence hold on to it until god sends back the answer and when god sends it back a revival will start in your heart it will not just be in your heart it'll be in your family's heart it'll burn from one to another amen to see the power of a living god something's real no matter what form he comes in but god has a way of sending things to us answering our prayers [Applause] he said i believe we just need to open our eyes and be ready to receive it god is going to send it to us in his way of doing it an unexpected time and an unexpected place in an unexpected way when he realized it was god he held on to it the children of israel the three hebrew children they found god in an unexpected place in an unexpected time in an unexpected way it was a dark time for them but you know before you can ever have victory you've got to have trials if there was no war there'll be no victory amen you can't have victory without war you can't have miracles without having something have need of a miracle you know when we begin to sing the songs we shall see miracles maybe we didn't realize we got to have to go through something to see a miracle but that don't change it we're going to see a miracle hallelujah amen the three hebrew children down have been brought to a spot the king had made a declaration that if anybody did not bow down to this image they would be thrown in the fiery furnace but they purpose in their heart i we will not bow we will not turn around we're going to go on with jesus we're going to stand for him whether he is a fiery furnace or whether it's not fiery furnace o king live forever you are a king but you're not the king but we serve the living god and though if god will slay us yeah we're going to trust him that was shadrach meshach and abednego's promise and they held on to it and they wouldn't turn it loose in the worst time in the worst moments they held on brother brown would say it again he said the greatest weapon that's ever put in the hands of mankind is prayer it changes everything hallelujah you know i got to think i was i think i was talking brother andrew and i was making the decision to come on i said you know it was some years ago back in the 40s this group of men thought it was a good idea to float some boats across the pacific ocean and set off some bombs on pearl harbor and they did they brought destruction on all sides for a moment and they thought wow we got a victory and they're flying them planes and landing them back on that aircraft carrier and they're rejoicing and they're drinking their their victory drinks and every hoo-ha and carrying on and the general that army stood up and he says you know he said this has been a great day he said but i'm afraid we've awakened us sleeping giant all of a sudden the war machines of the us and all the power of the us began to turn and it began to turn out boats and armies and and and planes of all kinds and and scientists begin to become anointed under a power amen they begin to invent things and begin to move until where they could invent an atomic weapon i wonder if those men would have dropped them bombs if they realized the last result was an atomic bomb not one but two dropped on them if they would have made that decision that this is how the end's gonna come and i want to give the devil fair warning you come and drop the bombs in the wrong spot you may have come to this island you may have come to that country you may come to that place but you have dropped bombs in the wrong spot you have awakened a sleeping tide amen it's not by my powers not by my my works it's not by who i am but by his spirit saith the lord amen we are now anointed with the power of the holy ghost the same one that anointed paul and they want to anointed peter is now anointing these men of god is now anointed to you amen that you can carry your weapons yet you have been assigned they say brother timothy it's just a slingshot you go to the world in that swing shot and say devil i'm coming at you in the name of the lord and you let it go in faith and watch what you're gonna do he'll answer he'll send it right to the head of that child and he will fall at your feet i say god anoint us this evening or this morning god anoints with such faith that we'll pick up whatever weapons that i have and we say devil you bombed the wrong place you come to the wrong house you come to the wrong body you come to the wrong family but we come at you not in our power we come at you not in our mind we come at you not in our street but we come in the name of the lord jesus christ i say house of hell give way in the name of jesus hallelujah that's not empty words that's the spirit of god that has anointed me to speak house of hell give way you'll not have your way in these families you'll now have your way in ron spitzer you'll not have your way in care and pruitt but there is a spirit that is in the building to arrest you and to tell you you have an expiration date [Applause] your time is over are you willing to tell the devil this morning your time is over are you willing to tell depression this morning your time is over are you willing to tell anxiety and fear or whatever thing that's been holding you your time is over with are you willing to tell that thing that's been holding your child it's over with [Applause] it's over with devil we don't come to you in our strength we don't come to you in our abilities we come to you in the name of the lord and the name of the lord is a refuge it's a strong tower and the righteous can run into it and be saved that decision has come to every person in here if god is god serve him if baal is god serve him this ain't no we ain't we're in a time no more brother ron and playing games playing church that's why i've appreciated seeing y'all's response in the services and your response even as we're ministering here this weekend i can see faith is rising you're not sitting back and just letting the devil run over you he's attacked one of your leaders but that ain't the time to sit back and say oh my what are we going to do no it's a time to move forward it's a time to advance on the enemy the enemy may be screaming he may be hollering he may be rioting he may be see that's what the devil is going to do just like they're doing now on the streets they're riding when they try to when somebody tries to stand up for something right or something in our law enforcement they're riding against them they're riding against the very power to protect and to serve just like the devil is riding it's the very power that's coming to the body of jesus christ amen the holy ghost to try to tell you you don't have to live that way you don't have to go on no longer that way but there's a power greater than the one that's been against you but don't you think the devil's going to right and he's going to fuss and he's going to scream what's he trying to do make you back up but we're not backing up we're stepping forward we're stepping forward what's the sound that i hear i hear the spiritual airplanes and the spiritual guns being cocked i hear the spiritual man begin to have a voice on the inside i am more than a conqueror god has given me the victory this will not defeat me but i shall overcome let me hear you this morning how do you feel what will you say to these things what are you saying to this cancer what are you saying to that brain bleed what are you saying to the devil that storm in your house what are you saying he's a god who answers by fire he's obligated to his promise and as long as your abraham seed he's got to answer not a doubt in one of my minds today keep those doubts away stay right at the cross now now stay right at the one who promised i've never seen him fail i've never ready of him failing he will never fail because he's god and he can't fail he who made the promise is going to keep the promise who who gave us the victory is going to let us keep the victory i believe he hears and i believe he answers he's here to answer by fire he's here to destroy your enemy that's what he told jehoshaphat he said what i want you to do i'm gonna bring it again to this moment what i ask you to do is i ask you to get you some singers i ask you to get you some musicians this battle's too big for you jehoshaphat but this about i want you to understand it ain't yours this battle's mine saith the lord oh hallelujah this battle's mine saith the lord oh lord what'd they do they got them some singers and they began to praise god and they began to lift up the name of jesus and they began to glorify his name they said yes lord this joy that i got the devil didn't give it to me aren't you thankful about a joy that's not a temporary joy it's not temporary in the sense that it's determined by how joyful you are about how good a day you're having no that ain't determining nothing i'm joyful because i see an old rugged cross i'm joyful because i see a risen savior amen amen he comes in the darkest of moments in the darkest of times in the darkest of issues and spirits on every kind trying to drive you back and push you back off the promises of god trying to make you step back and say maybe this ain't the day maybe it's for somebody else maybe it's for so you know for that brother yes that was over there and just keeps backing you know this ain't the time to back up it's a time to say devil that's my promise and when you stand on it the devil's going to scream and he's going to holler and he's going to make a bunch of noise but that's all he's got amen is noise but that's not all you got you say oh brother timothy we got a lot of noise no that ain't just noise no there's a creative power behind that voice that'll go beyond this little church building right here and go into heavenly realms and begin to speak against that enemy and that enemy will hear your voice and say i gotta move off because how you know he's only got noise because i can read about him as a white horse rider as he begin to ride in the first church age he was a white horse rider and he was a writer with a bow and nowhere else you know what you can do with a bow but no errors you can do a lot of clanking that's about all the good it's going to do it might put some lashes on somebody but it ain't going to kill nobody it might he might you know put a few bruises in a few bumps but that's all it's going to be able to do because he don't have the power over your life to take it from you god showed us at the beginning to a prophet's message this enemy that we serve or that we were fighting is not a a armed enemy he's weaponless he's a bluff he's trying to bluff us he's trying to ah spencer's gonna die but cancer's gonna he's riding karen pruitt ain't never coming back to reminding you he's rioting but he's a bluff the prophet god said i know a people that's made out of stuff that don't bluff amen if they was resting on their own human abilities and what they could do see or think it would they would be somebody would back up but it's not me that he's coming against he's coming against the one that's on the inside of me and that one on the inside of me has omnipotence it has eternal life and it'll make every devil flee it'll make every devil flee and try and cry and scream as he moves back don't you feel him moving back even now let the musicians come this morning don't you feel him moving back those hebrew children got up to the last moment but you know what it takes for the fourth man to come it takes a fire brother brandon would play it out so beautifully as he would look beyond what we see he'd say gabriel would come up and he would have his sword drawn he says father have you been seeing what's going on down there send me down and i'll wipe them all out he'd done it before read the scripture there was two angels that went into a mist of they believed some syrians and killed like 180 000. i had to look that again just get the exact number but it was somewhere around there amen two angels what could three do five do 10 do legions of angels that's right god opened our eyes today we can see around us there's chariots of fire angels of fire there's more with us than there is against us oh yeah the devil's making his threats worm would come up and said father you see yeah i've seen i told gabriel i seen he said they're getting to their last moments he said i'm the angel over the water send me down there and i'll flood it i'll put that fire out he says no you've been a good angel he said but i'm not sending you this is my job he said i can see him take those priestly robes off lay them down that is strong and he said he reaches over and he calls for the east wind the west catches the zigzag of lightning and just in a few seconds not even seconds he's in the fire and that king aka not the king

has been fighting and pressing forward [Music] it's worth it all for the miracles that's been produced by the trials that you've watched the ministry of the son of man standing in it's been worth it to see all of the prodigals that have come home to see the deliverances that have happened because of the faith of a people moving higher we decided to move forward we didn't decide to retreat and right in the middle of the word forward is war and we have declared war on satan that we won't back up we won't back off but we have stood here and declared war and we have served notice on the devil
