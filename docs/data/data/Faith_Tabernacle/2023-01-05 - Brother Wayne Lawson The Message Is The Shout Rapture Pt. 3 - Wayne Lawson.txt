Rapture and this is going to be part three and you never know we may just get raptured out today tonight amen and uh all I know this will not be the same as we came in tonight amen and uh just like to say it's just really good to have everyone you can be seated for just a moment and but like to uh just uh thank everyone for coming and supporting the the services we've um this is I guess our fourth year doing it in January and the Lord's blessed us with good weather and so we really thank the Lord for that and uh uh it's just it seems like it's spring in in winter but uh we'll take it at least for this week and then it can snow whatever next week I guess but uh brother Sam's ready for it to snow he's got his snowmobiles ready so and I'm ready for it to snow but not this week amen so we just thank the Lord amen for holding it all off and and I want to say it's just good to have all of our visitors and the ministers that have come to support it I I know brother Mark and him and your congregation we really appreciate you uh supporting our services and seeing brother Ron and the brothers with him God bless you and brother Josh a man just a good friend of ours brother Tim brother Daryl amen we just we just don't take that lightly we I just really thank you for coming and you all are a blessing you the all you visitors are just a blessing to our church and um and we're just going to have a good time tonight and most of all we've got the greatest guests and that's our lord Jesus and and we just want him to have his way tonight and just speak to our hearts and you know every when you get a congregation together there's always needs that are present and you may have not even had them yesterday but they popped up today or something but Satan's just always warning and so we just want the Lord to have his way to just to walk down the aisles and touch everyone here tonight and you know as as we've been taught you you the congregation operates the gift we operate the gift and um and I believe the Lord has put a great gift in brother Wayne and he has dedicated his life to this message and to serve God's people and I I appreciate men such as that and and as he stands here tonight I I just know that God can move I've seen it time and time again and not just brother Wayne but in these ministers um they're present when they're preaching God just comes on the scene and begins to deal with lives and and the Lord can do that tonight can you say amen and so we want brother Wayne just to have his Liberty amen and take his time and and just preach and and whatever the Lord lays on his heart and we're here to receive amen so let's just stand to our feed and and um there's that uh song uh lately all I've got leaving on my mind amen lately all I've got his leaving on my mind oh yes yes it seems that's all about the most of the time soon my troubles far behind lay me I've got leaving all is that where your thoughts are tonight don't sing it again lately all I've got is leaving on in my mind oh it seems that's all I think about most of the time and very soon I'll be my troubles far behind [Music] lately I I've got me believe it on my mind oh lately is [Music] beautiful girls foreign [Music] I'm living it's me [Music] couldn't get it but all I need [Music] leave it on your mind tonight [Music] oh it's other thing almost of the time [Music] very soon [Music] [Music] strong sometimes we spend a few days overseas and you know I don't know sometimes maybe first time I went I went almost a month and I figured out that's not good for a married man with a family you know you maybe we can cut her down to about 10 15 at the most you know and but when you when you're on about the 13th day and you've got 15 and you're walking into that Sunday morning and and you know that Sunday night that you're going to pack your bags and you're off to the plane you got a different attitude you don't really care what they're doing or what everybody's thinking or there's they're making plans for next week and you walk right by their conversations and you'd only get included because you ain't going to be there you you know and I feel that way a little bit about this whole world you know they got a lot going on out here and there's a lot of things happening but it really doesn't uh it doesn't pertain to me because just any day now there's going to be a sweep move over this bride and we're going to be gone will be gone God bless you tonight certainly a great honor to have all these men of God in here tonight I amen I feel very humbled amen I am and uh this is this is the preacher tonight I told him I I wish we had enough mics for everybody to have one they could amen while I'm preaching why we'd have a time we'd have a time to sleep with Andrew and brother Ron God bless y'all for coming and Amen brother Mark there he's he's been here I guess they dismissed last night and came over amen it was good to have him here he's been a real Fellowship amen we think this the front row this this is a power roll this what's your calling brother you stand next to some powerful preachers over there tonight amen and uh amen amen and we certainly appreciate them driving up here tonight but Tim Josh and brother Daryl and amen I I counted such an honor uh preaching these kind of meetings and and just just centering on the very message of this hour and putting our Hearts here and our focus and and our lives and I know brother Andrew is going to be finishing the meeting we're going to be with you tomorrow night and then we're headed back home for the weekend but we want to appreciate brother Sean for allowing us to be here for these meetings it's always a blessing right in the middle of the week and and we we certainly have great confidence in brother Sean in the years and years we've known each other and stand right upon the word of God and we thank him for it amen and we want to tonight just before we take a scripture reading we'll bow our hearts together and let's just pray father it is an honor to stand in this place tonight and these men of God that have gathered here and these Saints Lord that have gathered around them Lord they have brought their confidence Lord they come to put their shoulder against the wheel the people of God come into feed and to Lord to feel the presence of God while they hear the word of God and Lord Jesus I pray tonight you take a hold of me Lord you would use me for your glory and your honor and Lord if if there be something to be spoken Lord we're we're asking you to give us a Divine leadership here in this meeting Lord and fathers we have our heart on Rapture we're centered here we're asking you to deal with us now lead us in this way we ask you father in Jesus name amen and amen and God bless you as you could be seated tonight I want to talk to you a little bit again about you can be civilia I want to talk to you again if we could uh from the message of course this is the third part on the Rapture subtitle I want to preach to you on the message is the shout the message is the shout now there will be a few of these things that is very familiar to you and you've heard them preached a lot of times but the revelation of the Rapture hasn't changed uh since the prophet spoke it now it has become clearer and we've been able to identify things maybe a little clearer since of the the times that was first spoken uh as it was brother Branham said things it was so far I didn't read the scripture that's what you were talking about amen I I didn't sorry I got our own conversation going on there uh I didn't uh I didn't uh things that was probably light years uh a way that a prophet spoke those things and then you know we're finally coming into them and uh and we we thank God for him I've already had you seated is it okay if I just read this to you we've been coming from first Thessalonians 4 and the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord and so shall we ever be with the Lord and I I just want to take this for a moment on the subject of the Rapture of course we've been defining it as a seizure or a capturing or a kidnapping which is completely different than most people look at the Rapture most people are thinking about how they work themselves into it and but what the Prophet preached to us is that it captures you it's something that came for you amen and and because you are a seed God has something for you and I and and uh as brother Brandon will begin this uh he he's talking to the Christians businessman of course brother Bradham uh is speaking to people that has a lot of a lot of opinions on what the Rapture is they've got thoughts and feelings and and they've got thoughts on what the Rapture is and uh it's amazing to me because he actually starts it by saying I'm going to take a different avenue he said now uh but how many in here believes the Bible teaches there will be a Rapture now he's actually talking to people that believes in Rapture but they don't believe in the Rapture the way he does and he says I'm going to take a different avenue well how could he have not taken a different avenue these men have taken every Avenue that every person down Through the Ages had took and they had taught things in a certain way way but nobody's sitting there knew that the message was the shout nobody nobody that was listening to him even had a clue that they were listening to the messenger of the Rapture speaking to them and he was taking a different Avenue and I I personally believe that that was the Avenue a man that Enoch took amen I believe that's the right Avenue that's the one the church wants to be on right we want to get on the path amen the Avenue William Branham was talking about and as we said it last night it wasn't opened amen until a certain season and then when that season came there was an opening for it now brother Bradham says you're not a blind people you're a responsible people a sensible people and he said if I stood here and I said these things for a Prejudice he said I don't I say it because it's life and because I'm responsible to God for saying it and I must say it and and my message and knowing all the time back there it's got to come forth knowing the message would come forth here it as them Seven Seals have been opened the Mysteries showing things that has happened he said I didn't know it of course he's saying that he's not saying it for prejudice now he was saying it for need and we'll get to this a little bit but he was saying it because it's what it needed to be spoken he he wasn't even saying it because he thought it would just please the people or it would say something good but he knowed that the bride needed this word spoken and he couldn't speak it without Crossing up other ideas because those men had already spoke those things and it was not necessary for them to speak it but they had spoken and they built denominations upon it and he was listening to disagree with all of them and he was trying to get he was trying to let him know it's not that I don't like brother Smith or not that I don't like Martin Luther or I don't like John Wesley they did their job and he elevated them as messengers of the ages he said but see if they would have lived long enough they'd be here where we are tonight payment because it wasn't opened in that time is the reason they didn't preach it that way but but they got lutherans today who are saying well Martin Luther didn't believe it like that but if Martin Luther was here Martin Luther would believe it like that amen because he preached the current revelation of the age he lived him and I believe today that's exactly where the bride of Christ is standing and some of the things we preach may sound prejudiced to other people or other denominations or other ways of believing but we're really not being prejudiced to them we don't I don't at least I'm not I'm not being prejudiced to the ideas of men but we must preach this rapture we must preach this Rapture somebody said well preacher why are we going to preach Paul said we must Comfort one another with these words come on we got to preach this Rapture y'all know amen y'all know Divine Healing is something that was done 2 000 years ago Divine Healing brother bam said it on the table of gold he said Jesus couldn't heal you if he was here in the building tonight he said healing was already paid for at Calvary and the only way you excess it is by the preaching of the word it builds faith and Faith translates into healing but the fountain come on now I'm talking about Divine Healing preaching amen if I if you want salvation the blood's already been given for it and a man preaches salvation by the word amen somebody put a a sin a quote a bit ago and they said you know the thing about this is the preaching of the word is the casting out of demons it's not you're not saving a person by the words you're saying you're casting a demon aways from somebody so they can believe the word and when they believe the word they're saved now now come on church I'm saying there's salvation faith and there's healing Faith but there is rapturing Faith and the bride must hear rapturing preaching to bring a rapturing faith somebody said well all he wants to preach on is the rapture you betcha that's all I want to preach on because it's the revelation of the age I'm living on and I pray that God put the Rapture Revelation in the church and bring Faith up to the place where it's at it's not that it's not available amen it's not that it's not available it's here amen but we must preach it and and and and as I said other times of course other men are called for other things and I'm not against other men who are called for other things but I've been called for this this is the calling on my life this is what draws me when I look at the scripture when I think about the people this is where it brings me now other men it takes some other places but this is it's this is where my heart is this is my life God put it on our heart to do these things now the prophet of God said of course amen that this is not for prejudice it's for need amen and and and the prophet of God said of course he said if there's if there's not a Rapture where are we at come on y'all y'all looking at the news and the situations that's going on and the problems that are everywhere you you start trying to fix it and you'll think well if we could fix it like this and and you go to the school teacher and she said well if we could just get it fixed we could get it fixed but we can't fix it at the school because we got to fix it at home and then and then if you go to the homes they can't fix it because the homes are they don't have any foundation the half the fathers are not even staying and raising children and the mothers are not staying and they're going amen half of your generation was raised by grandparents amen because that people there's no foundations to any of it you you can't where you're going to how far are you going to go back because if you go back to the families then you got to say well we need a good church and then you go back to the church and the in the organization is undermined the premisary and and so so it's all gone folks it's a it's empty it has nothing behind it amen that's why God gave us a Rapture as a way of Escape he said with every Temptation there is a way of escape and I believe tonight that God gave this bride a way of escape and matter of fact he said God would bring an escape upon the church and it's for the bride of Christ the man's okay if I get rid of this jacket amen is for the bride of Christ amen now what are we speaking about amen we're talking about the the who is for it's for brother bam said now this Rapture is for the bride and then he says it's only one that's going to be in the Rapture nothing but the right the elected ones the foreknown of God from the father's spiritual genes now that's powerful stuff friends the father's spiritual genes amen and then it makes kidnapping clear don't it amen it's not him taking somebody else's kid he's just taken his own son before the fire falls amen he's got every right to pick his little boy up and say all right we're getting you out of here and he said well I want no you ain't staying we're getting you out of here judgment is coming it's a kidnapping or a seizing but it's his own child that he's taken come on you're not the Son of Perdition you're not the daughter of Perdition you're the Sons and Daughters of almighty God and God sent a Vindicated Prophet to tell you so oh come on church amen this message didn't come to condemn you it come to redeem you now in the leadership powerful sermon in leadership brother Branham actually says this your physical contacts the physical your spiritual contacts the spiritual but inside of you you've got a soul and that soul is the gene that come from God ooh brother amen amen there's three levels to a man and that third level to a Believer to a redeemable child of God the soul is the gene that came from God Amen the prophet of God modern events paragraph 172 the real ordained of God the real Gene that real germ is a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world you amen that's really got the spirit of God tonight you were in Christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily amen and skipping here a little bit then if you were the gene a gene a word an attribute from the beginning then you walked with him here upon the earth now somebody said well brother Wayne when did we get the seed let me say what the prophet said God who's rich in Mercy he said when that little baby is born into the world there's something in that baby if he's ever going to have life there's something in there in that child he said he'll come sooner or later that little seed is in him and the scriptures plainly declare it again God rich and mercy one day you being a part of god you being a part of the word you when you heard the words you knew you where you come from you know that was the truth you always you were always the seed was in you and then the word sing the word now watch that the word sing the word amen he was telling you you were the word when you come into this Earth amen and he sent A Spoken Word by a prophet into this Earth and when the word meets the word amen there's a reaction is that right that you were the word and this is the word and it comes together amen just like a husband and a wife just like a father and a son just like a eagle and a baby eagle it's word coming to word that's right you always were amen somebody said well brother Wayne Amen I got I got I I come to a new birth down in the Pentecostal church and so how in the world could I be listen there's a great secretly in here the prophet told us it's about atmosphere and he said if you were a seed you always were a seed he said and let me tell you this you can take a seed he said you can take a duck egg you can take a chicken egg amen or an eagle egg and put it under a chicken and hatch it and brother bam actually said it happened one time he said they took a duck egg and put it under a chicken he said and they hatched it amen that means that somebody could be hatched in the wrong place they can be hatched amen they will understand some old teacher amen got all um everything all messed up payment amen but if you get it in the right atmosphere and if there's a seed of God in that heart it'll come to life brother amen but if it comes to life and it's enough to begin with it'll be an ugly duck as long as it lives in the chicken yard amen it'll be there in a wonder why it don't think like others think oh they don't feel like others feel but brother mom said one day there's a duck born in that chicken yard y'all know the story he said he'd come around the barn he said he got a sin of that water and straight to the water he went then he could understand his bill then he could understand his web feet he probably he probably wanted feet like everybody else but all of a sudden he realized he was born different and he was always going to be different he just needed to get in the right place with the right people Old Church of the Living God when I came to this message I found my kind of people I found shouting people I found believing people I found Holy Ghost people and this generation that we're living in you call me a duck if you want to but brother I got a sin of the water amen and ain't nothing glory to God Amen that old took off running brother bam said he jumped jumped in the in the pond and there it went to swimming come on I think it's powerful brother you know what he said he said brother bam said we used to have an old swimming hole he said I'd run down there and jump in that old swimming hole you remember it he said we talked about he said you never knew what the water was going to be like he said so I said I had one pen in my overalls just had one pen he said he said I had a little little nail hanging there he said the rest of them had to stop and take her and deal with her clothes he said but not me he said I'd be running I'd pull that pen he said I'd walk right out of them overhauls he said and jump into that pond he said if it was good he said you'd turn back and say it's good come on in boys I'll tell you what the prophet got in the water before you and me amen but I tell you what he did he went back and way back at the church and said it's good Waters come on in church come on in I'll tell you something tonight amen some of us has been in the waters of life and I think we ought to be able to wave into the church tonight and say the water's good come on in amen when's the last time that you got to swim around in the bless sing to the Holy Ghost and the power of the Living God let me tell you it's a powerful thing to come into the presence of the Living God ah goodness amen the same thing there is to a Believer when he meets God face to face he comes to himself the seed is in him and he's quickened they commence filter that word cannot deny itself and it then it's satisfied or a desire of what what made you desire it in the first place now that's a that is a that is a that is a life question what made you like this message what made you want this message brother banham said I've got to turn my timer on too amen he said what it is he said what it is he said it's because your desire in the first place down in your soul that was a predestinated seed which was eternal life and it was always there so preacher what are you doing I'm justifying God of getting you God is Justified in the beginning of you you belong to him he didn't steal nothing you you were his to begin with and the only reason he shed the blood was to buy back his own boat y'all know that story about that sailboat that little boy lost it didn't he but one day he saw in the pawn shop and he said that's my boat and he went and said mister that's my boat he said well somebody found it and if you wanted it's a certain price and he paid the price he bought his own boat well I'll tell you God bought his own bride and he's the Justified and taking it you're double redeemed don't you you double bought you were used to begin with and he also paid for you pawn shop can't hold you come on there ain't no leans against your life you're free and you're free if you want to be free if you want to be free I'm on church if you want to be free you're free tonight there's no leans against you it's nothing can hold you come on church you can let go and let God if you so desire amen amen there's a seed on the inside of you and here's the powerful thing do you know that seed won't receive anything that she won't receive just anything Brother Band said there's nothing to get into that but the Holy Ghost my goodness amen he said there's nothing can get in that seed but the Holy Ghost it's that germ it might come to life anywhere but nothing can get into it but the Holy Ghost amen it's a germ a seed from the beginning that was in God at the beginning standing there drawing that Seed Life this seed is in Your Heart by for the nation Hallelujah the seed is already in there by the foreknowledge of God predestinated and when it draws it can't draw nothing else but the word my goodness has been a filter put in us the filters a built-in filter the gene seed of God and can only draw the word of the or the holy ghost out of the word isn't it powerful what is it it's a drawing power there's only one thing that will pass through that word that's the Holy Ghost that's the Holy Ghost so preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about things that are to be amen raptured part two things that are to be brother bam said a real child of God is hungering and thirsting and if there's something in your heart telling you you want it and it needs it there it shows something pulsating trying to pull you there if there's something wanting to change if there's a body a desire for the body change there's got to be one somewhere I'm on Church there's not a fish that has a fin on his back unless there's a puddle of water to swim it in amen and there's not a desire in your heart to walk from one dimension to another unless there's a way to do it amen there's got to be something I I don't know I don't know I I I I I how could I say it I know we're all on the same page here but I'm gonna talk about me my desire is to feel the elements of my body I want to know what it's like to find mortal elements change to be immortal elements I want to be even the Fulfillment of first Thessalonians 4 as something in my life that is the greatest pool on my life it has pulled me through everything every situation every argument every five every every destitute every desperate thing every family problem every Church problem every world problem when others just stopped on the roadside and for some reason I kept pressing it's this Rapture that I'm interested in I'm interested in the change of my body well if I'm that interested in it if I desire it that much there has got to be a Rapture somewhere foreign and thirsting if there's something there there's something trying to pull you there there's a body that's there amen there's a body that's there one of this type here what are you using this for and glorify the devil in the world but there's something up there you're glorifying god with your life In My Father's House of many mansions if it wasn't so I wouldn't have told you I go and prepare a place and come again to receive you unto myself things that are to be things that are now only potential our calling for things that are to be he said preacher what are you saying I'm saying William Branham preached the Rapture because there was a seed in you for rapture now I want you in the message things that are to be brother Brown says something that's very powerful he said listen before a little baby is born it's craving for vitamins and a mother's word specs and says Dad I want cantaloupe or I want watermelon I want something another he said well he'll do anything he can to get it because he wants his child born as perfect as it can be how many of you had them babies hey man you you know you'd weather the cold night to get out and get get your wife now you boys ain't got a guy married yet you ain't got babies you don't understand this but but to anybody's got babies and your wife over and she she gets to want some pickles with her ice cream they ain't no pickles in the house you'll get up on a cold night and slip your clothes on go down to the market amen and pick her up some pickles or get some ice cream you'll do something because she's asking for it and that that's your baby you want perfection in your baby and you you can say well that's the weirdest that's the weirdest appetite anybody ever had why do you want that kind of food why you want why you want bananas on peanut butter with mayonnaise why what you want that for wait a minute it's showing you she never wanted that before she never liked that before pulling for something because something is coming into existence and you maybe were in the world or you was loving the things and amen you was out there doing whatever you was going to do Amen Brother on you remember I've heard your testimony you were doing whatever you want to do but one day you got to craving something else you got to want something else amen I remember very distinctly when God wouldn't let me alone for two years amen it was a war I couldn't go to sleep I couldn't go deer hunting I couldn't be alone amen because every moment of my life something was pulling at me what was it it was God pulling at that seed but he had a prophet to speak those words because there was something in me that needed that word to develop develop a perfect life and there's a life on the inside of you and a God Amen brother Adam says it like this he said God will call a man to the pulpit to preach something because of your need because of your need come on sometimes you need it when you don't even know you need it I could preach a little while right here sometimes God will have a man preach something you don't even know why he's preaching it but you got a need of it come on they didn't think we needed Seven Seals preached but God knew we needed Seven Seals I didn't even there was Seven Seals but when God said we needed it he opened up the green beans and because it was a bride needing vitamins and you can't eat it till it's open you can't walk it till it's broke but we are in a generation where God has gave us every vitamin of the word of God to fulfill whatever desire we have in this generation he'll call somebody to the pulpit to speak it so brother Wayne I wasn't even here when brother Brown preached the Rapture that's all right that's all right but let me say let me tell you what he said in paragraph 181 he said we're ready now waiting for the Rapture God calls somebody to preach it now he said the Rapture of the Saints it has been spoken and so shall it be in the end of the Rapture sermon if you listen to that tape very often you're going to notice something along towards the end of it brother Brown's going to say I believe that woman wants us to leave I believe that woman wants us to leave she came to the back of the room they had expired their stay things had come to an end and she's wanting to kick the prophet out come on church and he's saying his last words over this congregation he's only got a few more sermons to preach amen and here he is saying these last words and they're trying to kick him out that woman's trying to put him out he said but I've got to say a few more things and he finishes a Rapture and said it has been spoken so shall it be look at that he had to force his way and hold back the doors and preach it when he wasn't even wanted to preach it when they didn't even desire him to preach it but he knew that was coming to church it was coming to Pride he knew we was going to need this word and he said it has been spoken so shall it be he took those last minutes he said take the offering and pray pray for it if you'd like to now you say preacher what what are you getting that I I was I was blessed one time I think it was in Jeffersonville when I first heard that so it's been so concerned I didn't really want to preach on it because I thought am I making too much out of this it has been spoken so shall it be so I actually was similar was with the brothers notes on the Rapture was laying out I think I was in Jeffersonville and I walked by and I looked down at his handwritten notes in a big block it was written it has been spoken so shall it be and I thought oh he wasn't no accident he meant to say that amen he meant to put those words out there and he knew what he was doing church he knew he was speaking the Rapture for this generation it has been spoken so shall it be when God says anything all heavens and earth will pass away but that word will never fail paragraph 182 he said when God set back there in Genesis 1. look what he's comparing his ministry to amen back there in Genesis 1 it might have been 100 years before there was any light but he said let there be a palm tree let there be an oak let there be a desert let there be a mountain let there be this he spoke it you see and as long as it went out of his mouth in a word it had to be manifested it had to be as long as it went out of his mouth it had to be spoken and once it was spoken it would manifest it had to be paragraph 189 brother bam Compares himself to Isaiah amen how did Jesus get into the Earth folks Isaiah prophesied of him 800 years before he ever came and brother man said an intelligent young man that one day under inspiration he said he couldn't help but saying it a virgin shall conceive can you imagine how silly they looked at him him a Vindicated Prophet amen didn't have anything lined up to fix that or he made but he spoke that word and said a virgin shall conceive unto us the son is born and unto us a child is given his name should be called counselor and Prince of Peace body God Everlasting father and of his government there shall be no end he said there shall be no end to this rain how could that man intelligently say that a virgin should conceive everybody look for it though and it's done been spoken it was the saith the Lord it had to come to pass because it was God's word and that's the same as it was in Genesis when he planted them seeds down there beneath that sea it was without form and void and water was upon the deep but it had to come to pass and one day 800 years later there was a womb of aversion conceived of the Sea of God and created and she brought forth a son my when that Prophet spoke it you've heard it preached 800 years it circled the Earth come on Church it had been there longer than that because when God told Eve amen the woman sees shall bruise the head of the serpent that was the same seed and it had been frozen since the Garden of Eden waiting for somebody to have it when God told Abraham he would have a son Isaac was not the son he was talking about Jesus was the son and Mary produced the son of Abraham Jesus Christ and Mary produced the son of God Amen what was it it was the spoken word fell into the womb oh it was a virgin whom it fell into nothing mingled with it brother so when it produced It produced Purity It produced something that was not corrupted you see what he was talking about the prophet of God said the womb amen of the church is their mind he said this word falls into the spirit of your mind and you let it fall into your heart and there the womb produces the womb produces the word in the generation that is spoken in [Applause] the preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about the Virgin born son of God brother bam said it was the son of the Virgin the manifested word let me ask you that amen what are you producing the manifested word from the Virgin womb brother man said when that son was born he said the same son that came from the words of Isaiah stood at the grave of Lazarus and he said Lazarus come forth what was it amen God produced the voice of Resurrection by the spoken word of Isaiah and the Church of the Living God brother random says the message is the shout but the bride is the voice and when he prophesied of a bride coming that fell into the womb of the church and that same thing that is produced through the church is the voice of Resurrection now I'll tell you what Amen in the days of Martin Luther when he preached his message amen the lutherans came to him and they raised up and they came and John Wesley they raised up and they came is that right amen and and in the days of the Reformation under the baptism of the spirit they raised up and they came amen but under the message of the hour they've raised up and they came can I say something to y'all but this is the opening of the Lamb's Book of Life and when you begin to believe this this is going to bring forth every saint of every age that has ever been in the ground we're going to draw power out of the ground ironius out of the grand Ruth that's going to come out of the ground by your faith in this word it will deliver everything yeah what has been produced what has been produced is the voice of Resurrection show it to you in the scripture Jesus called the resurrection Jesus called the resurrection the bride is the voice of Resurrection somebody told me one time so brother when I was preaching that wrong I said we are I said didn't brother bam say the voice is in the bride they said yeah but it doesn't say the voice of resurrections in The Bride I said well you're smarter than I am they said what do you mean I said well I've never been able to take the resurrection out of the voice of God I figure if God speaks there's Resurrection in The Voice amen I I'm just I'm sorry I'm oh hillbilly I figure there's power in that voice there's Resurrection in that voice it's anointing in that voice I'm talking about something here's an eye the Flesh of this message is the voice of Resurrection in this generation and that ain't somebody that was and that is somebody that's coming I'm talking about you I'm looking at the voice of the Resurrection in the last day not that you're going to stand over a grave and call your loved ones names that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about a seed that's in the field waiting for the harvest season who calls who caused the Resurrection The the seed or the farmer I tell you who does it the farmer does it and whatever grain is in the is in the is in The Granary bin they don't call for the Harvest they're already there the ones that causes the Harvest is the grain that's in the field but when they get into the ripening condition when the when the ripening comes their voice calls for them to bring a harvest into the Earth and as this bride begins to mature Harvest Harvest will become brother Brown said it's been spoken it will come to pass all right that's pretty powerful stuff folks if you if you miss anything else about the Rapture tape go back and listen to this it's been spoken it shall come to pass it'll get you through everything it'll get you through everything it's the vision that it gets you through it all right y'all know brother man when he went to that doctor and he come back and gave him that discouragement he said brother man Angel met him remember he met him he said now don't let him do that to you it's just your stomach and brother Brown said if it hadn't been for the vision I'd have been a very discouraged boy all right think about Joe think about Joshua standing there at those walls without a vision hey man I got one I'm not using it so sorry I did that to you again didn't I I just like to see him walk down that oh the Hank job God bless him he did something for the for the man of God God bless him amen what's this it's it's been spoken she'll shall be now if you go to First Corinthians 15 51 Paul is the same writer of Corinthians and Thessalonians and he said behold I show you a mystery and we don't have a lot of time to preach there but I'll say this and Amos it tells us that a mystery can only be revealed by a prophet so Paul locks the Rapture at this point and he said we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed telling us it takes the presence of God to change living and change dead it takes him to change all but it says in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the Trump shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall all be changed now look at the beauty of this for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality and when this corruptable shall put on incorruption this Mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory now if you if you if you recognize that he's talking about both resurrection and rapture he's talking about Mortal becoming Immortal he's not like corrupted becoming incorrupted and he's showing you that there's a change going to happen in the flesh that's what Paul is preaching to us it's happening in the in the flesh now the reality is this that there has to be a stopping of the corruption in your body and a reversal of that corruption to incorruption now job will say this in job 14. he said oh that thou will hide me in the grave that thou will just keep me secreted to thy wrath has passed and that would support me a set time and remember me now if a man shall die shall he live again in all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come Thou shalt call and I will answer thee that will have the desire to the work of thine hands now the prophet of God actually will explain job to us in a message called the end time seed sign now I know as well as preaching to you I'm setting this uh maybe a few my watch it later and so I want to quote this point to you end time seed sign when I first studied this sermon in depth I wondered why he would call it the end time seed sign but it's preached right after spoken word Original Seed and he preaches end time seed sign and uses the scripture Amos 3 the Lord Our God shall do nothing until he first sends it by a prophet and he says in in he begins by saying and being a prophet we know the story of Job God finally explained to job that the seed of man was imperfect because the mother of man had failed that that what job remember job looked at the at the at the flowers and he said they go down and they come back and he said the tree it goes down and it comes back he said but man now when we place him in the grave he said he stays there remember he just keeps staying there now what God was doing was he was showing job in nature in a short cycle see if you if you want to understand the resurrection and and maybe you're not going to live from the time to a resurrection of humanity but if you put a flower in the ground you see it next spring so you can see the witness of Resurrection in nature because in one year you see a death a burial and a resurrection and brings it back to the same now if you don't want to study it in a year long or an annual Resurrection brother Brown said it actually happens daily by the sunshine he said the sun comes up in the morning right he said that's your birth and then it comes to 10 o'clock and there's your teenage years and then it hits that noon sun he said there's your middle age he said then you see it begin to fall right he said now when it goes down in the evening he said that's not all of it in the morning he said it'll raise up again he shows you death burial and Resurrection every day of your life Garnet Pink's funeral actually brother Branham brings it out and he says look in that in that point he says he says now everything witnesses that Garnet will raise again he actually speaking now and he says the Bible testifies he will he said the son testifies he will he said the flowers testify he will he said it's the word of God doing the testifying you say preacher what are you saying job was seeing that he was seeing the testimony in the son he was seeing the testimony in the nature but he hadn't seen the actual Resurrection yet so he said what's the matter with man that he goes in the ground he don't come again but brother Adam said but what happened he was a prophet so God showed him the secret he said what it was he said he had known to the prophets he spoke the word and when he spoke the word God showed him and it become material it was a spoken word now what he had seen was is he had seen when God spoke the word in the Garden of Eden now don't lose our train it has been spoken so shall it be amen back there in the Garden of Eden when he spoke that word back there amen Adam and Eve lived in Perfection until Eve corrupted the word and what job saw in Vision being a prophet was we fail because of that corruptive word he's said but then being a prophet God didn't leave him in just see him the problem as a lot of people can see problems folks but job being a prophet he didn't just see the problem but he turned and said oh I see what it is it's the corrupted word he said then there must come another spoken word that will be without corruption and job turns around remember in job 19 and 25 he said I know that my redeemer liveth and they shall stand in the latter days upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God and whom should I see for myself my eyes Shall Behold Him and not another though the Reigns be consumed within me he said preacher wise That's so exciting because that Resurrection was being prophesied by job himself he was talking about his own body was going to come out of the ground and then he said put me in the ground if you want to but my change is coming my change is coming I tell you something that I church amen I believe there's been people in this generation that'll speak the resurrection and the Rapture by the preaching of the word of God it has been spoken hey hey amen no wonder David could send my flesh shall rest in hope the flesh arrests and hope it had already been spoken my said preacher what are you talking about if you can find more corruption come in I can tell you how to stop it come on church we are reversing the death cycle we are stopping the corruption cycle and we're moving from a death cycle to a life cycle the cycle of the Rapture is already on us amen the cycle of the change is already on us somebody said well when's this Rapture going to start it'd be like me going in the house and Chris in there washing clothes amen there's Cycles so that there's a rent cycle and a wash cycle and a tumble side all them Cycles is there but the minute she pushes that power button she just started washing my clothes and after a little while when it's all over I'll take my clothes out of the finished cycle amen and if I'd say it to you sisters the washing machine's running already amen the cycle of the spoken word has already came into the Church of the Living God we're not waiting on the prophet to say it this spot will have the saith the Lord or shall stand still that's why Prophet turned around and said now she has the saith the Lord then the prophet will say it like this the move is on for the bride it's time to go church it's time to go the cycle of the Rapture is a Polish in this generation stopping at this cycle stopping the death cycle and beginning a life cycle it's in the scripture second Corinthians 11 and 2 I'm jealous over thee with The Godly jealous for I have a spouse neither one husband that I may present you a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear my last any means the serpent begalled Eve through stability so will your minds be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ Paul knew it was corruption that caused the problems too but in the mystery of First Corinthians 15 he is preaching a prophet coming with a spoken word of clarity without corruption come on it was The Incorruptible word of God that was being spoken it's a preacher I don't believe words have that much power have you read your Bible lately [Music] have you read your Bible lately what condition was evelist in before she listened to the words perverted by Satan she was in a condition of perfection she was in a condition of eternal life everything was perfect one word twisted around pulled her out of Peace into nervousness out of Peace into depression out of joy and salvation into a fall they fell from eternity into the Earth what a fall they had what a fall it was oh but thanks be to God Amen he said the word being tormented and twisted brought them out but if the word being broke can bring somebody out what about when the word is restored to the Church of the Living God this word can take you from a nervousness back to Joy it can take you from an Age of Anxiety into the peace of God it can take you from death to life it can take you from Mortal the immortality it can take you from correction to win corruption I'm talking about the power of the spoken word of God in this generation uh it's been spoken so shall it be [Applause] let me say it like this if snake if Satan could snatch her from the Garden of Eden by a corrupted word then God can snatch a bride out of laodicea by a perfect word and we now have the perfect interpretation of the perfect word and it's come to snatch you [Applause] where the car can see who's there the Eagles shall be gathered together we won one in the bear two in the back one live one taken two in the field one left one taken where's this gonna happen Lord where the carcass is there the Eagles will gather together man lives by every word see the power of the Gospel to snatch you out of the hands of the enemy so preacher I'll tell you what man don't feel like Rapture to me let me know I'm going to present the way the prophet did end time seed sign he said what did Elijah tell that woman she went nothing but a handful of meal he said make me a curse first now I'm telling you that was a poor little woman without money or without food and if that Prophet asked to be fed first it wasn't because he wasn't a gentleman come on Church it wasn't that he wasn't a gentleman but he knew a law of God if you'll take my word first you won't have no more need your life is over your days of destitute are finished your days of famine have ended into a great feast of the Lord and when that woman amen when that woman obeyed that word he come back and said the saith the Lord the millbarrow will never go dry the curse will never run empty again when she was at the bottom oh my god when she was at the end that's when Elijah came and when the laodicea was at the end of his rope it was at the end of things that's when the prophet came and said give me what you got first and then I'll give you the saith the Lord I'll give you a word that'll snatch you out of your denomination it'll snatch you out and bring you into this great Rapture of life amen what brother bam said he said the miracle happens after you take God's word everybody was not being rude it was not being prejudiced you needed a word and he preached it even though it rubbed him them theologians wrong you began to believe God's word and the Miracle takes place on that word that's a refrigerator quote the miracle takes place on the word because the word is a seed that brings forth the miracle got to take the word first amen I said preacher what are you trying to say brother man said it's the law that's what Mary did remember Gabriel met her and testified to the word and said a virgin shall conceive that's your type now an angel came and said this is the word she checked it by the book of Isaiah and then she said be it unto me according to Thy word no feelings no Sensations no emotions she just took the word now some theologians took that and tried to make it the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not right the same woman just a few days later went up into the upper room and received the Holy Ghost come on Church you don't have to have a feeling to take the word but when you get the Holy Ghost it's a different story altogether I'm not feeding emotionalism and I'll tell you this hey man if you ever got what I got you'd know you got it I was a sinner amen I was in the I tell you what I feel I'm preaching right now I tell you what I I tell you this if you was as poor as I was poor and somebody walked in and handed you a billion dollars you'd feel it from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head and if you was as lost as I was lost when God gave me the Holy Ghost brother I felt it from the bottom of my feet to the top of my head and it ain't never left me my goodness I think the Young's Brothers saying it he gave me something I could feel I could preach all night on that point I said preacher why were you what are you talking about because brother Brown well my goodness let me just say it real clear brother man said why do they call me a Holy Roller I'm identified with that guy take the rapture as a seed oh boy have you ever thought that you're taking the Rapture as a seed you're accepting the Rapture as a seed when you receive this message you are receiving the seed of rapture when you believe it when you accept it into your life you are accepting the seed of rapture somebody said well I thought we were already seen Mary was seed when Isaiah said a virgin would conceive she was the seed but when Gabriel come he brought her Isaiah's word and seed come to seed and there was manifestation there's a word seed right there's a word seed and then there's a jean seed the prophet's message is the word seed you're the gene seed and they got to come together the predestinated plan of God is in view just as the seed other seeds must have ground prepared beforehand must have ground prepared before him this message had to have ground prepared to receive it works as faith is expressed that's the very very brother Brown said it's got to be prepared he said there's the predestinated plan just as other seeds the word of God is a seed and must have a ground prepared before amen now Jesus said a little lower in his Parable he said the ground has been made ready first so God in Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first he prepares you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he foreknew You by foreknowledge and ordained you to eternal life and he knew you therefore he prepared you that poor legalist Devil's flopping out the floor right now I'm talking about a snatching kidnapping a seizing God planted this in you he prepared you for it God's power to transform brother Brahman said Enoch he's our type was translated from Death By God's transforming power what did God do that for for a type for a Rapture that's coming paragraph 254 saying message he said the word has got to come to pass it's God's word planet in your heart if you want to go in the Rapture if you want to be a genuine Christian place this word I believe it was Ezekiel God said take the scroll and eat it up that prophet and the word became the same and every promise in here has to be manifest because it's God's original seed don't let some educated Theologian come out here and pump it out of you don't you let them spray you with that carnal science of knowledge and education you believe God Amen what's he telling you eat this take this message into you amen as a as a as a remember as that expecting mother take that message into you take the seed of the word into you as expecting mother craves food We crave the seed of rapture we knew we had to have it we knew something something wasn't satisfying there's an empty sound in the Pentecostals there's an empty sound in the lutherans there's a it's it's some of it's okay but there's just something's just not it didn't have the seed of rapture in it it could justify you it could sanctify you it could get you to get but it couldn't bring Rapture into your life but this message brings Rapture it's a rapturing faith and a Rapture and anointing it's a strange call Brother bam said it's a strange call he said I read in the past I read in the paper I'm gonna have to hurry he should have read in the paper the other day about a boy sucking on a bicycle now now friends he said that boy wasn't sucking on the bicycle Palace mom cut now his mom come out and caught him doing that and took him to the doctor you know why she took him to the doctor because it's a strange thing to see a kid of that age sucking on a bicycle pedal most kids ride them most kids using the bicycle you don't go out and see your kid on a bicycle and take it to the doctor and ask what's wrong but the minute it sucked on the bicycle pedal this kid's different something wrong with this kid and she took him to the message to find out what's wrong with this kid why do they just keep coming down that Altar and praying for that Holy Ghost why they keep asking for God why they keep they just won't quit they just want you've seen it brother Daryl in our meetings people sometimes you'll come by and pray and next year some of them same kids will be saying I want that Holy Ghost I want there's something about them that they just can't quit till they get that absolute what's wrong with them right brother ma'am said I'll tell you what was wrong with him he said they come to find out he didn't have enough sulfur in his body right y'all heard that he didn't have enough sulfur in his body he said but see it was in that bicycle pedal he said because it had came from the Earth where his body had came from so what happened is in his birth he had bypassed the need for the sulfur that was needed for life so there was somewhere their sulfur was and it was just in that bicycle so being he bypassed it in his birth he had to find it in another place so when he found it in the bicycle pedal he didn't care it was a bicycle pedal he just sucked on it anyhow come on church and you bypass your theophany when you was born into this Earth and when you come here you came about this theophany amen but one day you said I gotta have something I gotta have more than I got and you started back towards the word of God and started started listening to the message of the hour which everybody thought was no more than a bicycle panel amen but you was ready to do it and somebody says what's wrong with them I tell you what's wrong with them they got a gene seed on the inside and they bypass the word when they was born here but now they're coming back to the word and one of these mornings this word is going to change our middle bodies back to what it was to begin with amen they all come out of the ground didn't they and why are you feeding on this open book church because you was in the book before you were here and this message is the calling out of that book this message is the preaching of the book of redemption in this generation you're going back to where you come from that baby's born into the Earth and immediately it turns back to its mother and begins to nurse on the breasts of his mother where it came from and we come from God and we're returning to God God sent a message in this generation a door a door to return according to John 5 24 we're going to bypass judgment we're not coming into condemnation and you're going to need something to get around judgment and brother Brown says since you ain't going in judgment he produced a Rapture for the church and you're going in a Rapture instead of the Judgment you're going into a change instead of the instead of the Judgment seat we're going into the change of our body we've already passed death and came into life and you can put us in the ground but we will never die foreign says this bra to be waiting for the Revelation this rapture but there won't be no higher order than a prophet to bring the word right so we have the revelation of rapture that's why you're feeding on the message that's what's causing you to go there to feed it's it is strange I know it is it's odd for you to believe this compared to what the world believes but the reason behind it is different than what they think we're eating this way because our bodies are going to do something different than theirs if you're going to do something different you need a different food come on church we know we are what we eat y'all don't tell what I've been eating been eating that homemade biscuits and gravy and some fried chicken ain't nothing but ain't nothing as good if you don't fry it I'm down south I'm preach it out Cana I hope my home Church ain't listening ain't nothing as good as you fry it you know boy you don't only taste good you wear it sometimes I just hope we wear the message brother bam says you know that we're waiting on the Revelation if you read the message of the rapture he says we're waiting on it and just a few pages later he tells you the revelation of the rapture he tells you the revelation of the Rapture how no how many knows God does things in threefold purposes when you're listening to the message of the seventh seal you'll hear something beautiful Brittany he'll say that there's three folds to the seventh seal in the seven seal book he'll say all Heaven quiet everything hushed up he says but think of it he opened it and then he'll say here's my revelation of it he said it was in a threefold purpose and I will tell you of a foal of it but the mark first time I heard that amen somebody said you can't prove it by the seven sealed book I said I think I can but we'll listen to it and so I listened to the to the seal and you know honestly brother bam didn't tell you what it was he just said he said you know he says well I'll tell you a fold of it and then so I'm listening to it and brother Amos I'm looking for him to tell me the scripture and kind of teach it out you know what it is they don't tell you he just starts talking about his own life he starts talking about Sabino Canyon about this vision of these angels and he starts talking about all these things and how they came so I rewounded and I listened to it again I thought well brother ma'am I appreciate what you're saying there but I thought she's going to tell us what the first four of the seven seal was and let's do it again and listen to it again then listen to it again and then I don't know maybe it was a hundredth time I said it's here he said he was going to tell us and I'm sitting here listening to it and then it hit me oh the word coming to the prophet was the first fold of the seventh seal oh my goodness it wasn't a Doctrine it was something God was doing in our generation bringing the word to a prophet because he had to speak it he had to say it it had to be spoken through the lips of a prophet it was sending angels and you know that broke into that pyramid maybe and maybe Andrew will get to it ain't gonna have time but it gets into the Pyramid of Junior Jackson and moves out there in that pyramid of seven angels and out of it comes the third pull the Sword and the Hand the word and brother Ben was talking about that third pull well then the next sermon he goes to Christ the mystery and he said it's in threefold right he said now the first foal of it is a revealing the second foal of it is the Revelation takes preeminence and the third is the changing or taking back to Eden so we have the seven seal in threefold we have Christ the mystery threefold and then when he comes to the Rapture he takes you to first Thessalonians 4 he says it's in threefold he said first we've got to shout and then we've got a voice just leave it up there we've got to shout he said then we got a voice he said then we got a trump the shout is the revealing of the word the voice is when the word revealed falls into the womb of the Bride and the and the son of that black calls the resurrection it's the voice and the trumpet is the very change of our body that's why we don't know at what point that's going to happen could be tonight could be this very hour somebody said well I thought something had to happen you know what brother Mann said it's the Readiness of the Bride he said that's all we're looking for is the Readiness of the Bride is that what he said he said when you know who you are this Rapture is going to go when this Revelation gets so prevalent over your life that you're done arguing with it when you're done arguing he said you're a son to begin with why do you want to argue with that just say yes I was a son to begin with you're the anointed children yeah I'm the anointed child of God you are The Virtuous sinless bride of Amen I'm The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ amen I tell you what I'm done arguing with this message I think we ought to believe it there's a miracle on it preach man there's a miracle on it in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the seventh seal brother man said would be pulled back what are we talking about three things the Rapture message I'm I'll try to hurry here the Rapture message a shout is the message going forth now I've been preaching this all all day all the services what I've been talking about the planning of the of the Rapture seed it had to be spoken through a dedicated Channel a shout what is a shout it's the message going forth the living bread of life bringing forth the bride God has a way of doing things he never changes his policy in Amos 3 and 7 he would do nothing on the earth until first he reveals it to his secrets of prophets it's the word first and then we believe it and it makes a change among y'all y'all stood there on the valley amen with Ezekiel you've stood there and and read that with him and you could hear the horror in the man's voice looking at such a vision and God's saying can they live can they live well no they can't live Lord but but he didn't say it like that he said you know y'all remember brother boom had a vision like that didn't he looked at a situation the Lord said can it be can they live can it be fixed and he said you know amen but Ezekiel Saw that condition there it was laying in a place where it couldn't come back but God said to him prophesy Prophet prophesy profit and let me say this we might not be prophets but we're prophetic people and the word of God has been placed in the voice of this bride I tell you it's time to prophesy it's time to prophesy this word over the church prophesy let me say it plain the message is the shout amen the shout of first Thessalonians 4 is the mess message of William Branham it is not the first poll it is not the second pull the shout is the third pull of William branham's Ministry no we don't have a first pull and no we don't have a second poll but we are the Vindication of the third pool of William Reynolds Ministry first two pulls was ministered in a cave brother Ron we've we've battled Giants all over the world ain't we and you know you've been told same as I've been told amen these works that I do greater work should I do shall be gone the father that was just brother random right I've been told that by many theologians and I say if you bumped your head and they say he's personal pronoun I said but it also says in John 5 24 he that believeth so it's that one is all of this only to one man but William random didn't preach it that way William Branham said he ministered the power of it back into the church come on now you say preacher what are you saying when I when I first started preaching the third pull in the bride I had somebody come say well I'll tell you if you got a third pull where's your first two and I just looked at him funny I thought well you know what third pull is do you so but I never say anything to him I just let it go and then I study him one day and the Lord spoke to me he said the first two was ministered by an Angel and had nothing to do with you in that manner but the third was the opening of the word which was the beginning of your change it was the beginning of your come on Church The Rapture is a spoken word manifestation and this spot holds the seed of the Rapture it's the third pool it's the third pull it's not the third push it's the third pull come on you ain't running this down it came and got you you're not trying to chase this Revelation it came and got you it pulled you out it brought you out it got you out of troubles and situations if you get in the ground it's gonna get you out of the ground it got you out of the graves of denomination this message coming to get you [Applause] my mama used to say the devil's gonna get you and I'll tell you why it was Jesus that got me I found out hey man you can't hide from Jesus if you got something on the inside of you [Applause] the third pool was the opening of that word if you're reading it in a church age book brother bam said the Bible said they called out once remember the Rapture is for the called out the Genesee he said they called out once he said or the summonsed ones he blessed is a man whom thou chooses and causeth to approach unto me that they might dwell in the in thy courts now let me just say this when William Branham calls this a summons it changes everything the Rapture is a summons anybody ever been to court anybody ever received a summons if you got come on gay you can preach this message right here strong you've served a bunch of mentioned hey man he served a bunch of summons he's a police officer and God bless him for his service let's put our hands together for this man of God I wish to all the police officers were good message believe in men of God Amen be some character back in the in the business amen but you but but if you serve a summons that's not a suggestion they they do not they do not suggest you to come to court they do not say look if you don't have anything else to do would you show up on this day but when a judge summons you there ain't no excuses you you I guess you could die amen but you're gonna go to court and the prophet of God said the message is a summons to you God is summonsing you well I tell you what amen am I not carrying that kind of badge but I got another one and I'm on duty of the king tonight and I'm here to serve a summons upon your life the Rapture is claiming you it's claiming you for this word in this generation you'll not outrun it brother amen the law the enforcement of the Holy Ghost is here to enforce the word of this age you have been summoned you have been summonsed into the high courts of almighty God when a man steps into the presence of God he has forever changed he changed our souls already resurrected us but one of these days it will change our mortal bodies ah goodness you say preacher how in the world how in the world is God attracting the church brother man said he fulfills his word when Thy word fulfills it is a Divine attraction or a summons upon the seed of God what happened on Mount sunset God confirmed his word that's what this noise is about God fulfilling the promised word what he said Revelations 10 1-7 If You Ever Wanted about a legal affidavit of your sermons read Revelation 10 1-7 he said it's the message the mystery revealed the hidden Mystery Revelations 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills Luke 17 30 and the day when the son of man is revealed when he's revealed when he's revealed I love how Song of Solomon says it he said draw me and we'll run after thee amen the king hath brought me into his Chambers and we will be glad and rejoice and we will remember thy love more than Wine and upright thy up love love thee now you said preacher what are you saying I'm saying when he drew me amen I couldn't help but to run I didn't run from him no more I ran to him I ran into the presence of God two decisions in my life I have never regretted first one was I married that little girl Carissa Lawson that was a Wonder of my life and thank God for her she ain't here with me tonight stood by my side through many many hard trials and years she picked me up off of the floor a lot of times after me meetings just laid out there in unknown tongues in another dimension can you only know who I am or amen don't even know if I can get back to myself and her take my my clothes off and lay me in the bed and sit and rub my brow till I come back to myself amen special woman God gave me and never never ever regretted that decision to take her as a wife and the other decision I never regretted is one night I come to an Old-Fashioned Altar and God gave me the Holy Ghost and brother when he gave it to me I'll never take it back again I tell you amen it puts something in me I this world may fall apart but I love Jesus the world may fall apart this message is right every Church may fall every man may let you down but Jesus Christ is still a reality by this word in this generation sorry I talk like that in a minute I'll get kind of I'll get a little emotion on y'all but but look here look this is this stuff changed my life am I hard talking to you about somebody else's story folks the first thing that comes the message calling you therefore the message has caused the bride together we now have the inspiration that'll call the bride to the elected God is calling y'all know that y'all know the breach remember brother man said when the seals are open he said he'll call for his bride to come and stand by his side this time though it'll call the dead out of the Grave come on them that's went and they're in the Seas that'll call them out of the Seas them laying over them Arenas this message will do it all it'll call them all out this is the Capstone Revelation to the elected amen this is the very thing brother random went out in the desert to get it to bring inspiration back to us I'm hurrying through these quotes he said see for the Gathering of the people that's right amen it's the anointing of this age it's the Gathering of the unity of the church under the word amen we're looking at Ruth's anointing Gathering to my last we're looking at rahab's anointing Gathering to Solomon we're looking at the bride's anointing gathering with this word it's uniting time brother man said the world is your 19 but the bride has another United Team she's uniting with that word heavens and earth shall pass away amen but she's uniting herself with thus saith the Lord oh I'll tell you I could I could walk pews right now she's uniting herself with thus saith the Lord what's the saith the Lord at this age not justification not sanctification not just the baptism of the spirit but the very change of our body is the very thing that a prophet has prophesied over this church shall be changed [Applause] we're uniting it's a uniting for the rapture y'all know y'all know when things are about to change the bees begin to swarm y'all know I mean y'all heard it I remember I was a little kid went out one day and he's a big beehive hanging out about my dad's at my dad's uh tree there and we kids we're fascinated with them bees just hanging offside that knot of that I think it was a big old oak tree there and dad dad had some buddies it would be guys and he called one and said what did I do and he said well he said I got a box here he said set that out back to your house and I'll come down we'll capture that we'll capture that uh that queen bee and we'll move her so they went after I remember as a little kid was in need of slang they found that queen bee and I don't know how they know her from I guess she's bigger or something I never I'm not a big guy but they moved at B out there to that house and brother it wasn't but a few hours when that bee moved all them bees found their way they moved right into that into that they swarmed right there in that Hive amen right around that because something was happened to United nobody told her where to go nobody told them how to get there they the leadership Instinct brought them to that place what about it when when the when the winter time Falls up there in Canada and and stuff starts freezing up something happens and the ducks start gathering on the pond and they get ready to go south and brother bear said the geese start gathering on the pond and so he said when oh Gander will raise up and started making a call he said some of them little fellas have never been South a day in their life he said but they'll hear that call he said they'll start gathering on the pond and he said oh they'll go up into the skies no GPS no Maps no routes no food on their back no water they're not carrying nothing no gasoline they just head out knowing that the god that called them were prepared and everything they need for the journey is already in them come on church when God called you he knew you got the stuff you got the material that's going to take to make this Rapture you don't have to pack up a lot of things to take with you can I be an evangelist for a minute you ain't got to pack up a lot of things to take with you come on church this is not back in time this is unpacking time it's not dying to pack up troubles and pack up problems come on Amen I tell you what I've seen people credit grudges for years and years and years and years this is not Greg's back in time this is not a Time Amen to pack stuff around with you it's a time to lay aside every week that would beset you that you can fly into the heavens my goodness amen get lighter and lighter and lighter I tell you I've been I've been out there Brother Rich Cobb took me salmon fishing out in the out in the ocean hey man we didn't catch nothing we come in we come in and done some bottom fishing me and Zach caught our limit and everybody on the boat's limit they didn't know you got to be on the right side of the boat to catch fish they were all dragging their the boat was drifting they was all dragging their bottom weights you can't fish like that you know so Zach and I go to the other side and we cast and we fished and we were just nailing them they thought we was magicians no we were fishermen we caught our limit their limit the captain's limit everybody was they loved us you know but you know why they fish salmon in a certain season is because they gather in the ocean and they gather and they they get in groups we was just a little early but they're Gathering groups and those groups just as they gather the next thing they do is they turn and run up the river when they start seeing them gather out in the ocean the news will spread on the on the mainland and they say guys get your poles out they're fisting ahead for the rivers and they'll get a you know the Salmon's a little bit like walleye we have them up north and the wall I come up the rivers in the spring like March and April they'll come up in the rivers but you but you but you think you know that rain would disturb these guys but when it get a good rain they call it a push amen because they're sitting there waiting they need a little water to move and when you get a good rain all of them just starts moving together in that rain now look Church we've had a gathering amen but I feel them a lot of rains falling up on the church and there's another push into the word there's another there's another there's another thrust of the spirit of God pulling the church into it amen amen because when you see them Gathering it's time to go it's time to go you know uh I'll say this I I I've years ago I was preaching on this on this third pull and I was reading where brother Branham says he says that actually he says that it was a fishing vision hey I understood that man I you know I understood that when he said that it was a pool I get what he means he means he's got a bait on him he's got a bait on a a a a a line and when he pulls it that's what makes it attract you know like if you if you're fishing and and you're just carrying the bait sometimes don't do much but when you when you pull it it'll it'll flutter like that and the flutter will catch the sunshine and the fish will sit and they'll get it it looks like a live fish and you know when he pulled it he said that first time he said it was just little fish and he said he pulled it he said then it was just bigger fish he said but when he pulled it that third time he said the little fish got away from it he said and that's what attracted that big fish [Music] now brother Branham he was a prophecy but in the end he got off see his teachings got bad and and and the Pentecostals in them they had to get away from him but but that's what attracted you yeah you must be that big fish oh wow how many knows brother Bram caught the world record rainbow trout at one time it was it was at least the national champion world uh rainbow trout I think it was a symbol of another fish he caught a trophy bride with seven colors running through her what was it he hooked her with that third pull see when you took the seed of the word raptures in you amen no different than when a when a fish riches up and grabs the bait he thought he was getting the bait he got a journey into the boat and when you took this message maybe you've thought for a better life or you thought for a better way or it was something that attracted you but when the hook got set come on when the hook got said it was God setting a hook into you and you wasn't just taking it for a little something you might not know why you took it but God made you take it because he's taken you on a journey come on now I'm a little bit of a fisherman I know I know the best fisherman of all is one that it's one thing to hook a fish folks I've been salmon fishing up Michigan and we we hooked a bunch of fish and I was fishing with a bunch of guys and we had a we had to fish with a with a uh we had to fish with a barbless hook and it has to be a certain size so they don't want you snagging them you know and so we had these little flies and 17 pound test leaders on our rods and threw them after we'd hook him salmon and you'd hook into them in just a few minutes pow he'd break them it wasn't hard to hook one of them but they was maybe catching one ever six or eight or ten hookups and I told Zach I said well we're gonna have to do something some we got to listen to drags on our poles I said we're fishing to catch one not to hook one so I said loosen the drag a little and then we had hook except we're bending I said you're gonna buy a better hook and tie your own entire own flies so he tied us some flies with a good strong little hook and we we loosened the drag a little and we took it from one to eight and ten until we caught nearly everything we hooked because we wouldn't just wanting to hook something we wanted to catch something and God is not looking just to hook something he's looking to catch something and I tell you what he done he caught him a bride and he's going to catch her away in the moon in the twinkling of an eye this bride's going to move from the Waters of life into the she's going to turn into another dimensional creature you know what I'm talking about you've been hooked for it Church come on you never caught this message this message caught you they meant no trout ever caught affect you never seen a bass flopping on the bank looked up and said well I've done a good job catching you no amen that bass got caught and that trout got caught and that salmon got caught the same way you got caught this message has caught you for the changing of your bodies stand your feet with me tonight caught caught for the rapture caught for the rapture oh my what an hour to live what a Time what a generation you could have lived in another age you couldn't have took this but it's been spoken I now you can receive the seed you can take the seed of rapture isn't that amazing somebody's going to actually change [Music] somebody's going to actually change [Music] imagine that their bodies are going to change I want to know what it feels like I honestly that's what I live for I want to know what's like woman is it going to be I don't know but but I've took the seed that creates it now we're living in a generation it could happen any minute anymore all I want to do is remember to it I want I want to bring surrender in this don't you this isn't this isn't about what you can do it's about what you can surrender to you summoned quit argument [Music] I may not [Music] everything he told Enoch to do he just did it and everything this message has lined out for our age to it I remember when when brother Matt Morris first got saved we were you know he was a young boy in the message but he went out in the world spent years lord gave me a lot of Grace to to help him find his way back home we were sitting one day and everything's a mess it's just a mess and we were just talking he said Wayne he said you know things are I'm trying to get things back I'm just you know some things I don't understand I said Matthew if you listen to this message and just obey the voice of the angel
