resurrection praise the lord it's good to be here in the house of the Lord trust everyone's had a good day today and the musicians can be dismissed and uh we um certainly discounted an honor to to be here with you and just to Worship the Lord for he's certainly worthy of our praise and um you know this is only just a reflection of what it's going to be on the other side and amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and as it's been said and we want to keep brother Burley in our prayers he is should be in surgery now and so that the Lord would just keep him and um helping through these times and guide the doctor's hands amen and give the doctor the wisdom that they need praise the Lord but we want to look at Psalms the 23rd chapter and may we just go to the Lord in prayer before we start reading amen father truly we love you and we count it an honor to be here gathered with your people father of who you have redeemed you've called out of this dark evil age and to walk in your Marvelous Light and oh God we just humbly asked that you would now come Among Us and speak to us father help me just to get myself out of the way Lord and that you could use the gift that you placed Within Me father and I pray that you would just anoint people's hearts and ears Lord that they could hear and receive of you open our understanding Lord father for we want to know you more and we want to we want to walk in the way that is pleasing to you Lord just ask that you would bless this church father the congregation I pray Lord that you would just be with brother Burley now through the surgery and just guide the doctor's hands father and Lord we just love you we thank you for all things in Jesus Christ's name amen mm-hmm I want to read just starting at the first verse again and I'm just going to read the first verse the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. and you say that with me the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want you can have your seats this evening and before I get started I think the there was a notice that had already been sent out but uh for all of those that would like to gather for some fellowship and uh some volleyball you're more than welcome to come this Saturday and we're going to be meeting at the Gateway the Gateway Baptist Church has been so nice to to allow us to use their facilities and in times past and so we're going to be meeting at Gateway Baptist Church and I guess around five o'clock and we'll be uh try to start eating at around 5 30. and so um if you'd like to come love to have you and also a reminder uh that we're going to be taking up an offering for brother Andrew and sister Mariah this Sunday and it'll help them with their bills and things as we know that brother Andrew is full-time in the ministry and and he's been a real blessing to us as a church and to to people all over and so we want to be a blessing to them in this time and I think it would I just hate to see him get out have to go out on the road so soon after that baby and are having that baby and and so I think it would be nice to be able to do something for them to where he wouldn't have to feel that pressure and of course we know brother Andrew Don't Preach for money at all but at the same time he's got bills that needs paid and so we can help him in that area so just remember that also we're going to be only having one service this Sunday and that'll be at 11 o'clock then we're going to be having fellowship at Camp Christie afterward um and and I I kind of messed up on the dates and I was doing trying to do it every other Sunday well Camp Christie was booked up June and July and so we we got the uh the dates for the seventh and on and uh so I thought well okay so I was looking at my calendar and so when we were reserving things for in June and July I thought I had it all planned out and I didn't and so I uh so we we've got a a schedule with Cam Christie for this Sunday um for fellowships so uh anyways if you'd like to come we'd love to have you at uh Fellowship also um uh sister Brittany said there's a sign up sheet in the back for those who would like to contribute in in meals in the meal for Sunday and so if you would want to come we'd love to have you brother Andrew will be ministering the Lord willing this Sunday and so we're looking forward to that as well uh that I want to title the subject we've just been speaking on the Lord is my shepherd but tonight I'd like to deal with I shall not want. the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want and uh again we are looking at David's relationship with the Lord and uh and it's it's the same relationship that every believer has with God and so uh The Lord Is Our Shepherd which means he's our leader he's he's the one that is doing the leading and uh uh and we as his sheep are followers we're following him and uh so we quoted the scripture Romans 8 14 as for many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God never in in the Bible does it say that we are to lead it doesn't and then God is to follow and and I think we we put that the world has got misconception of God as though he he just follows our every whim and and and and and whatever we ask him or tell him to do it's got now that we tell him we demand we expected of him and he just so happens to do it and and and you know um and and it's good to expect if you're expecting the right thing but we we find uh that the the Bible never puts God in the back as though uh he follows us but we are to follow him Elijah put forth the challenge to Israel if the Lord be God then follow him ain't that right David wrote and sang My Soul followeth hard after thee Jesus said unto his disciples unto Matthew follow me he goes to Levi follow me if he he goes to Peter and Andrew follow me everywhere it's it's follow me it's it's not well what are you guys doing and can I go with you it's it's drop what you're doing Drop what you you have and follow me and they drop their Nets and they left the tax office and they quit their occupations to follow follow the lord ain't that rhyme and in Matthew 10 37 Jesus said he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me ain't that right amen so to be worthy of Christ we have to follow him amen and so it's not us leading God but rather him leading us and that's the whole point is he wants to have preeminence in our lives ain't that right amen and and so there are absolutely no benefits in us trying to lead God if you want to lead God and tell him what to do you you'll you'll never find the benefits that David's talking about it's only to those that follow him and accept him as their Shepherd ain't that right amen and so uh John 8 and 12 Jesus says I am the light of the world and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life amen so you have to follow him in order to to not walk in darkness ain't that right and so one of the benefits in following the Lord is I shall not one and and you know I I pray that I can bring this uh to where what I feel in my heart as to what this truly means of I shall not want and and uh we we've dealt with this of a few Services back but I would like to look at it just a little bit more and and one definition for the word one is Desiring to have or uh to lack to lack in other words there's a need there uh to be without having a need so so this is what I shall not want I I shall not have a need I I shall not be lacking I I shall not see and so uh uh sheep of course have certain needs as as well as anything but but we're talking about the shepherd and the sheep and and the shepherd does not lead the Sheep based on his own needs he doesn't care for the Sheep based upon his own needs but the shepherd cares for the Sheep he leads the Sheep according to the needs that they have ain't that right so we don't have a selfish Shepherd a man but this Shepherd cares for the Sheep he he knows his sheep he he wants his sheep to thrive he wants his sheep to be fed on on the right things and and so he's a good shepherd ain't that right amen and so we we find the prophet says that God has always been the god to meet the need when there is a need for his people and you know that see and God promised that he would Supply their need amen aren't you glad he supplies the need amen uh uh Philippians 4 19 says but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus ain't that right so the prophet would tell us anything that you have need of in this earth Journey God Will Supply it if you have need of it now that's the confidence that we can have anything that you have need of in this life's journey God Will Supply the need if you have need of it he promises to supply your needs not your wants but your needs ain't that right amen so we have seen I've seen God put food on my table amen when I needed it I've seen God put money in my hand when I needed it I seen God put clothes on my family when we needed it ain't that right amen I've seen God Supply the gas when we needed it amen I've seen God Amen turn on the electric when we needed it I've I've seen God do many many things amen uh because he's promised to supply our needs ain't that right God has supplied the needs amen but if we're not careful we will only limit our needs to materialistic things well I need this and I need that and I need you know and and and and and and then our needs turns into ones or our ones turns into needs and and and these things but brother Brandon would tell us in this layout of sin age and I think it's important now but he says I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold a man in the layout of sin or last age self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God Amen see and so this is where we're at and and so if we're not careful we will start basing or start Desiring or or we'll find our wanting a man to be materialistic amen but but I thought Jeremiah 21 11 amen for I know the thoughts that I think towards you A man uh saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected in now I I believe there are needs that are greater than just materialistic things I just believe that and I'm going to I just kind of want to uh go into the needs that that maybe we would have as as the people of God Amen brother Branham said God has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real can you say Amen now I want to just stop here we would never know that we had needs except we found the mind of God that we were able to get into the mind of God thank God for a prophet a man that would reveal to us the the Eternal thoughts of God Amen that was from the foundation of the world and these thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real God will never change his mind about anything you can't change God's mind about you I don't care how low you feel I don't care you can complain to him about yourself you can you can tell him all the negative about yourself and you'll never change God's mind of what he thought of you can you say Amen see because they are Eternal and they are real they are not simply like a man with the blueprint he is drawn up in which one day will be translated into substance and form now think of that it's not like a blueprint amen and you're looking at the blueprint and and then you're waiting for it to come into materialistic and and and and then you can identify but brother Branham is saying the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real oh my to think of that you already were a Son of God Amen you already were amen uh uh uh perfect in his mind you already then we're real then we're just substance this isn't just a thought drawn out but these are real a reality ain't that right so be uh but they are already real and eternal and the part of God ain't that right but I can tell you this in the natural sense amen we did not come into this world reflecting the thoughts of God Amen we didn't come into this world uh uh as as reflecting saved and and Perfection and and sons of God Daughters of God Amen we we didn't come into this world we actually come into this world complete opposite of what God predestinated us to be but you know what that didn't mind bother God a bit ain't that right now you know we can waver sometimes and when when things are going good we see it as going good but then when things drop and the bottom drops out and then we can't see what we saw that was good we're looking at what is the bad you understand what I'm saying and it's hard for us to get out of that negative and to look into the positive again amen but see God when the bottom dropped out and and we were born in another way than what he had predestinated us to be God never looked at that and said oh my God this is a mess I I don't understand I don't know if there's any hole he always saw you as the Son of God he always saw it was more real to him amen than you were as a sinner because his thoughts are real and they're Eternal ain't that right you could have been drinking you could have been down staggering amen uh in a bar somewhere that didn't matter to God Amen he didn't even look at that because he saw you what was in his mind and that was more real what was in his thoughts were more real than you sitting there staggering in a bar room ain't that right that's what he said it's more real so he would stay with the thoughts and not with what your condition is that's why we can have hope can you say man we can have hope when we see that things are going bad and and our loved ones uh taking a turn for the worse amen we can look and say hold it hold it that's not what God thought of this to be the thoughts of God are eternal that God didn't predestinate us to be Sinners but we came that way God didn't predestinated us to be weakened Beverly but we came that way God didn't predestinated us uh uh to be subject to the powers of Darkness but we came that way ain't that right we came into this world having a fallen adamic nature amen we came into this world full of lies and and hypocrisy having a carnal mind which is enmity against God do you believe that amen that's why we all come into this world just like that that cute little old baby you know and and uh but yet born with the sinner's nature with the with the nature that was against God cannot be subject to the law of God and all that but yet God had called us to walk with him and to fellowship with him aren't you glad for that God called us so so as you begin to see what you are in the now a man or in in this a contrast as to what he's called you to be we can say there's a need ain't that right there's a need amen see now the prophet would tell us well uh Amos you know he asked the question how can two walk together except they be agreed amen here God is wanting fellowship and here we have the nature that is against God so we can actually say there is a need ain't that right amen a need we have a need of uh we needed a change of natures ain't that right well we find that God has called us for a greater purpose than what you could ever dream of you you young people may already have your plans already picked out but God's got a greater plan for you he's got a greater purpose for you amen ain't that right amen we're called to be Sons and Daughters of God you believe that we're called to reflect his nature his power his glory we're we're called to be the habitation of God himself we're called see we've been predestinated to be conformed to the image of Christ brother Brown said we've been invited to be molded into His Image his character so we can say that there is a need ain't that right how many believes you've come you you've come into that full character well see we we find that there's a need when you when you see your folds when you see your failure then you find out there's a need there there's a lacking there there there there is something amen not saying that you don't desire to to be further up the road amen but that desire amen is in You by God that you're following a Shepherd that will promise to meet the need amen ain't that right we know we're living in a a Rapture age Amen brother Brandon said it's going to take more faith than there ever was in any age for this have to be rapturing Faith to be taken up ain't that right he said if I want you to get built up now in this holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour so we can say there's a need there hey man I don't know about you but every time I look at the promises of God and I hear the prophet preaching I I see that there's a need there's a need can you say amen amen if if you're Desiring something it's because there's a need there ain't that right yes sir well maybe not but I know if there's something in me crying out that means there's a need there if you're thirsting for something you know there's a need your body needs something ain't that right if you're hunger and it's because your body is needing something ain't that right so if you're crying for God if you're hungering for God if you're thirstian after the things of God that shows there's a need there and he promised to meet it we're living in the in the astronaut age amen and as man needed something to lift him up a man from this Earthbound Rim into the orbit amen's Soul are we because the prophet said we are in the astronaut age you ain't gonna you ain't gonna get up there you ain't you ain't the pilot that flies to 747 boiled jet amen that's not an astronaut he can fly but that don't make him an astronaut amen because that don't take him into orbit ain't that right you can drive your car but that don't mean you're an astronaut see we needed something to take us into orbit into outer space and the prophet declaring that we as Believers are living in an astronaut age lets us know there's a need that is there a man that will lifts us up we need something a power a something Amen to lift us up into the heavenlies God doesn't want you to be Earthbound anymore amen horse and buggy Days Are Over Pentecostal Days Are Over Baptist Days Are Over denominational Days Are Over can you say Amen all the man-made Doctrine is over it ain't enough to lift you up into the heavenlies there's a need Joel 2 23. says and I will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the canker worm the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sin among you I will restore so God is saying there's a need ain't that right and when was this restoration going to take place today he didn't wait for Luther he didn't wait oh he started the restoration but we find out that they they would go back come out a little bit go back come out a little bit go back come back a little bit and go back ain't that right go back into dominations go back with the the same old ruts and and all of these things amen but we find that even God is saying the church needs a restoration we didn't know when that was going to happen but we found out by the message of the hour this is the age of restoration this is the time that the church is going to be restored can you say Amen the darkmas of man decrees of man the the the the traditions and ideas of man they killed the tree amen they sat the life out of it they stripped it bare amen until it was nothing but a stump amen but God would say I will restore now we didn't know there was a need we thought all church was is just being a member of a church being a good citizen doing our do's and don'ts and and all of these things that we found out there was a need in the church now we knew there was something crying out for more of God we knew there was something in our hearts but we didn't know where it was we were lost we didn't know how to get back but God promised he would be our Shepherd to take us back and to restore it all back to us hey amen that's why you don't need to listen to The Very things that stripped a tree in the first place why does people seek Revelation outside this message anything else would strip the tree ain't that right amen so the church the need of the hours for the church to be restored I hope it's all right and I know these ministers could do a far better job but but I'm just skimming over a lot of this but brother Brown said we got 900 and something different organizations of Christianity and each one condemning the other and saying this is right and they're wrong this is right and that's wrong and so forth and the poor people are so confused they don't know what is right and wrong so now he asked the question what do we need we need to get back on the course ain't that right get back to the Charter what do we need we need a genuine true scriptural sign of the truth a vending Vindicated gospel truth is what the church needs for this end time way amen I'll just read some more in other places he said we need a rising of a true Prophet to bring us back to the word every time the people are gathered together at the end of the road which we're at the end of the road we're at a junction ain't that right amen see God sends a true prophet and the devil sends a false prophet we need a prophet that's sad that the church don't know they need a prophet America didn't realize they needed a profit it would have stopped a lot of this confusion if they would have followed the voice of a prophet ain't that right Dogma depending upon the social succession with men and with their man-made Creed and leaving the word of God what we need is a prophet today to blast that word in there the need another place I think the church the organization and denominations they've been on the field for a long time and they're beginning getting latched and the work of the Lord is being left undone the word of truth because the church in itself has become stemsided and what we need today is the voice of God to speak among us to bring us back ain't that right and notice another place God has promised to meet the need of the hour he always does that what and we need the voice of God today how many believe that we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time that we're living in and after he is promised that we can rest assure that he will keep his promise that's the confidence that the believer has in his maker that God promised to meet the need aren't you glad for that God promise now you and I both know we're not looking for a prophet God has already provided the prophet we're not looking for a voice on the earth we've already got the voice of God that is the promised to meet the need for the hour can you say amen amen see and all I can say to this amen we can mention need after need after need that the church has and and and and has had for a long long long long time amen Through the Ages and all of these things but one thing we do know that if we follow the shepherd we shall not want can you say amen I don't believe this bride is going to go in a Rapture amen still lacking are you with me now amen you say well but look at me I don't care about what you are thinking I'm caring about the need can you say amen God knows what you have need of [Music] one thing about it the life that is in you is calling out for it ain't that right it's calling out there's a need it's calling out calling out amen is what makes you different from the world something calling out but he's here to meet the need so we say that we have that God has sent to us a prophet of Malachi for the message of the hour is the voice of God and it's the voice of Our Shepherd [Music] right I think we're old acceptable to that if not you need to pray that God will open your eyes for this message it is the voice of God it is the voice of God you don't need to despair just believe the voice ain't that right it's the voice of Our Shepherd now brother Brown said what did he say in Malachi 4. that he would restore Malachi 4 was to restore restored back the original Pentecostal Faith back to the people with the same Pentecostal message the same Pentecostal sign the same Pentecostal evidence the same God the same power the same teaching everything exactly with the Vindication of the same Pillar of Fire that struck Paul down on the road down to Damascus among us today doing the same things that he did that day see it's a uniting ain't that right that's what we needed we needed to unite with the Lord bride and bridegroom to unite ain't that right that was a need that's what it was needing and God promised to meet the need he said we see the Nations uniting we see the world uniting we see the church uniting and notice we see the bride uniting uniting with the word why the word is God and as the word as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hero of the word they come together in a union they unite like a wedding they're they're getting ready for a wedding they become one the word becomes you and you become the word ain't that right Jesus said at that day you know what oh the father is I am and all I am you are and all you are I am and in that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me I and you and you and me at that day what day this day and we find out the great hidden mysteries of God being revealed in this day Hallelujah now notice he says we notice that God began to make him a bride for Christ and the bride must be identified with him and in him because it is part of him and now the brightest part of him she is part of him the word for that date the bride becomes part of that word for it's Christ you have to be in Christ in Christ we have to be of Christ in Christ part of Christ and Christ is the word so he ain't Dogma he's not Creeds he's not made by of ideology that's why we had to have a prophet for the word of God to come to you ain't ain't that right see because we needed to be part of him we needed something to magnetize too we were trying to magnetize to a church to a denomination to a belief a Doctrine a Creed that wasn't Christ ain't that right so there was a need now he says what is a woman when she takes a man or a man takes a woman that woman has to be a part of him they no longer are two they're one and when God and Christ become one they were one because God was the word and the Word was made flesh the Flesh and the word became one and when the church becomes Christ's bride she and the gospels are the same amen she and the gospels are the same the same power the same life the same Supernatural works is in her I shall not want you see God's been supplying the need all alone he's been restoring this bride Amen in this last day and the world does not knows nothing about it and they want to take a little bit from the message and they want to say this is inspired this isn't inspired they want to make it look like it was all psychology but what we find is God himself meeting the need for this hour [Music] Lord amen so he says how can you say them the days of Miracles are passed how can you say then that he's not the same yesterday today and forever how can you say that those things uh is for an apostle or disciple or somebody in another day when you are to be part of him ain't that right see we're realizing the need that we have as Sheep amen say we need to be like him we need to be a part of him that's why we cling to this word with all that's within us when he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass see or never fail how about Revelations 22 when he got through writing the book he said I testify that if any man shall add one word or take one word out of it his part will be taken from The Book of Life how are we going to come to heaven then to say well I believe this but I don't believe that you've got to be the full word everybody say I've got to be the full word that's the need for this day is you've got to be the full word don't don't don't just play around with it amen don't just become punctive become complacent with it and treat it like just any old book any old message any old amen uh uh preacher amen you've got to become the full word can you say Amen that's right see and he says see for you are part of him that's how God is going to try to me is trying to make his church today not by a Creed oh yeah they're trying to force us into that folks you can see it coming the handwriting is on the wall it won't be too long until we're going to be a World Church and every church is going to have to fall right into that or stand the circumstances well are you ready to stand that you better not do it just because you think it's the right thing you better have Christ in you because that word is eternal and that word is what will raise you up again you see the need we need the word because it is eternal and it'll raise us up again you become part of that word you're identified with that word amen see so if we're following the shepherd we shall not want we shall not lack ain't that right now I'm going to get into this just for a few moments today so many are left wanting but it's not God's fault if you'll take the time to look around what God has done for us in this message everything that you have need of is in the message God has done his part to supply the need can you say Amen if you're laodicea look warm it's not God's fault you'll never put it on God and say well God I just didn't have what it takes God promised to meet the need and he has met the need it's here it's it's everything that you young people need to overcome it's here everything that we need to overcome this laodicea lukewarm age it's here but yet people are still found wanting but why is it that they still want there's another word for want and that is the word lust lust Desiring craving to covet lusts makes people uncontrollable and if you'll notice that's not sheep for the voice of the shepherd controls the Sheep the voice of the shepherd when the Sheep is being tempted for something the shepherd calls out and the Sheep come back in line because they know only one and that's the voice of the shepherd they trust the shepherd they they've got confidence in that Shepherd and the shepherd is is the very thing is all they depend upon but the word lust this lust makes people uncontrollable the Bible prophesied that people at this last day would be incontinent and this word incontinent is powerless without self-control they become self-indulgent remember lovers of their own selves lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God they they're craving they're Desiring they're wanting but their one is Twisted it's it's a perverted want ain't that right you know look look at the the natural we we talked about it before but you can be thirsty just dying of thirst have you ever just drunk a Coke Dr Pepper something real sugar after you drink that whole bottle you're still where you're at you're thirsty there's nothing to quench The Thirst and that's that's where that lust comes it's it's unsatisfiable are you with me young people you know boys say if I ever get married it'll stop everything they get married and they got the woman that they have their dreams so they say and it still doesn't stop it they're still after something still looking still wanting still craving we got divorces all over the place men marrying one woman then another woman another woman and same thing with the woman amen what is it it's a lust that can never be quenched lust for power I could just become superintendent I'd be great and and that ain't satisfactory you want to be something else you become the president and you still ain't satisfied you want to be the governor of the world it's it's a lust it's a craving it's a desire can you say Amen we have our automobiles instead of the horse and buggy but we still want we have our nice house with plenty of rooms and air conditioning instead of having to live in the old Hut with dirt floors but we still want we can send emails and texts to one another instead of having to send smoke signals a man for every little word that we want to say and we steal once hello got the Worcester and drier and instead of having to to hang out the clothes and and use the worst bin and scrubbing on and we still watch nothing has been able to satisfy the lust with him I want to ask you is technology that we have today is a satisfying the world absolutely not we've gone from our flip phones to our iPhones and we still want a better one we still want yeah hello the Bible says ever coming to the uh uh what what is that ever learning but never coming to the knowledge of Truth it's a lust that that just has no end a desire a craving is education satisfying the world absolutely not is the progress of science satisfying the world is Hollywood satisfying the world is all the movies is the television that you so wanted is it really satisfying yeah are the peace talks of this world satisfying the world absolutely not we get our president in the one that we want and it's still not satisfactory we think everybody should be just like us if everybody was like us we still wouldn't be satisfied can you say Amen so there's a want that can never be satisfied because it stems from our own lusts but the one that David speaks of stems of a need hello not less I need and God promised he would Supply the need now notice hope that's all right we read this last Wednesday thinking of good to read it again God gives the control tower to you to give you the things that you need the control tower in you is what directs you tells you what you have need of spiritually speaking there is a control Tire in the body that tells you the need that's needed in your body and it's brought to you by thirst also there is a control tower in your soul that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of something in your spirit and you buy this can tell what kind of a life is controlling you by whatever desire you have tells you what kind of life is controlling you and when you can see that what your desires are then you can tell by that but what kind of something that's in you that's creating this desire that you have see there is a certain thing that you thirst for and it can tell you in your soul what this desire is by the nature of The Thirst that you have he said I hope you can understand that there is a control Tire of the Soul one and one for the body and each Tower is warning caller for the needs of the other each one calls to the uh to the Need For What the caller is calling for and it sends out a wave of warning for instance the flesh thirsts to satisfy the desires that's in the body and the spirit desires the things that's in the soul and desire see and many times these War against one another and we find there what's a great trouble today that too many people tried to live between those two desires for one of them desires the things of the earth and the other desires the things of Heaven ain't that right now let's look at the Bible First Peter 2 and 11 it says Dear beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain everybody say abstain now do you all know what abstain means get away from shun shun it flee it don't touch the beer bottle get away from it get away from its company abstain can you say amen that's right see abstain from fleshly lusts desires cravings which war against the soul can you say man first Peter 4 and 1 for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that has suffered In the Flesh has ceased from sin that he should no longer live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God so we're we're understanding I hope you're understanding more of what David is saying I shall not want he's not living by his lusts them lest ain't driving him to where he's uncontrollable can you say amen I tell you what if you're going by the lust that's within you you'll never find God to be an appeasing you'll never find Christianity to be appeasing you'll never find this message to be the real need for you can you say Amen because God is not your Aaron boy God is not here to satisfy the needs or the the the lust the Cravings the desires of the flesh he's after that soul now the Bible prophesied of this day saying that people would be led of their own lust and yet they are religious people Paul speaks of Israel saying they were all under the cloud they all passed through the Red Sea they were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea they all ate of the same spiritual meat they all drank of the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that was Christ ain't that right so they were religious they they went to the blood they went through baptism they they tasted of the good things of God but notice what Paul says but they lusted after evil things therefore the works of God could never satisfied them the miracles of god could never satisfy them the promises of God the Vindication of God though it be in their midst the pillar fire the cloud that led them could never satisfy them for they lust it after evil things and notice the prophet Paul would tell us some of them were idolaters and then he says don't be idolaters as them now brother Brown would say and I'm just going to put this in but he says you say well I wouldn't worship an idol he said that doesn't altogether mean you worship an idol you just have to be idle doing nothing go to church yeah that's all right go back home do nothing about it brother a real born again man or woman can't stand still there's something in them they've got to testify they got to do something they're bound to do something they can't hold their peace that's what it means by don't be idols idolaters can you say man amen so does it always mean worshiping an image amen but it's coming to church and listen to the word of God and they never do nothing about it always keep keep our mouth shut and don't tell somebody about the goodness of God and what God is doing but all we'll listen to every negative thing that that Satan will bring to us can you say Amen see look the Bible also Paul goes on they were idolats some of them were idolaters some of them committed fornication and 23 000 of them died in one day some of them tempted Christ and were destroyed of serpents some of them murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer ain't that right see God's Prophet a messenger Moses his Prophet Shepherd was trying to lead this the people into the promised land trying to take them over but instead of being able to do that he had no control over the influence of God could not control them because they lost it they lost it after evil things can you say man now see that word lusted means to long for to set the heart upon so here the prophet is telling here's a little here's a lamb here's a land but every time dates went to rise up he they could influence him them people because they lusted after evil things their heart was set upon the evil can you say amen that's right sin and they were LED amen well the the it also lusted means to turn upon a thing to have a desire for long for to desire to lust after covet of those who seek things forbidden see so they were led by their own lusts is this okay they were led by their own lust so no wonder again they were so easily influenced this one could rise up and they'd go after it amen even though God would swallow a lot of them up amen yet another would rise up and they'd go after that is because they lasted after evil things and they were led by their own lust the word of God could not have influence over their lives and then Paul tells us that they were overthrown in the wilderness because God was displeased with them but we're back to the same thing today I've got just a few more minutes so you just bear with me Jude 17. through 19 but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how that they told you that there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lust these be they who separate themselves sensual not having the spirit second Peter 3 1 this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I steer up your pure Minds by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this verse that there shall come there shall come everybody say there shall come in the last day scoffers walking after their own lusts ain't that right so that's a promise for this day amen second Timothy 4 3 for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables Jude 14 and Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied of these saying behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints to ask you to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly Deeds which they have ungodly committed and all of their hard speeches which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lust and their mouths speak great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of advantage in other words if if brother Bill if you couldn't give me some Advantage some some Prestige I would put you off and I'd cling to brother Amos amen he's got Prestige he's got a position he can benefit me he can put me up somewhere you understand what I'm saying instead of making every man equal amen they would look at this and having uh uh men's persons in admiration because of advantage we don't look at any preacher in this message as high or low or whatever you understand what I'm saying amen something's got great gifts some are just for the local church some are for convention some are for you know whatever but they're all in the body benefit for the body ain't that right Romans 1 21 because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptable god into an image made like two corruptable man to birds four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore listen wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanliness through the lusts of Their Own Heart there came a time where God says okay that's what you want have at it I'll Supply it and you say Amen they didn't want God they didn't want the truth of God they didn't have the love for the truth so God sent them over to strong delusions that they believed believed the lion be damned and yet they're religious our church is it's not not message churches by God's grace but church is all around except in homosexuals behind the pulpit why God gave it in the over to the lusts and it shows that denominations were not of God in the beginning it was started by the lust of men can you say amen and you found out they started one denomination and couldn't be satisfied with that so they'd start another one can't be satisfied with that they'll start another one hello you could go on and on and on and see amen but we find this this kind of want is ungodly it's evil and will never be satisfied the church world is wanting because of their lust they Lust For popularity they lust for Prestige they lust for knowledge they Lust For more members they lust to be the biggest church they lust for fortune and fame they Lust For recognition they lust and God can never satisfy that kind of wanting ain't that right all right I'm going to close I want you to look at this Mark 10 17. speaking of Jesus and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall I do that I may inherit internal eternal life now we know this is the Rich Young Ruler and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one and that is God thou knowest the Commandments now I want you to notice this man's condition this boy's condition thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not steal do not kill do not bear false Witnesses defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these things I've done or observed since a youth ain't that right then notice then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest yes I want you to understand this because he he was obeying the law he was living strict coherent to it he wasn't one of these rebel Rebels he was actually following the line doing toeing the line with everything that was required in that law and yet Jesus would tell him you're lacking and he knew he was lacking went to church since he was a boy learned all the do's and don'ts learned that the rules and did them and yet he lacked go thy way so whatsoever thou Hast give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and what follow me now this tells us a lot there's a lot of people going to church there's a lot of people that are religious there's a lot of religious people that are more strict than what we would be and they're lacking because they're not following him you say oh they say Jesus Jesus but notice he knew he had to have eternal life and where did he come to the word of the hour you believe it now notice what the prophet said remember Jesus said follow me follow me get rid of what you got and follow me and that's the only way to have eternal life by following not eternal life by doing you got to do things too right but all you're doing won't get you anywhere if you ain't following him that's the only way to have eternal life that's the only remedy he'd give this man was the only remedy he give this businessman is the only remedy he gives anybody his choice he makes his decision it's perfect every time and we must follow him it's the only way to have eternal life so the leadership of God is follow the Vindicated word of the hour and Pie of the Holy Ghost yeah amen the Lord is my shepherd well how do you know he's your Shepherd because I'm following the Vindicated word of the hour and it's applying my need I shall not want. I'm finding that my lacking my need is being met are you with me see Jesus was there to satisfy the word of the hour the Vindicated word was there to satisfy that which he lacked all right and he failed to do it and you say Amen brother Brown said you know there is in the country today so many dissatisfied people and it's amazing when you get around and find out so much dissatisfaction people hardly know what they want to do they come down the road at about 70 80 miles an hour in a 30-mile Zone Slide the brakes and turn around the corner and start up with such speed till they burn their tires half off to go to a city block to sit and talk a while seemed like people just don't know what they want to do or what they do want some of them get so disturbed until they go down into the drugstore go down to the drugstore and purchase for themselves a bottle of arsenic or sulfuric acid or something and commit suicide they find they they find them laying dead some will turn their gas jets on in the room or set in their automobiles with the pipe for the carbon monoxide gas trying to get away from Life some of them will climb up to the bridge and write a little note and stick it on their coat and lay it down and plunge themselves to death in the river jumping off mountains High Towers some will take a pistol put it to their head and blow their brains out see they're just dissatisfied that lust ain't being quenched the hospitals are full of dissatisfied people the insane institutions are overrun dissatisfied they don't know what they do want and there seemed to be something that they're reaching after but they just never come to it can you say Amen you love the Lord I I'm going to close now but Psalms 90 and 14 says oh satisfy us all satisfy us with thy mercy early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be glad all our days you know what that word satisfy means to meet the need of the need is met and I'm satisfied I shall not want the Lord is my shepherd and I'm satisfied can you say Amen now look what the the prophet says because there's a scripture that I wish I could really get to you because when I read it I just about shouted but I listen to what brother branham's saying she held two traditions now you know what he's talking about is the church throughout the ages she held to traditions and substitute she held to the substitute blood instead of the real blood to instead of the real blood Jesus the word said when it was manifested to her because she held to these Traditions Jesus the manifested word said to the bride the Hebrew bride because you hold to your Traditions you make the word of God without any effect to you see it can't be effective now that's what's the reason today the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals but we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no don't don't don't think we have got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere the bride hasn't had a revive now he's showing us the need for the Revival we need there was a need there the bride hasn't had a Revival there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to steer the bride yet we're looking for it now it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again yeah he'll send it he promised it can you say man now this was before 63. I read this scripture and I found it applicable prophetic for us Psalm 17 15. David said as for me I will Behold thy face in righteousness of course the word righteousness is the word being fulfilled that's righteousness hello it become a festival fill all righteousness but notice I shall be what satisfied when I awake with thy likeness we've had nothing to waken this bride up yet he says it will take these unknown Thunders to do it but it'll be there God promised it right you all know the quote but he says brother and sister more of the herald of his coming one of the finals papers on the field Herald of his coming but they will hardly print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet how many reads it say you know you see it all the time fast pray fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's

be a great thing happening all of you pray pray pray we're not too late yet why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they've not recognized The Awakening of the brag by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen it's already been promised that when he I would awaken your likeness I'll be satisfied so they know there's going to be Awakening it has happened the bride's awakened and you know what she's finding herself more like him every day she's finding that as it has been written she was predestinated to be conformed into his image and she's finding she's satisfied can you say amen I shall not want. they're trying to give us a new message I don't want that new message I'm satisfied with the Awakening I see it because when I've awakened I'm coming into his likeness didn't you say man good bless the name of the Lord they know something is supposed to happen they're looking for it way off in the future to come when
