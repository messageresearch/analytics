after church and uh until about one o'clock this morning and we didn't get home to about two and but it was worth it it was just to see the people of God liberated amen and the devil hates that the devil hates it you know we were a product we were a product of traditional teachings and man-made ideas and all that and it killed us spiritually it killed us but then God called us out one time and because of the message of the hour we've been there's a creation that has taken place and we have seen in this meeting a product of what the message has done there is a people on the Earth that's liberated the fear is gone we're not headed for tribulation we're not headed to Doom and Gloom Satan don't know what to do with us amen but every time he tries to get us down we back up again hands

Vindicated word and the power of his resurrection Hallelujah my it's so good to be with God's children I look forward to this time when when we can come together and and just put our licks of fire with uh Believers amen when you get Believers all gathered together and when you know that the supernatural power of God is here with us tabernacling in us well then it's it's unlimited what God can do for us nothing is impossible with God and nothing is impossible with you either all things are possible to them that believe and it's just it just what can we say about the word that we've heard thus far and uh just uh brother Timothy and uh brother Wendell and last night and it's just been a tremendous time and just feeding on the word and I I think it's what the prophet said it's the unfailing Bodywork word of the son of man this is not a man that we're feeding on we are feeding on Jesus Christ and uh I tell you what it's giving us rapturing strength it's giving us Rapture and Grace and uh you you feel it you you see it and um it's uh I tell you what I want more of him amen and uh we uh we just want to Echo what brother Wayne said uh yesterday and what he was before he started he just spoke my heart as well speaking of all of the work and the labor and and to everyone that has uh just uh put their their efforts in making this uh meeting possible and um I tell you what the the work uh it's a tremendous tremendous undertaking but I believe that the the the rewards and the fruit is eternal and I I think from these meetings it's going to be something that uh on the other side will truly see everything that took place and uh what God has truly done through these meetings and so if you have your Bible we uh we just deem it a great privilege to be here and uh to be able to preach the message of the hour with such a caliber of of men as that is preaching these meetings we can turn to John the first chapter and then we'll turn to Isaiah the 60th chapter these are very familiar scriptures to us but as we read out of John the first chapter I think that we read this portion of scripture with a revelation that this is not just speaking of a day gone by but this is also speaking of the day that we live in and so John the first chapter in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God brother Branham would take us to the meaning of in the beginning was the word and he would say that it is meaning the logos or the Christ or the pillar of Fire or the angel of the Covenant it's all referring to the same one the word so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own in his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not a blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of men but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me now let's turn over to Isaiah 60 and we'll read the first two verses arise shine now we know who he's talking to he's talking to you he's talking to a last day people the Bride of Jesus Christ arise Shine for thy light is come whose light has come thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee before Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee now let's just if we can let's just bow our hearts one more time in a word of prayer father we want to express our love and confidence and appreciation for your grace upon us and to allow us to come into these meetings father we're gathered under a Vindicated message and Lord we're here identified as Believers of this message then Lord Let the Fire Fall just pour out your spirit and move in such a supernatural way we give ourselves completely over to you Lord do as you will Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you you may be seated the prophet or for a title I would like to just title this the manifested word and uh we we are in a season of manifestation and the prophet of God would say in spiritual food and do season he says I want you to get built up now in this holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing Faith be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether if that be of God or not whether that be God or not now I think that we have made our decision we have seen we have heard we have heard the message of the hour we have seen the signs and the Wonders and the Vindication of the message of the hour and we do declare that this is God this is not a man this is not a workup this is not a man's Revival this is not something that man is trying to organize lives and trying to put over but we see that this is the manifestation of the power and the anointing of God in this last day this is the Fulfillment of Prophecy that that says that in the evening time there shall be lied now the prophet taught us what light is is the word made manifest is lied now we have went through the denominational ages and where men have tried to figure out the Bible and they have brought forth teachings and they probed out these secrets and the Mysteries that have been hid and and it has brought much confusion it's brought an idea here and they denominated and it's brought another idea here and they denominated over that and and it's it's brought us into uh the age that we are in and that is dark laodicea and the spiritual condition is death it's a it's a spiritually dead Condition it's identified in the scripture as Babylon which is confusion there's much confusion everywhere you turn it's confusion no one knows what to believe in this hour amen and so again it is identified as Sodom and Gomorrah as it was in the days of lot Sodom conditions so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man and so gross darkness of unbelief has covered Humanity but you see the only thing that can defeat darkness is light amen it's not another idea it's not another church it's not another Creed it's not another idea the only thing thing that can defeat darkness is light and again what is light the word made manifest is the light now you see the prophet says that just like he did in Genesis 1 3 it said let there be light and light come forth his word went forth and light followed it and cleared away the mist and the Darkness went to one corner and the light shined on the other side that's the way God does today he sends his word for this hour and the Holy Spirit comes and makes that word live and the Darkness goes on to their Creeds and denominations but light shines because it is the word of God being Vindicated that his word is true now there is nothing fictitious about that that's just exactly exactly the scripture you see then this is the message of the hour this is the message that we have heard amen that this is the message that God is light and in him there is no Darkness at all and John said if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin amen there is no true Unity outside of the Vindicated light of the hour if you want True Fellowship then you unite around a Vindicated word in this day and hour if you want to see Jesus Christ raised to the power of his resurrection you unite around a Vindicated word amen if you want the blood that you cover your sins and take away all of your unbelief and you want to be clothed with the righteousness of the blood of Jesus Christ then you come under the headship of a Vindicated message for he is the word made manifest it's not a dead Creed it's an anointed light there is a man that can turn on the light there is a man that can take away the confusion there is a man that can give you rapturing Faith there is a man that can break the shackles there is a man that can defeat sin there is a man he's here he's the anointed reveal the word of the hour it's not a man it's the man Jesus Christ the Vindicated word of the hour Hallelujah you see his son it's the Sun that influences the natural seed it creates an atmosphere for life to be made manifest and we are under the teaching and the influence and the creative atmosphere of the Vindicated word of the hour you see a prophet is a teacher amen that's what a prophet is a teacher of his message amen and the fruit of the message is the words a man not a word that is here dormant but it is a sunlight that is shining upon this word to pull out the scriptures that is prophesied for this last day and to shine light upon this scripture and say these signs shall follow them that believe in my name you shall cast out Devils that's not a myth that's not some man it's the Vindicated sunlight shining upon this word the words that I do shall you do also every devil is under your feet it is the anointed revealed word shining upon this word we are under the influence what's wrong with your preacher I'm under the influence why do you act the way you act I'm under the influence why are you so fanatical with this faith I'm under the influence amen I know what it is to be under the influence of death I know what it is to be under the influence of hybrid religion but I know what it is to be set free by the power of the Risen sunlight he's not dead He's Alive it's the Healer and I miss it's the deliverer in our midst he has risen you see the prophet of God said that it's the manifestation of the son of man it's the manifested words you see remember he said John was sent to prepare the way for the word to be made manifest he was not the light but he was to prepare the way for the light to be made manifest and the prophet of God he says now he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord and make his path straight was he preparing the way of the word then that the word could be made manifest and the prophet says hallelujah don't you see in Shadows stop here a minute in the last days there's got to be a place prepared for the work to be made manifest and we're now living by the evidence of the new man of the new land the son of man you see a man a prophet came a man to prepare the way for the word to be made manifest you say preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about the word made manifest in Pride form there had to First be a prophet to prepare the way to call you out of dark denominationalism call you out of this man's teaching call you out of that Dogma call you out of that Creed and vindicate the word and show you this is the light of the hour there is no more light outside of the vindication the word of the hour and then to unite you around that Vindicated headship that the word could be made flesh in you we're not looking to cross over we've crossed over we're not looking for the promises we are in the promise we're not looking for a manifestation we are the manifestation we are the manifestation of a Vindicated message [Applause] is that okay to say like that [Applause] without this message there would be no bride without this message there would be no Millennium without this message there would be no change of the body without this message there would not be a Grace there would not be a bride shouting Grace Grace unto The Headstone why are we chatting there's a message why are we rejoicing there's a message why do we believe all things are possible we have a message Hallelujah we are not in Darkly at Asia we've been called out of the denominational ages we have come under a bright anointing we have come under an Easter message the mechanics and the Dynamics are won where's the mechanics where's the Dynamics hallelujah we're not waiting for it it's here splattering it's the Dynamics it's the refueling of the Holy Ghost wave after wave after wave and is sweeping over us until finally it'll change our mortal bodies and we will be likened to his glorious body [Applause] it's the evening light [Music] there's got to be a place prepared I don't know about you but I've been prepared for this day I've been prepared for this word to be made flesh I've been waiting for this tent meeting I've been waiting for releasing I've been waiting to just be me I've been waiting just to be the word made flesh I've been waiting just to believe and just accept who I truly am I'm not a chicken I'm an eagle I'm not in some dead Barnyard I'm under the anointed Vindicated word which is Christ himself Where Do We Gather do we go on Jeff do we go to Arizona no you just come on into Christ come on into the anointed revealed word of the hour how do these signs follow them that believe get into Christ they that are in Christ these signs shall follow the believer [Applause] come on come on over into the anointed message of the hour it's Christ it's the anointed one as listening to a message the other day and brother Branham says that that Moses following the pillar of fire let the children of Israel to the Red Sea and then here come pharaoh and his armies and Hallelujah and they begin to cry and they begin to well and they begin to amen we're going to be lost in everything else and then the prophet says but then Jesus came you mean Jesus was in the Old Testament how did Jesus get in the Old Testament how did Jesus amen Jesus well I'll tell you how Jesus got there in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and John the Elijah anointing said this is the one that I've been telling you about he's preferred before me because he was before me but I declare that he's the same yesterday today and forever he is the word he'll be the word hell I'm going through a hard time the word I'm going through difficulty the word oh but brother Jonathan you don't understand but the word and it's not a letter it's the manifested Vindicated word shining on the word and says you can't believe it [Applause] he's already manifested healing he's already manifested Deliverance he's already manifested Joy he's already manifested the Holy Ghost we're not waiting for it to be manifested we are the manifestation [Applause] oh yes we're living by the evidence grape juice all over me it's the wine of stimulation when a promised word is made manifest it stimulates if the word has not been made manifest then you've got an excuse there's no stimulation but if this message has become a personal revelation to you there is a stimulation of Revelation The Joy bills are ringing in your soul it's because you are stimulated what happened on the day of Pentecost when the new wine was being poured out amen they didn't burst amen they were fresh skins they were fresh anointed skins they were fresh word made manifest that was waiting for the Vindicated light to break forth upon their flesh they were waiting for the mechanics to become the Dynamics they were waiting for the stimulation of Revelation to sweep over them oh yes they have to wait they waited until the day of Pentecost was fully come but when it came oh it was joy unspeakable and full of Glory they became drunk men stackering under the influence of this is that this is the word main manifest I am that I am have made this word live in my flesh what's the shouting about brother Jonathan this is that why are you being so stimulated this is that [Applause] I hate to break the news but let me just break a seal over you we're not waiting for it it's already come what's the secret what's the mystery Christ in you the hope of glory [Applause] you see the prophet of God said the seventh Angel's message is to call the people the bride out of the Pentecostal and World tradition to the genuine atonement the word Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh Among Us science has proved it by pictures the church knows it the world around we firmly know it for he's never told us one thing in thus saith the Lord but what's been the truth you see I begin to look at that if the seventh angel is calling us to a genuine atonement the word then there must have been somehow they aired and they thought that they were under the atonement but they're not under the atonement and how did it take place because of false teaching you see we're not interested in just preaching about Calvary we want the effects of calvary you see you see if all we needed was just a man was just a good sermon on Calvary then all we needed was just Billy Graham's message but you see we're not just trying to get you to the altar we're not just trying to get you to make some confession we want Calvary to be effective we want a genuine blood a genuine bleach that can annihilate unbelief in your life that you can come to a perfect faith and a perfect confidence in the blood of Jesus Christ Malachi 4 the Vindicated message of the hour has brought us back to the genuine atonement and that is the blood works the bleach of Calvary is exactly what you need to live an overcoming life to be washed girly clean you see it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride there's no discussion there's no well maybe and what about this no you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word and the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the pride in yes sir she stands perfect very origin and adulterated she never sinned in the first place she was trapped into it I don't know about you but I'm not waiting for that word to be made manifest I am the manifestation I stand Here Redeemed by A Perfect lamb sacrifice I know that I know that I know that I stand Justified my faith is anchored in the atonement and I have no fear to say that I am perfect I am sinless [Applause] my confidence is in my sacrifice my confidence is in what God has Vindicated to be thus saith the Lord in this hour I have no fear to preach this message because it's the Vindicated where the Vindicated blood of God in this hour you'll never become sinless without it [Applause] because it's Jesus Christ [Applause] all right Revelations 1 and 5 from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness once he a faithful witness over his word and the first begotten of the Dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood wash means loose it's the same word that when Lazarus was dead in a cold cold formal [Applause] no life just dead but Jesus Jesus said there's a season for my word to be made manifest so they're trying to bring him on the scene but he cannot operate outside of his season so instead of going to Lazarus he just waited because my meat is to do the will of the father so Jesus had to wait what is he waiting for for the right season so the Bible says that he went four days journey and when he came in the season of restoration [Applause] when he came on the fourth day when he came in the fourth light you know I'm in the restoration of the Bride tree when he came in the fourth message [Applause] he went to the tomb of Lazarus and said hi Swiss come forth who is he calling for for that predestinated seed that was in that cold formal grave and he called him by name what is the revealing of the word doing it's calling those names you don't have to be buried in some dead cold formal tradition he's alive the Vindicated word of the hour is Jesus Christ risen and his sunlight is breaking all the denominational ideas out of us it's ripening the grain that just simply say I am him [Applause] come out of her Jesus had some help he has some Messengers he has some faithful Ministry the voice of the Resurrection The Message the shout went forth but there had to be some voice of Resurrection that said hey we gotta move this Stone we've got to roll the stone away and Jesus sent a word and said Row the stone away but it didn't stop there because Lazarus was bound up with grave clothes from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet there was a restoration message but there still had to be a word of Resurrection over Lazarus and loose him lose him from slavery loose him from those ideas lose him from unbelief lose him from all of the difficulties of complexes and fear and depression and all of the lust of laodice here stand as a witness a messenger of this evening light and say whom the Shadows set free is free indeed you're lost it's not what I said it's what he Vindicated [Applause] how'd you get here because you're loosed how'd you get out of that Baptist tradition you're loosed how'd you get out of that Pentecostal tradition you're loosed but it's time to go ahead and just loose you all the way these complexes that keep you bound up that you can't say that you're the Bride of Jesus Christ that you are not the perfect sinless blood but redeemed Pride of the Lord Jesus Christ I say I rebuke that in the name of Jesus you're loosed believe it believe you are him believe you are the word made manifest believe it [Applause] at the light of the hour you've been expressed to this heaping time to light up this age [Applause] walk in it believe it walk in the light as he is in the light you're loosed The Headstone crying what Grace Grace The Headstone the Vindicated word of the hour and his message to you Grace Grace there were no there would not be life spring forth if there was not first light Grace Grace the Garden of Eden would have stayed in chaos but for great grace come on the prophet of God said that there was darkness that covered that covered the world chaos cover the world but Grace came in the form of light the message of the hour the Vindicated word of the hour is God's message to you Grace Grace I don't care how perfect you think you are in your works you are nothing but a sinful human being [Applause] there is absolutely no human possible way to make the Rapture without Grace [Applause] we heard it last night when you fall get up again Grace Grace [Applause] if you make a mistake Grace Grace you gotta hear it you gotta hear it from the Garden of Eden after the fall when the word was walking in the Garden of Eden crying Adam Adam where are thou what was it the word coming in Grace I'm Not Gonna Leave You In This Fallen condition but I'm going to redeem you I'm going to come to the seat of the woman and it's going to be a virgin birth and I am going to destroy the works of the devil the Son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the devil Grace Grace while you were getting sin he destroyed the Oaks upon the drop in your life Grace Grace every time you press play on this message it's Grace Grace it's the faith of this hour imparting a rapturing Grace upon your heart you couldn't believe without Grace [Applause] you have passed from death and Creed into a Living Word of the Living God well brother Jonathan you know we got alternative plans we got Plan B plan C Plan D this one doesn't work we got this plan and if that doesn't go I said all that for this God's only provided plan four not your age his age I'm starting to feel too good you see we're talking about the Creator we're talking about the word that created all things so the same one that said let there be light in the beginning is the same one that said let there be light in the end time and he has created [Applause] his age and if you want to find Christ you got to come on over into his age brother Jonathan what is his age it's the word age if you want to find power come on into the word if you want to find Deliverance come on into the word if you want to find Rapture come on into the word it's my word that comes Faith the Revelation to believe and stand and be victorious not by your words but Grace [Music] God has provided in his age the word age Grace [Music] [Applause] I'm never going to get through this quote is this okay [Applause] pass from death and decreed into a Living Word of the Living God God's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit up of something to make him alive and seated now somebody say with me see to now in Heavenly places in prison tense what is the Heavenly places it's replacing it's your adoption seated now in Heavenly places already alive and subject to every promise in the word then what does that do you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men are part of God's word seated together manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no living among you what is living is sin what is sin unbelief but he has paid the price of our hybriding there is noun therefore now no more condemnation in Christ Jesus present tense setting in Heavenly places we are now without living [Music] we manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you no leaven among you just the word only seated in Heavenly places in the door where he put his name Christ Jesus no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't do it at Wesley's age couldn't do it in the Pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man will be made man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on Earth in a form of a prophet God it's because it is the same one Hallelujah then you mean to tell me that it's the blood is the bloody pleading word that has made this possible you mean we are sitting together right now present tense in the Heavenly places without living no one believed and the fullness of deity is right here dwelling in the word pride the last day manifestation of his presence I tell you friends it's not a myth it's a reality deity Tabernacles in your skin you've been redeemed for this purpose you've been purchased for it then then then it's okay to say thy light has come [Applause] we're not waiting on it to come we're not waiting we're not behind and waiting for something greater to come brother Branham said my Ministry is to glit is to declare he is here yeah so all of the signs all of the evidence everything that we have accumulated is the faith of this hour this is God thy light has come a revelation has come the manifested light is shining on this scripture bringing out those promises that are for you and this last day Hallelujah that If thy light has come and the Lord has risen upon you amen then it is not it is not just it is not just a man it's not just a gift [Applause] it's not just simply a manifestation and we just enjoy his presence and then we go home and we're just the same old same old as we have been this is the Lord himself that has descended upon the Bride of Jesus Christ the Lord has risen upon thee what force why why to bring Liberty where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty liberty for what to be changed changed from a chicken to an eagle changed for being from a hybrid to an anointed son and daughter of God changed from kids and dogmas to a living manifested faith change from laodice here dead called formal blind naked miserable than a bride of Jesus Christ who recognizes who she is in the evening light message change not lukewarm changed I'm trying to just give barely get Bob from week to week change not fearful to identify with this message and ashamed of the Messenger changed [Applause] changed from just picking around with it until I believe that but I don't believe that and taking away the Miracles taking away the manifestation taking away the glory of God for the bride changed [Applause] sold out [Applause] applied with the headship of the word the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory we heard that last night didn't we his glory shall be seen upon thee we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten the prophet of God I'm not going to I've got so many quotes and things I can't get to them the prophet of God said the reason that the bridegroom had to be so plainly manifest is because the bride is coming as the Omega here's the alpha bridegroom and he is the Omega bride and the bridegroom was so plainly manifested that you would be able to look into the manifested word and say that is me he's the alpha he's the Omega he's the Masterpiece and you were taking out of this side through Redemption and he is now by his word created a masterpiece bride and has brought you back into perfect union with the word Alpha has become Omega you see who you are [Applause] I can feel I can I can feel that fear demon trying to come back on wait a minute you you mean you mean the bridegroom was made plain so I would be able to look at him and see me but you don't know my complexes you don't know my mistakes that's why I'm preaching to you a bloody pleading word [Applause] that's why I'm manifesting the blood that's why I am manifesting Calvary that's why he said if I be lifted up I'll draw oh man unto me [Applause] oh but brother Jonathan you just don't see whenever a time I look in the mirror I see all of my mistakes you're not looking through the blood [Applause] you're trying to look at the word through your own ideas of it but you've got to come through the you've got to come through vindication are you with me you gotta come through what a Vindicated Prophet said about you amen it's your not your thoughts it's what God thought of you and spoke it and now you are the manifested light of this message you've got to speak it you've got to come through Vindication and then when you come through Vindication you'll say what a prophet said about you and you will say I am him everything he is I am he's my example he's my example and the prophet said if he hit on 16 cylinders the bride of Christ will hit on 16 cylinders why she's flesh of his flesh both of his bone manifestation of his manifestation power of his power word of his word hallelujah she is him this ain't imagination we're not making this up we speak of Vindicated word over this bride don't be fearful to believe I am here if he said these signs shall follow them that believe that's who I am if he said they shall lay hands to the sick and they shall recover that's who I am in my name they shall cast out Devils it's who I am by the blood of the lamb and the word of my test of your testimony you'll overcome of this age that's who I am I'm not shirking my responsibility I speak this message I believe this message I claim this message is the blood over our lives thank you his glory his glory shall be seen on thee the pillar of Fire the token the prophet of God said we have one we have taught with the token but now the token is made manifest the Holy Ghost the pillar s is now made manifest foreign [Applause] when you're when you're feeling so much of a of a spirit of a layout to see upon you I just want you to know that there's an anointing on you thy light has come and His glory is on you when you're taking care of sick children at home his glory is upon you when you're cooking supper at home his glory is upon you Daddy's when you're facing the hardships and your work and all of these things and you're facing so many but I just want you to know his glory is upon you hey man you see your light has come amen okay then the prophet of God says hey man says Show Me Your Glory Moses is talking he says Show Me Your Glory and I'll go I like to see a little of that Shekinah Glory don't you show me your glory Lord now what is your glory Lord Moses what is that in your hand it's a stick Lord an old Crooked Stick said throw it on the ground throw it on the ground it turned to a serpent he jumped back said pick him up in the tail he did it turn back to a stick now Moses take your hand put it in your bosom he did over in his heart pulled it out it was white with Leprosy see it means the conscience of man the heart of man his wife with Leprosy the very thoughts of his mind is leprosy sin he put it back in his bosom and pulled it out again what had to be done when it come back out it was white cleaned off just like like a baby's hand like the other hand he's seen God's glory what is God's glory then miracles signs wonders Divine Healing show me your glory Lord I tell you friends his glory has risen upon thee the pillar of fire has returned to the Church of the Living God we see Miracles we see deliverance we see manifestation Show Me Your Glory we've seen it last night we complexes were being broke off and shackles when you danced under the anointing of the Holy Ghost because you are his victory Hallelujah now healing is God's own witness his own Glory he sent his word and healed them and delivered them so what is the word to do it is the glory of God shining upon you bringing healing body spirit and soul and delivering you oh yes sir the glory of God is risen upon thee you are God's miracles you are God's paradox greatest mystery to hit this Earth is how you in sin and the devil had you so bound but God under the power of His glory resurrected you freed you wash you and now you are spotless restart [Applause] you see you see Divine healings God's glory the testimonies that have been coming back you were this way but then the Lord came upon you and we've seen his glory and it changed you you were sick now you're healed what is it it is his glory that is risen upon thee the pillar of fire accompanies this message always all right I'm getting very close you see John in Revelations 5 came to a book that it was a written word but had not been a manifested word yet you see the prophet of God said that as long as it's just in its written form anyone has a right to put their own interpretation I don't know if I don't know if I maybe I should reword that they don't have a right to it but they do it they come along and they begin to try to say well the days of Miracles have passed and they try to take you to their scriptures for it and they'll try to twist your mind and then they'll come right around and say well we don't believe in all of that emotion and that's all fanaticism and that's we got the word now we don't need all of that thank you see the problem is that so many are still trying to Rally around a close book [Applause] they're trying to make the word live under another age another anointing they're out of season you see the Pentecostal age was the shock but the prophet of God says that the tassel made a way or the stock made a way for the tassel and the tassel made a way for the shock and the shock made a way for the grain the Holy Ghost the word to be made manifest justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the word to be made manifest it is fullness Revelations 10 [Applause] malachiophore Luke 17 30. all of these scriptures accumulated together manifest the full word born into manifestation again in the last days we're not looking for a word to be made manifest we are under the anointed Vindicated word made manifest we are not waiting for the word to be born into manifestation we already are born into manifestation all right I got the quote so I can go there but I don't have time you see under the written word John was looking at a closed book and he you talk about depression you talk about spirits of Oppression being able to get to you when you're still looking at a closed book your subjects to you're subject to all kinds of doubt you're subject to all kinds of influences you're subject to all kinds of demonic lies and John wet because no one was Worthy no one was worthy to even to to even look upon the word this book of redemption a man he looked at that book of redemption and and all he had in his heart was sorrow and pity and woe is me and there's no hope and we're Beyond hope and we're just going to barely make it and I sure hope I make the Rapture but I don't know if I'm gonna make it I sure hope I'm going to miss the tribulation maybe the blood isn't for me baby baby the blood's not powerful enough for me come on you know I'm dealing with those same voices that attack your mind [Applause] Hallelujah but all the sudden there was an angel there was an angel with a message there was an angel with a declaration there was an angel that began to cry out don't weep John thy light has come don't weep John the lion of the tribe of Judah have prepared and His glory the glory the glory the glory of the Risen manifested sunlight is on thee don't weep don't worry you can't miss it you're predestinated your life is in the roots [Applause] you're a part of the sea Gene and this word is manifested the fruit [Applause] you are the fruit of the open book you can't be lost [Applause] [Music] thank you you are the fruit of this message teaching and the Dynamics that is the latter rain falling that is quickened that predestinated seed refuse this to allow you to believe that you are going to the tribulation refuses to allow you to believe that you're going to miss God you you are predestinated to see the manifestation of his presence [Applause] you know what I did when the line prevailed and that message began to go forth it changed the whole atmosphere just like it did in the garden when the whole world was in chaos and darkness and but all of a sudden the original spoken word is the original light and it began to clear out the darkness and it began to create an atmosphere of joy begin to create an atmosphere of life and now this risen this word this manifested word is now producing an atmosphere over John who is a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ and this atmosphere is changing from Doom and Gloom and darkness and fear and unbelief and tread and what if and what if and what if to an atmosphere of real Joy of real faith of real understanding they that know their God shall do great exploits they're coming under the revealing of the son of man and they're identifying that hey I can't miss it I am him I am the manifestation of his word I can take you to this written word and show you where I am I know my place in the scripture I'm a believer I'm anointed to make this word live when the lamb took the book Revelations 5 8-10 when he had taken the book The Four beasts and Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sang sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy oh that sounds like last night that sounds like the previous nice that sounds like there's a revival going on I'll tell you what it is it's not an intellectual Revival it's a word Revival the Dynamics have come to the mechanics we've been restored back to Acts 2 the Power of Pentecost has returned We are following the headship of the word back to the Garden of Eden [Applause] oh yeah change the song completely Thou Art Worthy to take the book and open the seals they're up for thou wrestling and the house redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth amen if you would read on down amen the Bible says that everything and in heaven everything on the earth everything under the Earth heard a high John shouting rejoicing worshiping the lamb [Applause] oh why his losing had come his Revelation had come his light had come the glory of the mighty Angel and raised it upon him and now he was made worthy by the blood of the Lamb yes sir there's a shout in this Revelation it's the shadow of the king is in the camp it's the shadow of the blind lies being open it's the shelter of those that once were lost and now they are found it's the shelter of those that were in drugs but now they are set free it's the shelter of those that were under the death sentence death sentence and slavery of sin but now they are set free there's a shout of the anointed king in the camp I'll tell you what season it is it's King lamb worship time no no brother Ronnie shared this quote this morning it says when you walk through the blood of Jesus Yonder and God has cleansed your soul there'll be another dancing party take place the joy bells of heaven will leap up in your heart why because the old Taskmaster is dead amen the old sleep held a sin is dead the old traditions is dead the old sin of unbelief is dead and now you are liberated to raise your hands now you are his victory [Music] it's not an emotion it's a revelation you are his victory and dance is a victory it's a revelation but hey I'm going in the Rapture the word has found me the word has found me the word has found me it's the word age [Applause] I'm predestinated to this seventh under Revival I am predestinated to hear the voice of my shepherd I am predestinated thank you for my change let the musicians come can I share one more with you one time Elijah was feeling sorry for himself because he thought that he was the only one that believed the prophet of God in the fourth seal says Elijah never knew even one of them was that way he thought he was the only one saved are you ready until God opened one of the seals and showed him the mystery in the book that he had 700 that never bowed down to them Creeds that they had when God opened his book to Elijah said now wait a minute son I got 700 that's tucked around out there that's got their names on the book since the foundation of the world their mind the prophet says God opened the seals are you ready for it that's the reason I think John was doing a lot of shouting the other night he must have seen his name on there [Music] do you think God allowed the prophet to look beyond the curtain of time not just beyond in that in that era not just those bodies but maybe some bodies right here in 2023 that believe this message do you think that the angel of the Lord said let me show you a vision there's more to come there's more to come this is only the Sheep waving this is only the Declaration there's more Sons to come oh yeah I say we're here brother Jonathan what do I do what do I do what do I do all right all right shine don't work it up just believe you're a believer you're a believer you're anointed to believe you don't have to work anything up it's in you to believe [Applause] it's Easter it's Resurrection it's time to go home [Applause] press the battle keep pressing the battle we're almost there Can You Feel the glory of the Lord surrounding you [Music] [Applause] if God would allow it they could take a picture right now and you see the pillar of fire surrounding you we're not making this up we're in the message of the hour the angel of his presence is with you the pillar of heart never leaves this message and I hope I did a good enough job of saying it this way and you are the manifested word of the hour the alpha the alpha has become the Omega Jesus never went around trying to become the word Jesus never took the letter and said if I could only be that if I could only be that if I could only be that he was the word he was the sea Gene of God we are not trying to become the word we are not trying to if I could just believe it if I could just believe it whether you've got enough Faith right now to believe it now or not you are I didn't say it it is the revealing of the son of man the bridegroom that has taken responsibility over his own bride and he said I'll not lose one we are under the responsibility of the Vindicated sunlight of the hour he said I will have a harvest I will have a bride the prophet said how is she going to be there I don't know he said it's not up to me to know it's up to me to preach the word it's his responsibility [Music] I just want to go ahead and just let you know [Music] that's the reason I rejoice that's the reason I say it often enough I tell you you you you you want to know a rock and a hard spot for me as a Preacher Brother Ronnie it's sitting right there where brother Wayne was preaching for her setting and hearing the message of the hour
