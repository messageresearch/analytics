we're still here and we're still believing and we're still pressing on Amen well the musicians can be dismissed here this evening we greet you on the name of the Lord Jesus it sure is an honor privilege to be in his house tonight and I want to say it's real honor to have this privilege to speak to you tonight and we just pray that something can be said to bless you and to help you and if you have your Bibles this evening we will turn in our scriptures the book of Ephesians the first chapter we want to look there in the book of Ephesians the first chapter and I want to say it's a really good to be home here tonight and we are sure thankful for all that God's doing among his people amen amen Ephesians the first chapter we want to look here in the third verse just before we read the word let's just buy our hearts together for a word of prayer and how many would say Lord speak to me tonight amen he sees every hand Heavenly Father Thy word is true here tonight and Lord as we stand here we are very well aware that we're not Lord just in a building Lord that's been set aside to be called a church but Lord we're in your presence and father where two or three are gathered together Lord in your name you said that you would come and be in our midst and Lord as I look around here tonight there's more than two or three but there's a whole house full of Believers here tonight Lord that believe you and they love you and father we're endeavoring to diligently seek after your will and seek after your ways father Lord as we come to this portion of the service tonight we know that Lord any service is not complete without the preaching of your word and or do you see these things that you've laid up on my heart these thoughts tonight God I pray or that some way somehow you would take these things and Lord may you positionally place him in the hearts of your Believers Lord that father as your word is being preached Lord May healing take place in bodies Lord father May Deliverance take place in mind Lord May spirits that are low may they be lifted Dear God me spirits that are bound may they be set free Lord those that are discouraged may your word Lord or may it bring encouragement in their hearts and Lord whatever is your desire for this service we surrender to it tonight God and we give you your way give you your will Lord have your way among the sword we we give you this service we surrender everything we are into your hands Lord we don't want to be in control of anything we want you to have the way your way in everything now Lord we pray you bless this meeting with your presence in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the believer says amen and amen the book of Ephesians the first chapter and I want to look here in the third verse of Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3. Paul here writing very familiar reading he says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ now there's one thing that really stands out to me is he's not going to do this in the future and he's not saying I'm doing this right now but he actually has done this it was something that was done in eternity that you're actually catching up with in time who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ now if we could also look at one of their passages scripture in the book of Hebrews the book of Hebrews the sixth chapter the book of Hebrews 6 and I want to look there in the 19th verse another very familiar reading in Hebrews 6 and verse 19 Paul here writing he says which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil amen let's just read that 19th verse together which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entireth into that within the veil we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I want tonight just to speak to here for a few moments and if I well title this tonight I want to speak to you on a little thought here the Lord has given me I've just been preaching a little bit on the field a little bit with it so I pray maybe just share a few things from it tonight but I want to speak to you on we are heavenlies in our souls we are heavenlies in our souls now when you look at that word heavenlies it actually uh just a very simple definition but it is suggesting uh the Blessed state of heaven so in other words it's actually telling us that the the blessedness or the delightfulness or the the serenity or the peace amen of what's going on in heaven is actually come into the souls of human beings now as we have read from the book of Ephesians you know that the prophet says that Ephesians parallels the Book of Joshua right he said you could read Joshua and it's like reading Ephesians in the New Testament read Ephesians it's like reading Joshua in the Old Testament and brother Bram says in this adoption series number one he said now the book of Ephesians places us positionally in Christ that's what the book of Ephesians does it places us positionally in Christ what they was in the Holy Land see but we are not placed in the Holy Land amen but we are placed in the Holy Ghost so amen as Joshua was placing tribes into the Holy Land remember said the Holy Ghost is not here placed in the church in a holy land he said but it's your place in the Holy ghost in the people and placing them in the Holy Ghost now when you start talking about that the first word that jumps out to you is Holy right the Holy Land the Holy Ghost and then breaks it down he says see but there is no holy man there is no holy church excuse me he said it's a holy ghost right not a holy church not a holy people but it's the Holy Ghost among the people he said that's what it is he said not a Holy Mountain where Peter and them stood the mountain wasn't holy he said but it's the holy God on the mountain is what made it holy now amen he says see it's not a holy person it's the holy ghost that is used in that person is what makes it holy not the person but the person of the Holy Ghost so amen the book of Ephesians is positionally placed in the holy ghost in a people that is separating them from the things of the world it is separating them from the ideas of denomination it is bringing them to a position in Christ now as we start looking at this you all know this quote by heart but the prophet of God says we are promised another Ephesians right we are promised another Ephesians and I believe that that another Ephesian is actually going to produce another Exodus but remember said like this he said we are promised according to Revelation 10 and Malachi 4 and Luke 17 30. and so forth that there has got to come and Ephesians to this there is promised it friends there must come in Ephesians that these Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God he said they must be unfolded and it's in the laodicean age that this takes place he said I believe that we're here I believe that we're right in the shadows of the coming of the the Son of God and as Joshua just before the Ephesians raised up he said so did John the Baptist raise up before the next Ephesian and were promised another Ephesian now think about that John the Baptist raised up right before that Ephesian he said and we're promised another Ephesians it's predicted here in the scripture therefore I think we are living in the Ephesians again we are promised that what was left off during those Seven Ages so we are not amen we we are promised what was left off is going to be given to the church in this age he said in God rich and mercy now we find that we have come to another Ephesian he said another emphasis now where that inner intellectual denominations and so forth all of our educational programs has come to its Jordan he said then we must have in Ephesians again we must have and Ephesians again he said we must have an exodus Amen to come out of and to go into for the Rapture so the Holy Ghost is not positionally placing you amen for another age he's not positionally placing you for another Revival or just another a move of God but he's actually positionally placing you amen for The Exodus or for the Rapture or for the changing of your body so I can say that you like me I said the book of Ephesians amen is not addressed to the unbeliever right the book of Ephesians is not addressed to the make-believer but the book of Ephesians is addressed to the believer amen and as a Believer we find that there's actually desires that a Believer has amen that an unbeliever does not have there's actually desires that a Believer has that a make-believer does not have right I was listening today the prophet preaching three kinds of Believers he said it's very easy to identify amen three kinds of Believers he said the believer is genuine he believes the word of God regardless he said the make-believer he said he hangs on long enough to find some fault or find something wrong he said the unbeliever he said he just gets up and walks out he'd been very simple way to identify amen which believer you are amen a Believer believes the word regardless right amen a make-believer believes it until they find some fault and then they found something they can emphasize upon amen but an unbeliever won't even set to hear it but thank God tonight amen that the word has separated us and has identified us not as unbelievers amen and not as make-believers but we have been identified amen not even as borderline Believers but we've been identified amen is genuine field Believers with the spirit of God and then as a Believer there is desires now I said to you like this I find two desires right there in Ephesians 1 3 amen the first desire amen is the believer desire spiritual blessings any believers here tonight amen you desire spiritual blessings amen then the second desire of the believer amen is Heavenly places amen they desire spiritual blessings and they desire Heavenly places now amen I said like this the Believers desire amen is a spiritual desire look what David says in Psalms 27 4 he said one thing have a desire to the Lord amen that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord amen all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple in Psalms 38 verse 9 David said Lord All My Desire is before thee and my groanings is not hid from thee in Psalm 63 verse 1 he said oh God Thou Art my God Amen early will I seek thee for my soul thirsteth for thee now watch here amen David has just identified what is thirsting after God Amen is his soul he said my soul thirsteth for thee amen and my flesh longest for thee in a dry and thirsty land amen where no water is see thy power and deceive thy glory amen so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary look at what Isaiah says in Isaiah 26 9 he said with My Soul have I desired thee in the ninth season amen yea my spirit Within Me will I seek thee early for when thy judgments are in the earth and the inhabitants of the world Amen will learn righteousness Jesus said in Luke 6 21 he said blessed are ye that hunger now for you shall be filled amen see I'm thankful tonight to say to you that we are serving a God that can make our desires a reality amen we're serving of God that if you've got a desire here tonight for a an answer there's a God in the building that can give you an answer if you've got to desire for a healing there's a Healer in the room amen that can give you the healing if you've got a desire for a victory amen there's a captain of the host of the Lord amen that's in the church tonight and he's here to do more than just stimulate your flesh he's here to do more than just give you an emotional high but he has come down in the midst of the church to me our desires amen a reality Our God Amen can make our desires a reality amen now you know I can go very deep on this thought because the prophet did he said before there can be a creation amen there has to be a creator Brian he said before there was a fan on a fish's back he said there was a water for the fish to swim in he said before there was an apple tree on the earth he said there was an Earth for that apple tree to grow out of Amen in other words before there can be a desire he said there has to be something to fulfill that desire listen friends if you've got to desire here tonight and it's a word based desire amen it's a scriptural desire it's a spiritual desire then there is a God who can come on the scene and can manifest the reality of that desire I think of in the Book of John the 12th chapter the Bible says they came there for the Philip which was a Bethesda of Galilee and what did they do they desired him saying amen their speech was coming from their desires amen they desired him saying sir amen we would see Jesus Remember said our hearts are just as hungry tonight amen to see Jesus Christ as those Greeks were he said because no one can ever hear of him amen that would not more to see him see he said it's been my heart's desire Amen to know the reality amen no one can hear of him amen without there being a desire to see him no one can read about him without there being a desire Amen to meet him let me say this tonight amen and our hearts don't have to leave the house of God empty we don't have to leave here without one thing amen by what God has promised we can have in the age we're living and our God is a god of reality and if he's a god of reality he's been in spiritual blessings are a reality if he's a god of reality then Heavenly places amen are not just some pipe dream somewhere amen but there's a God of those heavenly places there's a God of those spiritual blessings there's a God who can come down in the church tonight and can lift you up out of the situations of your life he can lift you up out of the circumstances listen amen I know we're living in some dark times I know we're living in some confusion times amen but don't forget what you got on the inside of you you may have a lot of trouble you may have a lot of circumstances but on the depths of the depths of your body there is a soul and that soul is not anchored in the White House in Washington that soul is not anchored in the church house here in Virginia amen but that soul is hankered Amen in the eternities of eternities Amen where there's a living God who can move upon that Soul hey our God is a living God he's a god of reality he's a God that does more than give you desires amen but he gives you the desire he gives you the reality to that desire then I say tonight Heavenly places are real if you agree with me Heavenly places are real now when brother bran preaches adoption this is actually where I picked up this title from in the adoption part one he actually takes time to break down Ephesians 1 3. I know you know this but this let me share it with you he said in Heavenly places now you're not just out anywhere everybody in Heavenly places he said we are assembled in Heavenly it means amen that's the position of the believer he said that if I'm prayed up and you're prayed up or the church is prayed up he said and we're ready for the message we've assembled ourselves together amen as Saints called out elected baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessings he said called elected set together in Heavenly places now now watch what he says we are heavenlies in our souls amen we are heavenlies in our souls amen our Spirits has been brought us in to a Heavenly atmosphere brother there you are a Heavenly atmosphere he said then what could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in a Heavenly atmosphere and the Holy Spirit moving every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus he said all sins are under the blood Amen in perfect worship with our hands up to God and our hearts lifted setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus worshiping together in the Heavenly places he said did you ever sit in one oh I have amen till I would wheat for joy and say God never let me leave here just Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now amen I could stop there and preach for a few moments amen because notice where he identified the heavenly's word he did not say you were heavenlies in your body he did not even say you were heavilies in your spirit he said but we are heavenlies in our souls amen now you all know as well as high amen that it's Wednesday night and your bodies are tired amen your minds are weary you've been through some things today you're facing some things tomorrow amen and right now you're pressing but you're pressing with everything that's within you just to be in this service amen your bodies are tired amen your spirits are low amen but let me ask you this why are you here tonight are you here because your heavenly's in your body are you here because your Heaven is in your spirit amen the reason why you're here tonight amen is because you are heavenlies in your soul if it was up to your body you wouldn't be in the church house tonight if it was up to your spirits you wouldn't be raising your hands amen but do you know I sometimes slow Services amen turn into blowouts do you know why sometimes slow song Services amen turn into spontaneous worship Services amen is because there's a soul in there and that Soul has broke beyond these Earthbound elements amen and the soul is not controlled amen by the condition of the body amen the soul is not controlled by the condition of the spirit remember the soul is controlled by the authority of God's word and it's been revealed in the age you're living amen then there's a revelation in your soul amen that no matter how sick I am amen my God is here no matter how bound I am my God is a deliverer Oh Glory to God you see where that's coming from it's coming from your soul well you know I'm telling you the truth if it was up to your body you wouldn't get out of bed on Sunday morning if it was up to your body you wouldn't raise your hands amen some people didn't give in their body they don't get up on Sunday mornings and come to church no more amen but there's some amen there's still moved by their souls y'all know what I'm talking about you've come to church on Wednesday nights amen and your body's been against you your spirit's been against you everything's been against you amen and you've got enough courage to make it to the house of God and you come in on a Wednesday night and you sit down amen and your body said just be thankful you got here and your spirit said I hope nobody looks body and your spirit made an agreement and she wasn't going to get a blessing out of that service amen your body and your spirit made an agreement that you weren't going to get nothing out of the preaching amen but when you got in the building amen and the songs of Zion begin to Be Sung amen the atmosphere began to turn into a Heavenly atmosphere amen and from your soul your spirit began to be lifted up amen and then those hands had said they weren't going to wave and those hands that said they weren't going to clap and those hands just said they weren't going to give God praise Amen in a few moments you broke out of this Earthbound chatter chattering and you broke into rim and your body was too and amen what it said it wasn't going to do and you know why that was because you are heavenlies in your soul amen you are heavenlies in your soul amen amen I love what Paul's saying he said blessing us with all spiritual blessings amen breaks that down he said blessing us with what amen with Divine Healing with foreknowledge with Revelation now notice this Visions Powers tongues interpretation wisdom amen knowledge all the Heavenly blessings amen joy unspeakable and full of Glory he said every heart is filled with a spirit walking together sitting together in Heavenly places there's not one evil thought Among Us there's not one cigarette smoked there's not one short dress not one this that or the other amen not one evil thought amen not nobody got anything against one another everybody's speaking in love and harmony everybody with one Accord in one place and then suddenly there came from Heaven a sound like a Russian Mighty Wind he said there you are amen he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings he has blessed us with all spiritual blessing amen I don't have time to preach on all the spiritual blessing but there's one brother Amos that just jumped out and got me and it was Revelation amen one of the spiritual blessings amen that God has given the church amen is revelation now when you start looking at this thought between the soul and the body and the spirit in 1961 remembers ask the question please explain the difference between the spirit and the Soul he said well now that's a hard one he said but the first thing you are a Triune being amen just like Father Son and Holy Ghost everybody agree you're a Triune being just like father son Holy Ghost see he said three titles going to one person which is Jesus Christ and you are a soul you're a body and you're a spirit but it takes those three to make you with just one of them amen you're not you so it takes the three to make you he said like I said the other day this is my hand this is my this is my ear this is my nose amen this is my finger amen but who is me he said see now notice this if the eye if the hand if the body stood here just as it is today my body could be here but me could be gone my body could be here but me could be gone he said then what am I whoever I am is inside of me has gone on he said that's the part that is the spirit now watch this the soul he said is the nature of that spirit amen the soul is the nature of that spirit that when the Holy Ghost comes upon you it does not do nothing it changes amen or converts your spirit to a different soul he said in that soul is a different nature that's on the spirit he said so the soul is the nature of your spirit he said first you were mean and evil and hatred and Malice and strive amen you were not loving but now you are sweet and you're loving and you're kind do you see the difference it's your nature see it's your soul that's been changed amen the old now listen what he says the old soul died and the new Soul which is the new nature Was Born Into You amen it wasn't Two Souls amen It Was the Same Soul it went through a process of regeneration amen and the old soul the old man teacher died amen and the new Soul which was the new nature came into you he said see and the soul of the spirit amen is what controls the spirit that controls the body now watch this brother Branham is not speaking from the outside in he's speaking from the inside out he's not saying it's your body that controls your spirit that controls your soul but he's saying if there's a nature change oh God if there's a nature change on the inside of that little compartment in the heart called the soul and the old nature dies and the new man the new nature takes preeminence amen then the new nature will control the spirit amen and it will control the body right amen see in other words as a Believer you are a twofold being right you're a twofold being amen said like this she said if you got the Holy Spirit In You amen then you are a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural amen no wonder people can't believe in those things he said they've never come in contact they got nothing in here to believe with but when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart he said quickly he becomes then a twofold being he said one of the earth to die amen but one of the Heavens to live amen your body is of the earth to die amen but there's a soul in there and that soul is of the Heavens to live he said in this body he's still subject to death but in his soul he has passed from Death unto life in his body he has Earthly contact with five senses amen but in his Spirit he has a contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God this it's them and speaks with them and they are messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God Amen to this individual listen right now I see your body right now I see a twofold part of you and that's your body and it's of the earth and it's subject to die amen but the reason I'm preaching tonight with everything within me is cause I'm not looking at your body amen alone but I'm looking at a soul by the word amen and this body is subject this body is subject to sickness it's subject to disease it's subject to bad days it's subject to Hard Times amen but there's a soul in there and that soul is not subject to what this body is subject to you say why amen because the soul has passed from death and to life listen friends amen it's not your soul that depresses you it's your body that depresses you it's not your soul that says you're not going to make it it's your body that says you're not going to make it come on you know I'm preaching to you amen your body and your spirit will team up on you and before long they'll have you convinced nobody loves you you ain't worthy to be in the bride you ain't good enough to be a part of the church amen I tell you where that's coming from it's coming from your body and your spirit amen that there's a soul in there and if the Holy Ghost is on that Soul it'll bring that body and spirit subject and your body will have to obey the confession of your soul my we need the holy spirit amen not just Upon Our flesh not just in our spirits but we need the Holy Ghost in our souls the proud of God said the leadership of the Holy Ghost decide and the church is nothing but the world Amen with God's name attached to it amen the world and the church are all the same lump they're just like Jacob and Esau were the same parents amen but the spirit of God makes a difference amen the spirit of God makes the difference amen it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone can do that amen but the point is whether or not you have the spirit of God in you for without the spirit you are a reprobate amen and you are none of his amen without the spirit of God you are a reprobate and we are none of his you say then why are you preaching so hard about the leadership of the Holy Ghost being on the soul amen because we are motivated by Spirits you know Birmingham sit behind everything brother Sammy said behind everything there is a spirit he said there's a spirit behind television there's a spirit behind Hollywood now come on we might as well preach we're here amen behind and everything there is a spirit so the motivation to everything you see is a spirit you see people say to me of time they said with Andrew they say why amen do you preach against skinny jeans why do you preach against this why do you preach against that amen if you could only realize we're not preaching against the person wearing it amen we're preaching against the spirit amen that obviously they're ignorant of that's motivating them to wear I'm on y'all know I'm telling you the truth what boy in his right mind puts on a pair of jeans amen they're skinnier than any so that's more skin tied amen than any dress Hollywood's ever made I tell you what kind of spirit it is it's a spirit from pale that come into Hollywood that's been labeled fashion amen and a man of God got a backbone about him amen he'll strike that spirit and give the young person or the man enough courage Amen to rebuke that spirit and accept their deliverance from Hell come on you'll say well I don't know why he's always preaching against television amen ain't nothing wrong with the television ain't nothing wrong with a box ain't nothing wrong with the wires what's wrong is the spirit that's motivating the picture that's being put on the thing that's found the Liberty in your home oh come on church amen if you want to overcome Some Devil start recognizing in the infancy of the spirit of them and drive them out of your life amen it's a motivation of spirits it's something trying to get at your soul to bring you in a condition that God never intended for you to be him he said whatever your spirit is moves you you are motivated by a spirit and if the spirit of Jesus Christ is in the Christian the believer no wonder he's a peculiar person no wonder there's something moving in him because God is in him and the spirit of Christ is motivating him and he has to move as the spirit moves him could you imagine seeing John walk down there and say oh that's all right and this is all right as long as the spirit of Elijah was on him he acted like Elijah when you take these people that ghost now starts off and says oh I'm going to be a Christian and they start off all right but the first thing in about six months are all gummed up and going back he said you can tell right then amen that the anointing's leaving them somebody say that with me the anointing is leaving them they start off with a confession I'm going to be a Christian but in about six months and then they start pulling back program identify what's causing he said the anointing is leaving them then let me ask you what God on them amen that moved him to that confession that they were going to be a Christian I'll tell you what done it was the anointing the anointing God on them that moved him to a confession I'm going to be a Christian amen but he said watch the anointings leaving them he said for as long as the spirit of Christ is in you it'll make you Christ like as long as the spirit of Christ is in you it will make you Christ like now notice here as long as the anointing amen is in you it will make you Christ like then I say to you tonight amen that the anointing can't just be upon us and the anointing can't just be around us amen but the anointing has got to be in you and you have got to be in the anointing if you're going to have the strength Amen to hold your Christian confession the anointing is going to have to be in your church it can't just be on you in special meetings it can't just be on you in the church's field and there's a bunch of visitors and we're all shouting amen but on a Wednesday night on a slow service and a high service amen if the anointing is in you regardless of the conditions of your body regardless of the conditions of your spirit you can stand up in the middle of church and say no matter what my body and my spirit is trying to scheme up against me in my soul I am a believer in my soul I am a Son of God in my soul I am a daughter of God the anoint is not just told me to shout he anointed he's not just told me to dance amen but the anointing is in my soul that's the very life of God could be lived out through my flesh oh the anointing's got to be in you and you got to be in the anointing you say brother Andrew what is the anointing I said to you like this Christ is the anointing Christ is the anointing Paul said If any man be in Christ he's a new Creature if any man be in Christ he's a new creature all things are passed away and behold all things are become new can I read that to you under prophetic interpretation If any man be in anointing If any man be in the anointing he is a new creature the old things are passed away and behold all things are become new in Colossians 1 27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which he is Christ in you the hope of glory prophetic interpretation which is Christ which is the anointing in you the hope of glory he said now what is it Paradox 64 it is Christ coming to his body we all know the anointing is Christ that comes on the word that makes the word live see Christ is the anointing can we all agree there Christ is the anointing the music is not the anointing the preacher is not the anointing come on your favorite song is not the anointing amen your favorite camp meeting is not the anointing your favorite convention is not the anointing the anointing is Christ it's the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word to make it live now the word is in your heart you believe in Divine Healing whatever more and Christ the anointing come unto his body see the connection there just like a husband and a wife to become one the church has got to get to the ministry until the church and Christ becomes warm and he can anoint you somebody say anoint me he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the Bible see then the anointing is not just coming upon you Amen to give you an emotional High amen or to see a vision or speaking tongues or to interpret the anointing is coming upon you amen that Every Blessed promise that's in the word of God Amen could be fulfilled in your faith listen I say oh God anoint you say man anoint us with the Holy Ghost that we can receive the promise amen of joy unspeakable and full of glory amen anoint us oh god with a promise amen of Divine Healing anoint us with the promise of a Rapture among church amen but we got to get out of this Earthbound realm and we got to climb up into the anointing he can anoint you isn't that beautiful he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the Bible it is yours all of it's yours everything is Promised at this age is yours amen then Christ is the anointing amen Christ is the anointing and I said to you like this amen the anointing is the mystery of God revealed are you with me Christ is the anointing and Christ is the mystery of God revealed now you know when he preaches Christ The Mystery of God revealed he preaches it in a threefold purpose right he said the first fold is he's going to reveal himself he said the second fold is by the revelation of himself he's going to take preeminence in a body right then the third fold is by the revelation of himself having preeminence antibody he's going to lead a body back to a Garden of Eden condition again listen friends the only way that can be done is you are in the anointing and the anointing is in you can I tell you something tonight the seventh Angels Ministry was to declare the anointing the seventh Angels Ministry was to declare him he said my Ministry is different from the pastor it is different from the Evangelist it is different from the teacher he said my Ministry is to declare him amen he is here you say who is here then amen can I tell you Church Christ the anointing is here or him said now I believe as we people have perfect absolutely perfect Vindication that Jesus Christ is with us do you believe that Jesus Christ is with us and so if he's here somebody say he's here if he's here he said that he's here to answer and to minister to us every blessing that he has promised in the word if he is here he is here on purpose if he is here he is here to minister and to manifest amen and to give you every desire amen of your heart he is here to fulfill the promise of his word so when we pray and we lay hands upon the sick we expect you to believe that God expects you to believe that he said never move from it and let nothing shake you from him somebody said we may never move from it never move from it say it like you believe it never move from it and let nothing shake you never move from it and let nothing shake you brother brother Jr I ask myself what am I what's the devil trying to move me from Brother Sean what's the devil trying to shake me from and then it come to me from the revelation of the presence of Jesus Christ being here now regardless of the conditions that's what the devil's trying to that's what the devil's trying to move you all from right now on this Wednesday night service amen is from the revelation of the presence of Jesus Christ being here regardless of the conditions of your life right now you know I can go into Matthew 16 right and Jesus said Upon This Rock he said I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it right remember said watch what is the Gates of Hell against not the denomination he said the gates of hell is against the spiritual revelation of Christ being here now the same yesterday today and forever right now that's what the devil is trying to move amen the church the Living God from is from the revelation of the present presence of almighty God in the church as his word should he would be he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you alway even to the end of the world do you see then the whole secret was the Revelation the whole secret of Christ The Mystery of God revealed amen was the Revelation coming into the church which the Revelation was a spiritual blessing that God promised would be in the church which would move their souls into the heavenlies and would set them in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's the trouble of it today is people don't understand that the whole church of living God is built upon a spiritual revelation of Christ the whole church does not realize he's saying that though that the church the world does not realize that the church is built upon a spiritual revelation of Jesus Christ he said see now watch when the word comes into you I hate to ask this but there's some cold air blowing up here hence it's going to take my voice right out the door when that word comes into you it's sharper than any two-edged sword it's even Discerning the faults and the intents of the heart he said there's the word coming in watch he said the revelation of every word of God is true you can hang your soul on any phase of it now watch this every word of God coming in the church is true he said see and you can hang your soul on any face of it brother Psalm then he says Revelation you can hang your soul on any phase of the revelation of the word that is coming in the church that is manifesting the spiritual blessings in question among church amen if our soul is not hanging on this word then watch it hanging on if it's hanging on the Republicans you're in bad trouble if it's hanging on the Democrats you're in bad trouble but listen we've gone a Step Beyond denomination they say well hang your soul on the word amen and that's partially right amen but we're living in the age where we don't just have the word but we have the revelation of the word and we are hanging our souls on the scriptural revelation of the presence of Jesus Christ in the age we're living in I love what Paul said he said which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul he did not say an anchor amen of the body he did not say an anchor of the spirit he said brother Shema we have this hope as an anchor of the Soul it is brochure and it is steadfast and it entereth into that within the veil now look at this word Soul it means the breath of life it is the vital force which emanates the body and shows itself in breathing amen notices it is the seat amen of the feelings and the desires and the affections and the aversions amen it's our heart hey minutes her soul you see what the devil's trying to do he's trying to gain the seat on the control tower come on church amen that controls your affections controls your desires controls your passions controls come on Amen because if the devil can get in that control tower he can guide your body where he wants you to go do you know why you're not if a honky-tonk tonight amen is because the soul has not got a honky tonk amen driver on the seat of the control tower amen but your soul has got the Holy Ghost and your soul is greater than your body well you know I'm telling you the truth your soul is greater than your body amen your soul is greater than your spirit amen your soul said we're going to the house of God and your body said I don't feel like going and your spirit said I'm too low to go amen but your soul said shut up I'm gonna use your feet to get there I'm going to come on preachers you know what I'm talking about amen amen You Don't Preach from your body You Preach from your soul amen you don't sing from your spirit you sing from your soul you let the soul dictate the spirit you let the soul dictate about it because the soul is the seated feelings desires affections amen aversions it all comes from the soul I love this next one brother Sean amen the soul as an Essence which differs from the body and it's not dissolved by death well glory to God Amen your body is of the earth and it's in position to die amen but your soul amen is of a different Essence in the body amen and it is not dissolved by death it is distinguish pushed from other parts of the body I love the Amplified Bible of Hebrews 6 19 it says this hope this confident Assurance we have as an anchor of the Soul Sister Kim this is powerful he said it cannot slip and it cannot break down under whatever pressure Bears upon it oh God whatever is in your soul it cannot slip and it cannot break down under whatever pressure Bears upon it I'm on Church the revelation of Jesus Christ in your soul amen is strong enough for your teenage years it's strong enough for diseases it's strong enough for laodicea there is a revelation that is taken preeminence in your soul by the message of the hour and no matter Josiah what pressure amen Bears upon that body it'll never break down that Soul because that Soul has passed the only elements of death it's passed beyond the Realms of dissolven under the fragments of human elements it is broke out into a realm with God of Eternity well glory to God I feel like shouting on Wednesday night amen are you here in the church there's a soul in there and that soul don't break down never be dissolved I say we're heavenlies in our souls I say right now some of y'all need to whip that devil and just go ahead and say Amen even though you hadn't said it all night we're heavenlies in our souls but by the end you don't understand but we're heavenlies in our souls or abandon my body but we're heavenlies in our soul brother you don't get it my spirit but we're heavenlies in our souls we're in a revelation a revelation is in us this Revelation cannot slip this Revelation cannot break down under whatever pressure Bears upon it it is a safe brother Samaya it's a steadfast though that enters within the veil of the Heavenly Temple are you ready for this that most holy place in which the very presence of God dwells then what was the prophet saying let nothing move you never move from it let nothing shake you brother Amos never move from it let nothing shake you what is the devil trying to shake you from he's trying to shake you from the anchor that's within the veil he's trying to shake you from the revelation of this presence being here now but I love what the prophet says he said when Anything Is Anchored it cannot move yes sir which hope we have is an anchor of the Soul not we do not with every doctor never win toss from one side to the other I've taken signs over here taking signs over here don't know where you stand the Bible said I will that should be established not saying well I'm this today and something else tomorrow anchor your soul in Christ Jesus be born again and let the life of God living in you and you know beyond the shadow of a doubt that you pass from Death To Life your whole hopes is built up yonder in Calvary and the love of God pours to your heart and you believe every word that God said is the truth you are willing to die for any phase of it come on Church you're willing to die for anything amen if you're not willing to die for this message amen then you shouldn't be falling if you're not willing come on somebody say one time they said brother Andrew how do you go across seas and preach in foreign countries amen because when I leave my family and I leave my home I know very well Daniel I may never return to see him again amen but what I'm carrying over there to preach if it's worth standing behind the a puppet in America and talking to that it's worth going in the Villages of India Amen in the soccer fields of Africa amen I believe this Revelation and I believe we ought to hang our soul on it a moon church quit trying to hang your body on some feeling or some sensation Feelings Will Fail You emotions will fail you amen little trickling thanks for the message I'll failure amen but if you ever break out into the realm of Revelation and hang your soul on the voice of the seven of angels teaching there'll be nothing past nothing present and nothing in the future that'll ever move you oh young people if you never hear me preach again you'll hear me tonight ain't your life on this message and your family on what a prophet talk it'll take you through every way it'll bring you through every Valley it'll take you across Every Mountain foreign and your soul on every face of what a prophet taught why don't you let somebody combine Buffet this message out to you well you can take that and you can't take this I got a good Greek word for that you know what it's called hogwash whatever a prophet told I've got the guts to say it foreign hung my soul on it I'm willing to die for any phase of it see what I mean steadfast and sure isn't it beautiful he says isn't it beautiful when you can really anchor your soul in Christ in such a place that you can get caught before him and hear his voice speaking to you I'm the Lord that healeth thee I am the Lord that giveth eternal life I love thee I Know Thee before the Falcon what are these These are Revelations that were coming from the voice of the seventh angel that was bringing the presence of God near I'm the Lord that healeth Faith what other point what other preacher could stand there for night after night after night and tie the devil up in strings on one promise I'm the Lord that heel of Faith look at this one I'm the Lord they giveth eternal life I love thee I Know Thee before the foundation of the world I put thy name upon the book Thou Art mine what are you saying these are not just scriptures they're Revelations you can hang your soul on fear not it's me don't be afraid I'm with you what are these with Amos they're anchors to the soul see the anchor the soul hello brother says he said the man sold out all that he had for the by a certain Diamond he said you sell out to the world the things of the world and everything that pertains to anything else to have this that's right put your whole anchor right on that it's the anchor of the soul to see his revelation of his word it's the anchor of the soul to see the Revelation so the anchor of the soul is the revelation of his word can I say it when you see it when you see it it becomes an anchor because it's a revelation what did he say he said the light of the ages the word made manifest when you see it three kinds of Believers he takes time to labor in the point and say Jesus Christ is the manifested word made plain can you see it come on friends it's not about just hearing it it's not about just talking about it but can you see it I love what Paul said he said the very God of Peace sanctify you holy I pray God your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless unto you for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ for faithfulness he that calleth you and also will do it look here in Romans 8 verse 11. amen amen if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also what Quicken your mortal bodies by a spirit that dwelleth in you Romans 8 12 therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live out the flesh verse 13 for if you live after the flesh you shall what he shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live if from the soul through the spirit you mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live now look at this word quickly this word Quicken means Amen to be brought to life after death remember says God's Pride a place of worship 1965 if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead amen dwell in you it will Quicken make alive your mortal bodies because it's already life the quickening power in your soul it's already life see and when it comes into your body I love this it brings your whole body subject to it when it comes into your body it brings your whole body subject to it remember says subject to what the word of God if it's in you amen if the word of God is in you when the spirit of God the quickening power quickens that word that's already life it will bring your body subject to the word then the Holy Spirit comes into your soul to seal your soul amen and to manifest and vindicate the word of God in other words make it live in flesh the Holy Ghost makes the word live in flesh I love what Rhythm says he said now if you don't believe this then Jesus said search the scripture for they tell you who I am now they should have known see he was the same God that could create the bread he also created the winds and the waves certainly he is just not part God he is all God he created the winds and the ways if other things I'm gonna I'm gonna tie this together and some of y'all are gonna shout right now but I'm gonna close in a minute free of charge if other things had to obey him he was the creator would not the winds and the waves have to obey him also see now let us remember that whatever he created had to obey him he created the bread and the bread had to obey him and when the spoken word spoke across the bread the bread had to obey the spoken word and multiply and feed five thousand amen amen the winds and the waves when he spoke to him they had to obey the voice of the Creator and back up in the sun had to come out and shine listen the creation has to obey the Creator he said then he also created our bodies and won't our bodies have to obey him you surrender your thoughts to him you surrender your life to him you surrender your faith to him and watch that body obey what he says if you're a little drunkard and you can't quit drinking then Surrender Your Life to him and watch your drink no more if you're a habitual smoker and you've tried to give it up and you cannot do it just read that to him and Watch What Happens he'll make that body come on Church he'll make that body come back in subjection to the word yes sir but you've got to surrender it to him you've got to believe him he made our bodies that they will obey him also do you believe that if you're a Christian you have to he said now you may say he makes our bodies obey oh I believe we have jurisdiction over that then you're not fully surrendered if you can acknowledge that the creator of the body Jesus Christ causes the body to obey then you're not fully surrendered he said for you're not your own but you're dead you're suffered ahead and your life is hidden God through Christ and you are sealed by the Holy Ghost how are you going to do it how are you going to get away from that he said you think your poor thought your pure thoughts then them old worldly thoughts that lead you off your debt of that see what a secure feeling no one in watching the Holy Spirit change your nature from a vow person then we have passed from Death unto life we see the Holy Spirit living in US his life then I ask you tonight what are you feeding on you so brother I don't have the strength to raise my hands what is your soul feeding on other my spirit's so low what is your soul feeding on because God will make our bodies so obey him amen because he said he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood half everlasting life and I will raise him up again in the last day he said think of it our bodies obeying we have no more control of it he said and it turns back to a spoonful of dust amen God will speak to that body and it'll raise it up again in the likeness of the resurrected Jesus Christ what are you worried about this if it's in the hands of god let's go for he will raise it up in the last day he promised it that's the saith the Lord I listen to her take today three kinds of Believers I never caught this quite like like he said Do You Realize right now he said he was actually talking about job when job said though the skin worms destroyed this body yet in my flesh shall I see God remember he said Do You Realize right now that the skin worms are already in your body he said right now the skin worms are already in your body he said waiting to be activated the skin worms in your body right now well brother Andrew I'm 18 years old and I just got to my brand new car and I just got my career amen but you got skin worms in your body they've been waiting to be activated well brother I'm 50 years old and I just retired well amen you got skin worms in your body weight in the bathroom amen but then I got to thinking brother Bob he didn't say nothing about them skin warmers being in our soul he said them skin worms are in our body and their way to be activated amen by Sister Jane what's in your soul according to a prophet Rapture and faith is in your soul Rapture and Grace is in your soul Revelation is in your soul anointing is in your unknown church amen if the skin worms are in your body amen then you can accept Rapture and Grace is in your soul and if the skin worms are waiting to be activated in some morning between six and nine amen a cool sweep is going to come across that body and it's not going to activate them skin worms it's going to activate that say that faith and that Grace that's in your soul and your body will have to obey the confession you've been saying for 30 years my body is going to be changed yeah bring that body subject to the word when the body receives the spirit of God he says now watch it throws I'm closing here it throws The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God I don't guess I'd ever clot caught it like this because we've all heard the point you obey you confess the word your body will obey your confession anybody here heard that two of you have uh anybody here okay you you speak the word your body will obey your confession then brother Sean he says it like this he said the word will bring your body subject to itself subject to what the word I never caught quite how it happens but he says here he says we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside somebody say inside we are a spirit man there's a soul inside and that's faith in God's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith by accepting what God Said oh my we bring our bodies subject to the word by Faith by accepting what God has said don't just say if I could quit this if I could quit that just get in Christ and it's all gone see because your body is subject to the spirit look here in Hebrews 12 9 furthermore we've had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father's spirit and live now look at this word of subjection it means to yield to one's admonition or advice it means to arrange under to subordinate it means to put in subjection it means to obey or to submit to one's control so let me sit like this I actually I was out the other day in Missouri and I sat there we went in a restaurant most of my eyes kind of interesting we go in this restaurant and there's a family sitting over from us I was out there brother Tim Barnes and we're sitting there eating and there's a family over sitting over here from us and the little boy's sitting there and he just starts I mean just starts crying screaming kicking all this and his mama looks over at him and she just kind of smiles at him and he keeps on cracking uh keeps on screaming crying he's laughing and cracking up I mean doing all kinds of stuff and so she goes you know she just kind of just kind of well the kid takes his hand raises up and goes I'll hit you like that and I thought oh oh brother kind of racist hey you know I mean he didn't say it but it was like a sign you know how it is NATO just smack you you know so I thought well this gonna get real good right here bro Tim it's about that time she reached in her phone and gave him her phone turned her phone on and hand it to him and he raised his hand again to smack her again and I looked over to brother sitting next to me I said I said I'm pretty sure had I done that when I woke up on the outside of the restaurant two buildings down but it's the age we live in see it's an age where nothing can come into subjection the minute you show Authority they take it as a criticism rather than a help but here Paul says amen if we was humble ourselves to the respect and the reverence of our Earthly fathers of the flesh then how much more should we come into subjection to the father of spirits and live what's he speaking about he's speaking about your body he said if you let your brother said if you let your faith loose to God's spirit it brings your body in subjection to God's Redemptive blessing to you his word has gone forth it's fallen into the heart it corrects us it brings us into subjection to his spirit I love this one there's very few people that really come up in contact by laying on of hands my Ministry is not that we realize that's a great ministry on hands but the ministry of land on the hands was a Jewish sign you know Jairus said come lay your hands on my daughter and she'll live but the Roman Centurion said just speak the word that's all the Gentiles see just say the word and Jesus turned and said I haven't found Faith like that and this will see just speak the word because what happened now bear this in mind that help me Lord that Roman knew of Amos that every sickness and disease was subject to his word that Roman knew every disease every sickness was subject to his word now he says if you can realize the same it's all over when you can realize that the same that every demon every sickness every disease every Affliction is subject to the word of God regardless of the body regardless of the spirit the soul is in the heavenlies have y'all ever thought about a little girl named Georgia Carter it's actually amazing if you you really look at Georgia Carter's situation and break it down by the court where the REM gives and question answers on the body spirit and so it's actually interesting to see what a caliber of testimony Georgia Carter really was I was like got to thinking about this brother Bob her uncle had raped her as a young girl on the way brother Kevin to piano lessons and remember said she didn't do nothing herself to put herself in that condition but she was abused by an uncle and she was put in that condition so right there as a young girl she's got her whole life ahead of her she's taken piano lessons amen a beautiful little girl and her uncle takes a advantage of her and abuses her and Rapture and gives her TB and puts her in a bed her body is brought into a horrible condition by something she didn't even do herself right for nine years and eight months she laid up on a bed now think about this dwindling down to nothing as far as weight a horrible condition just basically a bag of bones just a fair little girl in there amen but now notice something but her spirit on the inside of her I believe her I believe we can say like this amen no doubt some days her spirit was up because she was a human and some days her spirit was down because she was a human amen but let me ask you this where did the faith come from Amen to believe that if a Prophet come by her way and spoke over her she would get up out of that condition brother Bob it wasn't coming from her body her body was in a horrible condition it wasn't coming from her spirit amen her spirit might have been low even on the day brother around come by but there was a soul in there that believed the word of God and there was a prophet out there who was praying and he said every time I got down to pray he said that mosquitoes would come he said I'd hit him and get up he said then I finally said I'm going to pray or not he's said I'm just going to pray and he said I Heard a Voice say go by the way of Carters now can you can you can you break in this story with me for a second when brother Branham goes in the harder the Carter's house it's not a fire Revival atmosphere the home is not a Heavenly atmosphere George's own mother has been standing at the window praying amen that a God will send that imposter by our house her daddy don't believe in it but in a bedroom in a horrible condition from her soul oh come from her soul she created an atmosphere in the home to welcome her miracle in the room and brother random walked in there and he said Georgia in the name of the Lord get up off of that bed and she got up off the bed and she took off running and when she went out there remember since she blessed the grass she blessed the trees he said and she went over there and she began to play the piano can I preach to you she began to ran as she began to play the piano nine years eight months no lessons probably her her fingers probably didn't even have strength he meant to to hit the cords amen but when the Creator comes on the scene the Creator by the soul will command the body to come into subjection to the promise of the word and the part of God said amen she picked up right where she left off foreign right back over there and started playing nine years and eight months no lessons let the Creator come by [Music] not William Branham the word and the word the word and a prophet spoke over the soul of a young girl and she got up out of that condition can I say it to you like this Georgia Carter was heavenly's and her soul let our musicians come tonight when you realize that same word is in you you can realize the same word it's all over every demon ever sickness ever disease every affliction is subject to the word of God then the disease has to come subject to the advice of the Healer and leave the body the demon has to come subject to the admonition of the father and has to give up its hold and turn loose to God's Property y'all realize the hour we're living in in horse and buggy days this ain't automobile days this ain't airplane days this is astronaut faith it's where the prophet of God said it like this he said we live in the heavenlies how do we live in the heavenlies because of your heavenlies in our souls brother Amos your faith is in the soul regardless of the conditions we are in the heavenlies I'll share this Testament with I pray it'd be okay to testify too for a minute last year we went out to brother biscals there for that Winter Camp when I was out there brother Murphy Wong some of you may have heard of him brother Murphy he's a missionary the brother from China and we're sitting there talking and he said brother Andrew he says uh this was on Wednesday morning he was talking to me he said Andrew he said he said I've got so many kids I got a daughter that's married and he said he's talking about his family and he just kind of when he said it he kind of abruptly stopped you know and then the conversation changed but I could tell he was wanting to say something to me just tell me something well I never brought it back up I didn't know nothing didn't know what was going on so we went on in the service that Wednesday night and I was preaching on the thought of we've been LED I think I've spoken here in our meetings expectations have been lit by the message we've been we've been led to believe these things we've been led to believe things can happen we our soul has been led to believe the third pool is in the bride and I began to just preach on my brother Grandma's out there in the woods and while he was out there in the woods there was some squirrels out there there was no squirrels there and he spoke and I said like this pretend I said there was no squirrel DNA on the ground there was no bones no hair no guts no no cells there was nothing there I said so he didn't come down brother Kevin and say abracadabra abracadoo I make a bunch of squirrels right here for you he didn't do that because there was nothing there to do that by there was no DNA there but the spoken word created squirrels right there and I just told that when I said that the word dropped in brother Murphy's brother Murphy's daughter's heart and when it dropped in her heart amen the next day which I didn't know all this that's going to just this just just weaker a week or so ago brother Murphy said you remember last year when you were here I said yeah he said you remember when you spoke that about there no squirrel DNA and about that time of the shmiah's daughter come running up and she was holding a little baby and she said brother Andrew she said do you remember last year and brother Murphy said I'll let her tell you the testimony he said do you remember last year when you were preached on that Wednesday night and you said there was no DNA in there amen films crossed to be created by she said you didn't know she said but my husband and I was Desiring a baby she said two years ago in a meeting brother Ron Spitzer was here and he had a vision that we would have a child he said when we she said when we left the meetings we were believing that she said we went to the doctor and she said when we got married the doctor said like this she said there's nothing in your body to have a baby with so we got to do a surgery there was something missing or some element there and so we have to do a surgery and hopefully by the surgery they'll be able to have you'll be able to have a child she said but we had a vision that we was going to have a child she said so I just kind of thought well maybe the child's going to come by The Vision by the surgery she said so that wish tonight when you said that she said something dropped in my heart and said there's no DNA there right now for a baby but there can be DNA there for a baby she said I left there that night and told my husband she said we're going to have that baby she said right here is that baby she said but then you didn't know this she said but the very next morning I woke up under inspiration and took a pregnancy test and said I come to this Camp last year with a pregnancy test that was positive and she said today the baby's here she said you know what it shows me the word still creates come on Church we're not just having meetings in Canon there's a word that's been spoken and that words are Revelation and we've hung our soul in every face of it
