praise the Lord everyone had a good afternoon amen beautiful day and U glad to be part of it amen uh the musicians can be dismissed and um we're going to uh turn uh first of all to the Book of Luke the uh 21st chapter praise the Lord amen uh Luke 21 and before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord for a moment Lord Jesus we're so thankful for the victory that we have in you father and that we can rest knowing that we are triumphant father for you defeated the enemy 2,000 years ago and we're dealing with a defeated enemy oh we thank you Lord for that and Lord as we have come this evening to uh learn of you we're just asking that you would help us father Lord as we Endeavor to to minister your word I I just pray that your spirit would just take over and help me to get myself out of the way father Lord that you would bless your people that have been diligent to come father those that weren't aable to make it tonight I I pray that you wouldd be with them if they're streaming Lord I I just pray that your anointing would come in to the home the car wherever they're at father that you would Minister to their needs father we give it all to you we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen the uh uh Luke 21 and 25 it says and there shall be uh signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity with uh the sea uh uh and the waves roaring 's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory amen then um uh John the 14th chapter um we're familiar with this um but John chapter 14 and um um I believe uh would start at the 17th verse or we'll just the 16th and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I in my father and you in me and I in you and I believe that this ties in with what we just read in Luke 17 or Luke uh 21 the son of man coming with power and great glory and then uh in Philippians 3 and 8 um Philippians 3:8 yay doubtless and I count all things but lws for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord and and of course the knowledge is not learning like you go into school but it's an experience may have that knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ that the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him everybody say that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death amen you can have your seats this evening and um if I have a title it would be the son of man came with power and um not coming with power but he came with power for we believe that he is here he has come but the the power of God is important to us as Believers very important and one one would think that uh uh the world would recognize the power of God when it came and uh manifested and and these things but that's not so for there in in Timothy uh 2 Timothy 34 the Apostle uh Paul prophesied that in the last days perilous times shall come and that in other words dangerous times uh shall come and and he gives a a list of reasons as to why uh they're dangerous times but one of the one of the things that he listed was was that the the the people would have a form of godliness but would deny the power thereof and uh I thought that'd be interesting how that it's it's at the same time that the son of man uh comes in a cloud and we know what that cloud is it's not a thunderbolt amen but that cloud come in in uh uh 63 in Tucson um uh there and and he would come in a cloud with uh uh Power and great glory and at that time then Paul would let us know that not everybody is going to receive the power but they would deny that power they they would have a form of godliness but when that power would come they would deny the power thereof now the the Amplified says that for although they had a form of piety True Religion and that word piety is obligation or devotion being devoted see so so although they had an obligation and devoted to religion they deny and reject and are strangers to the power of it see their conduct belies the genuiness of their profession so so this word belies is to present an appearance not in agreement with uh to show something to be false or wrong so so uh uh one writer says the history of balai illustrates a certain connection between lying and disguising in Old English Bai meant to deceive by lying and in time was used to mean to tail lies about uh taking on a sense similar to that of the modern word slander eventually its meaning softened shifting from an act of outright lying to one of M misrepresentation and by the early 1700s the word was being used in the sense to disguise or conceal so so they they they they've got this form of godliness and and yet the very thing that that makes godliness is the power well they deny that power so so their their their life is is it's it's a contradiction of what they're claiming to be and so uh uh uh it's it's it's like taking a monkey out of out of the Jungle from where you know he swings from tree to tree and and he does what he does you know cuz that's his nature and he's at home in the jungle and you take him out and then you you dress him up in in in clothes and as as a human and and you teach teach him you know uh how to live like a a a uh a human and and you you house train him and and all of these things and and they've done that uh uh there but but no matter how much you train him he cannot be totally human uh because his nature is is as a monkey amen and so you could teach him to go through all the uh uh the the the uh uh rituals that maybe we would go through but that doesn't mean that he's human uh he's still a monkey he still has the nature of a monkey still the life of a m monkey and and so uh uh he will always be that a and and and in in time given a chance he will automatically revert back uh to to the habits of of his nature as a monkey ain't that right and see and and the only way that that could change is that the power of transformation would come into that monkey and and change him from what he is to a human being so so the the the the rituals that we could teach him uh to do as as as you know going to the bathroom and and and getting a cup and drinking and and doing all of that that we can never make him uh uh a human being it takes the power of transformation and so so many people are claiming Christianity and by by the form of it but not by the power and so form of godliness doesn't mean that you're a Christian at all and and so uh uh so this power uh that they will deny is the power that the son of man comes with when he is revealed and and of course the son of man has been revealed how many believes that the son of man has been revealed there's no question to that and and if there is then then ask the Lord to help you with that uh because because truly he has been revealed red and and and if he has been revealed then he has come with power uh uh he he has done that and so the power of God you know uh when we thinking of that it's it's been manifested really since the beginning of time uh uh God created the world by his power he he upholds the World by the word of his power and and so in in in the beginning there in in Genesis we see how that that that uh the world was without form it was Darkness covered the earth and the water and and all these things it it it it was an awful condition but God by his power and the prophet would call it the power of transformation he actually began to change these things and and and he talks about that there was seed that was laying in the earth and and and these things but then God would would through the power of transformation he would take chaos and he would transform it into to a Garden of Eden ain't that right but we not only just see the power of God in that we see the power of God through the preservation of the Hebrew children and and we see the power of God as we had mentioned this morning in in shutting the the the mouths of the lion for Daniel we see the power of God exhibited when he rode back the Red Sea uh uh for the children of Israel it we see the power of God when he made the ax head to swim and and it was all by the power of God ain't that right amen so so the power of God has has been essential and is so needed amen because it is more it it it's Supreme it it it does things that man can never accomplish is by the power of God now today the prophet said Satan's power is becoming a more of a reality amen uh in the world than God's power he said see Satan by the laws of sin and death makes everything that sin and death bought operate to Satan see uh uh uh you know he sends cancer Satan will send cancer and he says see the man recognizes it receives it Satan sends heartaches and we recognize it and we receive it see and and and you know today there's more sickness and and more corruption and and more more negative More Everything uh than ever before and people are fearing it uh because they are recognizing it and and receiving it see and and and yet it's the manifestation of Satan's power ain't that right people are living in fear today because they they have accepted this evil power of Satan as a part of normal life amen uh they is just becoming a a normal uh people are afraid of getting the flu they're afraid of of getting cancer and and and they don't even have to get cancer they don't have to get the flu and yet they're all scared of it and and afraid that you know and and and believe it or not they I believe they confess it enough to bring it upon themselves well even job said the thing I feared Came Upon me and and so fear does a lot of things fear opens the door uh for Satan to gain access and his to manifest that's why we should not fear uh anything that goes on in the world Amen well uh uh shouldn't fear cancer amen shouldn't fear heart disease shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't fear even if the doctor told you you got something you shouldn't fear that amen you you should just cast it off and and but but see uh uh uh but anyways they they're they're becoming more sensitive recognizing the power of Satan in in in the world and and so uh uh whatever Satan is sending up on the earth well the people recognize it and they receive it they they just simply accept it well if you know because negativity is becoming more and more and more the norm for people they're just negative people and and so uh you used to didn't worry about germs and all of a sudden we worry about germs and we worry about shaking people's hands and we worry about this and I hope so and so doesn't come to church tonight if they got a cough because we might get it and all of these things and and they become more sensitive to the Satan's power than they do God's power used two people didn't matter care about them things if God was just God and God was able and God was you know if if if something comes on we just rebuke it and just move on Amen see but but uh uh Satan's power is becoming recognized and becoming predominant as the main power among uh the Earth today but see as they recognize Satan power well when God sends his power and and uh down upon the Earth well then the people deny it and and the prophet say well they just say it's of the devil you know uh that that's amazing you know we'll accept Satan's power any time and if if if someone says well you know doctor says you're sick well we just accept it it's just oh oh okay I'm say you know and and we don't even have to cough we don't even have to have these things and all of a sudden oh I was around somebody and and oh my I don't know I better check my fever I better just check just in case you know I might just have that you know and and and so we bring it but when God comes with his power oh that's of the devil we just ain't going to accept that no sir ain't going to have that in our home ain't going to have that in our church ain't going oh no you know well see it it's it's that it's amazing how people will receive Satan's power but the Bible says that when he would come with as Jesus comes in his power well oh we deny that see and the Very the very uh uh religion the very thing that the power is supposed to bring well we'll keep that ritual we'll keep that form no wonder people get tired of church well there's no power in their in their service no wonder amen people just doesn't accept God and and they get bored with it all you know and it just becomes a dread and it just becomes that well they deny the very power of the god that they claim to serve you understand what I'm saying and and so then we we find amen you know I it's it's it's actually funny well it's sad too but there are actually preachers in the message that are afraid to lay hands on the sick because they're afraid that they will get what they've got you know and I thinking man what what woohoo you know uh that's just a little bit too far but but see but but notice the son of man which is Jesus Christ how many believe that amen the son of man is Jesus Christ he has come with power and great Glory so then if you want to find where Jesus Christ is it's not in your imagination that you find him it it's not through theology that we would find him find where the power is and you will find Christ because he comes with great power can you say amen amen see so uh uh this is why brother Brandon would would would would hit against formalism and and and formal worship formal uh churchianity and all that because that was not where Jesus is he would point us to where the power is and if you can tap in that power that's where Christ is see amen now brother brandom says see now if Satan by his power make his laws work in man how much more ought god with his power make his laws work in man see see so if Satan can make his laws be sure and US recognize it see how much more ought God to his children make his laws be recognized among his people of Divine Healing Revelation power gives manifestation of the spirit see the law of sin and death works in the people and the law of Liberty of Christ has come unto us to set us free from those things ain't that right see so Satan's power will make you sick Satan's power will drive you into an insane asylum amen Satan's power will you not only physically but spiritually mentally Satan's power is a power of deforming that's what the prophet called it deforming power see but then it the same time that Satan power increases and and demonic Powers flow in and pour in and people are becoming so possessed of it God would send his power to break that power and to set us free and that power brings a law of Liberty unto us amen you see God Saves by his power he heals by his power he delivers by his power he preserves his Saints by his power he upholds by his power he transforms by his power he raises the dead by his power he redeems by his power can you say amen amen see that's what his power has come to do so so the power we would call it saving power healing power power of transformation uh healing power delivering power redeeming power the prophet would call it quickening power power resurrection power see it's not just him just flexing his muscles there is a power there and amen not not just I hope you understand amen so so many titles to this power to let us know that his power is not limited just to one thing but the power that can heal you can save you and the power that can save you can redeem you and the the power that can redeem you can transform you and and the power that can transform you can actually change your your mortal body amen the power is here he has come with power and great Glory see this is God's power and so then we who have recognized the power of God through the son of man Ministry ought to take courage amen that there's nothing impossible amen with you if you just believe that's what the Bible says amen nothing impossible to them that believe ain't that right why because we recognize the power amen I may need one thing but there's a power that is here Amen to to help me you may need another thing but that same power is here to help you amen and all of God's people amen will not be left behind amen all of God's people all of this elect amen is coming into what God has called them to do by that same power now uh uh brother Ram says God the Creator who created All Things by his power through his spoken word and everything that is is the word of God made manifest the entire world was made and how we do error when we try to ignore God's word or try to limit God's power by our own imagination you you don't please amen God help us all not to limit God's power by our own imagination amen you may be down in the dumps and you may be going through hell but don't you limit your situ God's power by your situation just let God be God can you say Amen Now watch how the power of God is connected with the word of God I hope this all right amen but Romans 1:16 we've read it this morning I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God under salvation ain't that right to everyone that believeth amen 1 Thessalonians 1 5 for Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance amen so the power is connected to the word of God Amen when God speaks the power is there to make it come to pass you believe that it doesn't matter if if it needs transformation The Power of transformation is there if if it if if sickness is in the way amen then the power of God is to drive that sickness away way amen whatever it is God's word is going to come to pass amen because there's a power in the word of God so you cannot you will not find amen power out God's power outside of his word can you say amen yeah you just won't do that see amen but it's connected with the word now notice uh brother Brandon said notice now Luther comes in the cunningness and breaks the unity of God to man just like he did in Eden by great Temptations of promises of self-power and exaltation in this day he comes with great and Promises of of self-power and exaltation no wonder people don't want the they they deny the very power of God he's got them in in a place to where they're lifting themselves up by self-power amen it blows my mind he says you know uh they say well why why you can become a bishop if you'll stay with us you might be the district presbyter you know why why why would you go to something like that see that's Pentecostal see see the Catholic and so forth see a great false promise to men to receive power outside the word and promise of God he says see but you receive power when the Holy Ghost comes upon you not when you become a bishop not when you become a deacon not when you take a position in a church or in in in a public office or whatever the power comes after the Holy Ghost comes upon you so he says Lucifer comes in in cunning like he did then by Temptations and false promises a power outside apart from the word of God ain't that right so so Satan doesn't mind people having a form of godliness amen but it's the power see he wants the people to to deny the power because the power is what brings the change he does not mind you under knowing this Bible uh uh by heart and being able to quote it from from Genesis to Revelation and he doesn't mind you having a full schedule of reading this Bible year after year after year and finishing it amen when when the year is up and and all of these things he doesn't mind you coming to church and and and and knowing about God learning about God hearing about God he doesn't even mind you sitting in a m his church but he does not want you to accept the power amen that comes with the word of God ain't that right for the power is the is is the is the thing that it brings about the change now how else could the manifestation of sons come about without the power how else could the predestinated seed come forth in this last day how else can the changing of our body take place how else can the dead in in Christ rise amen how how else uh can we be caught up to meet the Lord in the air if if there's no power can you say amen and and see religious status is not the one that's going to change you amen just coming to a church and and being a moral good moral individual amen is not the thing that's going to change you it's the power of God that's going to bring about this thing you see we're living in an age of rapture do you believe that we're living in the age of rapture now in his prayer brother brandham said may we just not be satisfied Lord with joining church and trying to be a Christian amen being some self-effort see some way to try to manufacture something saying well I joined church and the people going to expect me to be a Christian see and now I'm not to have to do this and and not have to do that no more because I'm a Christian oh God may we get away from that Pharisee condition God that bunch of Hypocrites oh God somehow let the Holy Spirit speak at what I mean Lord I can't find the words to say it he says we don't want to be self-made Pharisees see God fill us with deity fill us with power and energy until our souls are a flame that our strength will be him our testimony will be God our words will be his and then the Devils will tremble and the world will shake and rock under the impact of it can you say Amen see so the power without the power then we're just self-made Pharisees so to speak we're self-made Christians we're self-made taught we're self-made this we're self-made that that's why we want the presence of God in our church that's why we want the power of God in our lives amen we want to welcome him can you say Amen we want to welcome him amen that's what this message is all about is to introduce us to the the son of man with power yes sir see now we are living in the season of change you know and and and uh uh uh here's the way the the Catholics think about change uh one priest told brother brandham he said that God gave the the P the church power to change the scriptures anytime they want to so that's the change that they're they like they like to where they can take it and make this word fit what they want to and take what they want to leave out and what they want to add to and and all of these things ain't that right but see God gave the church power not to change his word amen but that so that the people can be changed into His Image I don't want to change his word hello amen I don't want God to give me an authority to change his word what I want is an authority to be changed myself to his word amen yes sir so so here's the change 1 Thessalonians 1:5 for Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your and you became followers of us and the and of the Lord having received the word in much Affliction with joy and of the Holy Ghost so that you were in samples to all that believe in Macedonian AI for from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and AI but also in every place your faith to God's word is spread abroad so that we need not speak anything see for they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how you turn to God from Idols to serve the living and true God see so the gospel that Paul preached there was a power there and when the people received his word as the truth the power took effect and the word took on a manifestation in their lives now brother Brandon would tell us the gospel is the power of God to make the word act what it says it'll do now think of that the power the gospel is the power of God to make the word act what it says it'll do now church we we this Bible has been laying dormant for years and years scriptures that have been laying there dormant now is is becoming alive because he has come with power can you amen so now brother brandom says in the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to heal all sickness do you believe that something you don't want to deny right in the church this morning is the power to heal all sickness see in the Church of the Living God lays power to overcome all temptation in the possession of the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost aren't you glad for that that power is in the church amen we we don't have to say oh God if you just please help me please no the power's there it it's it's there within the church uh uh uh now amen see and and so we can't look at all the sickness and we can't look at the habits and the sin and then start judging and saying well I I I know well God Can Heal Me of the headache but I just don't know if he can heal me of this this tumor you know and D D D no the power is in the church if we can recognize the power amen that has come uh to us thinking of this power Romans 88:18 for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with Glory which shall be revealed in us what a hope for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope see because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God now I believe that Paul was talking about this day that scripture have been laying there dormant until waiting for the power to come into the church so we have been subjected not only to vanity but to Hope ain't that right been subjected to Hope notice what Romans 15:13 now the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in Hope through the power of the Holy Ghost he did not just subject you to Hope but now he wants you to abound in hope in the things that he subjected you to now as a sinner we abounded in in in the vanity we we were subject to vanity we abounded in that ain't that right amen we started out as just a little innocent baby before you know it you know we' lie with this with that then we come and being maybe drinking smoking swearing you know adultery or or whatever and because we were subject to vanity but then that same God that subjected us to vanity subjected us to a hope right so then he says you would abound that you may abound in Hope through the power of the Holy Ghost amen that's right that's right oh do you love him you're not one just that just attends a church you're you're not you're not one who just has moral standards you're not one who just goes through the religious ritual you have been subject to uh to Hope and are bound abounding in Hope amen through the power of the Holy Ghost ain't that right look how you know brother brandom I believe in countdown and and other messages he he he showed us how fast the the world has progressed you know started with the horse and buggy then the automobile then the airplane and and now you know the the the the astronaut and all that happened the progress within what 50 years or so been I've been you know reading of of the uh uh R Brothers I've got a book of the history of the R Brothers and and here they were the ones that that that put man up in in in the air and and they were actually lived to see man go into space amen by what they had accomplished but but the progression had has has gone so fast so fast see it had been laying there horse and for how many years and years and years and years but all of a sudden something took hold and brother Brown said the natural it it was an anointing there and and even though it's the natural it was typ in the spiritual because look how fast the church has progressed and you say Amen in this last day we progress in so much because there is a power there upon the church to cause her to abound that's right abound God hates a powerless religion it has to have power in it can you say Amen people may shout in the spirit they may dance in the spirit they may sing in the spirit they may they may whatever in the spirit see but that's not power that's blessings ain't that right we've seen it we've seen it all all through my lifetime of people dancing in the spirit and still the same way they were were before they started dancing sing and shouting and and all of that and and still uh uh in the same condition that they were before they started doing all of that see Amen brother brand said oh you say I went down there and there's a lot of power brother the whole floor was dancing in the spirit and not enough Faith to heal a toothache and you call that power that that's not power that's blessings he said there's a lot of difference between blessings and power ain't that right we thank God for the blessings and and I appreciate the blessings I I I love it when he when he falls Among Us and and we we we get excited and and some dance and shout and and cry and whatever see but that's blessings up that that that falls upon the people ain't that right but he said there's a lot of difference between blessings and power see God makes his blessings uh uh fall upon the righteous and the unrighteous amen that's why a man can be totally possessed the devil and speaking tongues and and and a man can Dan and shout and prophesy and and and and and and speak whatever you know just like cafas did and he's one that crucified the Lord Jesus and yet he was prophesying among them and and all of these things see it's the spirit of God falling amen up upon the congregation and it's the blessings ain't that right but we're not talking about the blessing we're talking about the son of man coming with power and it changes it changes that's right amen amen now brother brandham said notice he says you know sincerity brings power it also brings worship not forms it brings genuine power worship to know that you pass from Death un life now he says that God wants to perform by his power God wants to perform amen remember he says it's not by might nor by P might or by power but by my spirit not by your power but by my power by my spirit ain't that right so he says now when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word he said see God wants to perform by the Holy Ghost and vindicate his word and the church wants to perform see so so the church has its own way of bringing in Souls amen it has its own way of sending preachers out it has its own way amen of of making uh uh people Christians it has its own way of forgiving sins it has its own way of showing What Love Is Right see and and so the church wants to perform and and brother brand said they want to perform to make a big organization and what else to bring membership see no matter what you have to baptize Sinners see drunkers bootleggers and anything else and take them into the body of Christ and that's why the church is so messed up today is because the church is trying to perform the church is trying to make uh uh make the monkey into the human being so to speak they're trying to take the Sinner and make him a saint but it takes the power of God to do that amen that's right now brother Brown says in order for the church to perform they must deny the Holy Ghost right and have they done it yes they have amen they they've done that and and see he says denying the power and yet going through all the rituals see so then as as as I not take too much longer but when we think of the power of God we think of deity right deity amen when when the power of God is is manifested and is performed then we say God is Among Us that it's it's it's deity it it speaks of deity you know and and how many times have we been guilty of separating God from mankind by keeping deity in heaven right am we've been guilty of separating God from mankind by keeping deity in heaven you know it we're we're carnal human beings but just put deity back in heaven where it belongs but for the you know the purpose for redemption in the first place was to reconcile God and man back together and and to make one man one with God is that true and this is exactly what Jesus was he was one with the father and man knew that deity wasn't in heaven it was on Earth in a body of a man that's right ain't that right amen see John 14:7 if you had known me you should have known my father also from henceforth you know him and have seen him Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us and Jesus said unto him have I been so long with you and yet thou Hast not known me Phillip he that has seen me has seen the father how sayest thou then show us the father right well what was Jesus John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God 14th verse and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us can you say Amen so the word took on flesh and we behave his glory but then we find in John 17th chapter and and I won't read it but Jesus prays to the father that that he would make us one with him as he and the father was one bring us into that same Oneness can you say Amen sir now the world is trying to be make a Oneness and they're they've been trying to do it for years and years through a force everybody beli the same thing everybody say the same prayer everybody do the same thing and everybody this and everybody that and it's a force of Oneness and it's coming again the World Council of churches is you'll either be in it or you'll be out it's it's just that way ain't that right but it ain't going to work that's not the Oneness that Jesus was talking about ain't that right but see so God was in Christ reconciling the word World unto himself and notice Jesus had power for he says all power both in heaven and in Earth is given unto me oh man I think that's powerful he had the power to heal the sick and he did it right he had the power to cast out devils and he did it right he had the power to raise the dead he had the power to forgive sins he had the power to open the blinded eyes but not only that he had the power to fulfill every scripture that was prophesied of him for that day and he did it did he not he manifested that power there was no devil on the earth that could that could uh detour him that could break him that could destroy him nothing Satan remember he was going across the sea and Satan caused the Tempest and the winds to to start blowing and the waves to start rocking he was trying to drown him in the ship let's get rid of him let's drown him in the middle of the lake but Jesus stood there with the power and said peace be still and the power of God closed or shut uh calmed the storm can you say Amen see so he manifested that power and notice in the end that power quickened him when he was dead it quickened him and raised him up because there was scripture that was pertaining him yes sir so the grave had no right to hold him death had no right to keep him amen because there was prophecy concerning him and he was full of quickening power to raise him back up again now the blood of Jesus Christ as we know and this is simple but the blood of Jesus Christ made preparation the whole point of Calvary we can sing about the blood there's power in the blood we can sing about how that it reaches to the highest mountain and reaches to the lowest Valley we can we can sing about all of these things thank God for the blood and thank God for Calvary and He Paid a Debt that he did not owe and I owed a debt I I I could not pay and I needed somebody to wash my sins away and and we sing all of them songs and that's wonderful but why are we seeing it what was Calvary to reconcile us back to God yes sir that's right see amen see so the blood of Jesus Christ prepared the way for deity to come into man and deity and power go hand in hand sir oh I got the Holy Ghost and then God remained silent in you he didn't do it in Christ that's right now notice Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you but te ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be ued with power from on high Acts 1:8 but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you ain't that right so this power relates to the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is none other than the spirit of Christ and this is exactly what happened on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came into them and they received what power power from on high that's right and then we can see what took place look at Peter's life look look at the disciples amen what they were before they received the Holy Ghost and what they were after they received the Holy Ghost a book of Acts could not have been written beforehand but after they received the Holy Ghost they received that power there was a book of Acts Hallelujah they cast out Devils they healed the sick ain't that right yes sir see and so now of course that was the beginning on the day of Pentecost that was the first church it was God planting his Pentecostal seed that first church was in seed form ain't that right but it hadn't yet went into the ground and rotted that's right so the prophet told us that God planted that Pentecostal seed on the day of Pentecost it was a perfect seed that he planted you take a SE an apple seed every Apple that that seed will ever produce is already in the seed ain't that right everything about that apple and uh that that seed that the tree everything it's already laying in that seed potentially ain't that right so everything that God was was laying in that seed everything that the church would be was already laying in that seat for it was a perfect seat but the prophet told us that was under the dispensation of the Son of God the son of man was never promised to be revealed anywhere outside of this age according to Luke 17:30 ain't that right it was a perfect seed and it had the full power of God in it but it never came to maturity for the seed had to die everybody say the seed had to die to it had to die and the prophet said that Pentecostal Church died at Nia Rome the seed fell into the ground into the dirt it was buried you know what the dirt was brother randam said that dirt was denominations ain't that right so he says see the first church was that reproduction the bride that seed that word made manifest that fell into the ground at ner Rome he said see there is your dirt is them denomination see there is where the word was cruci ified they accepted dogma and for hundreds and hundreds of years of Dark Ages the power and manifestation of the word was hid from the world only Catholicism ruled ain't that right but notice but that Pentecostal church is to be resurrected in the brigh tree in the last days amen aren't you glad for that now it's not the planting of another seed God didn't take away that seed and decided to plant another seed in this day nope see it's the same seed that went into the ground on the day see that was planted on the day of Pentecost went into the ground that N seea All Through the Dark Ages now it's coming up and we're now at the stage of maturity it's not another planning as we know brother brandom's taught it so many times it has gone this seed has gone through three uh stages of growth Luther Wesley Pentecostal ages ain't that right but notice brother Brown says now everybody say now that's very important I know people deny that fourth age that fourth stage but but brother Brown taught the fourth stage we would have known the fourth stage now we've see we've gone through West uh Luther Wesley Pentecostal age now we're down to the end time and Christ has returned in his form of the holy spirit in the fullness of his power into the church to manifest himself what son of man the fullness of the word every promise that was promised to the church is now to be made manifest in this age by a people yes sir a people who were not born perfect a people who had faults and still has faults a people that has weaknesses and born with weaknesses and born with all of these things and yet there is a power to rest upon them to come into them to manifest the word of God we're not self-made we're not a self-made bride we're not a self-made people can you say Amen you love the Lord amen so brother Braham says I have to watch Parables the way nature runs I haven't the education to do it I don't want it I'd rather have what I've got and than all the education in the world I have Jesus Christ I see him live his word right through and that's all I need to know and if a man is born of the spirit of God he'll search the scripture to see if it's the answer for today the answer of the day is Christ Christ is the word and when the word comes to life it shows the light that's promised of the day this dark Le otsy and age just a few as many as I receive I chasen I rebuke Repent Jesus said and return turn back turn to the word he is the word come to him yes sir now he says watch the light it come from the East going west see we're at the West Coast see it had three stages didn't it it had three stages it crossed the water three times from Paul and across the Mediterranean come into Germany Germany lit up with Luther cross the English Channel uh over into England See England see and it it come uh uh uh with John Wesley and then it come across the Pacific to the United States see she has worked her way down through Luther's message on down until the last part of it is here on the West Coast again and from the ripening of the grain all the way back from Luther all the way back down through the age notice it ought to be the fullness of the Gospel now the power of God to R ripen what's it ripening that predestinated seed inside you the light has been shown through justification sanctification the Pentecostal age ought to ripen the bride tree for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that Christ could be manifested in his church as one person him and his wife him and his bride and this is the hour We're living this is the light of the day do you love him we could go on and on with these things if the musicians will come brother BR said what Luther had what Wesley and what the Pentecostals had we've got plus everybody say plus plus until Jesus Christ is made manifest in the fullness of his power as he promised to be in this last day you know when Jesus was born he really didn't show anything that he was special he laid there as a baby crying in that manger anyone that would have looked on him would say oh that's you know cute baby maybe like me and you know yeah it's kind of ugly you know and but he didn't show anything really special but when he become a man the world had to take notice the world of that day had to take notice that something was different about him that was God right and brother randam said see now the church now that was once dressed like that little manger experience that we've been through there was a time we didn't really just show much we just you know yeah that's just a normal church just the normal people going through their thing yeah but he says now the church has come to a place that the people are realizing that the deity and the power of almighty God is living in the human being that's where we're at church I hope you recognize that to say that the church the power of the Living God is in us and we don't recognize that if God is in US it has to come forth and it's changing us day by day it's changing us little by little it's changing us your your believing is not in vain your your testimony your confession is not in vain there's a power that's actually changing us we're leaving this place Church and and the god that subjected us to vanity has subjected us to Hope do you realize they without us cannot be made perfect all the saints of old of of that have gone before they cannot be made perfect without us we're we're the last we're the last generation standing we're the last Church we're the last Age and and it's in this age in this age when it looked like it was all hopeless when it looked like it was it just nothing was going to change everything was just going to remain the same cycle after cycle after cycle just cycles of Revival bride bride bride bride churches churches churches bride bride as the prophet said but then there comes one that's not only got the mechanics but she's got the Dynamics she's different from the rest what is it the power has come and has changed her changed her making us ready for a Rapture not going to another age not being introduced to another church age another another messenger there is none the power had to come if it didn't come we'd all go through the Great Tribulation but the power has come I'm so glad for that really look at it this power brother brah said no wonder you know he said talking about Jesus being adopted on Mountain Transfiguration I know some don't believe that but brother Bram taught that that Jesus on Mount Transfiguration that was his adoption then when he come down from there and we all know what the adoption is it's a it's it's the son that had been tutored and tutored and raised you know to learn the the will of the father subjected to the will of the father doing the will of the father he he had been an obedient child under under the under the tutor a ship of of the tutor and and and and and you know then the father uh uh you know uh gets the report that this this son is worthy to come into this adoption he he's been obedient He's been Faithful he's been you know attendant Amen to everything that I've showed him and about the father's business and and then then the father takes that son and and adopts him not not our adoption to where we take someone outside of her family and bring an you know an adopted into our family no he's always the Son of God he he he's always but now he gives the father gives him full power full Authority places that on that son in an adoption and now the father stands back and the son stands forward and now he conducts as the father would it it because they become one can you sayen oh my brother BR said after after that adoption no wonder Jesus say all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me it' come to his adoption now do you realize that he the son of man coming with power people looking for a physical body but what they not understanding is that power has come to the church because there's Sons and Daughters of God that has come to maturity it's an adoption can you say Amen brother brandom talks about it in hear ye him and adoption and he preaches several sermons on he hear ye him you ought to go listen to them all talks about all these things and what is it it's the power coming to the church that is here because there's sons and daughters that have been faithful to the will of God they've rejected all other thing and they've listened to the T ership the power of God is in them that they can speak can you say Amen you love him I think the world rejects the power of God because they can't be obedient to the word of God they have to argue with it they have to they have to dissect it they have to say well that was just man that was just brother Brand's opinion that's right and by saying that they denying that power they're not coming into that adoption but there is a church saying Amen to every word be it unto me according to Thy word and it's the son of man being revealed in your flesh you say well how do we know he's here because we have seen the Messiah sign it's been done we know he's here he didn't leave here with brother brandham he's still here with them that church he's pouring his power into the Church of the Living God don't you fear about things don't fear about the world don't fear there's so much arguing and fussing in the white house and even in churches and and in in in Republicans and among themselves and Democrats among themselves and just so much all this confusion and chaos but don't you worry about all of that God's power is with you to transform you I'm so glad for that hallelujah what what song there is power in the name of Jesus there is [Music]
