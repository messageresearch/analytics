good to know that we're on the Lord's Side and he's on our side amen and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to first of all First Corinthians the 14th chapter and as you're turning we want to remember brother Ron's meeting this weekend starting Friday evening and if you're not able to attend uh I'm sure they would appreciate your prayer there that the Lord will just move in a special way and again just to let you know that I'll be gone this Sunday that coming Sunday the next Wednesday and then the following Sunday and so brother Terry will be ministering this Sunday and then brother

little truck trouble there but um glad that he was able to make it back and doing good so also we want to keep brother Bob in our prayer and it's going to be going the stress test tomorrow I believe it is and so we want to keep him in our prayer that the Lord would just be with him and continuing to give him strength that he needs and brother Andrew is preaching there at I won't say brother Roy's but it's my brother Ron Lily's Church there and so we want to keep him in prayer this evening and he asked me to greet you all and uh there and so he'll be ministering there with us in Pennsylvania and so looking forward to a wonderful time in the Lord uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and just talk to our lord for a few moments Lord Jesus it is truly our desire to honor you and to worship you Lord and to give all that we have for you for your glory Lord that you could reflect yourselves through us I pray father that you'd grant us the grace Lord to serve you wholeheartedly in Lord I pray that you just draw was closer to you father we're asking that you would just help brother Andrew as he would Minister to not give him the anointing that he need and Lord as he's just asking for prayer Lord giving the words to speak father May the people be edified I pray Lord that the people would be edified here tonight that you would just help us father Lord help me to surrender myself get myself out of the way and Lord and any spirit that would try to hinder I pray that you would drive it away from this place I pray Lord also that you would help brother Bob tomorrow Lord father you see the the test that you take Lord and the risks that are involved but Lord I I know Lord You're the sustainer you're our strength you're our healer father our protector I pray that you'd be with him Lord during this time father May the report be good we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen a man you can have your seats well actually no we didn't read didn't we okay well first Corinthians the 14th chapter and the um the 15th verse praise the Lord um try to find it here what is it then I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with understanding also I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also then if you'll turn to the Book of James the fifth chapter James chapter 5 and we're going to read the 14th and the I think it's uh or I'm in First Peter hang on just a moment yes uh James 5 14. and 15. is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let him pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith everyone say the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him amen you can now have your seats amen I um of course I've been talking on prayer and why we should pray and James here talks about the prayer faith and I think that just right off at any prayer should be a prayer of faith for the Bible says when we uh he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is rewarder of them that diligently seek him so no prayer is effective without faith but it is important that we pray um first Thessalonians 5 17 we've read this before but Paul would tell us pray without ceasing uh wrong scripture but uh pray without ceasing and so brother Branham said every day you're bound to sin and you're bound to be backsliding constantly so it takes a constant prayer to God takes a constant prayer so prayer is is something that should be a part of our lives on a daily basis you you I I don't think that prayer could be over emphasized there's a lot of things we can over emphasize but prayer is something you cannot brother Brown said you can never pray too much you can do a lot of things too much but not pray too much and even Jesus who knew no sin he he had to spend much time the prophet said in prayer and the reason was is to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him of course we know that God was in Christ and so he he Jesus kept in fellowship and that's that's every one of us prayer is is a a way to keep in fellowship with God and brother Branham said if you only knew what prayer meant sometimes when you're in prayer God changes the complete destination of different things that's going to happen he said do you believe that might be something fixing to happen and your prayer could change the whole situation well you say if God knows it's going to happen what would my prayer do and then he goes back and and where Jesus stood looking up on the Harvest and Jesus of course was the lord of the Harvest and he said the Harvest is ripe the laborers are but few pray ye the lord of the Harvest that he will send labors into his harvest in other words you prayed to me that I will send laborers into my Harvest which I'm telling you it's such a needy thing but again part of it lays in human beings he said see the kingdom of God lays within the human being ain't that right so we we have a part of God's plan we have a part in God acting and that is by prayer prayer is if if if if if it seems like things are dormant in your life pray God moves in prayer and and so uh uh but notice notice the relationship that our prayer should uh if if I could say it be based upon uh the the kind of relationship that you have will determine the kind of prayer life the prayer life the the uh the the anticipation expectation that you have with your prayer and in Luke 11 and 1 the disciples asked Jesus to teach them how to pray and and so Jesus would say uh when you pray say our father can you say that with me our father Our Father we chart in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in Earth ain't that right but the key uh uh there's a lot there in that that prayer that we could go into but but to think of how he told us to start it out or the relationship is our father approaching God as our father so we do not come to him in prayer um as anything else but as a son and daughter of God and and that's the relationship uh that that we should have and our prayer is to express that kind of relationship now if this age is the age of the manifestation of sons and I I believe it is for then then in in this age we have been restored back Amen to where God is behind what we say Do you believe that if if we're back to being Sons and Daughters of God which and and the manifestation of sons and brother Branham talks about this I believe in depth in in the adoption series as as as well is in the messages hear ye him he talks about this adoption and of course other messages but then uh brother Branham here in 1960. brother Branham said the world and nature is groaning crying everything's moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons feel Sons speak and their word is backed ain't that right I believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir say to this mountain and let it be sold brother I desire so and so a certain thing done I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ well I give it to you in the name of Jesus uh name of the Lord Jesus Christ see there's a manifestation oh my brother my crops are burning uh out yonder I haven't had any rain well I'll send you rain in in the name of the Lord God bless your crop oh see waiting groaning on nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning and he gave man the domain ain't that right so uh um then brother Branham goes right after that and and he uses uh John 16 23 whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you ain't that all right so so we're back to a a place of position where the Sons and Daughters of God are being manifested and their words their very own words are being backed by God now if we believe that if we truly believe that our words are so important to God Amen that what we would say then he will come behind that and back that up then it should give us a courage it it should give us a desire to pray more to pray more to know that God our words matter then you say man our words matter and and so a a a a Praying church that's been positionally placed has the authority in their prayer ain't that Ryan a church that's been positionally placed has Authority in praying now Galatians 4 and 4 Paul says but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made unto the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the uh uh adoption of sons and because your sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore everybody say wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ can you say Amen so this is where we're at is no longer children no longer servants but we are Sons can you say that with me I'm a son I'm a daughter see I I I am I am in this position that I am an heir of all things ain't that right so then notice he became me death that I might become him life he became a sinner that I might become his righteousness he became poor that I might through his poverty amen be made Rich he became what I was so that by his grace I might become what he is can you say man now then brother Brown says then talk about the powers of God Amen the powers of God are not somewhere A Million Way Yonder up in heaven the powers of God is in the church do you believe that now First John 3 and 1 John would tell us behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called denominational believers that we should be called churchgoers that we should just be settled down with religion I don't think so the whole what Manner what kind of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God can you say Amen so we are not servants can you say that I am not a servant now brother Branham said the Gentile church was never a servant amen see the Gentile church is Sons and Daughters of God who have received the Holy Ghost even though you were under tutors and governors you were still a son of God ain't that right even though you were you were under the beggarly elements a man and and was just no more you differed no more than a servant there comes a time that you are a son of God now God has always saw you as his son amen but now he has recognized you and given an adoption of sonship [Music] and you say Amen we're Sons so who has the most power was God it's not an angel for an angel is a servant they are only God's servants and you you and I are his sons and daughters you have to believe that you're a son you have to believe you're a daughter of God see a sinner who has been graced uh saved by grace the prophet said has the most power in heaven than an archangel that's standing right by his side he's constantly in the presence of God and yet he has no more power it doesn't give him any more power for the power has been given unto you I give unto you power he never gave that to that Archangel that's standing right by his presence but he looked at the children of God his own children and said I give unto you power to tread upon the serpents and the Scorpions and and all of these things can you say Amen so a son has more Authority than the servant he has more Authority in heaven than the servant because he is a son brother Graham said oh we forget what we are we forget many times what made us what we are after we become what we are then we forget how we got here but don't forget how you got here can you say Amen First Timothy 2 8 says I will therefore that men pray everywhere we talked about it that there is no certain place uh uh really to go to pray our home should be a a place of prayer the the church should be a place of prayer our car or you know you go out in the woods uh or anywhere and and and and and and pray it it it it should be a a prayer a man uh uh God on our mind all the time but Jesus stressed the importance of getting by herself to pray just you and God Alone can you say man we need that time Church getting away by yourself to God you and God Alone God yeah you need that now the prophet and we talked about it the the you know take time to pray don't don't don't don't uh uh uh uh uh don't get too busy to pray ain't that right don't get too in of a hurry Amen to where you don't pray amen uh you know remember the the Pharisee uh uh that invited Jesus to the banquet that he was having and and Jesus come at the invitation and and uh but yet he he slipped by amen the the uh the foot was flunk he and he was found in the corner with dirty feet he he was found in the corner unwelcome ain't that right and and see the prophet said see they didn't entertain him and they totally ignored him they were too busy are you with me they were too busy and he says that's what we are today we're too busy making proselytes too busy to see if this person's baptized correct or not we're too busy to see what position he has and what we can do with him in the church we're too busy with the people and the things of the church we're too busy making sure that everything's carried on just so and so can you say man and in doing this getting too busy we let Christ get by without entertaining him and he says we fail to entertain Jesus after we have invited him to our place many time you're too busy at home in your home life you got too many things you have to do and you can't take time to pray because you're too busy you see prayer is not just asking things that prayer is entertaining him can you say amen and that's what happened there is they did not entertain him amen so we we find that prayer is giving him the attention that he deserves can you say amen and how often he comes to our home and we don't acknowledge Him you know surely we we wouldn't be one to invite someone over for a company and and then when they get there we totally ignore them we don't acknowledge them we we ask them for supper and yet we we sit down and and and and and don't tell them to sit at the table we don't say welcome we we we we uh and then we all start eating and they're just sitting by the door how uncomfortable that would make someone feel it ain't that right well it's true and yet Jesus comes at our invitation all right and then when he comes we're too busy to entertain and you say Amen well Jesus will always go where he's invited ain't that right now you know I I want to look now the Bible tells us the kind of people that he is always with Psalms 145 and 18. it says the Lord is nigh unto them everybody says nine to them to all that call upon him in truth ain't that right the Lord is nine to them that all them that call upon him to all that call upon him in truth ain't that right so so praying in truth praying with the understanding of the word now now in in John 17 17 Jesus said Thy word is truth ain't that right amen it's not coming from a prayer book it's it's the truth is the word of God now I hope that we can all see just how blessed we are to have and to know what God has done in this age you see a man just doesn't stumble on the truth truth has to be revealed ain't that right yes we're still talking about prayer now but see without truth there is no judgment uh uh uh there there is no way to tell right from wrong uh without truth he Jesus could show up and you wouldn't even know him Prophet preached the the message the presence of God unrecognized ain't that right see and so now notice first John 5 14 and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will David ain't that right according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petition that we desired of him so that's the prayer of faith ain't that right see so knowing that we are praying according to his will knowing that he hears us knowing that we will have whatever we Petition of him then you say amen amen see but how could we tell the difference between the will of God and our own will without the truth how could we even begin to pray according to the will of God if there's no truth can you say Amen see so without truth we wouldn't even know how to pray or what to pray for our prayers think of it now without truth our prayers would be like a ship or an airplane without a rudder nothing to direct it nothing to control it ain't that right and our prayers would be a stenched to God and our lives would be an Abomination to him with that truth without truth we we would pray contrary to his will ain't that right now notice Ephesians 1 9 and and hopefully when we're done make some sense to you but Ephesians 1 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will his Will's a mystery and he's made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself ain't that right so the truth everybody say the truth of his will has to be made known that pray according to his will if you if it's a mystery but when it's made known to us the truth of his will has to be made known to us talking about praying asking him truth right see calling upon him in truth if we didn't have truth how would we know what to ask and what to believe for see where there is no truth there is no understanding do you believe that a relationship with Christ must be guided by truth our progress in Christ must be guided in truth our prayers must be directed by truth do you believe it see our worship must be guided by truth Isaiah 59 and 14 tells us what happens when there is no truth judgment is turned away backward and just to standeth afar off for why truth is fallen in the streets the Broadway now looked it up the street Broad yes Broadway ain't that right broad is the way that leadeth to destruction truth is fallen in that way and equity and Equity cannot enter I looked up the word Equity it's the true things of Prophecy see so so truth is falling in the broad way and Equity the the the true things of Prophecy cannot enter ain't that right so in other words the word of God cannot have the preeminence because truth is falling the 15th verse yea truth failures and he that departeth from Evil maketh himself a prey well why is because there's no judgment between right and wrong and you say man we're living in needs of of uh they call that evil uh uh which is good and they call good uh evil so evil good and good evil ain't that right because truth faileth truth Flawless in the streets and the Lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment there's no judgment in the churches today there's no judgment in in the nation today there's no judgment in the world and prayers are being offered prayer after prayer is being offered but it's not being offered according to truth [Applause] and you say Amen brother Branham in his prayer said father we pray that you'll associate our minds this morning into this truth the word and help us Lord that we may be able to understand better today how many wants to understand better amen we want to understand better amen and I'm gonna just say it amen that a PR a prayer from a son and daughter of God the far outweighs a Pentecostal prayer a Baptist prayer a Catholic prayer can you say Amen it's true so he says see when we leave uh that we might be able to understand better today when we leave this house of teaching that it might be good for our souls again the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him to all that call upon him in truth now at the world now I see a council brother Brown said the word lost its influence amongst the people and they all voted out the true word and took endogamous of discrepancy of the early Catholic Church they added a pope they added a bishop they added this that and the other they taken away the real true meaning of Peter and of Mary and all the rest of it made idols and made nothing but just a pagan ceremony out of all out of so-called Christian religion what was it it's the seed of discrepancy and organized and organized for the first time on earth a church what was it that seed of discrepancy started sowing something adding to and taken away ain't that right so brother Branham goes on who who another place whoever heard in the Bible not eating meat on Friday right whoever heard in the Bible of of anything uh sprinkling of of baptizing in Mercy whoever heard of those things Hail Mary or something who ever heard of some of this rotten tummy rot of these Protestants who whoever heard of some of these things that these apostolics hold on to whoever heard of such things as these uh Pentecostals hold on to come on you can amen it surely they hold the things and they teach it as though it's scripture and it's nothing more but a lie then you say amen that's right see and what they've done is they've driven God away from them do you believe that they've driven the presence of God away from them but the Lord is night after them that crawl upon him in truth in truth that's why it's so important don't you hold on to Creeds don't you hold on to dogmas don't you hold on to traditions it's truth now the truth has become a mystery and brother Bradham said there's a lot of Truth lost out there where others have compromised on Truth amen amen ain't that right another place he said people don't know the mystery of God the truth of God why they've not been taught the mystery of God the only thing they've been taught join Church put your name on the book be a good fella treat your neighbor right that's all right but then brother Brown said you must know everybody say you must know the mystery of God do you realize it's this message that brings you into relationship with God it's this message that brings the presence of God not far off but right now you amen ain't that right so you must know you must know the mystery of God Revelations 10 and 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished you know what it means the ministry of God will be revealed as he hath declared to his servants the prophets then you say Amen so it was so important to God that you get truth it was so important to God that God uh sister Brendan would be able to walk with you and talk with you and have relationship with you but he had to restore truth to you he didn't want you living in an Abomination he didn't want you to live and pray and and sing and and serve and do all their religious duties and things outside of his will something contrary pray and no have no power with God serve God worship and have no power with God can you say Amen you realize how much worship is going on today and it has no meaning to God how many prayers are being offered and there has no meaning to God [Applause] [Music] Revelations 10 1 talks about the mighty angel coming to the Earth with an open book and you know these these quotes but brother REM said the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book Glory opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people that's where the truth is it's in the open book to reveal it to his people that's that's where the mystery of God the truth of God is going to be finished and be revealed tie up all them loose ends can you say man notice he says the seventh the seventh angel in another place don't compromise on nothing he gathers all up all the Loose Ends and gathers them all up at and at his sounding all the mystery of God should be finished oh God sent him all of the Hidden Mysteries was finished when he see it was revealed to him by what if these are hidden mysteries the man will have to be a prophet amen amen see see I I hope you young people understand why we don't we don't delve into all the books there's a lot of Christian writers that are dealing that that deal with prayer that deal with marriage that deal with raising children that deal with dating courtship they they they've got man they got us so much yeah and yet none of that appeals none of that none of that Appeals because it had to come by profit [Music] can you say amen I say to you a prophet's good enough don't need a psychologist to come in don't need counselors to come in the spirit of God back that Prophet up and he revealed the truth that God could walk with you restoring you back to relationship restoring you back to an Eden ain't that right see so a prophet is likened to an eagle because he can climb up where no one else can he can see things that no one else can brother Brown said the prophet Eagle is a revealer of the truth that's been Fallen all through the age another place the seventh angel disposes shows up makes plain the Hidden Truths that the seals had hid all these years through all those churches and denominations ain't that right another place the third pull was the opening of The Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word ain't that right we thank God for the first two pulls but that was not to bring the bride it was only to gather them it was only to catch the attention can you say man but the third pull is where the truth laid the third pull is where the Mysteries were revealed ain't that right yes sir so the Mysteries that were once hidden in the book are now divinely revealed Truth by the seventh angel messenger now brother Branham says now the book was so important that it is the word of God now watch and when the word of God is brought forth it's got to be brought by the prophet because that's who the word of God comes to every word of God is brought can you say that with me every word of God is brought the Bible doesn't change its system at all it's the same thing it's got to come to this Seer that we're expecting to arrive now notice uh Revelations 10 1-7 now remember there's no more Powers goes out after that eagle no more every time the Antichrist sent forth something God sent a power this Antichrist and another Power God sends something to combat it he said another Power God said something to combat it and then when he got down to the eagle that was his word back like it was in the first place there's no more there's no more need for anything ain't that right so then it's the word or the truth restored unto us right you believe it amen now notice brother Brown said with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of power power that's what this message does to us the revealed word the revealed truths it brings power to us as Sons and Daughters of God ain't that right now how do I know it's the truth well brother Brown said this if the truth is revealed the truth is also Vindicated see no matter how smart the person might be how brilliant he might be in his mind if God don't back up what he's saying there's something wrong ain't that right another place he says why couldn't this be before because it hadn't happened before now you see it see the great Holy Spirit sing those things coming down Through the Ages and times and now it's being revealed and then you look there and see that it's the truth that's where we're at how many seasons that's the truth another place he said see we have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication ain't that right now so by being Believers in in the message that God sent by way of a prophet we are not a people that prays for and believes for things that God never promised we are not praying in a state of confusion wandering as to what God in the godhead we are praying to we we are not a people that prays to a god that we do not understand or know ain't that right we do not pray to a god that is a figment of our imagination it's in this day that we have been blessed to see God in action and demonstration you believe it we know beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is the same yesterday today and forever not because someone told it we've seen it we've seen him declare it ain't that right amen amen now brother Branham says this Divine Healing isn't a Hocus Pocus affair it isn't saying a few mystery words over somebody and hypnotizing Divine Healing is the truth revealed through Jesus Christ do you believe it Divine Healing is the truth revealed I'll go on to to say that Redemption is the truth revealed Deliverance is the truth revealed adoption is the truth revealed amen the Rapture is the truth revealed our future home is the truth revealed unto us didn't you say man our name on the Lamb's Book of Life is nothing but the truth revealed to us being Sons and Daughters of God is nothing but the truth revealed to us you believe it amen that's true God's saving our children is nothing but the truth amen revealed to us it's we we see we've been taken back the truth has been given to us truth that wasn't just a prophet standing behind the pulpit revealing the truth to a gathering of people that day and to be honest that isn't really what brought the understanding to you yet it took a prophet to reveal the truth but see the truth has to be personally revealed amen it has to be personally revealed to you in order for you to know where you're standing amen ain't that right and brother Branham said you'll never know what is Christ or what is the word until first the Holy Spirit has personally revealed it to you in your heart then you know that Jesus is Lord when your heart said so not when your knowledge said so but when your heart says so that's when you know it ain't that right that's when it becomes truth to you is when your own heart says it people hear Brother Brown's all the time and they still walk away from it but there is a people that their heart says it's right not intellectually but down in their soul they can say Amen to it then they come to God in truth because their heart is saying itself ain't that right brother Brown talks about us being an outside being by our natural birth and the outside is what you taste feel smell hear and see but when you are born again it has nothing to do with the outside nothing and this is what makes you sons of God it's not your natural birth but your spiritual birth and when that spiritual birth it happens then you become the Son of God and it has nothing to do with your natural birth it has nothing to do with your outside man can you say amen and brother Brown said the inside which is the soul that's what you really are yeah ain't that right that's what you really are the outside man he says is what Satan temps and knocks around and and and uh uh you know he he just uh looking for a word here but he just he just rattles them he just knocks them flat on that outside man they feel hear smell and see and all these things that's where you go through the trials and The Temptations and the failures and all that but way down inside he cannot do it unless you allow him to do it and you say man that's what program says he he can he can tempts you on this outside flesh he can he can he can get you to where you're not feeling God you don't feel like a Christian you don't feel great he works on you and how many has been worked on yeah yeah he works on you you'll not be you'll never be healed your children will never get saved then he of course then he wants to make it think that it's you that's one that's taking these things that that's coming from you and it's not he's the one that's making these things and he's badgering you in that outside man then you say Amen but in that inside man he has no control over you ain't that right unless you let him and brother Brown said now that's where Faith resides is in the inside man where you live is where Faith resides ain't that right now notice faith can only be based upon Vindicated truth which is being it's been personally revealed to you it's it's no longer the minister trying to encourage you even though we all need encouraging but there's times when you ain't got the encouragement and no one seems to understand or you don't have the devil fights he he he'll make you feel like you're alone you're standing alone he'll make you feel like you ain't doing no good he makes you feel like all kinds of just nonsense right and and it's in them times that's where Faith resides is down in that heart and it has to be personally revealed to you out if the whole church walks away it has to be personally revealed to you that this is nothing but ain't that right now without faith it is impossible to please God ain't that right so brother Brown said if you want to please him you must come to him with faith believing his word is the truth come to him come to him come to him as a son daughter of God in truth it's personally revealed to you you're not taking the preacher's word you're no longer just taking a prophet's word it's now inside of you [Applause] now you're approaching him not brother Branham said Lord but father your word said I'm believing this with all of my heart this is what I am heir to all right ain't that right you're not coming to him based on a Creed you're not coming based on on your feelings you're not making your prayer founding your prayer upon how you feel you are coming to him in truth yeah whether I feel it or not it's still the truth and you say man whether the doctor agrees or not it's still the truth so you're not coming to him based upon that outside man reasoning intellectual all of that is no good don't don't even begin to serve God by your reasoning don't even try to begin to study scriptures by your reasoning don't even try to understand the Prophet by your reasoning it's got to be revealed truth it's got to be personally revealed to you and then you're calling upon the Lord in truth Faith doesn't come from the outer conscience and the prophet said the outer conscience reasons but there is no reasoning in faith and you say Amen do you believe that this message is the absolute now I know there's a big question right now and for you to say that it's the absolute boy they nail you all right but it's the absolute if the prophet was to bring the truth then we must finally stop looking and say it's the truth can you say man then it changes our relationship with God it changes how we pray and it changes how God looks at us and and when I say that you know it's it's it's kind of it's kind of like a little child you know when my children were small we had a totally different conversation than we do now a lot of times it was Google that was the conversation I do not tell my children I don't walk up to my Daniel and faith and Judah and I know you walk up to these uh Ruth and Levi Google there's maturity coming right they're getting to a greater understanding ain't that right I thought of you know um I've thought of well interview parents that have had children you know when they're small their arms just going all over the place their legs are going everywhere they ain't got no hardly no control but that same child to say the boy the same that same child he grows up as as he's growing up like Levi he'll have a football say Dad catch you know and I better be ready because I might knock me upside the head like it did it's more his mom but he's developed not just moving his arms the power was there but it was uncontrollable he didn't know he didn't have the understanding it it wasn't developed but then as as the relation or as they're growing up and the understanding come the relation he's always been a son it's just a relationship starts to change we're no longer Google did it's it's now beginning to talk and see things eye to eye all right thank you amen and this is where I believe that we're coming to Pentecostal teaching will only leave you as a baby it will only leave you without knowledge of who really God is not this message has come not for us to look and say oh wow God is great but now we're seeing this understanding how great he is and how his works because we are developing lord it's one thing to read about Jesus speaking to the tree and that's fine and we can say thank you Lord for speaking to the tree but it does not bring us into an intimate relationship as much as when we say it when our words are backed up when our words have the power then we can say oh wow that God that was in him is now in me and that saying God has used my lips can you say man so we're coming to an understanding and and in our prayer our relationship everything about God and us it's we're becoming to know him better greater amen so there is no reasoning in faith brother Brown said you got it from God and you know it's there I don't care how much it looks wrong you still know it's right it's thus saith the Lord and there's nothing going to bother that nothing can bother that it's moving right straight on difficult means nothing to it Wades right on through it for it's the word and the words The Sword and the word Cuts ain't that right see the sword Cuts itself free from everything else takes the hand of Faith to hold that word so therefore we don't pray with our reasoning and I'm not going to keep you too much longer but we pray by the truth that's been revealed to us we we're coming up not babes anymore but we've been ripening in the presence of this message the presence of the sun it's ripening us our understanding is ripening our worship is ripening our prayers our words everything is ripening our conduct our attitude so that's when you pray the prayer of faith and God is nine to all that call upon his name in truth brother Branham said when God revealed himself personally to Moses he then knew that God was the Healer and he knew that God was with him ain't that right what a change that was when God revealed himself to Moses Moses had this understanding that God was the Healer and that God was with him ain't that right notice the very Ministry of Malachi 4 is to restore back to this Fallen people through these denominational twists back to the original faith of the fathers to restore back the Fallen people aren't you glad for that no more is our prayer a fallen prayer amen no more is our understanding a fallen understanding no more is our conduct a fallen conduct God by the message of the hour has restored us back to what we fail from ain't that right now I'm I'm going to close but I do want to read here a scripture I know that there are prophecies that speak of Israel and and from what I see that a lot of these prophecies also are dual that they speak about the church as well and and spiritual Israel is the Church of the Living God and so I want to read this whether it helps you or not as I read it today um it meant something to me Isaiah 42 22 but this is a people robbed and spoiled they are all of them snared in holes and they are HID in prison houses for they are a pray and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith restore as I read that I've been I just got to thinking that we were in we've gone through seven Church ages and and Satan has robbed Satan has taken Satan has spoiled Satan has just had his way with us ain't that right and and yet we have never been in a complete restoration if I can say it that way there's no one that could that had the message of of complete restoring just never did so there's not been a through these Seven Ages have not been a complete uh uh Deliverance now notice the 23rd verse who among you will give ear to this who will hearken and hear for the time to come who gave Jacob for a spoil and Israel to the robbers did not the Lord he against to whom we have sinned for they would not walk in his ways neither were they obedient unto his law this would fit just exactly through the church ages God sends a Revival and the church goes right back into the muck in the mire God sends another move and they go right back ain't that right is that what Israel done he delivers them back bring something brought back they go right back into the same old the the same old muck and mire now Isaiah 43 and 1. but now thus saith the Lord that created the old Jacob and he that formed the O Israel fear not have we not heard them words we've heard a lot fear not taking away the fear from you that's what a prophet would say taking away the fear from the church and he says see fear not for I have redeemed thee [Music] I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine when thou passes through the waters I will be with you what's he doing making his presence known and through the waters they shall not overflow thee when thy Walkers through the fire Thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee see he's manifesting the truth of his power but nothing will be able to hurt you walk through it won't hurt you it won't destroy you for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and Sabah for thee see so he's making known to us the truth of what he is I am the Lord thy God amen can you say Amen it ain't denominations it's me that's your savior yeah the organizations at your Refuge can you say Amen is that not what he's done in this age made himself known as The Rock of our salvation notice since thou was precious in my sight and all of this when when I was reading it and what I got out of it it's truth truth he's making known to us we we were in the prison cells we we were we were all in a mess and there was no one crying restore there was no one uh uh to bring us out we were in a hopeless situation we were destitute we were nobody and yet he come making himself known revealing the truth to us fear not I am your Redeemer fear not oh my I'm the one I'm the one that is your salvation I'm the one ain't that right since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and I have loved that you you see what he's doing he's making known the truth of what was in his mind before the foundation of the world and he's telling us I never looked at you in a in a uh in my wrath I've always loved you you've always been with me I was always been precious in my sight thou has been honorable can you say man therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life again fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West what's he doing he has done the work of a redeemer kinsman redeemer and now he comes to claim what he has redeemed fear not I am with you hello you ain't come to tickle our fancy you ain't come just to make us feel good he come with the sole purpose to redeem what he has claimed ain't that right so now notice I'll bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the Earth have we not heard his voice crying in this day House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus give way even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yea I have made him see so now he reveals he reveals the truth of his purpose for creating us bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the death that have ears what's it all about he's restoring a fallen people he's restoring then you say Amen a people that couldn't see and understand the truth but it restores unto them their sight and their hearing so that they can know and understand the truth if you go on here in the ninth verse he says let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who who among them can declare this and show us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth you are my witness saith the Lord and my servant whom I have chosen that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God formed neither shall there be after me I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior can you say Amen so the truth has been made known to us that he alone is God that he alone is our savior he alone is our creator he alone is our existence ain't that right amen see and so he says I have declared and have saved and I have showed when there was no strange God among you see therefore you are my Witnesses saith the Lord that I am God yea before the day was I am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand I will work and who shall let it thus saith the Lord your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel for your sake I have sent to Babylon and brought down all their nobles and the Chaldeans whose cry is in the ships I am the Lord your God the your the I am the Lord your Holy One the creator of Israel your king thus saith the Lord which maketh the way in the sea and the path in the mighty Waters which bringeth forth The Chariot and horse the Army and the power they shall lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct and are quenched As Told can you say man see so it's the truth of this power manifested remember he says ye not the former things neither consider the things of old behold I will do a new thing and now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert and the Beast of the field shall honor me and the dragons and the aisle owls because I give water in the wilderness and the river rivers in the desert to drink to my people My Chosen these people have I formed for myself they shall show forth my praise can you say Amen do you love him well then you look at First Peter 2 and 9. he says but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but now are the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy oh do you love him calling up on him in truth he is not him that call upon them prayer from a Believer prayer of a righteous man availeth much amen first John 5 20 it says and we know that the Son of God is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life so now our prayer isn't the prayer of a beggar but rather it's the prayer of a son or daughter of God we have the truth as to who he is we have the truth as to why he saved us we have the truth as to who we are we have the truth that we were in his thinking before the foundation of the world we have the truth that his thoughts are perfect and that we were in his thoughts and they are Eternal and they are real we have the truth that we are Justified as though we've never done it we have the truth can you say Amen oh my we have the truth and we know his will we come to him knowing it is his will to heal us we make our petition knowing that it is his will to save our children we pray knowing it is his will to Deliver Us from all evil we bring our petition to him knowing it is he who hath made us his children and not we ourselves can you say man truth revealed if the musicians will come truth revealed is actually God's understanding revealed hey because truth revealed does not come from man's intellect that's why it had to come through a prophet because the word of God comes through a by-profit to a prophet so it's God's understanding that we pray with which gives us his faith can you say man brother Branham said this I found two wires that'll bring uh that'll bring the the visible power of God for Divine Healing into the individual he said that that's two things I find one of them is love the other is faith and they're sweethearts and when love gets married to Faith love always accompanies faith when you love God enough to know that he can't lie to you it'll create a faith in there that'll make you believe his word and every word he said is positive truth and you accept it with an unadulterated faith that won't say no it'll produce just exactly what he said it would do do you get it so that's where we pray with understanding it's not our understanding it's his understanding we have taken on his mind and now we know his truths we know the mystery of his will he ain't out to kill you he now here to acknowledge you you're his son you're his daughter he ain't here shunning you from your prayers you know the only thing that will hinder your prayer is sin that's why we have a covering we have an atonement are you with me [Music] Psalms 103 2 says bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits when you're going through your trial forget not all of his benefits when you're going to prayer forget not all of his benefits don't let doubt don't let reasoning stop you from asking for big things can you say man who forgive us all thine iniquities who heal us all by diseases redeem is our lives from termination who Chronicles thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things now would he do that by giving you understanding of Truth that way when you pray your prayer is not weak prayers with words of truth and you're coming now based upon his word father I know I feel like I feel like a complete idiot father I know I've I I feel I feel like you don't love me but I'm going to push that aside the truth says you'll never leave me nor forsake me the truth says that if I'd call upon you in truth that you're nigh unto me can you say Amen and then you bring him the word of God you bring the promises before him and say God this is your word can you say man I'm not doubting it I'm not here going to argue with it God I know it looks impossible and Satan is telling me it's impossible he's telling me there's no reason to pray but God here I am as a son and I'm approaching you based upon your word your truth do you loving isn't the Lord wonderful I hope it's helped you in some way but notice the Lord is nigh unto them all them that call upon him to all that call upon him in truth he will everybody say he will fulfill the desire of them that fear Him he will also hear the cry and will save them oh my no wonder the devil keeps us from praying no wonder the devil gets us so busy that we can't get along with God in prayer that brothers and sisters take time to pray get alone with God when your back is against the wall and you don't know what to do go to your heavenly father he's already made the way for you to come he's already made you an heir and joined air with Christ ain't that right hallelujah what song You're My Healer and I believe you are all I need I believe I
