remember the sins it's it's been totally blotted out of our lives and I'm so glad for the blood of Jesus Christ what an atonement amen the musicians can be dismissed today and I certainly enjoy the songs and the worship and it's just been a a blessing and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Isaiah the sixth chapter and just it's just good to have all the visitors today amen and uh good to have uh Sister Laura and and her children and uh just so appreciate them and her and Jonathan and of course Jonathan wasn't able to make it today uh he's got duties back home and but really just an honor to have have her and and the children and blessed by their singing brother Nathan and sister Natalie as well don't see them anywheres but I know they're all right there and so good to have them and uh Jamie Cunningham God bless you and uh good to have him as well spent many years uh been a while since I've seen you and been good to have him this morning and uh Seth and Becca and the grandchildren uh always enjoy them and tell you when they go home it about tears my heart out every time but uh it's certainly good to have have them as well as well sister Rosanna this morning and uh we uh sister Rebecca Adams man we're just going to hate to see you guys go and I know Ann is for sure and brother Michaela and sister Shekinah and I tell you we've just been truly blessed I for one I feel blessed to be part of a family that to see my nephews and nieces and just give theirselves to the Lord and give their talents to the Lord and I know it hasn't been easy for all you young people especially in this day that we're living in and a lot of temptations that are out there and but I say God bless you very much and may you just keep pressing the battle because you're part of this you're part of this and everything that God is doing in this age God has has set you in where you're at and uh for such a time as this and you just keep looking toward the prize because the Rapture the Rapture is for you as well and and this is why the Devil he's no respecter of persons he's going to attack in any way can but the Lord is no respecter of age either he's no respecter of persons and has called you just as much as he's called me for this age and so you just keep pressing on and all the home folks that have been gone it's good to have you here this morning and brother AJ and sister Kimberly we certainly love them appreciate them and good to have you all and as most of you might know I know some of you do especially you young people but brother shalom has has moved to North Carolina to be with his extended family I guess we could say that for a while and so it certainly breaks our heart to see him go uh there but he he just feels that the Lord is leading down that way we'll say for a while anyways but you know God sends people in our lives to be a positive impact and and brother shalom has been a positive impact to me and to to many of us here and so we we miss them people that are no longer with us or there you know but we certainly pray that the Lord will bless him and keep him wherever he goes and I tell you more than anything The Lord Is Our Shepherd and he knows he knows how to take care of us he knows how to delete us and to bring us where we need to be and so we certainly commit him into the hands of Our Lord amen and I want to say happy anniversary to my beloved wife uh 12 years now and so uh and uh I certainly appreciate her and she's sure been a an inspiration of strength to me in my life and I love her to Pieces so under death or whatever you want to call it but I certainly love her and appreciate her and uh but before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our lord for we realize without him we're nothing and we need him more today than we ever have so let's just pray to him father with humbled hearts Lord and knowing that we're your children Lord knowing that you've bid us to come today Lord together Lord to be with you to meet with you and father I just pray that all the songs and the words that have been said thus far have been pleasing to you father I know it has now we pray that you would just speak back to us the Lord father that you would anoint me Lord and that you'd help me just get myself out of the way and anoint the gift that you placed within my life and Lord that you would take my mouth and that you would speak and you take the words that are said Lord and that you would just planted every heart this morning no matter how simple the subject may be and they're knowing the hearts and ears of your people Lord to to understand and to receive father Lord we ask these things and we just Commit This service now unto your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen the book of Isaiah the sixth chapter and we're going to start at the first verse but it says in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting up on a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he did or end with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe was me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a life coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me amen you can have your seats this morning and I'm going to continue on the the thought that we have been speaking on and that is Ministry and um we've been on this subject for for a little bit and so uh but we we know that we're not just talking about any Ministry we're we're talking about the ministry of God God's Ministry and for those who are visiting Ministry it means it's an agent or an instrument a person or thing through which something is accomplished so the purpose of ministry is is to accomplish uh it's it's for accomplishing and and the word accomplished means to bring to completion to fulfill so that's that's what the ministry of God is for is to accomplish to to bring to completion to fulfill uh a purpose and so um we we understand then why so many will come up short and be left behind because not just any ministry will accomplish what God is after and so the ministry of God is an agent or agency by which something again is is accomplished and so this means that through the operation of the ministry power is exerted so the end is achieved amen uh through the the operation of the ministry so then we look of what purpose what what is to be accomplished in uh Jeremiah 29 11 says for God says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected in and and so this is why God would put his ministry is the direction of God's Ministry is that there is an expected end and it's not my expected end that I have that I'm trying to accomplish it's not yours it's it's God's ain't that right God's purpose and and so uh uh Ministry has a purpose behind it amen we're not none of us are wasting our time if you're part of the ministry whether you're singing whether you're preaching whether you're holding an office or whether you're testifying or whether your mother father whatever it is there is a purpose if you're part of God's Ministry amen so so we're not floating around and uh but so so then every Branch every branch of God's Ministry exists to serve his purpose we've talked about the ministry of Angels the ministry of the Holy Spirit the the the then there's the ministry of the prophets um uh uh that the Bible talks about the ministry of the Evangelist the missionary or Apostle uh Pastor uh uh uh uh teacher uh Prophet all these faithful Ministry and then the Bible speaks of the ministry of the Saints and within that Ministry uh there are singers musicians prophecy tongues interpretation of tongues Gifts of healings uh uh uh even down to the the janitor uh father and mother that that's a Ministry to be honest um uh their brother Branham even talked about mother being the Fifth Gospel uh uh there but uh there's Visions dreams and and and so many things and then the Apostle Paul talks about helps and governments and and uh but it's all for the ministry uh uh there and so all the these Ministries with or branches within his the ministry of God uh he has that so that his eternal purpose can be accomplished and and see as as we've been talking but just to go back over it God has wrote uh uh names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and those names were in his thinking uh uh at the beginning the prophet said they are the Eternal thoughts of God and they are what makes up the bride of Christ and we fail from God's thoughts and so therefore we all have an adamic nature uh which is a fallen nature and and as we know that in in our first birth we come as sons of Adam uh rather than sons of God and and we we are sinners we we were uh uh we were enemies uh By Nature uh against God um uh you know we were slaves to our enemy we were just miserable wretch uh liars and and and such and so what but what we were in our first birth we did not reflect the thoughts of God uh it wasn't the Eternal thoughts of god of what God thought us to be and now we thought this was life we thought that we would forever be what we are and and and what's sad is is the devil tries his best to convince us that that that will still be whatever we are whether we're dealing with habits whether we're dealing with uh just issues in our personal life that that the devil will try to convince us that you'll always be that way so what's the use of trying but that's a lie that that's a lie and and so the ministry is not founded upon what you are as in your first birth the ministry is founded by God's purpose and upon what God thought you to be uh in the beginning ain't that right and so see God called us to be different than what we were or what we are according to our natural birth he's called us to be different his calling is higher than what we are his his intentions are greater than what we would ever think and and sometimes even in our carnal mind as you young people you you might think well I'm going to be this and I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and a lot of times you think on them things and you make your plans based off of carnal understanding based off discouragement based off the devil telling you there ain't no use of trying to even try to be a Christian because of your failures and all that and you'll make plans based upon that and and and then God says I'm that that ain't going to be the plan that that my plan is greater than yours my you understand and this is where God says through Isaac the prophet Isaiah my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and and and so uh uh these things and so see God predestinated us to be different than what we are or what we were uh uh there and so uh uh anything that you are in your natural life your natural birth and your by your natural carnal thinking or whatever amen there's something God's predestination overrides that if if that would you understand and so so a lot of times even when a preacher is preaching it's just like the prophet amen he did not preach according to your present State he he preached from God's thoughts amen and he already called you Justified he already called it it's already done you understand what I'm saying and and so uh we we could not be what God called us to be me as long as Sin had dominion over us but see no matter what shape you were in or are present tense in amen because you know a lot of us look and say well I you know I'm not where I need to be when you hear the propheter you hear the Minister preach certain things and you're like man that's just not where I'm at I'm well that's fine that that's totally fine amen because God doesn't look at your present condition and no matter what you're you're in present tense you you you you're an eternal thought of God if you're part of God's plan and and and and and so he confirms that you are a part of his plan by giving you the baptism of the Holy Ghost ain't that right God doesn't waste his time giving people the holy ghost that ain't part of his plan but if you're part of his plan and he has filled you with the Holy Ghost that is your guarantee that no matter where you're at it puts you in an eternal arrest that I am an eternal thought of God now Satan get away from me ain't that right so the ministry is is the purpose of ministry is dealing with the thoughts of God and not your present condition and and sometimes God will rebuke God will correct God will shape you ain't that right but thank God for his correction thank God for him taking us and not allowing us to be there and it's not that God is preaching against you it's not that God is trying to correct in the sense of damn you he is trying to cut that devil away from you and when he when he when he deals with it he's dealing with that demon that is trying to pledge you and and and and and and and to try to cut you free from them things ain't that right amen well it's it's the truth a man because Satan wants to misguide you and the shepherd says absolutely not you ain't doing that to my son right and and so and then our hearts humble ourselves and we say say oh God take take me you know and and I thank God for his dealing with us but see within you is a gene seed of God and within that seed is everything that God thought you to be it's already in you ain't that right and so as we stated uh Wednesday night that is what's causing you to groan within and and uh you know I'll read it here Romans 8 18 Paul talks about that groaning he says I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature Wade is for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope amen see so he has subjected you to this vanity of the world but he also subjected you to the hope of of his promises of what he thought want you to be because the creature itself shall shell everybody say shell also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation growneth and travaileth in pain together into now it's either labor pains a man and not only they but also ourselves which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption or the changing of our body ain't that right so we're groaning and you may have had the Holy Ghost you may have you may have been in this for 50 years and and but you're still groaning we're groaning the groaning never stops until we come to the completion of what God thought us to be amen and that's there's a millennium waiting for us there's a Rapture waiting for us there's a new Heaven and Earth waiting for us and this is just a constant groaning a groaning amen you may not be what you used to be but there's still constant groaning a reaching Force ain't that right a Believer will never can never be settled in where they're at present tense God's always pushing us to go higher in him for you any or an eternal thought and God's plan is a Plan of Redemption ain't that right and in other words this Plan of Redemption is to bring you back bring all us back to what God originally thought us to be before the world began Romans 8 28 a popular scripture very well known but it's our scripture amen that we rest our soul upon for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of a son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called in whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified God so God foreknew them and wrote their names in the Lamb's Book of Life for they are the Eternal thoughts of God the Rapture is for them the changing of the body is for them Heaven is for them the marriage supper of the Lamb is for them the Millennium is for them the new city coming down from heaven is for them can you say Amen you realize that they will be the only ones living in that City amen that's what the prophet said now there's going to be other people living outside the city amen and and even Revelations talks about a 21 uh 23 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are safe shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor unto it and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall not be no night there and they shall bring the glory and honor of the Nations into it ain't that right but they dwell on the outside of the city amen and they are given eternal life at the white Throne judgment and will populate the Earth outside the city ain't that right but the prophet said but they will not be the elected and called bride they are the ones that come up in the second Resurrection ain't that right the prophet said there will be dealers of the Soul like Adam was and so forth caretakers of the garden but the bride everybody say that's me see the bride as Queen will be live inside the kingdom with the King ain't that right so this message of redemption is for the bride because he's already got an eternal purpose for her amen and that is to live with him that is to reign with him in in that City a man for eternity ain't that right amen says so now how how God's already got a plan God already knows who's going to make up that bride ain't that right he's Justified he called her predestinated Justified and has already glorified amen and the position is already there amen and and as the prophet here in this life said and no one can take your place no one I don't care how insignificant you feel I don't care how unworthy you feel I don't care how many trials you go through and how dark it may be no one can take your place whether you're on the Mountaintop no one can take your place if you're in the valley no one can take your place if you fail if you come up short nobody can take your place it's already an eternal thought of God in his mind no one so therefore God is now in this life and in this age selecting it calling his thoughts calling can you say man for acts 15 14 uh Paul I believe talks about God taking out of the Gentiles uh a people for his name amen and and so in other words he's selecting a people out of the Gentiles and them people are his eternal thoughts them names that were written in the Lamb's Book of Life and he's calling them out of this Gentile dispensation to be his bride and notice the prophet said the whole of the church ages is God dealing with the Gentiles and calling a gentile bride to himself he said that makes the church ages and the fullness of the Gentiles amen uh yeah sure there's other people that will make it a man the friends of the Bride the foolish virgin or whatever amen but the message and what God is dealing with is for that Gentile bride and now we are come to the fullness of the Jim tiles we're coming to the end of it that means that the last one is about to come in or she may have already been in I don't know that's up to God that I do know this that not many people are going to receive what you have received because we're here at the fullness of the Gentile dispensation all right that's right that's right it's good the message of this age calls the bride together which is the shout so the message deals with the bride doesn't deal with the foolish virgin deals with the bride doesn't deal with everybody else it deals with the bride why because this is the only way that this bride can be called out I have to say it it's the only way that that that them Eternal thoughts can come back can you say Amen into what God originally thought to be is this message and by this message can it only happen by this message that that you you it's the only way the Rapture can happen in this age I have this message can you say Amen buy this message it's it's all to do with the message of the hour you say well you're just following a man well I all I know is as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming a revealing of the son of man thank you and and and we all know that that Prophet Noah and I might have said Moses I don't know but in as it was in the days of Noah but as we know that that Prophet Noah stood at the door of the Ark and everyone that went in that Ark had to come by way of a prophet can you say amen and as it was back then so is it today you ain't getting in that Arc by outside this Prophet you ain't getting in a Rapture outside this Prophet you want to try to be like that guy that comes through the window amen you you can try that that we already know it ain't going to happen and you say Amen you can be religious or whatever you want to be amen but but you'll go through the outer Darkness you'll go through the tribulation and and all these God knows all about that but I'm telling you a man to come into the marriage supper of the lamb for this age there is a prophet that's calling the people together for such a Time [Applause] now we as the elect of God didn't start out reflecting his thoughts but through the work of redemption we're being brought back to the original thoughts of God and it's being done through his agency amen the prophet said he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place aren't you glad for that what kind of a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists Man On and On we can go no headaches no trials no Temptations exist you think of that young people all the enticements that the devil's got for yet no more no more no more no more you might have been here we we might have come in here worshiping god with a heavy load of things and and Satan worn on our mind but there's going to be a time that you'll worship god with nothing of that amen nothing nothing whatsoever can you say man why it's a perfect place and and the only way it can be a perfect place is no Devil's going to be there no death no suffering no sorrow no heartache he said and it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection how many he's got the pull now amen we we fill the pool we felt the pool amen it was a pool that brought you to an altar it was a pool that brought you to this message but that pool is still there and it's causing the groaning within what is it it's a perfect place calling you at an imperfect individual but it's calling you to that perfection amen it's calling you and notice what he says and you have to be perfect to get there ah now that's where everybody gets down-hearted and their their jaws drop and how am I going to be there then right well the Bible said so Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom everybody say it's a perfect Kingdom now people get downhearted but we Rejoice because we know what that perfect Kingdom means it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people amen come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect word to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride now notice how he says that he's going to ask the question so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God hello which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins I'm going to tell you no matter what these Skeptics get behind this pulpit and gets on the uh uh uh social media and all that and try to tell you well brother Brandon get here and brother Brandon was just a man and it was just his opinion there and it was just his amen and causes you to start that in this message God has said a perfect word wow there is truly a perfect place and by him sending a perfect word he has intended it shows his intent that he has called you to that place can you say man he wouldn't prepare the perfect place if he didn't have means for you to come to a Perfection so you could go to that perfect place it's a perfect message and it's the Waters of separation you say Baptist no no Baptist no no Baptist Doctrine ain't Waters of Separation Pentecostal Doctrine ain't it ain't Waters of Separation this message is the water of separation can you say man that washes us from our sins that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it in the dripping bloody word the word of God bleeding blood see to wash the bride in what a Ministry now we've talked about there's the ministry of Angels in the ministry of the Holy Spirit brother Brown said see the angels of God are with us to minister spiritual blessings to us and to help us along the road and encourage us as we see the heel of Zion Yonder in sight amen and we talked about the the ministry of the angels and even even to this day there's there's there's uh uh UFOs unidentified objects and and it's becoming more uh prominence and it's having prominence within the media and all these things they don't know what they are amen it's a mystery to them and and they're worried about it and and all of these things and uh uh uh someone they had a uh uh someone in the in the in the uh high up of of the army General whatever and and he's it was there before uh a board of Congress or senate or whatever it was and and and they asked him how do you know how do you know that that that these ain't Russians or this ain't this or China or whatever how do you know he said well sir he says there ain't nothing like that that we man could ever come up with to make such an object as as what we've been seeing he says there ain't nothing human possible uh uh that that we could come up with that could go through a a a category 4 hurricane and stay right there and never move one one bit and and going right in the middle of it and staying right in the air and then all of a sudden just disappear he says it it just can't be and and all these things better profit in this age told us what it is they're investigating angels and he said in one of these days they're gonna pick you up and take you home and brother that is exciting to me that God still has the ministry of angels and they are with us they never leave us they're for us even the Bible says he'll give his angels charge over you they're ministering angels but God didn't have angels to die for us Angels don't live within us amen there's the ministry of the Holy Spirit can you say amen amen it all goes into the same uh the work but then there's the agency of man human agency brother Brown said God does nothing without human agency he said see he has to use someone God only speaks through human lips he made men his agency it's God working his way back into man to worship and be worshiped through man God's agency God does nothing outside of a man being his agent his helper ain't that right amen we look at Matthew 9 37 amen through 38 Jesus said to his disciples the Harvest truly is plentiful and but the labors are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth laborers into his Harvest well and and yet he was the lord of the Harvest ain't that right he's telling them now it's it's the the laborers are few pray pray to the Lord of the Harvest and yet he's the lord of the Harvest ain't that right but here's the prophet saying what he was saying to them is pray to me that I will send laborers into my Harvest which I'm just telling you it's such a needy thing but see part of it lays the inhuman beings he says see the kingdom of God lays within the human being so Jesus is telling them you ask me what I know that needs to be done he said but he couldn't do anything until they asked him can you say amen that's right God ain't going to bypass what he has already called to be part of his ministry people say well I don't need a preacher because I got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will lead you to one James 4 2 says you have not because you ask not ain't that right now notice what the prophet said he says he God made himself so bound together with man that he works only through the agency of man he chose man and veils himself inside see he hides himself from the unbeliever and reveals himself to who he will why because he hides himself through men in men work through men and in every generation everybody say every generation God speaks to his people through human lips he always chooses someone or something that he can use ain't that right another place brother Brown said God keeps his word now you think of that God keeps his word by representing himself through human agency amen God keeps his word by representing himself through human agency so then as we see amen through our opening scripture that that God that man does not and cannot operate on his own amen uh it's it's not whatever God has given you to do you ain't on your own you you can't say well I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that go ahead make up your plans but if you're a part of the ministry of God you've got to be surrendered to God because it's his ministry ain't that right see man the prophet said it's a failure to begin with he's only an agent to which God works through and God works his own will God works his own purpose not your purpose not my purpose God works his own purpose so then man as we see in our opening scripture man gets his commission from God God tells him what to say God tells him what to do and where to go that's why it's so important Amen to find out what God would want you to do and stay with it amen I I find a lot of people are just so unsettled Unfaithful and you can't find hardly anybody faithful today and it's it's because they're doing their own thing they want to do what they want to do they want to go where they want to go they want to see what they want to see they want to hear what they want to hear and and and it's what they want to do and and so but but if you're in the if if you're in the the the the the uh the ministry of God angels receive their commission from God ain't that right now I'll say it this way the Holy Spirit too which is God himself but he's on a commission he ain't here just to tickle your fancy he ain't here to do something that he ain't sent to do and the Bible says that when the spirit of truth comes he will lead you and guide you into all truth well it's true and you say well I got the Holy Ghost and you still wear your britches you women and you still cut your hair and you still leaning on the trinitarian doctrine and you're still this and you're still that that ain't what the Holy Ghost was sent to do he is on a direct commission from God can you say Amen it's true amen the Holy Ghost ain't here to lead you into man-made ideas it ain't here to lead you to into bondage it ain't here to keep you as a sinner amen a religion all religious people are most the time or just religious sinners and brother Brown said a religious spirit is the worst Spirit there is can't tell them they need the Lord can't tell them they need to go Amen to get up higher you can't set them free from the sins they get mad at you can you say Amen well it's it's just the truth but see the holy spirit is under commission and and every every human that is part of this this ministry of God the human agency has a commission as well ain't that right amen and this word commission is a commandment or decree amen uh Webster talking of commission said it's a formal written warrant granting the power to perform various Acts or duties an authorization or command to act in a prescribed manner or to perfect to perform prescribed acts ain't that right yes sir see so now what what makes this human agency of God a man uh different from denominations and seminaries and theologians and Etc well can I say it this way God never sent a man in theologians he don't work through theologians God never sent denomination he doesn't work through denominations he never sent seminaries he doesn't work through seminaries well yeah that's that's true so they're here without a commission amen but but we find what makes the human agency of God that is a part of his ministry different is in the message Messiah Amen brother Branham talks about us a man being Messiah it's can you say that with me Messiahs I am I'm a messiah it and the word Messiah is the anointed one which Jesus was the Messiah and he was anointed ain't that right amen so we are Messiah it's well what was it that made him the Messiah what made the Messiah well just go through some scriptures here John 1 14 the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us right the word everybody say the word was made flesh amen a second Corinthians 5 19 break it in God was in Christ everybody say God was in Christ amen uh Colossians 2 and 9 for in him everybody say in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily ain't that right in him well John 1 4 in him everybody say in him Amen in him was life and the life was the light of men ain't that right now so that was that's what made Messiah not a churchgoer not knowing the Scrolls not men able to memorize scripture not because he had uh uh uh a bachelor degree or some kind of a degree that didn't make him Messiah God was in Christ that word was made flesh amen predestination what God predestinated him to be became flesh amen now notice the prophet says he wasn't only word but he was God himself the Dynamics can you say that with me the Dynamics amen go go listen to uh it is the rising of the sun brother Brown talks about them Dynamics amen and he puts them Dynamics not in in a man of 2000 years ago he puts them same Dynamics in the church today yes sir see he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word now this saint this is the same formula that makes Messiah X ain't that right all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church amen so it isn't uh uh so so we're looking now amen that this is the day and age amen when this is being realized amen John 14 20 at that day this day the prophet declared it was this day amen you shall know that I am in my father you and me and I in you then you say man it's his ministry his agency this is the day of the manifestation of the sons of God Amen brother Brown said see what it is it's the spirit of God coming into these bins so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it will join him and his church together now can I say this that this is the day that there is no other Ministry outside of Christ's Ministry amen that's it's Christ's Ministry we're coming by a prophet coming so close that is joining us with Christ that by a prophet God spoke through him and called us miss Jesus Christ it ain't no other Ministry outside of Christ's Ministry now and we know we're here because the message of the the hour is a clear sign to us that we're here we don't regard this message just another one that Come Through the Ages we regard this as something else it's a sign it's a sign that every scripture that is purported to the bride is now here to be finalized how many scriptures have laid dormant has been brought to life in this age how many people just just just even even those that did not believe the message but were around brother Branham and and and seeing the ministry and things and and uh so many of them ministers uh uh says it reminded us of the Bible days we talked about it we talked about it we've seen you all that but now we've seen them amen everything we'd read about what Jesus did we saw it in this day amen it's just the truth amen so brother Brown said see uh uh one time he traveled speaking of God over the children of Israel in a pillar of fire when he settled on the mountain even nothing could touch it it had to be killed see if they did then he came down and lived in his son and he lived there man could touch him but he was virgin born see he gave his life his blood that the sexual born people could come back into fellowship and have fellowship with him and be part of him so it's God not in the pillar fire not God in Christ it's in you the god in that pillar fires in you the God in Jesus Christ is in you [Applause] this ministry has brought us to this place and it's the same formula same ingredient producing the same results the word made flesh in your skin Christ in you the hope of glory and Jesus said the words that I speak unto you their spirit and they are life so the word being spirit and life is Christ and you say man I hope you're getting following me now this the word your spirit in life he says I I'm the word right the word made flesh that word in the bride is spirit and life that's what Christ is the word spirit and life can you say Amen so now the message of the hour is Christ revealed do you believe that amen it wasn't just some uh a theologian it wasn't just some formal uh uh uh uh train of thought or or whatever it was Christ revealed both spirit and life the word made spirit and life praise the Lord when Jesus walked the Earth he had the spirit of God without measure if your brother Brown said now is now is or God is in you if you have the Holy Spirit God is in you in a portion but it was in him without measure he had the fullness of God in him but now it's measured out to each one see so so it's it's not uh uh one man that's why we do not we do not hang get hung up on personalities as much as great Ministries that we have we do not get hung up on one minister and build our faith upon his ministry now God sent a prophet to us all ain't that right and yet we do not get hung up on the on the man we hang our very Soul upon the message he brought ain't that right but it ain't God in in the fullness of God in one man I believe the fullness of God is in the church body and each one of us that are part of that body has a measure of the spirit of God it does not give us less power it does not give us less Authority it does not give us whatever or less ability than than he had can you say man it ain't that at all brother actually brother Brown said he's had more success in my this my Ministry than he had in his own Ministry when he walked the Earth this is the son of man Ministry same power can you say that with me same power same Ministry same anointing same Authority same works do you believe that same an awning not in a word begotten body not in a created body that was created in the womb of Mary but now in a redeemed body same Ministry in a redeemed body same an awning in a redeemed body same Works in a redeemed body [Applause] he's been accomplishing what he's wanted all along and here you are to prove it you are his victory that's what the prophet said you're his victory he died for this purpose you realize that he died for this purpose so what we are is is is God Christ in you and it's making him the same yesterday today and forever because it's proving by by working in human flesh our flesh that he hasn't changed today it's not the fullness of God again in one man but it's the fullness of God in his church but by the word being fully restored Christ has fully returned to his church by the word being fully restored Christ has fully returned to his church now I'm going to try to hurry now but brother Brown said here is the secret the word is in the bride the word in the church nope the word in the bride the word in the denomination no the word is in the bride ain't that right and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she does it in his name she has thus saith the Lord then it is germanized so the Holy Spirit uh Waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose they do only his will why he's able to have preeminence in the church in his body in a group of sex-born uh corruptable flesh and yet he's able to have preeminence in that body can you say man what is the greatest victory over the devil that God could have besides taking your vessel and having total preeminence to where they do only his will no one can persuade them any different they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his day can you say amen he did not complete everything in his day in it I did spoken of the Messiah of first coming but there was another Ministry to come that spoke of the Bride ain't that right and here he is in this age we are flesh of his flesh born of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him she is him [Music] why would God make us Messiahs because he got a commission it's the commission it's the commission he gave us can you say man second Corinthians 5 20 says now then we are ambassadors for Christ and what is an ambassador acting or a it's an it's one acting for or a representative acting as or a representative so then we see that this Ambassador represents only one he doesn't represent another or speak for another he he doesn't promote something else he isn't a double agent or double tongue or whatever you want to call it Matthew 12 25 Jesus says every Kingdom divided against itself uh uh is brought to Desolation amen and every city or house divided against itself it shall not stand ain't that right now see so then the Church of God cannot be divided or worked contrary to the will of God can't do it not the ministry of God Amen because that would that would mean that his purpose would be annihilated ain't that right his purpose would come to not we look we look at just in the natural amen when when it's it's not the it's not the the the foreign countries that are killing America is the fighting with him it's the division within America can you say Amen that's right it's the it's the worm at the core of the Apple a man see so we we looked at an and every Ambassador in the natural that stands for uh uh their country they must be totally convinced of the one or uh of uh that he or she is representing a man an ambassador who goes into foreign countries they're representing their own country they speak for their own country and all the power of that country is behind them ain't that right so so I looked it up Ambassador it's the highest ranking think of that of the highest ranking person who represents his or her own government while living in another country amen see and and this government see they represent their own government and government is the continuous exercise of authority ain't that right they're the highest ranking person God doesn't beat someone that uh uh or or or or or or whatever the the the the the United States ain't gonna pick just some low bum or or some home whatever you understand what I'm saying amen but he's going to be they picked the the right one and put them in the highest ranking uh position to represent them in other foreign countries [Music] it's true and then they they have to stand by it amen the government has to stand by it well the government is a continuous exercise of authority amen so there's an authority behind the behind that Ambassador so the Ambassador is the mouthpiece or the voice of his own government he speaks in the name of his government ain't that right I I think it was uh Alaska that that uh was was to be bought was up for sale and and there there was a representative I think it was Steward Seward and and it's I believe it's known as Seward's folly but they came uh I believe it was the Russians that did not want Alaska but as as I've read the uh they they uh they didn't want it really it was to them or to anyone Alaska was just peace that they didn't no one wanted but they they offered a a fairly cheap price and so Seward uh it was in the meeting with him and he tried to call back home and he couldn't get a hold of anyone uh uh and and some reason couldn't get connected or whatever so he spoke as an ambassador and he told him we'll take it we want it and so they signed the papers and all that and when he got home they're like we don't want Alaska what are you doing well you can get a hold of you and the United States government had to back up that word because they sent him as a representative ain't that right now if they if they're going to do that in the natural now it's not that we can't get a hold of God all that because the prophet says that we have the mind of God and we do only his will you understand what I'm saying but so you're here in direct commission knowing the will of God and I want to say this and that's why it's so important for prayer we know a lot of times we know the will of God you hear the message and and the message and I know I'm gonna be honest and as I've told you before the message covers it all it covers everything if if you really just have an open heart the message covers it it'll cover your personal life it it covers how you should be a father how you should be a mother how how you should be deacons how you should be young people it it I mean it covers all aspects of everything how you should look for a a spouse uh uh how you should conduct yourself it conducts it how deacons should be how how how you know everything it just as pastors should be and ministers and da da you just everything so the will of God is made known and a lot of times even in our personal uh situations that we're we're dealing with like like where to move and what to do and and all these things amen there's there's you should never act on anything uh unless you have Direction I mean clear Direction now I know that it was you know the we throw these Saints well it's the will of God yeah the Lord told me the Lord told me and and you know good and well it's not the will of God it's it's just it's it's just really you know we've been taught never act out of discouragement never make decisions out of discouragement because most of the time you're going to make the decisions never never act when when you're going through turmoil in your life never make decisions because you're going to make the wrong ones half the time [Music] you say man Drew you get unhappy you're going hey churches have rough times not everybody's on the Mountaintop at church when you go to church most of the time you're going to see everybody's ugliness the more you hang around people the more we Fellowship you're going to see everybody's ugliness yeah you ain't always going to see that individual just sitting there and say amen amen praise God preach you start hanging around them outside the church and ain't always doing that right [Applause] wasn't born at you we all know no just joking and so the the but not everybody's going to be doing that so you're going to see the ugly side you're going to see the the the the backside behind your parts ain't that right been in all the mess of that you come to church you say oh man this is such a Godly church this is such a everybody's just so loving hang around and I I'd like to say everybody's loving all the time but that ain't true ain't that right people start out of church oh this is just a God thing man God sent me here give it a couple years then see how you think man I don't know I just don't know hey preacher won't shake my hand no more and and everybody just I just don't know well what happened same preacher yes same people same views same message and you say Amen then all of a sudden you start getting unhappy it's not like well maybe I need to go somewhere else it's in them times you better hang in there better be faithful better just stay with what God you really knew that God called you because the winds are going to change again winds are going to blow seas are going to change ain't that right then you're going to say then then you're gonna come back say man something's changed for them they're all kind again they're all loving I think the Lord really wants me to stay after all well give us some more time when's it gonna blow again but what's happened we understand that it's a will of God and we remain in the will of God regardless it's the same thing with marriage give it some time you butterflies when you first met her and you first met him it's all gooey get married just give it time you have to pick up a socks and you know how it is man he's sitting back home so mama can train him how to clean house foreign but when it's all said and done the wind's going to change again you're going to find out you love them better than you ever did ain't that right through all the ups and downs through all the nonsense or all the disappointments and all that and even the prophet tells you you're going to have disappointments that give it time can you say Amen we're not a people that just blows with the Wind we're a people that is set here to do the will of God and if it's God's will we'll do God's Will and only his will and we get to the place where Satan don't know what to do with this I send him a trial I send them through hurricanes I send them through tornadoes I sit everything their way and they still remain then we begin to understand the scripture he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved endure can you say Amen you endure and that's what makes pillars in a church that's what makes Faithful Men and that's what Paul told Timothy commit this into Faithful Men commit it and a prophet didn't just preach a message just for it to go when he died he committed to Faithful Men faithful women faithful young people that's going to remain in this message Stay True to this message regardless of what comes it's the message that must endure that was free so we speak the Ambassador the ambassador of the United States his word is the word of the United States notice he represents the mindset the position the attitude and the authority of the United States and you say man an ambassador of America would be a poor excuse for an ambassador if he didn't know who he represented and how to represent his Nation ain't that right if he didn't know what his his Nation stood for how could he be an ambassador see so then his Ambassador is the attitude of the USA or his attitude his authority his words his action his message comes from the USA he's an ambassador of America ain't that right to see him is to see the government of the United States to hear him is to hear the government of the United States to befriend him is to befriend the government of the United States see so if you want to get acquainted with the ways with the attitude with the The Authority the power of the United States government get to know the Ambassador he'll tell you what they are he'll represent them can you say Amen oh my brother Brown said if the president of the United States would make me an ambassador to Germany my words then in Germany would be exactly what the president told me to say and if I said them what he told me to say then everything that's in the United States is behind them words oh we're just talking and that government is rotten not governmental compromise that government will leave you out in the in the desert sometimes and just to cover their hide they'll act like they don't know you but now we're going to talk about God can you say Amen we're talking about a faithful God a faithful that will endure a faithful that'll see his word through and if you stand behind his word he'll see you through if you're standing upon his word and you're declaring him and you're representing him he will not let you down he has sent angels to stand by you to protect you to guard you I've thought about America brother Branham how to go and Beyond and out in other countries and he said there'd be snipers out there with her guns and right at him he talked about it the third sniper he's the devil's after me on every end remember them which doctors that got out there and stood outside that tent and started working up a storm remember he said likely to blow that storm but he didn't worry he was an ambassador and he began to pray and God drove that storm away the devil was defeated why he represented a government that was higher than any other government yeah now notice Colossians 3 17 is this okay amen Colossians 3 17 says whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus brother Branham talking about that time he went to that um uh man I don't know what that that individual was called uh uh hypnosis or something and and but anyway there she that lady raised the table up in the air and then she challenged anyone to come and knock that table off in some big old bruisers man muscled up guys said we could do that and then went over there and they couldn't get it down they'd trying to get it down and brother Branham uh had went there to see what it was all about and and I know he was I know he was led of the Lord to go there and and as he's watching and he realized it was demon power that was at work and that demon power recognized him in the audience amen but said and challenged him and says I I heard you're a minister she says I challenge you to come and knock this off I put this table out of there and put it on the ground and he he says well and and something to the fact uh says they tell me you're a preacher and and she said what do you think this is and he said I said it's the devil and she said well if you got so much power then knock it down he says I do not have power he says but I represent one who does see that that's the difference ain't that right that's why you'd never have to back down to the devil I don't care what it is that the devil is messing with your family if the devil's messing with your children if the devil's messing with the church if the devil if the devil's messing with you something in your job and the devil's trying to get you fired and the devil's trying to amen and you recognize what that power is coming from you don't have to get mad at the boss you don't have to get mad at your wife you don't have to get mad at your husband you don't have to get mad at your children you don't have to get mad at the preacher you don't have to get mad at nobody except you recognize that it's the devil trying to come in and challenge you to see where you are be as a representative of Heaven you've got every Power and that's what that's what brother Brown see he says in the name of the father son of Holy Ghost I command you and that chair or that table never come down he said in the name of whatever William Branham you come down and it never happened and he says he says then I said and I command that table to fall in the name of Jesus Christ and he said he'll lock the broke off all four legs off that table as I slammed on the floor I'm telling you the devil recognizes the representatives of this message of the name of Jesus Christ can you say amen I believe that do you believe that yes sir he recognizes the name of Jesus [Music] he recognizes the name of Jesus I remember one man talking and and you you you young people never get involved in it don't ever try it but a man that had just become a Christian he had he had been involved in Witchcraft and and things like that and and there was an eight ball his friends brought over an eight ball and they were trying to get him to get back into it and he said no he said I'm I'm I'm I'm a Christian I'm a Believer and and he said well let me try something and so he he they were asking questions and it would it would answer back and he recognized he knew that there was a power of an of a demon and he put there and he says is Jesus Christ Lord of all and he says that thing shot across the room and he put it back on there and he started asking questions and it would answer and he says again I ask you is Jesus Christ Lord of all it fell went across the room see the devil knows exactly he knows who a Believer is he knows who Jesus Christ is and when brother Branham said you are Miss Jesus Christ he wasn't just throwing that out there every Power Of Heaven is behind you it represents you you don't have to walk if you don't have to be discouraged you don't have to question God you don't have to moan and groan stand in your position as the ministry of Christ can you say Amen why amen your children are yours [Music] you believe that now notice Jesus Christ was an ambassador of Heaven amen he was God's agent brother Brown said that for God so loved the world that He Sent His only begotten son he sent them ain't that right he come to save he come to set captives free he come to heal he come to redeem and God said God determined that every name written in the Lamb's Book of Life would be delivered you believe that I still hold to that do you yes sir I believe that I still hold to that and Jesus said all power both in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me see you can't get to God without the son you can't get to heaven without the son he's an ambassador you can't get saved without the son your sins cannot be put in God's sea of forgetfulness without the son you will not be in the first resurrection without the son that's why Psalms 2 12 says kiss the son lest he be angry and you perish from the way make him welcome entertain him ain't that right yes sir well then what about God's Ambassador today well in Luke 13 35 Jesus says behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily I say unto you you shall not see me until you until the time come when you shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord now I believe this scripture is applicable to this age of laodicea for Malachi 4 5 says behold God says I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord ain't that right now now it'll be through the ministry of Elijah that the son of man would be revealed but the people will not see him see Christ until they can say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord why God sent a representative in this age kiss the Sun lest he be angry you see I ain't worshiping a man hey we don't worship a man you say Amen that we recognized by saying blessed you see that cometh in the name of the Lord we recognize we can see Christ in the message can you say amen that's right and and and and what about each of us who are part of God's Ministry today see the ministry doesn't stop with brother Branham no sir I know there's people that's waiting for the return Ministry bless your hearts amen and and what what else do you do just sit around and wait for him to come everything that is that brother bran wants to do is it's done not lays on your hands it lays on us can you say amen that's exactly right see and so now we we find that John 20 21 says Jesus said as my father hath sent me so send I you oh God doesn't send anyone without a commission and he says as my father sent me now I'm going to send you in the same manner ain't that right brother Brown said how did the father send him he went with him and was in him ain't that right he was with him and went in it was in him that's how the father said to him and that's how Christ sends you ain't that right at that day you'll know that I'm in the father and you in me and I in you ain't that right see and there will be no guesswork there will be no wondering for you shall know what a revelation is this all right so here's give you some scriptures Mark 16 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that is baptized believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned do you realize that that that by your very words and I don't believe it's just the faithful Ministry I believe it's I believe it's it's everyone part of the ministry of God Amen that he that believeth and is baptized by your words amen uh uh uh I shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and notice and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover can you say Amen do you realize that you as a Believer how many believers do we have you can put yourself right in that scripture brother Brown was very adamant about this scripture belonging in this age to the Church of the Living God ain't that right John 14 12 verily verily Jesus said I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also now is there some that apply that to brother just being to brother Branham that's a lie you go look brother Brown never taught it that way he said it's the believer Jesus was talking to them that believe can you say amen he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask the father in my my name amen I will do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it and he come in his father's name Matthew 18 and 18 verily verily I or verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven ain't that right Matthew 21 21 Jesus answered and said unto them verily I say unto you if you have faith and doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree but also if you shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things everybody say all things whatever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive you know the heavenly father knows exactly what you have need of but he asked that you have to ask him for it that's where people amen you have not because you ask not that's why the devil gets us away from prayer so much we've groan about it we talk about it we complain about it that's not what God asked you to do he asked you to ask him and brother Brown said ask big ask for big things don't limit God can you say man Luke 10 17 behold I give unto you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you do you believe that he's talking to every representative of his so God doesn't put you into his ministry and give you a commission only to leave you helpless and you say man and I say to you if you're part of the Church of the Living God you are part of his ministry you're part of his ministry he sent you for a work and if you are his agent then you have power over the enemy do you believe that oh my I'm closing now but brother Bram talks about the law of inheritance and and and it's in the Book of Ruth that if any man if a man lost his inheritance It could only be Redeemed by Kinsmen and no one else but a close Kinsman could redeem that inheritance and I I thought of that and of course he he's always applied that to Jesus Christ being our Kinsmen Redeemer and all that but then then he he he says this this this quote that I'm going to read you and I thought wow and we've read the quote many times but after he's saying this that no one else but a close Kinsman could redeem that inheritance he says now let me just drop a little token here that I touched on the other night to you mothers he said how many has prayed for your loved ones that are lost all right there you are again your inheritance and you say that with me my inheritance he's talking about Kinsmen a man that had lost his inheritance can you say man see now notice how he's putting that he says now Paul told the Roman believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved man I think that's so powerful why would God send us put us in the message just to sit here and cry over Satan just mess with our families nope he's put you in a position of authority it's true notice believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved if you've got faith enough for yourself to be saved have faith enough no matter how Wayward that boy is or that girl is they'll be saved anyhow Kinsmen can you say man God somehow if he has to lay them on their back laying there in a hospital dying they'll be saved I won't say to you young people you ought to thank God every day to have Christian parents that believe this message you ought to be thankful to God that you've got parents that believe this and hold this and will not compromise that they have enough faith for themselves in this message that they can have faith enough for you to keep praying for you to believe for you can you say Amen oh yes sir see says if he has to lay them on their back laying there in the hospital hospital dying they'll be saved God promised it it's the inheritance The Inheritance and they shall now he goes to scripture and they shall be there said Isaiah and all their offsprings with them they shall not hurt nor destroy and my Holy Mountain saith the Lord can you say man what is he he's talking about a mindset yeah he was an ambassador representing the mindset the attitude the thoughts of God God put this law of inheritance and now he's telling the prophet is telling you this is God's law for you this is God's law to you that no matter how Wayward and how badly they are you believe enough for yourself believe for them keep believing keep believing you say man it's looking impossible keep believing amen because we represent the power of our government now Isaiah 9 6 we all know he talks about it but in that one place he says the government everybody say the government shall be upon his shoulders the government shall be up on his shoulder you realize that's talking to you and I that's referring to us the church because notice the spoken word is the Original Seed 62. the government shall be upon his what shoulder that's part of his body that's his body his shoulders is his body and Paul tells us who his body is the church which is the fullness of him and what we've seen in this age was the head the headship up in the clouds brother Brown said that was the face of Jesus Christ that was the head coming to what his Earthly body where is the government on Earth at in his body Saints shall judge the Earth that right Paul said I dare you to go to court with one another and not take it before the church see Saints shall judge the Earth where is the government going to be upon he upon his shoulders his body the government up on his shoulders that's part of the body what is it his Earthly strength God's Earthly strength is his word made flesh in his body here on Earth bringing the past can you say Amen do you love him isn't he wonderful brother and Paul brother Brown said and that's where the real Church speaks in his power there's where the apostolic power returns to the church when the government shall be upon his shoulders judgment and I say we're here you have every right and the authority to serve notice on the devil oh yeah all right amen if the musicians will come we find that the natural church is devoid of the power and life of God and that's the condition that they're in today and brother Branham said the church has turned the people over to the doctors especially psychiatrists how can I prayed about being spiritually rich or Rich spiritually is more than I know they are bankrupt and don't know it but another place he said God sent Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends toward Dogma Creeds and not simple word so therefore they can no longer speak for God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation now notice took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation the method has failed God raised up others and so it's gone throughout the years until in this last day there is again another people that's you in the land who under their messenger now what's happening they're receiving the Revelation his Revelation they're receiving it and under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is it's it's its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride then you say man for the voice of God will be in her and I want to say this you're part of the ministry that the prophet brought because you have received his revelation you haven't received no nothing else you don't need the psychologists you don't need Dr Dobson and you don't need any of these other guys I appreciate him they're doing they're doing something you know and and doing great things but it's not for the bride never be ashamed of this message never never never never I don't I don't care how many people turn away you young people on the job School wherever you're going to be off but never never let your don't hide your light don't be afraid to tell someone God sent a prophet and tell them where that is I mean we ain't Joseph Smith and all that stuff we ain't we ain't believing all that nonsense we can tell you God told us he had sinned a prophet he told us and we believe that God sent him and it was so Vindicated to God this isn't just a a a something that's made up and it's not something that you just believed uh because you're raised in it this is something that's been proven to you God sent a prophet God sent a prophet you believe that and it's been Vindicated over and over and over and over don't be ashamed to tell people don't hide it amen I love the Lord greater is he that is in me than he that is he that is in me greater receive d see that is in me than he that is in first verse all Satan's like the roaring lion home until seeking whom he may devour the Bible tells the soul God has promised us today is Overcoming By I say greater received oh greater greater than he that is a rushing Mighty Wind you into the room baptized or with the power greater than any Earthly fold I'm so glad that I've got it too I'm gonna let the world know I say greater receipt that is in me God is greater he is in the greater is he that is in me the land he that is in the world will now Satan's like a roaring line roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour the Bible tells me so many Souls have been his prey they've been deceived and they fell in a weak hour oh but God has promised us today Hallelujah we are his eternal thoughts and greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me oh greater is he that is in me oh sing it one more time I'd say greater you see all greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world can you Worship the Lord and praise him blessed be his name blessed be his name hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my I say to you preachers keep preaching singers keep singing testifiers keep testifying mothers keep

give you honor I give you praise you are the lights are true I bless your name I bless they just play Softly again we want to just thank all of our visitors for coming and making it a special day yesterday for Anne and I know she was certainly grateful too have everyone and even though it was hot it was fun and been out in that heat all day I was so tired that I went to bed and I actually thought everyone was going to bed and Heather went downstairs and everybody was in the living room enjoying themselves and like I'm going to bed and I slept great so but it must have been that sun that just uh tired but anyways we really enjoyed you coming and being part of it and having you at the house and again Jamie it's really good to have you and and several would be traveling home today and so we want to just keep them in our prayers they would be traveling and as we announced last week that we're only having one service today and for young people young couples and as well we'll be having a Bible study at the house about 7 30 tonight we'll be doing it around the campfire and so if you all want to do that question and answers if you've got any questions you'd like to ask but we'll try to to answer them the best we know how and uh we'll also be fixing some food for tonight and and just have a wonderful time of Fellowship and so really looking forward to that and got had many uh good reports about last Sunday night of of how we had the kind of changed up things in the service and I really enjoyed it and Lord willing we'll try to do that again here soon also we're going to be starting next Sunday night having more of it you're getting youth more involved so you'll have different musicians up here different song leader and uh it's going to be a good time and anyways looking forward to that as well I think our youth are special and to try to get them involved as much as we can and train them up now and as you know you may not be here all the time and the Lord could take us home any moment but I was listening to brother Branham and I think it's important that we all would go back and listen to that tape taking sides with Jesus in 62 just before in time of evangelism and brother Branham really talks about our duties as as parents Elders everything and that making the way and reserving that for our youth and and I think that's so important and so uh anyways may God bless you and love you appreciate you very much and also we want to remember brother Joe Greene's meeting that is starting this Tuesday through Friday and so if you're able to I know you'd be blessed brother Andrew Glover and brother Ron Spencer will be ministering that and and so that meeting has snuck up on me and that I sometimes tell me that starts this Tuesday as a coal mine and so anyways if you're able to go I know you'd be blessed and you would be a blessing to the church there as well so we appreciate brother Joe and all that he's doing and so God bless you let's just bow our heads and word of prayer brother Makai you want to dismiss a prayer foreign [Music]
