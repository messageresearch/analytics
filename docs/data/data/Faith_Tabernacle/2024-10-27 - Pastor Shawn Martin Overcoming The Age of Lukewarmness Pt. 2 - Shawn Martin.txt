1/2 days to come back we didn't try to rush it although you know you like to get to your destination in a timely fashion but God was merciful and uh we we just God just worked everything out we we had a place to stay we didn't have to stay in a hotel because that would have you you could just about imagine for 10 11 days it would have been a huge but uh brother open brother and sister open up their

uh God was good in the fact that I didn't lose my voice and uh one of the things that I prayed about which which can happen every evangelist every preacher that goes somewhere to preach and you got a bunch of meetings that are Clos together my desire was Lord may not May the inspiration flow as strong as it does at the beginning that the last sermon that I had to bring on last Sunday afternoon I had two Services 1 in the morning at one church and then that afternoon in the city of Winnipeg but God just come on the scene and he was able to I I felt the anointing come down on me the inspiration the word open up Divine illumination struck the congregation and several folks come up for prayer last Sunday in both Services asking God for uh his help and but I really thank you all for praying for us your concern and so forth like that God just really moved for us amen and somebody asked me last night well you glad to be back well I said you know in one way I am but in another way I'm I would have liked to have stayed out on the field because the greatest satisfaction on I have is bringing consolation an encouragement to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and doing what I can in my little way that God has given me may I never fall short on anything even though I feel many times like a teaspoon compared to some Ministries and I don't want to compare myself we should never compare oursel to other Ministries but sometimes I feel very small but it's like I told them up there if I have a a teaspoon believe you me I'm going to show it out to you amen God God help me if I don't if he gave me

prayer in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord if you'd have your Bibles we're going to turn to um uh Revelations the 3rd Chapter and uh while you're turning we want to remember our fall festival next Sunday and um uh so we will not be having service here uh we'll be having it there at the Smith Creek Farms and at the same time 11:00 and um so uh just remember that and looking forward to a wonderful time in the Lord a wonderful time of fellowship and um amen and so um we always just have a a wonderful time and it's uh we get U different ones come in and and get to fellowship with them and you know uh there's no place uh no other people really to Fellowship uh that I like uh most of all and that's just a fellowship around the bride of Christ and uh we' got friends everywhere that we love to fellowship with and I'm sure you got co-workers and things that you like to fellowship with but there's just something that when you can Fellowship around Believers and have uh among like Precious Faith ain't that right and so uh but Revelations the 3 chapter and uh the 14th verse and it says uh unto the angel of the Church of the lay Osan write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would Thou Art cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth amen then if you'll turn with me the Romans we read this actually last Wednesday Romans the 12th chapter and um going to read uh the first two verses says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen you can have your seats and um I uh just had this uh thought on my mind and um um if I could use the title again overcoming the age of lukewarmness and it's um been just a a thought that has been on my heart and so I want to just bring it to you and um but we know that that God has uh seven allotted to the Gentiles seven Church ages and uh which is a a span of time in which God uh has set aside to uh form a bride um and and this time is not our time but it's God's time it's it's God's set time that he has allotted himself to to uh make a bride for Christ and you remember he promised that he would take a a people out of the Gentiles uh for for his name and so as we know it is it it it took God 4,000 years to to make the Masterpiece the first Masterpiece which was Jesus Christ and um uh of course Adam uh was was the Masterpiece but uh we're talking about the bride of Christ and and and the bride groom and so uh the then the the Bride is a masterpiece just as Jesus was the Masterpiece and as it took God 4,000 years to make the the the the groom Masterpiece it has taken him the prophet said nearly uh 2,000 years uh to make the bride Masterpiece and so the church ages is God's time um that uh he will fulfill his purpose and plan and it's it's not about our time to fulfill our plans and our purpose that's why we we didn't need to be in in all the church ages ourselves because that's not our time but but God's been through all the churches ages it and he's been working through all the church ages because it's his time and and so it it takes a spiritual insight to understand that that through the church ages God has been doing something he's been uh uh carrying out his purpose and his plan and uh if if if a man doesn't know what God has been doing then it it just looks like church history it just looks like like world events world history um you know and and that that would just be a carnal view of things and well then you know uh uh history doesn't have a spiritual significance to the unbeliever at all he just looks at what's been done and and and you know uh and more than likely well he just continues in a cycle and and we see that's what's been happening is just a cycle uh uh of of uh Church cycle of of things and and so uh but we know we know that that if if we're looking at what God's plan is and God's purpose history is not repeating itself uh not not with God but God is actually making something it's so so the church ages isn't just about man uh wandering in time just just you know happy go-lucky and doing the best we can but actually God is coming up to something he's he's he's doing something and so time time is not just going to continue on as as though we you know not not we per se but man human Humanity just lives as though time is just going to continue and there there's no stopping point and and so uh um and and and so uh uh and and and the unbeliever somehow thinks that America is just going to continue on and and they they think that there's hope for the world meaning that it can and will be a better place and and so they they're that's why they're indulging in in politics and they're they're saying this is the the the most important uh election that uh ever in history because because they know that it's you know it's a we're at a pivotal point and and they're wanting to keep America going they want to keep everything you know and and they know that that uh we're at the verge of crumbling and and and they know that but they don't know why they they know and they so so they're spending all their Investments and and putting in billions of dollars for the right candidate that they think is the right candidate uh so they can keep uh uh democracy and and preserve things and this and that and and it looks fine it looks good and and as and how true it is uh we've heard brother Braham say it but how in real true it is uh now that everybody's looking for a messiah they're they're looking for a messiah but why are they looking for a messiah to fix America to fix World governments to fix things to fix home life to fix to fix the problem s man's going insane we need somebody to fix this you know and and so so they they they want to fix it so we can keep on living in time and that cycle of time just to keep on going see but they don't know that God is finishing up his bride that's what the church Ages was about that God could have a bride for Christ and and and so God is Not concerned about America continuing to be a super Nation he's he's not concerned about who who gets in politics and he already knows who's going to be in politics he already knows who's going to be the president and that and whoever is going to be is going to fulfill his plan but I guarantee you it's not going to affect what he's doing it it's it's just not it's going to go right along with what he's doing and this is why we as Believers are de prayed thy kingdom come come thy will be done in in Earth as it is in heaven not my will but thine be done because God's will is what's important not my will not your will you you you could have plans and dreams and all that but you know I was thinking of of brother Anthony that just passed away 45 years old young man my wife 30 years old that passed away and plans and dreams and and these things but that doesn't matter God has a plan and and we we have to build our lives around God's plan God's will God's desire and and we don't want to walk outside of that see we want to be part of his plan I I I I don't want to be part of my plan and and you don't want to be part of my plan I don't want to be part of your plan you if you understand what I'm saying I I want to be part of God's plan that is the most important thing that we must be part of is we want to be part of this bride because when it's all said and done those that are not part of that bride is going to be Canon fod it's just facts there's some billions of people on this Earth that are just Canon fod you know they they just they're going for tribulation that's that's the facts and only those that are in this bride part of God's plan is is going to be in the Rapture and and so God is not concerned about some politician or religious organiz ation bringing World Peace amen that's not the peace you know they're crying for World Peace but you know what every believer should already have peace they should already have that anchor in their soul you know you uh you know what I mean he says I give you peace that the world cannot give so so you know so then the church ages is known as the fullness of the Gentiles the chch seven churches that John addressed as we talked Wednesday night were Gentile churches uh he did not address John didn't address uh the the the church at Jerusalem for that was a Jewish church mostly made up of Jews and and God had already turned to the Gentiles uh uh and and and uh turned his back to the Jews see and and so um uh now we we find that the Jews were allotted by God 71 weeks and and the prophet tells us that one week is seven years one week equals 7 years and so with in that 70 we period uh uh then then God deals with the Jewish people it it's a it was a time of Grace for them and and as we know the prophet said that 69 of those 70 weeks were already used up uh when when Christ come up on the earth and and then Christ and and Daniel even talked about that Messiah would be cut off in the middle of the week well Messiah uh Christ uh he prophesied for three and a half years and then was cut off and and and then uh uh uh uh God turned to the Gentiles which leaves uh the Jews uh uh uh three and a half years left of time of Grace ain't that right but see the three and 1/2 years does not start until the times of the Gentiles is fulfilled and and see as the prophet taught us that God doesn't deal with the Gentiles and the Jews at the same time even when Jesus sent his disciples out in the time that he was ministering to the Jews and part of that 70 weeks he told the disciples don't even go to the Gentiles don't don't go there it wasn't their time yet uh uh uh go to the Jews and and and uh uh these things so he never performed the Messiah signed to the Gentiles amen but but ain't that amazing that in the time of the Gentiles we have received the same sign that the Jews received that's to me that's that's that's that's Grace that's just Grace and and so uh uh and and and so we we find uh that that uh uh it was a time of Grace for the Jews at that time and so now the seven Church ages is the dispensation of grace in which God deals with that Gentile race that's us that's a that's who we are the gentile people and and it's a time of Grace for the Gentiles think of that now a time of Grace it's not a time of legalism it's a time of Grace it's it's not a time of law it's a time of grace and the prophet said as long as as that last as long as that time of Gentiles lasts God will still call men and women to his service amen and that's what we're believing that that there's still a little Grace somehow that that causes that's why we go out and try to win souls that's why we try to tell people about God Amen because we're believing that there's still Grace for them the Gentile church amen see uh but but we we know that uh uh the Le oosa age is the last Church Age and and uh you know um and and and seven is God's completed number it's seven is God's number of completion it's not our number it's God's number ain't that right and and and so we we find that it's been God's countdown every Church age God's countdown Amen brother brah said you know man counts down down to 10 you know and he goes from 10 backwards but God started from one all the way to seven amen countdown now uh Church we're we're at the end of that it's no more numbers to be counted they've been counted it's time for Blast Off amen see astronaut age that's that's the thing see and and so uh uh but the Rapture takes place when the church ages have run out Amen brother Bram said see the Rapture will come and the Gentile age will cease see so let me ask you why does the the Rapture take place well there's going to be billions of people still with their own ideas and they're plan and they're not looking for Rapture they don't want Rapture really uh uh if it was up to them they like I said would continue on living life trying to fix world problems you know and trying to pick the best candidate and and and and and and and these things that so so why does the the the Rapture take place is it because man is finished with his work on Earth no I I is it because the politicians have solved the world problems no is it because the church amen has been able to convert the whole world no see so that's not why the Rapture takes place the Rapture takes place when God is finished with his project not when man is finished with his there's not going to be one part of God's plan left undone when this Rapture takes place in other words every predestinated seat of God is going to be in that body when the Rapture takes place it won't come any sooner it won't come any later amen it's just because the the there see when God gets his plan finished there's no need need to hang around you understand what I'm saying amen you might have been saved 20 years ago but but God didn't take you then amen he's waiting for that last one he's waiting for the Perfection of the Saints amen that body to come to what he is after and then God will take us home a ain't that right so so the New Birth the prophet said is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth and now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in harmony not when everyone is perfect in Harmony on the on the uh political candidate amen that they want not when everybody is is perfectly in Harmony in what church they belong to or such and such perfectly in harmony see uh uh uh where the Revelation is perfect perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day amen now I think he said that in 63 now look where we're at today I I have to tell you I just believe that there is a church that is knowing their position I just believe that and and uh uh it it it really struck me um uh with on a Minister's chat and someone put a minister put up a quote aen I think brother brandom said when you get to the when uh I I don't want to uh I'm going to paraphrase but he says basically when you get to God and and when you really get sold out to God then God can use you and and uh something to that effect and and and another brother he you know he just put up and he says well I'm I'm so glad that I am sold out to God I'm so glad I and at first it took me back like oh man that's pretty bold but I thought no that's the way we ought to be that's the way every believer ought to be is I'm so glad I'm sold out to God in other words God is using me in this age God is using me amen that wasn't a proud statement that wasn't boasting that's exactly where we're supposed to be if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is can you say amen amen if God uses you you ought to know that ain't by accident that's exactly what he called you for amen and whatever uh uh uh uh uh a plan that he has for you and so see she knows she knows she's coming to that realization of who she is in God she knows she doesn't belong out in that world she knows that this word is to manifest in her life she knows it and she stands by confident that she is called for this age see the bride is the only one out of this age that is not in confusion amen see amen she's the only one that's out of this confusion look at the confusion that we have today amen the home is full of confusion men doesn't know their place women don't know their place children don't know their place and and and and so uh uh man and and and wife woman they they they they refus to know their role in the home they they they brought such a confusion motherhood and and and fatherhood is is such confusion Society is full of confusion women want to be like men men want to be like women you know I we we uh and and by the way I really enjoyed the uh brother's Fellowship uh thank you for those that have come that came last night it was wonderful but on the way to to the place I I literally I just you know that it blew my mind had saw this tall guy with a miniskirt on with lit Tarts and and dress totally dressed like a woman and he was walking with a beautiful girl a real pretty girl and it and she just laughing with him just like like it was no problem you know and I'm like you know something wrong here you know used to we wouldn't want to be identified with that stuff you know you get across the street I'll stay over here but but it's coming to a confusion people's minds are confused see and so so uh you know Prophet talked about women wanting to be like men they they they they want to cut their hair they want to wear in the men's clothing and men going around wearing the women's arm uh undergarments you know what a woman's undergarment is it shorts that's what a prophet said so so when someone tells you that that's not what that means you better listen to what a prophet said men aren't to wear shorts it's a woman's undergarment can you say amen and and so but but see it has opened up a door of confusion and and to where the children you know uh we have children identifying themselves as a cat or or some other animal and and and you know we we have men identifying as a woman and and women identifying as a man and and they're they're getting into the sports and you know the problems that they're having today men you know identifying as a woman wanting to play in women's sports and and and they're taking all the medals and all of these things I mean come on man it it's sick you know but but that's that the world is crazy it's confusion you don't know who to believe anymore I I don't anyways and the prophet said that's where we've come to is we don't know who to believe wh which candidate do you really believe come on now I mean they're given the promises but how can they fulfill them amen and and and what this and what that see but the church is so full of confusion the doctor has become their absolute politicians have become their savior you know and the Sinners want to identify as a Christian but but nothing has changed them it's it's it's like the man putting on a a mini dress and and skirt and all that thing and and but it doesn't make him a woman and so is it when Sinners try to be Christians and and it's the same perversion it's a spirit of perversion you know and and uh uh I I just you know anyways it it just it's sickening you know and and so you you got Sinners that are you know claiming to be Christians but they act like the world smell like the world talk like the world and church we we got to a place the church is is full churches are full there's no rugged Faith anymore there's no prayer life anymore there's no Holiness anymore and and and even in our message ranks amen Holiness is dying it's dropping slowly amen and I'm not talking about you know being so far over there I'm just saying pre preach what brother Brandon preached live the way he lived amen if you just do that you you you'd put your skirts down a little longer amen you you would raise up the the the blouse a little little higher you know uh uh these things but there's no Zeal for the word of God everybody's got excuses today as to why they can't come to church and why they can't do this and why and they expect you they expect you to believe it well I don't have to believe your excuse I've got a Bible right here that tells me I've got a message that tells me that your condition is backslid condition you understand what I'm saying amen I had a man tell me just out the door that the Lord told him it was okay to smoke and it was okay to drink I told him you're just a liar I mean let's just look at it he I've been in the message all these years for 10 years I said you're a liar God would never tell you to do something like that when a prophet says that even a woman or a person that is smoking cigarettes got a very slim chance of making it and he says and you watch it watch that watch the Holy Ghost when every time a Spirit uh a nicotine someone smoking it always calls that thing out and condemns it you understand what I'm saying but we've got to a point in which it was Wednesday night and I told him I said you're exactly the living proof of what I preached tonight didn't even know you was coming amen but you're nothing but a lukewarm believer you're you're you're listening to a devil I said I ain't trying to be mean I'm trying to help your soul amen but but but there's something that's not right let's get back Amen to what has been taught us you you understand but it's the age that we're living in see it's an age of confusion usion it's an age of everybody wants to be relaxed everybody everybody it's it's an age of people's rights don't tell me what to do don't tell me how to live Don't Preach at me anymore I've got my own right I've got my own religion I've got my own way you understand why I'm saying it's a it's people's rights I've got a right to stay home if I want to stay home I've got a right to dress the way I want to dress I I've got a right I'm a Christian just as much as you are you understand what I'm saying but if the fruits ain't there something is wrong you understand what I'm saying and and so now see so the bride is not confused and becoming more confused as to who she is amen notice she has been given the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him to know everybody say to know amen see she's been given the spirit of wisdom not worldly wisdom Spirit of wisdom to know and Revelation amen if you if if you're getting wisdom and you ain't getting the Revelation it's of the wrong spirit amen because when the spirit of God came he came he's the spirit of wisdom and Revelation Spirit of Revelation Spirit of wisdom and that wisdom will line up with this word right here amen it's a revelation that gives us wisdom ain't that right amen see so so this bride is not like the people of Le osia age who claim to have need of nothing and know not that they're blind wretched miserable and naked now now think of this know it not brother brandom in the message knoweth or not he if you ought to go listen to it amen but he says if a man on the street was poor miserable blind and wretched and if that man knew he would try to hide himself ain't that right he would try to fix the condition he would try amen and if you gave him a pair of clothes and he knew that he was naked and knew that he was miserable knew about wretched and he knew that he would thank you for providing him some clothes he would thank you amen for giving a blanket or something to let him know and to cover him up you understand amen but see if he was naked he would try to get some clothes he would try to make things better and that would be a most pitiful sight to see a man on the street that thinks he's well dressed amen and and or dressed well and that he's rich and he has need of nothing and yet miserable necked just enough religion to make him sick and don't know it well that's where we're at amen and and brother Bram said you know what it is it's a sign of insanity now you know one of our problems today that you keep hearing in the news when someone commits a crime or whatever and they always put mental health problem mental health mental health mental health amen when when they when they do rape a per it's mental health when they when they kill something or kill someone these children were going into schools or or or killing their families and all it's mental health amen and and well the prophet already warned us that this age this Le odsan age will go in complete Insanity well see that's what the scripture says they don't know it they're in a condition but they don't know it amen they're not meaning to be that way but they don't know it you understand what I'm saying see and he says it's a sign of insanity so what we are seeing is both mental and spiritual Insanity see and so the bride by the message of the hour by the message of the hour has recognized who she is she knows that she is the original word of God she knows that she is an eagle not a hawk remember the hawk is too lazy he's too soft and lazy to fly into the heavenlies and kill fresh meat well that that eagle knows that she's not a hwk so so she knows the better than to follow and sit on a CL on on a line with a hawk and just sit there and be lazy amen she's got it within her to move up higher she's got you understand what I'm saying we do not compare ourselves with the church natural we don't compare ourselves with the religion of the world and religious doers and religious people amen we are eagles and we know we are eagles and if we know we are eagles then we do something about it it's those that don't know amen they don't know they have no idea and they don't do anything about iten but the Bible says she does know because she hath made her herself ready Hallelujah she's identified she's not confused identifying herself as a sparrow as a crow a buzzard amen a peacock hawk or whatever she's identified her with the word of what the word says she is an eagle no matter how hard the winds are she takes them winds of adversity and she Rises amen not going to let her beat her down not let the trial beat her down not let this skepticism beat her down amen not even let heart preach and beat him down amen she Rises on it amen if God has giv it to me then let me have it I want to rise amen I'm not going to be here I know the spirit of perversion tries to get up us amen maybe not to try to act like a woman you men amen but let us act like the what a world is and what the the world is doing going to church with one foot in church and one foot out in the world Amen I don't want to identify like that I am an eagle I am one I'm not an Earthbound creature I am an heavenbound creature and I will rise I am Rising spread your wings Eagle she have made herself ready she is the Overcomer Hallelujah now see we've never had a day like the one we're living in you know brother Ram said it is true that there has been greater days of persecution when the children of God were put to death on every hand he said yeah so so as far as that you ain't going to see a a greater day of persecution for the bride as it was in the with the apostles amen uh uh see that that's that was better greater days of persecution but notice how more treacherous it is today but to see the deceitfulness of the enemy we've never had a day like this that we're living in now it's the most cunning deceitful day and when I see that it brings this that the Christian has to be more on his toes today than he ever was in any age can you say Amen not that you have to be scared of your religion and and and and hide your testimony oh you don't have to do all that amen but see you have to be on your toes because the spirit of perversion amen deceiving amen can you say amen amen to where people think think they're right and they're totally wrong amen see the only way you can know you're right is when you have the spirit of Truth within you that's taking you to this word and you're living this word word by word and it ain't a preacher having to preach constantly to you on the dos and the don't there's something in you that is boiling up within you saying I got to do what God tells me to do amen I don't care what the doctor says I don't care what mama says I don't care what husband says or my wife says or the children say parents say it doesn't matter what they're doing out there amen I'm going to follow amen the word I'm identifying see now brother Bram said see back in the days back in the days of persecution of Rome to the church a Christian make a mistake he went into the arena and was fed to the Lions or something like that when they found him of being a Christian for his testimony but his soul was saved because he was purely unadulterated believer in God and gladly sealed his testimony with his blood as the veins let loose or holes in his body or and the blood bleed out he would scream up with real loyal faith and say receive my spirit Lord Jesus amen but notice this is a worse age than even the days of persecution he says see but now the cunningness of the devil now see makes the people people believe that they are a Christian when they're not see there's the thing you don't have to see it's more cunning a a more cunning day than it would be than when you had to seal your life away with your testimony see the devil has set every cunning trap that he can he's a deceiver and Jesus told us in Matthew 24 how this day would be that we're living in the most deceitful day that ever lives so close so close everybody say so close so close that it would deceit the elect if possible if it were possible can you say Amen see so so you can see the miracle of overcoming in this age it's it's a miracle for Overcomers and and because then if if if we're to overcome now God's already addressed the Overcomer in this age so there's going to be an overcomer how many Overcomers do we have huh yes sir Trials come your way your battled minds and and things just hitting you left and right but you're an overcomer amen well God's already written you in the book that you will be an overcomer ain't that right see and and but but don't take that overcoming for Grant it and and and attribute that to a natural Gene seed or well my dad was a preacher my mom was a real devout Christian and and well I just raised up in the mess of church don't don't you take that for granted amen you are an overcomer amen because it's a miracle amen it's a miracle that you overcome uh uh uh brother Matthew see see so so now you have to you have to know that you need to overcome before you can overcome ain't that right if you're in that spot that I have need of nothing and and and you know I've got it all well then what happens you don't know you need to overcome and and then then when then then you start getting your stickers out a little bit and you get offended and you get this think you think I need to overcome what you know and and these things but but see if if you know that you need overcoming then when the word strikes and the word is preached or you hear a prophet saying something and and and you know that it's not your life ain't lining up with that all of a sudden you think oh I got to overcome God helped me to overcome amen you ain't going to blame Mama for it you ain't going to blame everybody else for getting on to you you you just know there's something in your life that you can actually tell that hey this ain't right I'm I'm not you know and there's times Amen brother Terry I have that in my own life when I'm listening to a message and or I'm hearing someone preach and it Raks my hide amen and and you know sure the first thing you want to do is like you know well you know doesn't he know I mean why is he doing that for you know uh but then I I begin to check my life you see the very first thing you ought to do when something is preached and maybe you don't like it or maybe it's you think it's hitting you amen the thing you ought to do is say Lord is that really for me is that really for me I was listening to the the message this morning on straight As the gate and uh uh you ought to go listen to that one but brother brandom he came up and he said you know I don't have nothing you know he said but just the Lord just kind of struck a little something he said but I don't know what to say and in his pray said now Lord I'm just going to rely upon you amen and man he preached a hide burner you know and and and but but see the the the thing to do is is said saying well uhhuh I'm sure he you know we ate coffee you know we drank coffee two weeks ago so he knows a little bit maybe maybe you ought to just say Lord you know you put a gift in that man's life you know and and and and if if that if that is really hitting me God I want to know about it Lord maybe I don't see everything and maybe I don't understand understand it all but God I just want to know you understand what I'm saying amen not not lean to people's rights how dare you you you understand what I'm saying see and so you you have to know amen that you need to overcome before you overcome see it's a fight to overcome how many believes that it's a fight to overcome you're not in a picnic church it's a fight to overcome that's why you come to the house of God because when you draw yourself out and you're not among Believers you're like that little you're like that little old uh uh uh that little bull cow or what what Buffalo cow whatever that's out there and there's Lions all around amen and when you get away from the herd amen that old line knows your weakness and that's where he's headed is your door you understand what I'm saying that's why we need a body of Fellowship that that's why we need one another these people that think they can stay home and still be a Christian brother Braham said you can't you can't do it can you say amen and and brother Brown never amen as far as I know searching the scriptures and and and the message both Bible and message never promoted people staying home amen streaming and and not having a body Church to go to it's just the facts can you say Amen but what is it it's more easier to do these things because it's Le oia it's a spirit it doesn't take you totally out in the world but it takes you into to a state of lukewarmness that's the age we're living in a state of lukewarmness where you have the you have the form of godliness but there ain't no power in your life to back it up you understand what I'm saying so so now this bride she is the full manifestation of the vision that God had for his bride Masterpiece this is where we're at God's put the final touches on this bride oh yeah you got to go through the fire do you realize that how many knows that you got to go through it Church don't belly ache about it don't whine about it but instead of handling the trial the way you would want to handle the trial get on your knees get get get get on the message start listening to that message start reading that Bible and saying God now how do you want me to handle this trial how do you want me to do it I know my way I'll get bitter about it I'll go knock their you know the socks off you know I I'll I'll whatever but now we we're in an age this bride is now coming to the place of God how do you want me to handle it God what do you want of me you're sending this thing for me for a reason now God I want to handle it the way you want me to handle it can you sayen why because the the prophet said this bride will not be like the first Eve amen she will not be deceived she will not give in amen but so you've got to be tried in you've got to be proven let the devil you just come amen you you try her you do whatever I'll show you she's not like Eve amen don't you belly ache about it just say God I'm so thankful that I'm in your plan devil you will not have me amen for the prophet says I never done it in the [Music] beginning Prophet said you never did fall that's right Hallelujah can you say amen amen glory amen remember you were not part of them that fell ain't that right so now the testings are coming the trials are coming what are you going to do about it how are you going to handle it give up sit in a weak State well God you understand where I'm at I can't overcome I'm having this problem they you know whatever and then you just just back off and your prayer life back off and your love life back off and your your uh dedicated life and back off and H I've seen a lot of people amen they get discouraged and before you know it they start listen to stupid devil and before you know it Holiness starts going down amen the tubes and and they start getting a little bit more LAX as though they've got an excuse you realize the Bible says there'll be many excuses in this day yeah see so the rapture after the Rapture has taken place the people that are left behind will continue on with their life continue on with their own plans fulfilling their own desires whatever the plans are get rich have enough money to where I get old I retire you know make sure the money's in the bank they'll still have them thoughts they'll still just be continuing on but the rapture's gone the people gone because there was that group of people that lined it up with God's plan and not their plan they lined it up to God's will instead of their will can you say Amen now see the Rapture is going to be a secret coming Lord the the unbeliever and the professed believer will never know brother brandom said see people will go right on preaching saying they believe they're getting saved and adding in the church and building churches and going just on just like they did in the days of Noah and so forth and not know it and the Rapture done P can you say Amen so those who make up the bride are the only ones who will know because the Rapture is for them amen can you say Amen you got to remember the bride everybody say the bride the bride is the pattern that God is working on remember he cuts out there's the P there's the there's the pattern and then he cuts out in the shape that he's wanting it the so the the the seamstress or whatever and and then she there there's that whole pattern but she cuts out of that pattern what she's after right and then she rolls up that other pattern and and lays lays it aside for another time that Remnant church that's going in Tribulation amen but now she starts working on this what she has cut out amen now we've heard The Voice come out of her my people come out of her my people don't you dare stay in there church come out of her my people can you say Amen why if you're wanting to be part of this body if you're wanting to be part of that bride cut out you better come out while there's a spirit of Grace upon you to do it and you say well I'm not denominational all that I'm not talking about all that come out of her remember it it's worldliness it's not only religion it's a worldliness it's it's a spirit that gets a hold of people that makes them lukewarm amen amen so the bride is the pattern so those who make up the bride are are the ones who have their name on the Lamb's Book of Life and they are the ones that Jesus came to redeem so when the bride fully manifests the plan and purpose of God there will be no more need for time to continue and and I understand time will continue all the way through the Millennium so that's not what I'm trying to say but let's put it this way the time of the Gentiles there will be no need for it to continue am see because God's Vision in what he had of a bride has materialized it's standing there in reality yeah before him amen so what's the point amen 120 years God just shows 120 years Noah preached and of all that eight SS went the ark that's it 120 years was given a chance and there was no one else out of all the millions of people there there's no point finally God when that last one that he has predestinated for Saul forn to be the bride part of that Bride Comes In It's Over Now Church were close amen amen can you say Amen see the word has been made flesh in a many membered bride the same word that was made flesh in that body bridegroom body now has taken on flesh in a bride body so now we're at Daniel's vision of the stone being hewed out without hands striking the Gentile kingdoms that's fulfilled at this time lord Paul's prophecy in Hebrews 12:25 through 28 is fulfilled at this time see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they spake Escape not who refused him that spake on Earth how much more shall we not Escape if we turn away from him the message that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now Heath prom saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken as things that are made as that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved that's our scripture that's where we're at can you say Amen yes sir so so there's many other scriptures that are fulfilled when the church ages are finished now notice it was after the church Ages were over that John in Revelations 4 was summons up into heaven and brother brandham now that's the Rapture and brother Bram says now John was a type of every True Believer that will be summons by Christ on high that right summons come up hither can you say amen that's what this voice is doing in this age to this bride not condemning you loosening you calling you out shaping you and calling you up hello that's right see so those who have wisdom not not Wordly wisdom carnal reasoning but the wisdom of God they can tell you what hour we're living in amen amen amen should never be ashamed to tell someone the hour we're living in amen this is where we're at they can look at Bible prophecy and see it all being fulfilled they can look at world events they can look at science they can look at the actions of the people today they can look at Israel in her Homeland they can look at the dis uh disturbance in nature and can tell you by all of this that we're here in the end time not have to panic they they just so excited that the Rapture is going to take place any moment see because they have the wisdom to know what time we're living in the eyes of their spiritual understanding have been enlightened we know that the world is falling aart amen it isn't some political party that's made this thing go Haywire surely you wouldn't think that well if we get another political party everything will be okay you're without understanding we had a prophet long before the political party that we have now tell us the world's falling apart he told us there ain't it ain't going to get better it's going to continually get worse ain't that right see so we're not looking for those you know or we're not like those who are looking for some political party to come and fix what the opposing political party has destroyed the world is falling apart because God is ushering in his Everlasting Kingdom amen right hello amen now aren't you glad that when God predestinated you to be his bride and he predestinated you for this age to be the final finale the final touches the final completion of all that aren't you glad that he looked beyond this world and had a place for you man if we had hope in this life only as Paul said we'd be of all men most miserable could you imagine being bride and yet having to fight every devil all the time and and and living weary all the time and I'm not talking in depression all that but you know what I'm saying it's it's there spirits that we deal with constantly could you imagine being the bride and for eternally living like that but God has prepared a place so this is why the world's got to fall apart he's already finished the bride he's got her where she he wants her he's he's able to have preeminence in a people they're they're able to do like Jesus did the first Masterpiece not my will but thy will be done my me is to do the will of the father can you say Amen not living their own life their own dreams their own Ambitions but everything is lining up to the word of God they're they're they're not living by excuse after excuse after excuse that they're living by the word of God they're lining their life up with this Worden that's right can you say Amen see so this this layout of see a bunch see they're they're full of carnal understanding understanding great understanding we we've achieved a lot in this age smart smart natural wisdom carnal wisdom understanding but they don't know what condition they're in ain't that right they don't know the sign of the time or the sign of the end time the prophet would call it see that that kind of wisdom comes from the Tree of knowledge now notice what the prophet said we're at the consummation of the church ages the LA leoan Church age the consummation of all ages we're at the consummation of of political the political world we're at the consummation of the natural world we're at the consummation of all things we're at the end of every natural thing ready to enter in amen well look at what the consummation is I looked it up it means completion it means the ultimate end or the Finish we're at the end we're at the ultimate end of church religion we're at the ultimate end of politics we are at the the the ultimate end of world government we're at the end of all of these things can you say amen amen now notice now what the prophet said God is finished with the church ages amen see the world is just keep on moving on just like everything just going on see and they're they're they're they're asking everything's continued on just like it was from the beginning but a prophet stood here by the grace of God to let us know God's through with the church ages another place the book of redemption is only revealed after the church ages and denominational ages have run out and there's time no more now we know that the book has been revealed we're not sitting here waiting we have another place we have come through a denominational age but now we but we we come now to a free age where the Holy Spirit himself comes down and vindicates himself and makes himself known makes every promise that he promise come to pass see so what was the denominational age well Wesley uh uh Luther Wesley and and Pentecost brother Bram says see those the three denominational ages carriers see which also must die and dry up just like the shuck and so forth does to give room for the seed can you say Amen they had to Die the church age had to finish off to give room for you to grow under this light don't mess with this message don't you put a Baptist Doctrine Pentecostal Doctrine or whatever else to this message we ain't got time for that God has done away with that to give you time to grow prise can you say man give room for the seed the seed cannot get right cannot get ripe until the shuck stalk and leaves are all dry dead see formal see dead dry that's right it it saps every bit of life of the life in them out amen all it was is that plus can you say Amen amen that's right where's it at all the life is in the seed glory to God so he said sees the second 2,000 years is finishing there's no more Church ages as the reason you latter rain Brethren couldn't start another organization there's there there's going to be no more that's right it's at the end can't be no more Church ages it's all over and another place we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age we're not living in a Methodist age we're living in another age we're living on up here to the bright age the calling out of the church and getting it ready or together for the Rapture another place we're entering the Rapture age not Church age Rapture age astronaut age can you say amen amen that's right amen I love the Lord so he says see the morning star has come out to hell the day coming see and the Holy Spirit showing its light see it's coming a time when the light and darkness will have to be separated one from the other church and its order will take the order of the day and Christ and his light word promise will go in the Rapture now what order are you going to take the church natural is just going to take the order of the day lukewarm blind wretched miserable poor and don't know it but Christ and his light L capital L light word promise you I bride is going to inter Rapture that's the only thing that's left for them to do it's a day today is the dawn of a new day for many who are looking for his coming and notice this leot of seean age goes into complete chaos and is it not going there today you bet it is you love him isn't the Lord wonderful now notice brother brandham was asked the question after the Rapture has been taken place will any of the church be saved in the end who was not taken in the Rapture no that's right because the blood's done left amen you see there will be no more intercessions the Gentile age is finished you say oh man and I know human human sympathy for people and human carnal understanding oh that's horrible really God's given them Seven Ages amen if you've got one day to to repent and and to ask for forgiveness and to accept what God has done that's grace to you that ought to be enough that's right but God has given us weeks after weeks years after years you understand what I'm saying there will be no EX excuse and no man can find Injustice in God for taking his people home and leaving the rest here true you understand what I'm saying brother Bram said Jesus Christ has had more success in my Ministry than his own why to let the world know that this message is Right amen so he said the Gentile ages finished there will be no one saved after the rapt none of the church so then is Revelations 2211 fulfilled he that is unjust let him be unjust still he that is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still can you say Amen now as we wind it up here uh on the day of Pentecost God planted he planted a Pentecostal seed a Pentecostal Church according to the parable that Jesus gave it was a good seed it had signs wonders Miracles non-spiritual gifts it had the manifestation of the spirit of God then as we know Satan came along and he planted his seed the carnal Church according to Matthew 13th chapter we we talked about it Wednesday night that the the seed that God planted are the children of the Kingdom the seed that Satan planted are the children of the wicked one see and so the children of the kingdom are those that make up the bride of Christ the seed that God planted amen is is called the True Vine or the true church it's what the prophet called it the True Vine or true church yeah the seed that Satan planted is called the false Vine or the false Church shortly after the day of Pentecost when God planted that seed Pentecostal seed that inaugurated his church in in seed form amen Satan planted his seed the false Vine the prophet said shortly after the day of Pentecost the false Vine got intertwined uh itself around the True Vine and we find the Deeds of the nicians he says that Spirit has fought the True Vine all the way through the church ages and will do so until it is destroyed by God religious spirit will fight you L it it what it's trying to do is get you into a lukewarm state to where you compromise on the word to where you have no convictions where you have nothing someone sneeze that becomes a big trial to you it about blows you off your feet see and and so in the Book of Revelations as we know that God addressed each Church false Vine True Vine and he talks about each one Prophet said he calls them the church see and only the elect will really know which is the true Spirit only the elect will not be deceived now notice for the true church brother brandham said Pentecost was was our pattern another place he says from the beginning until this time the real true church has been a Pentecostal Church it is true God has reserved this church aren't you glad God's reserved you now the spirit of God will always remain the same you cannot tell me that the spirit of God That Came Upon them on the days of of on the day of Pentecost and you got a different spirit can't tell me that you got the different Spirit than what Paul had or even what brother brandham had it's the same Spirit he Remains the Same do you believe that brother brandom or the Book of Revelations talks about the seven spirits of God as we know now that doesn't mean that God has seven spirits and and and he's divided in seven you know personalities and and seven gods and and and all these things that that doesn't mean so so and it doesn't mean that God changes his ways seven different times doesn't mean that at all brother BR said see the spirits was the angels that went to the Stars which were Messengers seven spirits seven different times the Holy Spirit would anoint a anoint a messenger which was a star in his day another place seven spirits of God are the seven fruits of the spirit that would reflect back in his people ain't that right so seven Messengers reflecting the spirit of God in in Seven Ages One messenger to each age seven Messengers seven Church ages seven spirits of God in other words it wasn't just one spirit in of God in the other age or in the first age and everybody else was devoid of it but God was letting them know letting us know his spirit's been through every age that's exactly right God will always be the same and act the same amen now notice brother Bram says see the seven Messengers will have the same spirit teach the same word have the same power and if the church is the true church it'll have it it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost by experience it will be a Pentecostal Church there will be tongues and interpretation and prophecy and healings God will be in the midst of her and God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has another place the real genu genuine AR article of God was Pentecost was is and will always be that's where the church began right here with Pentecostal power another place take the take the histories and look down through the stream of time to hear and find out if every one of those real true children of God didn't hold on to that Pentecostal blessing spoke in tongues interpret tongues had signs and wonders baptized in the name of Jesus Christ everything that the apostles did they did too right on right down through there see so then we find that the Apostle Paul being the first church age messenger and all the others uh uh uh Martin uh irus Columbus Luther Wesley uh uh you know all all the way Amen brother BR said they had signs and wonders why because the same God reflecting the spirit through them for that age amen now uh brother Bram said see the nickan church turned it down that false fine that carnal Vine that carnal Church see amen turned it down because of these things they were spiritual see and he says as I've drawn here he says the church was being squeezed out and the nickan doctrine was in the majority and the true church was in the minority and has always been the true church has always been in the minority you believe it and you remember the Capstone that brother the brand pyramid started out like this and it didn't go like this it goes like this so it's coming more in minority more in minority in other words more bride less bride members coming into the body as each Age come amen hello amen that's right see so now even Jesus followed the pattern of Pentecost for here acts 10:38 God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power with power who went about doing good healing all that there were oppressed of the devil for God was with him amen so the prophet said Jesus followed that pattern and as he went away he told his disciples to tar in the city of Jerusalem until they be in be ued with power from on high think of it in this age they'll have a form of godliness and deny the power yes see so they were wait to wait until Pentecost Don't Preach don't sing don't go out and witness don't do nothing until you get indued with power amen ain't that right and and what is Pentecost the spirit that was in him now come upon the believer The Same Spirit the same power the same works the same everything now come into that church true church church and when it returned to them what did it do it quickened Quicken their mortal body what did he Quicken them to the word that's why that that's why see people thought that the day of ausa Street the holy ghost that fell on in amen they thought that that was the days of Acts again that was the day of Pentecost again brother Bram said no that's not that's not true what looked to be like the return of Pentecost it really wasn't because they left the word and denominated true can you say amen that's right see so then it quickened their mortal body now see it was the only way for that called out body the true church to stand in his place in his stead on the earth taking his place that's what brother Bram said the church could not take his place except that spirit that was in him would return upon them and Quicken their mortal body you understand what I'm saying see so brother Bram said because that same spirit that was in him would be in them and they would do the very same Works he says and any people that is truly the body body of Jesus Christ the true church WIll manifest the same works as Jesus did and the Pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them any other church that does not have the spirit and manifestation is going to have to account to Goden I hope it's just ain't words that you're hearing I hope it I hope it's helping you CU you got to understand any any church any church see that does not have the spirit and the manifestations is going to have to give an account to God yes sir this layot ofan age that claims they have need of nothing it's going to give an account to God they're religious yet they're lukewarm they without a spirit and manifestation they're as weak as we can get that's why we have to overcome the age can you say Amen now one would think that it would be easy to keep that spirit that Pentecostal experience alive and that everybody would want it but that's not true see the false Vine is a product of the tree of knowledge and that tree produces death just like Cain killed his brother Abel he was a product of the tree of knowledge and brother Braham said see the wicked killed the righteous it it set a pattern it will keep that pattern until the restoration of all things as spoken by the prophets can you say Amen do you love him amen amen see so the Catholics claimed to be the original church and they were the Catholic Church began at Pentecost but it wasn't too long after Pentecost they began to drift away see and the Catholic church now is made up of those who drifted away amen from Pentecost at the beginning Paul even spoke about it he he he said men coming in and speaking perverse things and would turn the people away from God see because they weren't speaking the word of God ain't that right amen see and so we we find that we could go on but but you all know amen about about what what has happened uh uh through the church ages but brother brandom says what what was the spiritual climax of that church in the first church age it had left its first love of the word of God it had fallen from its origin fallen from its origin a man which was Pentecost and he said says this means uh that means this church was in danger of being taken away from the leading of the Holy Spirit and the control of the spirit can you say Amen so we we we see that and and this is exactly how that the first church a started just skipping through things but brother Bram says and it will get worse and worse everybody say it'll get worse and worse until the holy spirit is completely rejected and God Must Destroy the people now Church we're here nanism started as a deed then it become a Doctrine then it become a a standard brother Braham said it became the unbending way it finally took over and God's God was pushed aside oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensive and it does it to everyone now you remember now it started that way in the church age and it'll started in you if you're not careful it'll start with maybe an argument maybe a disagreement it'll start with just some little little thing maybe something happened in your life or something going on it starts so easily yeah and if you don't take care of it and you don't recognize it before you know it it starts winding its way around and winding and intertwining and intertwining and the excuses become greater than the word of God and and you're trying to get away and it's hard to get away you understand what I'm saying well see that that's the way it is see you let someone do you wrong you let someone say something against you and we all been there I'm sure oh yeah maybe they didn't even mean to do something wrong but you took it wrong yes sir and you Fester on that you dwell on it or maybe they did say something to you how easy it is to get offended how easy it is to Harbor it how it easy it is to hold it in but what you don't know comes as a little bitty thing and then it starts growing and growing and growing you understand what I'm saying well that's what happened with the church and I'm talking about all of us that have had these things we we could do just anything you know maybe it's just a little thought of maybe that the brother Brandon missed it in one little place and if you don't take care of that thought it'll linger and I just keep on and on and before you know it it start showing little excuses and start showing little things and get you start yeah and before you know it you'll start questioning the prophet over everything because you didn't stop it anytime that that I don't understand something about the prophet and the devil starts talking to me about it that maybe brother Brandon missed it you know what I just start doing I just verbally thank God you sent a prophet father I thank you for sending a prophet I believe he's right Lord I Thank you I base my whole life upon him I will not let the devil put something in my mind ain't going to do it well see see that so that's what happened it came as a little bitty thing but then it it it come it became an unbending way it finally took over and God was supposed to decide see oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looks so good it seems so sound see then it caught a hold and like a python it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church and oh that false Vine is subtle it is like an angel of Light until it gets a hold of you say so to see the beginning of the church age in another place he says and to see how the apostles and the doctrines and the things that they taught the principles of the Bible then to see that church about the second round of Apostles how it began to fade away the real true teaching the third round getting away see Way Away by the fourth round it had faded uh out and and the church brought forth a lukewarm church and now look where we're at ain't that right so here God out of all that church age now God is confr run in that age that carnal chur says I would that you were hot or cold but because you're lukewarm I'll spew you out of my mouth can you say man and remember what are they lukewarm about Rah says they have gotten away from the word they are no longer F fervent about it they are lukewarm about it ain't that right now brother brandham he says from the beginning I think we've read it but he says from the beginning till this time the true real true church has been a Pentecostal Church it is true God has rever reserved this church now talking to us as we get ready to wind it down now but Jesus talks about 10 virgins the five wise and the five foolish ain't that right and notice Matthew 25 and3 don't think I gave you the scripture but he says they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their lamps in their vessels with their lamps and while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut and afterward came also the ver other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us and he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not now we know that the oil is the Holy Ghost amen and brother brandom likened it to a coal lamp you put put the oil in in at the bottom of the lamp and then there is a wick that that dips into the coal the oil and and then the other end is where you and uh light light the uh light the fire and and you know he he was talking about that Wick he said it has to be made up of a special material because that Wick is to draw the oil right draw it up to the fire to keep feeding that fire you understand what I'm saying and then and you and and you got to keep that oil you got to keep the oil in it get the supply of oil that's right so the fire will stay lit ain't that right that's right see and and and so now brother brandham brother Bram says now that fire amen the fire that every believer must have is Pentecostal fire Pentecostal fire and he said see the fire is the Gospel Light on that oil God said so see that's the vessel the oil is in the vessel and the fire burn burning it see shows that it's reflecting the light of what the word said that's the reflection that wise virgin could do that but that other foolish virgin was on the side outside had no oil they couldn't reflect nothing but their church and their denomination can you say amen amen and he tells us in one place he says the wick is Faith another place he said the wick is the real genuine believer amen in other words we are the one that's keeping that fire lit we're the one not drawing from the world not drawing from the entertainment and and trying to find joy out there to sustain our [Music] joy our joy is coming from the oil and it's a Pentecostal fire that's being lit in us can you say Amen you love him amen Oh my he said see the people of this age doesn't need Faith they have intellect they have scientific knowledge and wisdom see so they don't need that Faith therefore they have nothing to draw even if they did sit in a holy ghost meeting yeah there's nothing to draw from it but God help us today to know who we are you cannot be bride and mingle out there and when I say mingle out there you know what I'm talking about carry bringing on their bearing their characteristics bearing their nature bear having their standards and expecting God to deal with that and accept that it ain't happening it can't amen if the musicians will come praise God thank you Lord the ones that had oil in their lamp Trimm their lamp the fire was a burning and they went out to meet the bridegroom Jesus here in Matthew 7:13 said enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there be which go in there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few few be there that find it brother said oh and this is in straight As the gate message he said I can show you plenty going to church I can show you plenty singing the choir I can show you plenty teaching Sunday school I can show you plenty that's head of the great societies I can show you plenty that shouts plenty that speaks with tongues plenty that works in the gospel work but show me one that's down in their hearts so troubled over the sins of the world show me a preacher that can stand today and condemn those denominations show me a preacher that'll stand and say the things and condemn them denominations can you sayen a preacher that'll condemn the sin condemn the world that's what we want church can you say amen amen keep the fire going keep it lit keep it lit keep it lit there's good people out there I understand that I understand that sure but they ain't got the fire lit that's the thing they talk about the Lord sure they go to church sure they love the Lord and what they know but they ain't got the fire lit that's right but see we we we we we're not confused about things we know we're an eagle we know we're bride we know that we're part of the plan that God is doing and and he expects nothing less he's already told us he's coming after a people that's got a fire lit can you say Amen yes sir he said there will be million 10 there will be 10 times million times billions of professed Christians and stun in their life that'll miss the gate can you say Amen you love the Lord I hope it's helped you in somehow Church let's stay on fire for God don't let excuses get in your way don't let Petty things get in your way whatever it takes don't care if you have to have an all night prayer meeting get an all night prayer meeting till you get prayed through till you get through to God
