all the things that God has done amen we just uh just always find it in our heart just to want to give him praise and glory amen and there become a time that we just be around his throne in his presence forever and ever and think of just praising him with no mind battles and no sickness and nothing there to try to distract us a man and um but while we're here we're going to praise him with everything we've got amen and the musicians can be dismissed it's good to be in the house of the Lord and trust you all are satisfied being in the house of the Lord I tell you what as the psalmist said I was glad when they said unto me let us go and it just Thrills our hearts to come and to be with God's people and most of all just to be in his presence and entertain him and been a little windy today but we didn't get blowed away so this is good tree you know they're close to my office and it's leaning a little bit my way and I was like oh Lord don't don't forget I'm here amen and so it's still up so thank the Lord for that if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and um good to have brother Josiah and sister Mindy and family back with us and also uh just to let you know we're going to be having communion this Sunday Lord willing and so look forward to that and um so and of course we'll be having two Services Sunday 10 and 4 and so just keep in mind of that praise the Lord before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and talk to our precious father Lord Jesus we come in thy name for it's in thy name Lord that demons flee the sick are healed the lame walk it's in thy name Lord that we stand here Lord undefiled and we stand here with faith lord it's in thy name that we've come tonight and Lord we're just under great expectation for you just to speak to us Lord for we know that it's by Thy word Lord that we overcome and lord it's by Thy word Lord that Satan is defeated anywhere anytime under any condition and Lord we pray that your word would just be planted in our hearts let it be anchored father and oh I pray that you would just anoint myself anoint me the gift that you've placed within me and help me just to get myself out of the way father and Lord may you just speak through this these lips of clay and I pray that you would anoint every year in Heart Lord of your people and any spirit that would try to hinder this service I pray that you would just drive it out of this building and that that your people could have Liberty Lord to hear from you and to receive we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen you can not have your seats yet we're going to read uh Psalms chapter 23 start at the first verse but it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters and he restoreth my soul I'm going to just stop right there and you can have your seats now praise the Lord but um my uh desire is that you'll be encouraged tonight and and strengthened and I'm sure the things that you've that I'll say is something you've heard but maybe it will just bring to your remembrance and solidify your heart into these things because I I believe it's so important to to be established in the the word in the age that we're living in and we we realize that we're living in the time uh of restoration of all things as we said before quoted brother Branham he's saying that this is the age of of restoration and uh there in I believe the Masterpiece I think it was there or um well trying to think of the other sermon but I've been listening to both of them but he says to restore is to bring back to to who really owns it uh to bring it back to its natural estate where it was at the first time to bring it back into its natural condition and I guess because that man is made in the image of God um he uh um you know he has this desire within him even though he is a sinner and unconverted but he has this desire to restore things and um you know I I think it's neat how that men would will take these old cars that uh maybe run down and and uh you know I I can remember and uh uh a man uh I think he was in in uh there in South Carolina and he drove all the way to to Oklahoma to pick up an old car and and he took pictures and so when I went to to minister at his church he showed it to me and and uh and and and the car had a tree big tree sticking out of it you know and uh uh out of the the hood there and and uh just you know it just looked like it was no hope whatsoever and then he takes me in in the garage and and and it's a beautiful car and I'm like wow you know how in the world did you do that uh and but he spent a lot of time a lot of Labor a lot of things uh trying to restore uh these things and so uh all the parts that they would put on the vehicle you know they if they're going to restore it they they want the exact same kind a replica or uh something that uh the the factory originally put on that vehicle uh years ago and so they'll they'll they'll put the same kind of Tire on it they'll put the same kind of mirror on it they'll they'll put this you know try to get the same uh color of paint that it did it originally had and but the same kind of seats and and different things and so whatever is broken then they'll replace it uh with something that um uh looks as like the original because they want everything to be just exactly alike uh uh there and so it's also the same thing when they um uh they do a building uh they there's those that will restore a building and uh they'll they'll try to do everything just exactly uh the way it was before uh uh it all got messed up or or whatever uh they'll put the exact pink color or try to find that that wallpaper or uh or refinish the woods of the wood or or or things like that and and that way that when you look at it you you have the you have the idea of what it was in the beginning and and and that's fine and that's good and that's but that's not restoration when you really think about it uh because no one no one can really restore like God can and so if it wasn't for him having the ability to restore uh then we we would be of all men most miserable we we would just be without any hope because God for one is not in the business of shopping and and around he's not in the business of replacing uh uh uh that which was broken and shattered and lost and uh uh because we we know that as the prophet would tell us no one can take your place and and you can't take another person's Place ain't that right and and so then you're not a replacement amen you're not a replacement for somebody and someone is the other person is not a replacement for you there there can be no replacement ain't that right and so then uh uh God is able to to literally take that which is broken which is helpless which is which is totally impossible uh uh uh uh to to be restored and yet he will take that and restore it because what what's the point of shopping when no one can take your place can you say man and so God made it that way and and so when when God restores he is the only one that can give the true meaning of what justification really means and that is you never done it in the first place now could you imagine standing there in in in in that place as we are if that could ever be a real reality to us that God's restoration is so complete and so thorough and so perfect that it's as though you've never done it in the first place now he can put you that way and and he is putting that church in that same way can you say man and so we're not talking about God uh uh replacing One Soul with another we're not into two so Doctrine amen but David said he restoreth my soul can you say man a soul that was lost a soul that was broken a soul that was so tattered and and vile and and sinful and and controlled by the devil and yet God would take that same soul and restore it ain't that right another way of restoring is if something that belonged to you was in the pawn shop and and you decided to go get that amen and so you paid the price of of uh for that something that once belonged to you and you bring it back ain't that right you take it out of of of the pawn shop and you put it back to where it was in the first place that's actually a an act of restoration amen the prophet talked about that ain't that right amen and that's why I would ask how can I be saved and in the pawn shop at the same time or how can I be in the Sean pawn shop and redeemed at the same time you can't do that ain't that right so also in the Old Testament when thinking of restoring we see that God uh uh through the ministry of Joshua divided up the land and gave a portion of that land to uh the tribe of Israel and there were 12 tribes and so it was given to them as an inheritance and was to stay in the family it was to stay within that that that tribe and so uh uh but but we find that not only God would give him that them that land and divide up the inheritance but he came my God would come up not man God came up with this law of redemption amen and and it was for them just in case and this is the whole story again of redemption between God and us but but he would provide this law of redemption for the just in case some poor uh uh some man he he got in a bind financially or or whatever and he lost that land he he had to give that land up a man for some unfortunate reason and and so this is an act of Grace on God's part ain't that right and and and and and so what one thing uh this does to us it shows us that the things that God has given us in his word he means for us to keep it can you say Amen what the things the promises the uh the blessings that God has given to us in his word he means for us to keep that amen but it also means that what rightfully belongs to God Amen he means to keep it as well can you say amen amen and so through the law of redemption that we see uh in Israel we understand God's heart we understand God's ability we understand God's purpose of redemption and so brother Branham begins to explain a man this law of redemption in Israel he says if if this man got poor and lost anything to another man all the only way it could be redeemed would be by a near Kinsman ain't that right but it finally it finally must come back so he says this man only holds it for a certain amount of time the man that he sold the property to can only hold it for a certain amount of time time he said see that's under that law of redemption it must come back everybody say it must come back to the original owner amen he says it must go back to the original owner if they was out of the tribe of Judah if he was there and this was allotted to his father then it was it was to him or some near Kinsmen so the dad lost that property and and and uh uh he he got in a financial bind or whatever and and he had to sell it or he had to give it over because he owed a man so much money and and there was no way that he could buy that property back he just had not that ability so now he's out of the picture he in other words he lost that in and you know uh uh to think of it what a horrible thing it would be a man to be that Daddy and here's you've got a son and you've lost the the land and you're thinking now what am I going to do amen where am I going to live what what is my children going to do what what I've lost it all that that had been and down handed down from my granddaddy and great-granddad and all the way down to me and here I failed and and all of these things but God provided a a law of redemption a man see and so uh uh so we find that that near Kinsman uh could take it he says now nobody else could rightly so if I've lost my land brother Andrew and and I I ain't gotten away to to get it back well you couldn't come and get it amen if I sold it to brother Kevin and and and and and and and uh brother Kevin is using it and and you go and say well I want to buy it and he says no I ain't going to sell it and well you you can't buy it it's just uh it's just the way it is ain't that right a man see and so brother Kevin could hold that piece of property until the debt was paid ain't that rhyme that's what brother Branham said but when the right man come along see so he says he explained is how this works he said see for instance if I owned a piece of property I lost it I sold it over to brother Neville which is of another tribe of Judah or or maybe sold it to an alien and he had rightfully owned it he he owned it he could come in there and farm it and take the goods off of it and so forth but really he just held the deed see he could not own it see so he he right he really couldn't own it amen he said that was the law in Israel can you say Amen so so you can hold the deed amen and you could live off that land you could work the land you could do all of that but back in in your mind you've got to understand that one day anir Kinsman is coming and he's going to claim that property now you may say no to brother Andrew and you may say no to to uh to brother Matthew and you may say no to uh uh sister Jane and all of these and by right you can do that but if my son Daniel comes and says brother Kevin I want that land amen that belonged to my dad you couldn't argue with it you you you couldn't do nothing amen because a near Kinsman had come to claim that property can you say man so this is what brother Branham is saying he says see now if this was my next Kinsman my blood relation he could not hold it any longer see no sir he had to give it over when that price was paid and when he uh gave him say 25 000 for the piece of property well then say brother Tony would come over and say brother Neville I'll buy brother branham's property he says well he couldn't do it see and and brother Neville says no sir I don't want to sell it he says well what did you give for it twenty five thousand well I'll give you 35. uh and and I'll give you so and so I don't care what you want to do he said I ain't gonna I don't want to sell it I'll keep it but let Billy Paul come along and say I want my daddy's possession here's your twenty five thousand amen no haggling no bargain nothing it it's it's settled it's done ain't that right see then that land that man that on that property had to let it go because that was the law of redemption now I hope I made that clear to you tonight amen the law of redemption the act of restoration ain't that right so God uh uh uh showing us in in in the Old Testament exactly what the law of redemption is amen see you were one time God's Property in the beginning you were God's Property ain't that right well and I'm going to say not just one time you've always been God's Property amen it's it's it's that way and and and you you say well how was that well brother Brown said we were with God in his thoughts at the beginning he called us and chose us in him before the foundation of the world and wrote our name aims before the foundation of the world so we were a part of God and attribute of God can you say Amen so so I want you to understand where you began from what you belong to and why God is so interested in you then you say amen he is interested in you he ain't just stealing you from the devil he has rights to claim you for his own now there's others he doesn't have rights to claim if you want to look at it that way amen see they were seeds of the devil serpent seed and and look at Cain and he was the son of perdition ain't that right but then there were people that were in the mind of God and God has every right to claim you back and and it's true that's right see so he says see we're an attribute of God because in the beginning was the word and a word is a thought expressed so we were his thoughts then expressed into word and became what we are that's the reason everybody say that's the reason our names he said maybe not what we have now but our names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world do you realize that is a record of God's book amen them names written in that Lamb's Book of Life has secured you as God's own property that's right see and so the prophet says that Jesus came to redeem all those names that were found written in that book now notice First Corinthians 6 20 it DePaul tells us we have been bought with a price ain't that right so we're not waiting to be bought with the prize we have been bought with the price so that tells us there was a near Kinsmen a man that could afford the price there wasn't near Kinsmen that could settle the amen settle the debt can you say man a man Acts 20 and 26 tells us that we have been purchased with his own blood God's own blood nah think of that so that was the price to be paid that's why no one else could do it but God himself ain't that right amen aren't you glad you had a a kinsman redeemer a man and God became our Kinsmen when he took on flesh he became you that you could become him ain't that right so so you think of this now and and job 23 and 13 job says but he is in one mind talking about God he is in one mind he's not double minded that he is in one mind and who can turn him what his soul desires even that he doeth so God would allow amen make a and provide a law of redemption for a natural people but in that he would show his own desire and his own purpose and his own plan he saw you the way you were he saw your Mart he saw you as a slave he saw you in a in a in a in a no-good junk pile but in that law of redemption he was expressing what he was going to do I'm going to claim him I'm going to come back Satan and you ain't gonna be able to do nothing about it can you say man amen say so so job says see what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth everybody say he performeth he performeth the thing that is appointed for me now now the devil had an appointment for you but God had a greater point appointment and that's what we're talking about tonight amen see so I didn't know you know uh or or we know that we didn't come into this world Amen looking anything like God to uh reflecting anything like a Son of God Amen uh uh we had a sinful nature we were slaves to the devil and the reason why we were slaves to the devil is because Adam sowed us into slavery Adam sowed us into slavery of sin but see that wasn't your beginning amen our beginning was before that amen when our names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life do you believe that amen see so we thought amen or I did anyways that I would be this way forever I just thought I'd been nobody forever I I just thought I'd be a hopeless case a sinner forever I just thought I'd always be you know just worthless and no good and and and even Satan thought that he had the power to destroy me you think of that and he thought he had the power to take you out he thought he had the power Amen to ruin you and to destroy you and and and after all he's the one that you were his property can you say amen amen that's right see amen and he was able to to use me and to extract things from me amen that he wanted for I was his slave when he had tell me to lie I lied when he told me to steal stole him when he'd tell you to drink you're drunk when he'd tell you to do this you just done it and a lot of times you're in it may be even in our own mind we'd say oh God I just don't want to be this way or or maybe you didn't even know God at that time and yet you was miserable amen but everything the devil told you to do you would just do it ain't that right for he was extracting things amen from you amen because he he uh he ruled you ain't that right amen but I want to say it this way he didn't own me for good he didn't own me for good I was a slave and I had to do the things he told me to do amen but he didn't own me for good can you say amen and he didn't own you for good that's right so he wasn't able to destroy me oh no no no there's a greater purpose he wasn't able to destroy you either ain't that right you realize the prophet said God took a picture of you before the foundation of the world Amen we so like our little phone so we can take pictures amen we think that's a new invention but God took a picture of you before the foundation of the world he thought of that before you ever thought of that have you ever just loved to take I like looking back you know when I was young and skinny amen and and I said you know I showed Heather you know a while back you know uh when I was about 16 and had my shirt off you know and had a little muscle and and but I slim you know and and she said is that really you you know I said that's me man yeah that's me and uh you know that's why I had to fight all the girls off and I just you know uh no but but you know uh uh and I think it's good to have the pictures so you can go back to in memory lane you understand what I'm saying but I'm so glad God had a picture of us as well I'm so glad that God took a picture of us amen that that it wouldn't just be a memory to him but it would be something that he would achieve four ain't that right that's right because that picture wasn't just for the present that picture was the future he saw your future whom he called he chose and them he chose he predestinated he already glorified he already Sanctified and that picture was you in the future can you say amen amen and he took that picture that's right see so when he looks at you it's not Memory Lane it's not God walking down memory lane as to what you used to be but it's God looking at the future of you and telling you you're going to make it amen you're going to come through you're going to Prevail because he saw it he decreed it ain't that right so no matter what happens you cannot be destroyed now Adam represented us at the beginning and and when he fell we failed and for he was the head of the human race and I I want to say to you head ship matters headship matter say man whether it's in a family whether it's in a church and and and what you come under the headship of it matters can you say man it really does and and so uh uh but then see so Adam being our head he fell and we fell with him amen but then God became our second Adam a man when he became flesh a man and in in in in Colossians 1 18 Paul tells us that he Christ is the head of the church ain't that right amen and brother Branham said he is the head of the of the uh of this new race a new creation it's too muffled now amen uh he is the head of this new race New Creation so we find that Adam was the head of the old creation ain't that right he was the head of the old creation and all that creation fell when Adam fell amen but Christ is the head of the new creation for the prophets that he was of the new creation he was an obvious old creation he was of the new creation and the Bible says you are a new Creature if you're in Christ If any man be in Christ he is a new creature or a new creation so that means you switched heads amen that means god rescued you when he become your headship amen not Adam would represent you now God himself would represent you oh my that makes a big difference for under Adam I was a failure under Adam I was a sinner under Adam I was hopeless amen that when God became my headship all I can see is Victory all I can see is overcoming all I can see is power all I can see is as I'm going to make it it because he's my headship now Satan noticed that new head Satan tried to make him fall like he did Adam but he didn't fall can you say man the first Adam failed to fulfill God's word but the second Adam our head fulfilled all of God's word everybody say all of God's word see our second Adam our head now the new head of this new creation fulfilled all of God's word Oh my he overcame every Temptation that came his way he overcame every trial that he was uh faced with he overcome every devil of Hell amen he overcomes Satan himself he overcome every enticing Spirit can you say Amen so it shows us that the first Adam no longer represents us whatsoever amen Jesus Christ represents us and you know what the prophet said he's our Advocate Paul says he's our Advocate ain't that right amen he's interceding for you and he doesn't stop interceding for you Amen on your Mountaintop he's interceding for you in your Valley he's interceding for you how can he do it he's the one that was worthy amen he's the one amen that that was worthy to become our Kinsmen Redeemer is this okay amen now notice what the headship says because I live you'll live you live also as I've overcome the world so you shall overcome the world can you say man why he's our head we are represented by him now amen it's kind of like the the Battle of David and Goliath and and each man uh uh each of these men represented their their nation and and in first Samuel 17 and 8 uh tells us that Goliath stood and Cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in Array am I not uh uh am not I of philistine and you servants to Saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me and if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then we will be your servants so they understood what the headship was was this this what this representation was going to be amen one man would represent his own country amen but if I Prevail against him and kill him then shall you be our servants and serve us so you could just imagine the responsibility a man that weighed upon David that little boy's shoulders amen he knew he wasn't playing playing games he knew he was fighting for Israel's life amen he was fighting for Israel's future he was fighting for their identity he was fighting for the children he was fighting for generations to come can you say amen he knew that this wasn't just about playing games this wasn't just it was his whole gland his inheritance his family amen was on the line the future of Israel laid on his shoulders but see David was a type of Christ and if you notice David willfully a man ran to meet Goliath and just as Christ did Christ willfully came Amen to stand for you and I he ain't that right there ain't no way that you was a match for the devil no way he was a match amen and I'll just be honest there was no way that Martin that that Saul was a match either there was no way that any other than men amen was a match but David was a match because he was representing Christ he had the very Spirit of Christ on him and did you know he got victory for his people and when the people saw that Goliath was dead they got courage and ran to join the fight because they knew they knew that the victory was theirs David the one that represented them had already defeated amen the enemy amen and so they ran they got courage they got boldness a man to chase the enemy can you say man and I believe that was the real victory that David had more than just defeating Goliath but to see the people Rise Up In Courage amen the ones that was hiding behind the rocks and shaking now to see them rise up and say yes that's right we're going to defeat the enemy that's the real Victory David was asking for can you say Amen oh yes sir to see the people of God that was once hiding in fear now running after the enemy what a victory now the prophet said we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his Victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory hiding behind the rocks oh no that's not what this Believers are that's not what this people is doing that's not what this church is doing we ain't hiding from nothing amen we're going after the devil and we're showing the victory of Jesus Christ he saddled the payment he defeated the enemy and here we are his victory when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows he couldn't keep him in the grave and they can't keep us either see that's right we are already potentially arised because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word can you say man from denomination Creeds to an eternal word of the Eternal God which is him himself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever and notice when the enemy saw that their representation was defeated they ran remember they were the one boasting God's people was the one hiding God's people was the one shaking in fear the other one's just walking around yeah go get them Goliath come on come on Go Tell it do it again I like to see him Shake not Elvis shook every time Goliath got out there all God's people just moved trembled but now here when the enemy sees that their representation is dead they run now I'm going to tell you that's facts [Music] you with me that's facts that when the enemy sees that their Chief is dead they run you say why am I having troubles well did not Israel go after the enemy now they could have just sat there too they could have sat there in their land and look down and say bye but they went after the enemy and I think every time that we make progress in God you know what we're really doing is we're going after the enemy we're not just setting Steel we're moving can you say Amen now we see in Portland Oregon we we see that there was a showdown similar to that one and and remember when that man came up on the platform and he he threatened brother Branham said I'm gonna break every bone in your body and brother Brown said he was able well capable to do it he had already done it to to one man uh uh uh uh put a preacher in the hospital and here he was now going to make uh uh uh a a spectacle and and of himself here and and he was making threats to kill him to kill brother Branham all these things and brother Brown said he'd come up on me towards me and said I'll break every bone in your body now you you think of it because all the other preachers left the pulpit amen they they all scattered and the policemen were coming to get that man and brother Brandon said no stay back waved him back hey man why this was a showdown again and and so he says I'm going to break every bone in your body and he drew back his fist brother Brown said I said because you've challenged the spirit of God tonight you'll fall over my feet I didn't even know I said that he said that was the spirit talking it done took over then but there was both challenges and he he run to me and said I'll show whose feet uh uh uh I'll fall over and he drew back his great big fist like that and the audience set Spellbound and just as he drew back his fist I said Satan come out of him and he threw his hands back like that his eyes bulged way back like out like the head and rolled around his head threw his head back and spun around the floor and fell on my feet so that the police had to come and roll him off my feet before I could move right across the platform he was perfectly laying there now notice what brother Brown says and at that time when all them demons had seen that their Chief man was defeated they just began to raise up out of the Wheelchairs and the cots and the stretchers and everything else and walk and that was the end of the meeting that just everybody was healed and walked out you understand what I'm saying they were taking one man amen and and that Chief demon was representing everyone there and basically if he could have prevailed against the power of God in that Prophet every every person would have sat there amen probably for life in in the wheelchairs laying in the cots and and all of that that once them demons saw that their Chief was defeated every demon left that building amen and the people began to walk the lame began to walk they got up out of the car said the eyes began to see and and and the ears began to hear and and the began to the limbs begin to straighten up why they saw their their Chief was defeated I'm telling you what the demons know the power of this gospel hey sure does now notice Jesus the one who represents us told us in Revelations 1 17 says fear not I am the first and last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death now you know where did he get them keys he went down into Satan's house and he got them keys are you with me now there ain't a new generation of devils so I believe every demon of hell was present when that when Jesus Christ opened that door I don't think he just opened the door I think he kicked the door down amen and he went over there and he grabbed them keys from the devil amen and every demon I believe was present and witnessed it amen I so so we're not talking about a new generation of demons that don't know what happened and have to be retold and retold and retold and retold no it's us that has to be retold it's us that has to be preached to can you say Amen to let us know that there was a real Calvary there was a real war there was a real Victory and you're part of that Victory God had you in his mind before the foundation of the world and you are part of God's Property breathe hey hey Glory Hebrews 10 14 for by one offering he hath perfected forever everybody say forever by one offering he hath perfected them forever that are sanctified and who was that offering but he himself became mire kinsman redeemer so we have been loosed as the Bible says by his own blood and are being restored how many believes you're being restored now come on now don't give me that hound dog look hey man like you just lost your best friend I'm telling you if you can understand that you are restored amen you would quit entertaining every negative thought that is in your mind you had quit in that entertaining everything that the devil offers you and you start fighting back and say hey I've already won I've already won can you say that with me I've already won I've already won why he's already won it for me please you realize the only thing about us that has been destroyed is their old life what we were under Adam is the only thing that has come to its end no more are you as sinners no more are you poppers no more are you a hopeless case no more are you Unholy and unrighteous no more are you an unbeliever can you say man in church I'm going to tell you this is not a pharaoh fairy tale this is the gospel this is the gospel I'm not sitting here wasting my time I'm telling you the exact truth amen and what I say it'll be rang up in heaven Amen on the Judgment day it's going to be there it's the truth can you say Amen can you say that with me it's the truth it's the truth God didn't save us just to sit on a Pew and dry up amen God didn't save us then 10 years later we don't know who we are and we just don't know what we're going to happen and we don't know our future come on church God would have never saved you like that he saved you and called you with the Holy calling an eternal purpose and what he done he did it for good hey brother John 8 32 says you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the problem is the prophet said people don't want the truth and you say Amen you know what the prophet said and he said but you can either be to either know the truth and be free or you can be a truth rejecting preacher a prisoner you can either know the truth and receive the truth and be free or you can be a truth rejecting prisoner can you say Amen that's exactly right now notice Adam represented us and we all fell when he fell but then Jesus Christ the second Adam who represented every name in the Lamb's Book of Life did not fall and here comes Jesus and asked the question which is so powerful to you and I and what a meaning what what something that captivates our hearts and and and and and and and uh creates a hope and expectation when he says who can accuse me of sin [Music] hey I've gone through it all but who can accuse me of sin I've been tempted in the wilderness but who can accuse me of sin I've been lied against but who can accuse me of sin they told me that my birth was false who can accuse me of sin they told me I'm just an illegitimate child amen but who can accuse me of sin you know what sin is unbelief who can accuse me of disbelieving Amen when I went down and I was in the trials and Satan came at me hard I stood back with faith and I never did waver amen who can accuse me that's our headship can you say Amen if our headship was just some weakling that the devil could whip around what hope do we have here tonight but if he's the one that said who can accuse me of sin and the Very accuser that accuses you get dare not accuse him preacher he may stand before our Lord and accuse us but who is he that can accuse our head for he is the innocent one can you say man so Adam's fall is not tied to us anymore as I've read before our own sexual blood is dismissed Psalms 32 and 2 blessed is the man whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity Romans 4 8 blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin are you with me you know what he's saying now these are blessings that only come to you these are your blessings come on now devil trying to tell you there's no hope these are your blessings we sing that song Count Your Blessings name them one by one and for some reason we always forget these blessings the Lord does not impute iniquity I'm it's a blessing to me the Lord does not impute sin unto me it's a blessing unto me it's what the prophet said these are blessings that God has bestowed upon us see so it's not our old life that counts anymore but notice it's the life of the Lamb for he's our head he's the one that represents us that's why God only looks at him he doesn't even see you he sees him then you say Amen and when Adam fell we fell that's just the way it was but here's our head another headship of ours that now that we're under and he says I've never sinned I who can accuse me I'm innocent and God looks at that innocent life before he honor looks at you [Music] so he's not his innocent life represents us and then his own life comes into you right and this shows that you have received the abstract as the prophet said now notice and I won't keep you much longer but but I'm I just want to keep one for a minute I hope it's helping you but abstract means it's searched all the way back to its beginning like that little drop of ink this morning he says when it struck that bleach it went all the way back and when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives an abstract right straight back to the Creator again and you become a son of God isn't that what we wanted to be we were a sinner by because we were a slave but now be we have received the abstract by receiving his life that is our abstract that we can show to the devil anytime I I ain't you I I ain't a sinner no more I'm not under your hit chip You Don't Own Me I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God ain't that right so he says see it gives an abstract right straight back to the Creator again and you become a Son of God see Abstract title deed is held in the hand of the almighty its Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve see what that ought to do to a born-again Christian it's legal possession to the abstract deed title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost Oh my he says another place when a man has said that he believes the word and then when the Holy Spirit comes it is the abstract to the title and that gives you permission everybody say I've got permission it gives you permission when you have that abstract that every bit of that belongs to you and everything uh that's on it belongs to you that gives us the abstract when the Holy Ghost comes upon this title deed that God saw back Yonder before the foundation of the world and put uh your name on the lamb book of uh or on the Book of Life see Buck was born through a man and woman subject to sin and guilty of sin but when I believed on it I received the deed but when the Holy Ghost come it was an abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandmother done it whoever did it it's it's all off everything that was struck against me is struck off I am free hey man great brother Brown talked about that epileptic child that had come just before service and he said the child was an EP that epilepsy come to the grandparents but brother Brown said I kept that Spirit off that child because I had an abstract can you say man had an abstract and you know what that's exactly what the church is to be doing all right Cassidy spirit's off are you with me because why we got an abstract abstract yes sir Mark 16 15 and said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be dead my name they shall cast out devils [Music] oh my you know brother Brown said that's what Abraham did for he was the type of the church you know that sacrifice there he's watching that sacrifice and he said he watched until the sun was going down and the fowls come down out of the air and on Abraham's sacrifice the vultures and Abraham cast him out and chewed them away he said what's this a type of Abraham's seed in the last day casting out Devils from the sacrifice casting away from the sacrifice God promised it the sacrifice Christ the same yesterday today and forever and all them unbelieving Spirits trying to devour it the man of God the Abraham seed stands there casting out the Devils away from it confirming the Covenant now see the confirmation showing that Abraham's seed he said I mean the Royal loyal Royal seed remember see the natural seed failed because it accepted law instead of the word of Grace So now here you are the loyal Royal seed of God can you say man that's right see he said see so they they so it has in this round bout in the Gentiles uh in this last day but there is a seed a royal seed with the word that stands true casting out Devils doing great signs and wonders getting all the unbelief away from the word keeping the sacrifice clean keeping the word holy keep it referenced not put anything with it add anything to it see just keeping it away standing on guard let nothing touch it and I say to you the prophet of God stood here into that stood night after night after night behind that Pulpit casting them demons out casting them demons out not just out of the people a man of sickness and diseases that cast an unbelief away from the people to where they could believe this word and see what the word really is can you say Amen not interpretation of man getting him Demons of creed and demons of Theology and demons of formalism and and demons of um all of them did that was possessing the people to where they couldn't see God for what he was he stood there casting them Spirits out and I say to you God by his grace God give me the grace to stand with our Prophet Amen to stand here and cast them Spirits out can you say Amen as a message believer Amen to cast them Spirits out amen as a as a message parent to stand there and cast them unbelieving Spirits away from my family out of my home as a message but Pastor to stand here behind this pulpit and cast the unbelief away from the people I'm so glad that we've got ministers in our church every one of these ministers that that Pastor that that helped me here at this church amen have are standing here casting these spirits of unbelief away can you say Amen now church that's your obligation that's what your duty is you are the Royal Seed of Abraham keep casting them spirits of unbelief away you say oh my oh yeah you see your child and the way they are acting the way horrible they are and that that's when the Devil comes and starts saying it'll never happen it'll never happen cast that unbelief away all right hey you can't have my children you can't have my home you can't have my spouse you can't have my church you can't take my Ministry you can't take my life I'm casting them Spirits out can you say Amen keeping that sacrifice clean getting all that unbelief away do you love the Lord now listen we have every right to cast them Spirits out do you believe it you have every right every right you say well I just don't feel like I've got the energy I just don't know I'm just just the smallest guy in the church even the weakest Christian can defeat Satan any time anywhere under any everybody say any condition by the word the weakest now that your Prophet our Prophet told us that so I'm not just standing here just just just blabbering I'm telling you what thus Seth the Lord said about you why the pie price has already been paid restoration means it's for everything we are in the restoration of all things you have every right to claim Every Blessing everything that God has ever promised you when the abstract has come the prophet said it struck off emitted everything everything he said I'm an abstract holder then and as sure is the spirit that raised Christ from the dead I have an abstract deed that I'm part of that body with the abstract of the Holy Ghost making that body of word live out just exactly like it did in him as he promised in this day in the last day the abstract all my sins everybody say all my sins are struck out all your sins are struck out by the blood of Jesus Christ no wonder the devil wants to take the blood away your sins will never be struck out if we take the blood out that by the blood to all your sins are struck out can you say man and by the blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost has come as an abstract to the title deed that God give me by Grace by foreknowledge so you have every right to cast out the unbelieving spirits too for you hold the abstract now listen how can you be a sinner how can you be a sinner and hold his life within you how can you act like a sinner now and and I'm not I'm not there's a lot and I'm not talking about going bars and all that what about people sitting in churches that that that that act as though as though they're unworthy as though as as though they can never come to a place that that God will accept them say you have Center Center mentality and I'm just going to be frank and and Satan wants us all to come into this place to where we don't think good about ourself and and I'm going to be honest with you there's nothing good about us so this has nothing to do about us gloating and and pride and all that jazz this has to do with his Redemption works so therefore by faith I accept it and I say it but I am worthy by his blood I am a saint by his blood by his work of redemption can you say man see so therefore every name that was written in the Lamb's Book of Life was to be brought into manifestation by the spoken word ain't that right but Adam our first head failed to do that so we were born into this world through a sex act thus We Came as a fallen attribute of God but now notice before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life by his spoken word and sent Christ the sacrifice to buy to redeem that same group that he had wrote their names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he come to redeem all names that's in that book no more not no more or not one more just what was in there when that last name is redeemed he takes his book and claims what he has redeemed ain't that right listen see so then he says see we were his thoughts then expressed into word and we become what we are that's the reason our names maybe not what we have now but our names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life and if it wasn't there then it'll it'll never be there and Jesus has come to redeem all those that's whose names were on that book ain't that right now I'm closing but listen he died everybody say he died he was buried but he rose again he died are you buried but he rose again and what was the next step the victory had already been won he showed who he was he proved by his resurrection that he was the son of God and notice the next step he said to his disciples in Acts 1 but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me ain't that right now think of a church they did not ask for his spirit he promised them his spirit ain't that right they had no idea that he could do it or would do it they had no idea amen now they had asked him questions uh uh through periodically as they followed him even one time they had asked him the question who is the greatest among the Kingdom of Heaven could you imagine the question who is the greatest you know of the Kingdom of Heaven they instead of asking for eternal life instead of asking that that he would come into them see they were just happy that they they only thought the purpose of God was that God become flesh and dwell with him and they were happy that they he would dwell with them and Jesus would tell them that I'm going to come to you one day and only come to you but I'll be in you hey that right they didn't ask that question that he promised it anyway and you say man oh do you love him and notice Acts 2 24 the promise is unto you Peter says and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and so he sent back his holy spirit upon the believer and why would he do that as as we close that why would he do that because the promises of God are the laws of God ain't that right when God makes a promise it is a law and it can't be a law until there's an enforcement that's why these Lawless people don't like our policemen they want to defund police because if you have no law enforcement you have no laws and that's why so many are attacking the Holy Ghost today and it's just Satan that that is attacking it because without the Holy Spirit there's no law and you say man now listen when God makes a promise and it's got to come to pass brother Brown said God said all of his laws in motion that it must work according to his own word are you getting it his word his law has to work according to his word he commanded the son he commanded the moon he commanded the Earth he commanded nature and they all fall right in line and all the laws work in harmony with God's spoken word and we could go into it there's a law to every seed of God that he planted let every seed bring forth of its own kind ain't that right and we know that there are seasons to the seed amen you can come up the flower comes up but in the winter time it goes right back down and and and but is that it no God said law that that seed's got to come back up ain't that right that's why you keep coming up in your trials that's why you keep coming up when you're discouraged there is a law concerning you I don't care how low you go you're coming up okay Lord you say well I haven't I I I I I haven't I haven't felt God in a long time bro Sean I don't care you're coming oh hey you know how it is we have long Winters sometimes we have some bitter winners you're thinking how is it going to be have you ever just been in the middle of a winner and you're thinking how how can it all live again how but spring comes to just to prove it and answer the question the sun rotates right back and gets close to that Earth and begins to call life again and what was so dead and so hopeless and so so nothing there has come back to what God called it to be can you say man do you love him oh yes yes yes yes so there's a law to you being a son and daughter of God how else can you be that if there was no law to it but that law the prophet said is the law of life ain't that right amen if the musicians will come Jesus had that law of life in him you have that law notice that law was written in Psalms Psalm 16 10 for that will not leave my soul inhaled neither without suffer thine Holy One to see corruption you see that was a law concerning Jesus ain't that right and by that law by that one law he told them unbelievers he said you destroy this Temple and within three days I'll raise it back again one law but he knew that that law was for him and he had the law of life in him to make that law work ain't that right and notice what the prophet said there wasn't enough time there wasn't enough Devils there wasn't enough anything to keep Christ in that grave see till his body began to rot because the law of God would bring the word to pass and the law of God by the Holy Spirit brings any promise to pass regardless everybody say regardless of the conditions oh what a restoration ain't that right the restoration I'm thinking of of even job the law of life was in job for he said though the skin worms eat this flesh destroys this body yet in my flesh I will see God do you realize he said that he saw he saw he said that four thousand years before Jesus came to Earth and there he died right there he died and and and that body was already turned to ashes or dust or whatever amen when Jesus come upon the Earth amen but the word had already been spoken God had already spoken it and given job that Revelation therefore that law was concerning him can you say amen that's exactly right and we read there in the Book of Matthew had that after the death burial and resurrection of Jesus that many of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth rose out of that dust why the prophet said it was that Prophet speaking with the word of God and the word had been spoken and the law of God by the spirit raised it up aren't you glad for that and he said the holy spirit is here to enforce that law amen for the believer he you have to be ordained to do so and take it and it takes a Believer you've got to have the badge of believer and notice what he says regardless and listen now he's going to make it just so plain to you that we have no excuse but to believe amen and every time Satan puts in your mind a negative thought gets you to use that for an excuse you ain't got none so you tell the devil that ain't excuse for me I I you you give it to somebody else but that is not an excuse for me notice brother Brown says regardless of how little we are how low we are how impure we are how Unholy we are how sick we are how Afflicted we are the law of God's spirit by his word makes it obey him and forces the issue and says give it back oh oh if we could just think of that for a minute forces it regardless of conditions no matter what the condition is the law of God's word forces the condition to cope with his word it's got to now if a flower is laying there and it's dead the seeds are rocking gone the pulp is gone that doesn't have one thing to do with it it rises again because God set a law for it to rise again oh I hope you understand I hope it gets down into your soul tonight he said you are made and born and placed here in the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of God you don't have to knock down to the devil we've got a law That's the Law of the Holy Spirit the only thing you know see have to do is know how to let go and let God in your trial know how to let go and let God in your Temptations learn how to know to let let go and let God when the devil is fighting your mind how to let go and just let God Amen throw them thoughts away throw everything away and say Satan I stand here under a law of God I have a new headship he said see you got to know how to let go and let God you keep fighting at it and it won't never work but when you let go and let God that's all that's just all you do can you say Amen do you love him he says see Fish talks about that fish and how the fish he doesn't fight for that law it's got a law within it that it can swim to the depths of the ocean so he doesn't fight against that law he doesn't say well let me hold my breath see how low I could go brother Brandon said if he'd done that it would burst you see you don't see the bird fighting against the law that it has within it to fly okay let's see here now okay I'm gonna stand back a little bit now I'm gonna run and maybe I can do this thing and you see him trying to woo brother Brian said if he'd done that he would fall right he said they don't fight against it they yield to it and he said that's the same way with us it isn't what we fight in pool and hurry oh if I don't get this if I don't get that that's not it if if you're in that state oh I got it I got it I got I gotta quit it quit it quit it quit it relax take it easy he said that's not it it's to know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing he takes you to the baptism of the spirit or anything that he's promised any claim that he's given is yours and by letting go and letting God he restoreth my soul you love him amen I hope that's all right he said you just think of it just think if you had someone come and steal break into your home and he stowed something and the policeman caught him the law enforcement caught him and he's going to take him to court to be tried and you grab him no no no no hold up hold it just a moment I just don't know if I should and you keep pulling him back and he's trying he's working getting him getting Justice for you and you keep holding him back he said he'll never get to court he said you're trying to hold back the very thing that is the enforcement for you ain't that right and so he says see he said see he said he'll never he said he'll never get him there just let him go let the officer go let him do his job let him go right and he said that's the way you do let Satan just get away all the doubts and everything flee from your mind then God will raise you up God will raise you up just just relax quit worrying about it well I just don't know I just don't know well just cast that thing aside say I'm not going to
