brother isn't he here last Sunday night but I do have a little bitty testimony the Lord just laid on my heart and um it happened a long time ago I was just a young mother and we had just had Dallas and found out he was about three years old that he was totally nonverbal uh he had not formed any words he couldn't he he made noises uh but no no language and I became so desperate and I was just praying to the Lord that he would help me at least to teach me how to have faith for my son and Terry was too we were just desperate and so I asked the Lord I said Lord Jesus uh just let Alice say something and I will know that he's all right that he's in your hands that you that you'll work it out this is the honest God's truth for a whole week that child went around the house just said M M M M he said it over and over and over again it lasted for a week he's never said it s but you know what that was my consolation that was my prayer that was my answer that was my faith and Heaven and Earth will pass away but that promise of whenever God chooses this side or the next side to let Dallas talk that's that's fine with me I just thank the Lord and I thought it would encourage you thank the Lord I think it's that's what I sing it last time [Music] let me just start it I don't know an unleavened word spoken by the voice of God for our day many have tried to add their own ideas and some take away [Music] but this won't mix with hyrid doctrines or creas it is the spoken word and it's God's original seed it's a perfect message this perfect word oh perfect [Music] message in an imperfect world it's carving out a little bride to be his word all of perfect love simplicity so humble only his Chosen Few will believe this perfect message this perfect word there are sometimes when there's things I don't don't quite understand but God's Prophet told me just to believe and on his word [Music] stand what others call the truth I don't want introduced we've heard the voice of God it is a are absolute it's a perfect message this perfect word a perfect message in an imperfect [Music] world is carving out a little bright to be the [Music] world it's full of perfect love and simply so humble only his Chosen Few will believe this perfect m is [Applause] perfect amen aren't you glad for this perfect word thankful for this perfect word amen as we stand this morning my hope is in the Lord is your hope in him this morning from this time on and ever more [Music] oh my hope is in the [Music] Lord from this time on and ever more oh my hope is in the Lord forever more I stand in all within the presence of the Lord in whom the wisdom of the ages lies in Whom The Ring Of The Sea subsides a living sacrifice my only source of life my whole is in the Lord from this time on and ever more oh my hope is in the Lord forever more his Tender Mercies come with every Rising Sun to meet The Sinner in his Brokenness to offer healing and forgiveness and those who trust in him will find their hearts at [Music] [Applause] [Music] rest My Hope in the Lord forever more can we sing that again oh my hope is in the Lord from this time on forever more oh my whole is in the Lord forever more amen do you love the Lord amen so glad that we can put our hope in him amen we certainly can't put it in the world everything is falling apart and um uh but we're so glad that the Lord has proven himself in this age and amen and we certainly love him the musicians can be dismissed and it's good to have brother Benji with us amen God bless you and um um and just uh pray that everyone had a um good Thanksgiving didn't gain too much weight and um uh yeah I had uh I told my wife got to go to the gym tomorrow and uh but but uh anyways uh pray that you had a good weekend and good to have brother Terry and sister Alice back amen and brother Junior and sister Brook back with us and little Wyatt and amen just everyone and it seems like everybody's uh I guess doing better in health and uh there for a while everyone was sick or different ones and uh but the Lord brought us through again so we thank the Lord for that and uh if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Ephesians amen the U first chapter I believe but uh we want to remember the church supper that we'll be having on the 9th of December at uh 5:00 p.m. and it's going to be at the um pilot Fellowship Hall um where Daniel Britney got married um I guess where we had our birthday party um back in September I guess or August but um so we'll we'll send the address out uh to you uh there but we want to keep that in mind and also brother Andrew asked me to greet the church uh greet you all for him and uh so he's there in um somewhere in Georgia preaching for brother yansy and uh so we want to just keep him in prayer and the Lord just use him in a great way there and also um January our meeting coming up uh starting on the 8th through the 14th and uh so looking forward to that and um just be in prayer uh for that meeting and that God will just just move we need the Lord and and more than we have ever needed him we need him now and I I believe that the bride of Christ has um the privilege of of asking him to come and he coming and doing the work uh among the people of God and and um so many people are devoid of the spirit of God and that this the bride is in in relationship and whatever you have need of God will do it I I just believe that and um we're we're coming you know to the end of time and uh we we must not play around we we realize the needs that are there some's got children that need to be saved and maybe some here needing the holy ghost or whatever it would be and I just believe that God can move move in a special way and so we don't want this just to be a series of meetings we we want it to be a a something Supernatural that God does uh for us and so uh but before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father truly it is an honor to to be here gathered with Believers Lord and knowing that two or three are gathered in your name that you promised you would be here with us and Lord we're under great expectation and we're now coming to the most important part and that is the word for Lord it was by your word that you created Lord things that were not and you brought it into existence it's always been by Your Word father and Lord you have gathered us Lord Lord by Your Word of a prophet in this age and now we're just praying that you would just do something downside of us Lord that take that which is lacking father and create a work within us Lord you know what we have need of Lord may your word uh meet the need we ask it father and anoint both speaker and hearer in Jesus Christ's name and the church says am amen and amen and so we look at Ephesians and I um we we want to look at Ephesians 1 and um let let's start at the 15th verse wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above all principalities and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and ha put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all amen you can have your seats this morning and um I want to continue uh on the the subject of the um the ministry of God in the body of Christ and here in Ephesians 4 and um one I'm going to read uh I did not give this to them uh for for the screen but if they can type it in they can Ephesians 4:1 uh through 4 but Paul says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord uh beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body everybody say there is one body one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling amen and so we we look that um that one body is the body of Jesus Christ and and the ministry that we we've been talking about is the the ministry that is in the body and it's the ministry of Christ and um um this ministry is the manifestation of Jesus Christ Resurrection the prophet said uh um so the ministry that is in the body is is is the ministry or the manifestation of Jesus Christ's Resurrection now in 1960 brother bradam said the same Ministry that the son went down in the same light that he went down in is coming again in the resurrection power now I believe that we're no longer saying that it is coming I believe that we can truly say it is here this this ministry that brother brandham said is is coming the ministry the same Ministry that the sun went down in is here in the resurrection power so uh uh and and you just I pray that we can make some sense uh to you today but we as we have said and and brother brandham talked about it that God made a covenant uh uh in the Old Testament and he also made a covenant in the New Testament with Jesus Christ and remember as we've told talked about it brother brandham talked about when the two when two part come together two men come together to make a covenant they would cut an animal or kill an animal they would cut it in two and then uh uh they would uh the two parties to make that Covenant they would stand in between uh the the the the two halves of this animal and uh uh then they would write a covenant on a piece of paper or whatever they had a parchment uh uh and they they would make this write this Covenant out both of what they agreed to do and then they'd both make a vow an oath that let us be as this dead animal uh if we failed to meet the the uh uh our part of the Covenant responsibilities and then they would tear that uh paper in two and one would keep uh one part the other keep the other part and then they wi that that Covenant was fulfilled uh then they would meet together at that that spot I guess and and um that Covenant uh uh had to dovetail both both halves had to dovetail uh to together and and and so in in other words this the the the the the the Covenant uh now has been brought into its fullness then they meet together and the Covenant has to Dov tail uh together in other words no one can impersonate this dovetail or this this Covenant uh uh brother brandham said to make this Covenant right these two pieces of paper had to dovetail straight together letter by letter for it would be the same piece of paper and he said both pieces had to come exactly the same letter by letter ain't that right so this covenant could not not be duplicated uh or impersonated and so then at at Calvary God makes the Covenant and he he tore Christ apart and he uh uh uh by separating his soul from his body and God raised the body of Jesus Christ on the third day took it up and uh into heaven and he uh set it uh set him on his right hand and then the prophet says on the day of Pentecost he sent down the spirit that was in Jesus Christ and the Covenant is now with the church ain't that right amen amen The Same Spirit that was in Christ is now in the church and so he says see when the church comes together in the Resurrection The Same Spirit that was in Jesus Christ that was tore out of him will have to be in the church you can't copy anything like it you cannot make nothing different from it it's got to be the same holy spirit that dwelt in Christ and when the Rapture comes when that body comes his bride that was tore from him or the Holy Ghost will bring that bride just exactly Dov tail right into the body of Jesus Christ ain't that right so what is the church what is the body it's life of his life bone of his bone flesh of his flesh word of his word power of his power she is him ain't that right so God in Christ fulfilled one part of the Covenant but now it's God in his church fulfilling the other part of the Covenant and when the Rapture comes there will not be one thing left unfulfilled concerning this Bride Can you say Amen she she will fulfill everything that God promised of her amen and so uh when this Covenant is brought into its full strength then this Covenant brother Bram said when a covenant is confirmed with God the church the people that goes in into the body to be his bride will be exactly the same spirit that was upon on Christ doing the same things the same Ministry the same power and it'll come together and be word by word the same confirming the Covenant can you say Amen it cannot be I I I say this now it cannot be impersonated nobody can impersonate this bride no one can make themselves bride she's got to be part of him which is part of the Covenant ain't that right now this is why Luke 17:30 means so much to us the revealing of the son of man for it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we've had ministries of all Roberts and Billy Graham and and and Jack Cole and and a uh AA uh Allen and and on and on and on but this ministry was the revealing of the son of man amen same Ministry so brother brandham says see Christ his ministry is in his bride which is his body the superat Natural Body of his see his spirit is in there living his life right out until him and the church becomes one in the wedding can you say man now we are not going in the Rapture to a wedding we are already married and United with him uh uh here can you say Amen we're going to a merit supper of the lamb but the wedding has taken place here can you say amen amen see so they become one they become one when not when the Rapture takes place they have become one now amen because now it's the same ministry as he had is now in the bride of Christ he takes them just a little minority in the last days can you say Amen now um we know that there are really two Ministries two kinds of ministry in the world God operates one in his body Satan operates the other and and both are able to achieve their purpose by Ministry uh again God operates his ministry through his church which is his body Satan's Ministry operates through his church amen which is his intellectual bride amen now throughout the church uh ages seven Church ages there have been two churches and and uh there there is the church that is the true vine brother brandom calls it the True Vine and then there's the church uh which brother brandham calls the false Vine and and so uh uh then brother BR says see but the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they are one as though there's only one Church in in in the seven Church ages but we understand that he's actually speaking to two churches on one hand he's praising and on the other hand he's rebuking see and so uh uh Revelations 2:23 uh uh God says I will kill her children with death and all the churches everybody say all the churches all the churches see throughout each age see shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and uh and hearts see and so uh uh now brother BR says see this m this scripture makes clear to us that there are churches uh uh and some of those churches most EV dently do not know that he is the one who searcheth the reins and the hearts so he's going to prove to them that is that that is so see and now then what churches will be those that do not know this truth of course it is the false Vine group because the True Believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of God and they being God-fearing judge themselves that they be not judged so then he says why does God call these churches his churches even though they are the false Vine he says the truth of the matter is that they are Christians he said see but they're not Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name of Christ in vain for Mark 7:7 Jesus says how be it in vain do they worship me see teaching for doctrines the Commandments of me ain't that right so he says indeed they are Christians for what else could they be see a Muhammad is a Muhammad see that is his religion no matter how he lives it uh see because he subscribes in theory to what the Quran teaches so he is Muhammad no matter uh uh no matter how he lives and no matter whatever but since he uh uh uh sub uh uh uh uh subscribes in theory to the Quran he is automatically Muhammad see well in the same way a Christian is a Christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the son of God born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is the savior of mankind Etc in fact in the Le oysan age there will be those who call themselves Christians because they because they subscribe to the Fine qualities of Jesus while reserving to themselves the the right to deny his deity see Christian Scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel he is a nominal Christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer for that kind of a Believer is one who has been baptized into the body of Christ and is a me M of him can you say Amen so so then we find this is where the tears and the wheat they're planted in the same field they grow up together they they they receive the same blessings of the Sun the rain and and and all of these things but by seed they're totally different and God says don't tear up the tears let them grow up together can you sayen see so we find this is a prophet IC of the false Vine being planted in the same as as the True Vine in the same time and and and and these things so now this false Vine started in the first church age amen and and Revelations 2 and 1 it says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden C candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canest not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars can you say Amen well this first church age it it it actually started uh 30 years or so after the day of Pentecost and amen and uh so it didn't start uh uh that long afterward and already the false Vine had been planted amen and and and this church amen and I'm just taking excerpts of the the the church age book but this church had already left its first love meaning that it had fallen from its origin which was Pentecost ain't that right but but no matter what it was amen and the church did fall but there was always an elect out of the each age amen that were true to what they believed and and knew to be the truth can you sayen but this church had falling amen this is where this V Vine come falling from their first love amen uh which was uh uh Pentecost uh fallen from its origin a Pentecost and and and so brother BR said this church was in danger of being taken away from the leading of the Holy Spirit the control of the spirit and it's the same thing that happened after Moses took the uh uh children of Israel out of Egypt amen see uh uh God had provided Israel amen a a a a pillar of fire amen a cloud a prophetic prophetic utterance Miracles and signs and god-given wonders to lead the people ain't that right amen that was God's perfect plan was was Vindication after Vindication Supernatural Vindication amen and and the prophet said this was to be done by God Select god ordained and God equipped and God sent men with the whole Camp being dominated by a holy ghost move ain't that right but the people rebelled amen and they asked amen for a set of rules and Creeds to go by amen they wanted something else than just to follow God's Vindicated prophet and message of the hour and he said see then they wanted to be exactly like the world and they went into complete apostasy and Oblivion ain't that right well this is how the first church age started see amen each and each age uh afterward just got worse and worse and worse until the holy spirit is completely rejected in this age and God Must Destroy amen the people the world can you say amen amen so we we find this false Vine it was planted in the first church age it started out as the Deeds of the nicians then it become a Doctrine then it become a standard then it become uh uh an unbending way that that you had to either believe this or you weren't part of us and and uh uh these things and so and and brother Braham says it finally took over and God was pushed aside now we're not talking about the body of Christ we're talking about the the what the vine that Satan had planted ain't that right and he says it started out small quietly and inoffensively it looked good it seemed very sound then it caught and like a python it it it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church amen see and so this tells us that the false Vine Works in subtility in deception in it it it it comes in in in such an approach that people don't even understand amen what is coming their way or what they're getting involved in and and these things so look look at what Paul would say in in Colossians 2 and6 he says beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the traditions of men after the r rudiments of the world and not after Christ ain't that right beware why amen you you would think well if it was just one church then then you wouldn't have to worry about these things but here is trying to warn that elect be aware of what's coming be aware of what's happening in in Philippian uh uh I believe Philippians 3 And1 Paul writes finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not Grievious but for you it is safe Paul's writings were safe Paul's warnings were safe can you say amen amen see be be Ware of dogs beware of evil workers Beware of the concision see amen see so then Paul would write a false Brethren who were brought in unaware look at Jude uh 3 and 4 uh he warns the church saying beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith now church if there's ever a time to earnestly contend for the faith that's been restored it is now it is not time to get laxed it's not time to say well I'm in a mess's church amen Satan's Satan he he his arms reach all the way in message churches too can you say Amen see so earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints don't let anyone down this message to you can you say Amen don't let anyone degrade this message to you yes sir see this message is to bring you back to the faith that was once delivered he says for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men they can range from preachers they can arrange from deacons musicians uh uh people sitting in the audience and yet Paul would call them Brethren or men crept in awes uh ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ so then we find as we've talked before that the false Vine is an angel of Light until it gets a hold of you that's what the prophet said the false Vine is an angel of Light until it gets a hold of you now brother Brown says this I believe in leadership but it is not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word see I believe also that God has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sins to take charge but that rule is by the word so that it is not men really ruling but the spirit of God for the word and spirit are one can you say Amen see so then we find amen that Paul in in Hebrews 13 and7 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation ain't that right see so the the the false Vine a man was getting a hold of a church see a hold in the church and was teaching that leadership by man was right see well and and and and and it's it's uh uh God uses men for leadership but when they get out of the word then they have no right to lead ain't that right amen see so so they were teaching leadership by man amen but see like like Moses Moses was called of God ordained of God to lead the people amen out of Egypt he was a Vindicated Prophet but then there arose dathan and Kora and balum amen they rosed up in their Ministries their gifts and whatever they would have amen none of them compared to what Moses had now you think of that none of them had the pill glorifier none of them was Vindicated like Moses was and yet in their Ministry they were able to deceive the people and draw them away from Moses see so the prophet says the these men amen took upon themselves to be the leader of the people God did not place them as Leaders they took it upon themselves to be leader of the people and what did they do they caus the people to to split from Moses Who was the Vindicated of God ain't that right see so their leadership was not inspired of the spirit it was not Vindicated of the spirit their leadership was intellectual reasoning and not God inspired ain't that right so instead of these men using their influence to bring the people in unity around the word of the hour to Rally them around God's Vindicated leadership they took it upon themselves to divide the people amen and brought in chaos and caused the people to disbelieve Moses to Grumble against Moses to murmur against God and and all of these things and we know that even God was going to kill them all amen uh uh just got tired of it you know which he did those god well God did draw the line in the sand and and and those that were with Moses had to come with Moses and those that were with Kora and all of these things and and the Earth swallowed those that were with Kora and and and them swallowed them up and so is it today the world is swallowing those up amen that turn against this message of the hour can you say Amen see so in in the church first church age men who were of that false Vine taught that the church had to be governed and I want to say this today that Satan is never against leadership he's only against the leadership that God has ordained amen but he's not against leadership at all no man who takes the people away from the message is against leadership as long as they're following them and not the Vindicated prophet of the hour no man who splits a church is against leadership they'll talk against the pastor they'll R you know get people away from the pastor but they want to be the pastor they want to be the leader they want to be the one that influences amen the people that they have gathered see so see that's what was happening in the in the first church age and it's always happened amen see they taught a control over the people but instead of doing it God's way they simply took Authority and vested all the spiritual power in their own hands and come out with the Holy priesthood standing between God and the people see they went right back to the old aonic uh system they became Antichrist everybody say they became Antichrist they became Antichrist for they disposed of his meteor uh meteor ship and imposed their own they done Away With Jesus Christ as being the mediator and they became the mediator oh my and God hated that the Ephesians hated that and any True Believer will hate it too see he says that separated the people God's people are supposed to be one by one one Spirit everybody say by one Spirit are they all baptized into one body and everyone everyone is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost and everyone is to participate in the worship of God but men wanted the preeminent so they took over control and Bishops became archbishops and with imposing titles they bypassed the word of God and taught their own doctrines see they got the people to obey them until the time came that the way of worship did not in any way at all resemble the early days after Pentecost see these Deeds were the beginning of apostolic succession it took the people from the experience at Pentecost it took them from the book of Acts right can you say Amen see it was the false Vine so brother BR says see from Apostolic secession it was one easy and quick step to church membership you you got to belong to the church by membership see and as and and they take that as the means of Saving Grace so the word was reduced to a Creed Antichrist by his Spirit was predominating the church the false Vine can you say amen amen so the people are led by people brother Bram says this the people are led by people who presume to be what they are not see amen see they they say they're called they say they're Vindicated they say Amen but they're really not and the people follow that stuff you understand what I'm saying so the leadership of man takes the people away from the word of God God ordained men will never take amen the the people away from the word of God Amen but the false Vine does take the people away from the word of God the false Vine takes the people away amen from their faith in God to where the people's faith is in in in that individual can't have Revival unless the individual's there can't get my healing unless that individual prays for me you know you know I I don't know if I'm going to make it but if that individual can tell me that he saw something and and he can prophesy over me I'll I'll be doing better amen see leadership of men takes the people from the word of God brother Bram never took us from the word of God but he put our faith in the word of God can you say amen amen so they take people away from the word of God this is how the church went from Jesus name baptism to baptizing in titles this is how it went from believing in one God to believing in three persons of one God see there and there's no such thing in the Bible but now in this age it's accepted as the word and and and if you if you say that that you know and you quote what the prophet says that Devil's travel in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost he travels in them titles amen that just blows most people's minds Amen to even come up against that and say that amen because now it is accepted as a way of life it is not it's a false Vine that was planted in the first church age about it so then you find for a man to belong to an organization any organization and preach the truth that organization will put him out cuz you cannot stay in there and still be led by God ain't that right see now the prophet said God never did associate Saint and Satan's church together God leads his church he does not expect political leaders to lead them and not even Church politics to lead them God leads his own people can you say Amen yes sir see so the Apostle Paul saw this happening in the first church age and notice what he said in Acts 20 and 27 for I have not shunn to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock man can you imagine people claiming to be an ordained of God and they don't care about uh uh about the Sheep at all they're going to preach their own ideas their own ways they'll scatter the flock so he said see not sparing the flock also of your own selves amen right among you shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them so see Paul warned the elect he warns the elect about this subtle priesthood coming and taking over with its false doctrines and he knew that they would implement a new way of worship that would exclude the people from having any part in a holy spirit Ministry and and so now it was it was the only the priesthood that was spiritual it was only the the priesthood that was holy it was only certain ones you you you understand and the people became more deprived of the spirit of God they become more ignorant of the word of God they become more to where they didn't even have a clue of what the word of God speaks this is why God would have to send a prophet to to take us back to original word amen amen so brother brand says see even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there's not too much freedom in the leoty and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries tries to absorb it see he said but here we we find where Paul would tell us and he taught that all when all come together and all all had the leading of the Holy Spirit and all participated in spiritual worship now this is what Paul would teach that New Testament Church that all would come together and when they did come together all participated in spiritual worship and the leading of the holy spirit amen can you say Amen that's right that's why the pastor doesn't do it all he God didn't ordain the pastor to be the trustee and the Deacon and the and and and the you know the sound guy and the one that's always the one prophesying and you know and and and um um speaking in tongues and and interpreting prophecy and and all that these are gifts to the church amen praise the Lord and can you say amen amen now Bible History teaches us that every time God gives a visitation of the Holy Spirit and the people get free it doesn't take long before they bind themselves back to what they came out of and and and we know and we're seeing it right before us that every denomination every organization is going back to to the mother Harlot the they're they're all going back and joining themselves with the Catholic Church ain't that right and brother you know the Bible calls her the mother of harlots and John spoke of her in Revelation 17 and5 as being mystery babblin the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth see so now we know by the message that the harlots are these denominations they they didn't come what didn't receive that same experience as as Pentecost did baptized into the body can you say amen God started his church on the day of Pentecost a ain't that right amen see Satan bypassed Pentecost amen and started his church there see so he says see the harlots uh he saids see they set as the word aside deny the work of the spirit of God subjugate the leoty and make it impossible for the leoty to worship God unless they come through them or through their pattern which is nothing but a blueprint of unbelief from Satan himself can you say Amen so we we look of how far the church has wandered and I again I'm I'm I'm speaking of a false Vine of how that it is wandered uh so far from from uh the the the first church uh there at Pentecost and brother Braham say see Pentecost is nowhere View and the word cannot be found Trinity cannot be found in the word of God do you believe that see Apostolic succession is cannot be found in the word of God Amen shaking a preacher's hand or to be saved as a way of Salvation or joining uh writing your name on belonging to a church and and and putting your name on the roll there's nowhere in the word of God for that to be the means of us making it to Heaven Can you say Amen formalism is not in the word of God a dead lifeless religion is not found in the word of God a powerless religion is not found in the word of God accepting emotions as a way of spirituality is not found in the word of God when it uh uh because you know uh uh people have these emotions and things and yet they deny the very fact of having an experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's not found in the word of God can you say Amen so we find that that that formalism started in the first church age amen by the so-called apostles who had only a form of godliness and notice what the prophet said they began to break to kind of break down the people under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and began to cause people to kind of make fun of them so their their whole motive was to turn the people against the true elect that really had a true baptism of the Holy Ghost a man that moved under the leadership of the Holy Ghost hello amen they they they believed in the gifts Paul says this in there they believed in in tongues they believed in interpretation of tongues and they done it under Paul's Ministry where he set the church in order amen and they they they were led by the spirit they moved under the spirit and this this false Vine moved the people away from that and to where they began to make fun of it it's happening again so these men who claim to be apostles were not and they were proven to be Liars can you say Amen now if you notice that happened in the first church age but look in the second Church age God exposes the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not and God said they are the synagogue of Satan see so now now uh again just uh taking it from the church age uh Church ages here the word Jews does not describe the religion of the Jewish people it only refers to the Jewish people and has the same meaning as you know me being American born see so these people were saying that they were real true Jews by birth and and they were not and they were not Jews by religion either brother brand says what it is they were a deceit people who were already part of the church they belonged to the false Vine oh can you say Amen so they were not of the true church for God says they were the synagogue of Satan now notice now the the word synagogue it doesn't have the same meaning as the word church for the word church means called out ones summonsed ones ain't that right see this is where uh uh Psalm 654 it says blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causest to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts that's the Church of the Living God that's the body of of of Christ ain't that right who makes up that body of Christ those that have been called out by God those that have been summonsed by God but this of a synagogue he says see it's a synagogue of Satan well synagogue is just a assembly or a gathering see not not a not a calling out not not a summons it's just they're gathered there they're they're assembled there which can be good and and it can be bad see uh uh but in this case uh uh the assembling of this people is bad for they are an assembly of Satan they are a gathering of their own selves can you say Amen this Gathering of them is not of God God didn't call them God didn't summons them they just came and gathered and were of the synagogue of Satan now this is exactly what Isaiah 54:15 uh uh uh said here behold they Shall Gather surely gather together but not by me can you say man they will gather together but not by me whosoever Shall Gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake so in the first church age and then now the second Church age this synagogue of Satan was the Gathering of the nicians ain't that right see so in the first church Church age there were those who were saying that they were Apostles but were proven to be lying in the second Church age there were those who were claiming to be Jews of in religion see and and these things but they were not so they were lying now now notice amen uh uh who who is the father of Lies isn't that what Jesus said the devil Satan is the father of Lies so then then it's not strange me that those who are part of his synagogue that Gathering are liars as well there's no truth in him you know I looked up the word Li it means to speak deliberate falsehoods to deceive one by a lie so brother Braham said see who who is it that shall attempt to deceive the very elect why the spirit of antichrist in the false anointed ones of this last day these false ones have already come in jesus' name claiming that they have been anointed of God for the last day they are false Messiahs anointed ones they claim that they are prophets but but are they one with the word never right have they added to or taken from it see see so no one denies that the spirit of God manifesting in gifts is upon them but like balam they have they they all have their programs make their appeal for money exercise gift but deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain yet they preach salvation and deliverance through the power of God just like Judas with the ministry imparted by Christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have a wrong Spirit motivating them religious oh my they outshine the elect in effort and Zeal but it is leot ofan and not of Christ for it looks for big crowds big programs startling signs among them see they preach the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of a prophet messenger though in power and signs and true Revelation he Eclipse them all see ah yes this false spirit that in the last days is so close to the real and can only be distinguished by its deviation from the word and when ever it is caught in being anti- word it falls back on the one argument we've already shown to be false we get results don't we so we have to be of God yeah that's what they say now second Timothy 3 and3 Paul would write and say but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceiving being deceived but continue that th everybody say continue thou continue thou in the things which thou Hast learned and H has been assured of knowing amen of whom thou Hast learned them amen knowing of whom yes that makes a difference amen now God allows them to deceive and I'm reminded of the time that Ahab and Jehoshaphat made an alliance together and Jehoshaphat wanted to know if they should go to war or not and want to know what was going on he kind of felt a little uneasy so he asked Ahab you have someone you know to to tell us what we should do so Ahab got his 400 prophets right now God's looking upon this assembly God's looking on this Gathering and we we find that that they the the 400 Prophet said go up go up go up God's with you yes God's given us the land and and and Jehoshaphat been halfway spiritual says H that don't sound right you have any anyone else yeah any true prophet and he well I got one he's in prison he said but he he always speaks bad of me I don't like him well I I I I ain't going to move until you send him I want to hear what he has to say you know so Micaiah you know the the guard told him says now everybody's telling him to go up go up you say the same thing you know if if you want to live and you want to prosper in your ministry you know and so he uh he well I can only say what the Lord puts in my mouth and so uh Mah goes up there going up going up yay the Lord's with you going up you know and and King's like heab like all right come on man now we all both know you've never agreed with anything I do you know so I don't understand why you're doing this now what do you really got to say about it right and notice notice the in First Kings 22 and 19 the prophet Micaiah says Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord I Saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the hosts of Heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left and the Lord said who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at rth Gilead and one said on this manner and another said on that manner and there came forth the spirit and stood before the Lord and says I will persuade him and the Lord said unto him how how you going to do this and he said well I'll go forth and I'll be a lying spirit in the mouth of all of his prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade him and Prevail that's right go forth and do so ain't that right yeah so if you notice that lying Spirit could not get on that true Prophet amen for the word of the Lord only comes to a prophet amen amen but he says I'll get on all of his prophets ahab's prophets and so there there were prophets that were that were ahab's which were inspired of the devil that that aying Spirit came on him them to deceive Ahab right ain't that right see and so so here we find you know one might think that it'd be unfair that that God would send a lying Spirit to deceive Ahab but notice the true story God sent Ahab a true Prophet first yeah Elijah and Ahab wouldn't listen to that man right he he listened to his wife that was a The Jezebel yeah and and so you know uh uh the word of the Lord would come to Elijah and and and he would give it to Ahab and Ahab would do totally different he didn't care ain't that right see and and and so even it was in his heart uh as as I told you you know there in First Kings 22 and8 Ahab said of this Prophet mcka I hate him for he do not prophesy good concerning me but evil the truth was evil to him every time that true Prophet would speak the word of the Lord Ahab would see it as evil instead of saying you know that is the truth I Repent I humble myself I turn around my evil ways they looked he looked at it as he's always striking against me he's always preaching at me he's always trying to destroy him he hates me no it's the word of the Lord that's right right so then to keep from having to hear the voice of God he tries to silence him by throwing him in prison and so is it today God has sent a prophet in this age but the world has rejected the voice of the Lord therefore he has sent a lying Spirit to deceive the world can you say Amen you look at it 2 Thessalonians 2 and7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now lth will let until he speaking of the Bride be taken out of the way you say well that's a he there not a she well the prophet said she is him ain't that right identifying who she really is right then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him who's coming is after the working of Satan with all power signs and lines wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved for this cause shall God send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie and that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness how awful would it be to attend church and yet be Anointed with the spirit of deception right amen or to read the Bible and the spirit of deception interpret it to you thank God for a prophet and thank God for a heart to believe what a prophet said Thank God to be able to Humble ourselves say God if you said it it's there then can you say Amen not that I would stand and the judge a prophet for the prophet said no man judged a prophet Isaiah never stood there to be judged by man right his word was to judge men can you say Amen so brother Bram said see so many people are listening to enticing Spirits instead of taking the word of God Spirits they're in the world they're demons and they go out into places and they get amongst men ministers they get amongst church members they get amongst good people and they cause them to come into an illusion and they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that's contrary to the word of of God I think everything that I've said here makes this bride shine so much greater am for there's only one people that cannot be deceived and that's the elect amen can you say amen amen now not to keep you much longer but having a Ministry is important amen but being a part of the body of Christ is even more important the Lord can you say amen amen being positionally placed in that body and we know that by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body but a man can have a Ministry and not be in that body yeah Judas had a Ministry did yes he did but he did not go to Pentecost and that's where he failed he showed his colors at p cost can you say amen amen so then we find that the body is the Church of the Living God it's not a group of people that is just assembling themselves but it's a people that have been called out and summonsed aren't you glad you've been called yes sir you've been summoned amen you're an elect of God see here at Faith Tabernacle anyone can come anyone can assemble themselves here the make believer the unbeliever the True Believer it's it's it's everyone sure that sits can sit here this morning or wherever can you say amen and anything can gather the make believer and the unbeliever brother BR said some come to criticize some come just to make fun some come out of curiosity some come uh you know because they they they they don't want to you know go to hell some they they they come for all reasons can you say Amen but notice but the church the bride is United by one God under one Spirit the spirit of God in whole one holy Union of God to be one holy bride to God that's right all together unify un of the bodyall the body waiting as a bride as it is the Bride As we call ourselves the bride for the uniting time of the Bride the church is so coming together it should create just a love Among Us that we could hardly be away from one another that's right see when you just see you don't have to beg people to pray you don't have to beg them amen to worship God you don't have to beg them to do what's right they're just so in love with him tell there's nothing else that's the body of Christ they're under a headship amen that's right it ain't gifts that we worry about it's not Ministry that we worry about the lord it's relationship with God that we worry about it's getting ourselves in such a contract condition to where we can be sensitive to his leadership amen that's the body of Christ cuz they're under headship he's the one that's going to take care of them he promised you know you see all these guys getting so caught up in these politics sad the same message people do it get caught up in politics as if the life will be better for them didn't your headship of the body that we claim to be part of already promised he'd supply all of our needs according to his riches and Glory not Trump's riches not Biden's riches under his riches can you say Amen remember when the king of the the kings of the earth wanted to bless Abraham and bestow riches upon him and he says no I don't want I don't want nothing of you he is my true reward he is my shield and buckler can you say Amen see so our headship is Christ he promises to supply all of our needs he's the one that said I am the god that Health thee can you say amen and if you notice what gathers that elect God is always in His prophets to gather the [Applause] elect amen look at Noah he gathered that little group yes amen from the rest of the world and he was willing to be called all kinds of names but it didn't matter amen God would send him to gather that people ain't that right Moses gathered them Paul gathered aren't you glad for that amen Church represents woman as we know and of course that Faline Satan Synagogue Church is at harlot system that ill famed what mother mother Harlot but the Bible calls the Church the true church the elect lady amen think of that that's right that that Gathering of her her she she's so gathered by a summons that that that the writer would recognize her not just the church but the elect lady the prophet called her missgrace yes sir praise the Lord that's right Amen brother BR said she is called the elected lady because among all the women she was chosen amen ain't that right like God chose Mary a virgin girl to bring forth the body of God upon the Earth so the church is the elected lady which is the bride of Christ to produce Christ can you say amen amen and so every individual that makes up this body is elected called Chosen and she been baptized by one Spirit into this one body and the new birth that has come to you is not by your your own works not what you have merited not what you have deserved but by God's election God foreordained to give you the Holy Ghost before you was ever born he he knew that can you say amen he ordained it so it wasn't that that that you just happened to stumble into this message God ordained you for this time God ordained you to be part of this body there's going to be somebody on this Earth that reflect the word of God can you say amen amen so being that the woman represents the church brother Braham says then we can watch the conditions and the conduct of women and you'll see where where the church is if you'll see the conduct of women in the world today watch the conduct of the worldly church today when you see women go just go on the Rampage just doing anything they want to do see uh watch the church is doing the same thing that's right it's rare for women to submit under headship today that's right amen they first of all they want to shack up together don't want to get married because of no com commitments amen hello true then when they do to get married they don't want no headship going to do my own thing husband does his own thing that is not the way God ordained a marriage to be can you say Amen but it's becoming more common among the women of the world today because there's a church just exactly like her yes headship has come and she's refused A headship amen that's true that's right see but watch brother Bram says see when the spiritual bride when she becomes to begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watch that little bride watch that little lady that's what you sisters represent don't compete with the world ladies don't let that Spirit of the world get on you amen amen cuz remember what a prophet said they're representing a worldly Church you're representing God's Church that spiritual bride amen can you say amen he says then watch then again how you see that scripture how that the scriptures at that time there will be a message everybody say there will be a message sweep out to catch that bride to catch that woman elect and have we not received that message yes we have we've received it it's Gathering Gathering can you say amen amen do you love the Lord am amen you know the first woman there Eve she was a prefigure of the church today as to where she come from as to who she was and what Spirit was in her amen and Genesis 1:26 says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness the 27th verse says so God created man in his own image and in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so man in his Spirit was both f fine and masculine Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nostrils the breath of life and man become a living Soul 18th verse and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meat for him you realize that's that's that's what the church is to be is an help meate to the Lord Jesus the Lord his Ministry carrying on his ministry his work 21st verse and the Lord God cused the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and God took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man right she was Adam right her name was Adam a that right amen now we know that the natural Eve fell but God purposed within himself to bring forth a spiritual Eve that would never fall never fall can you say amen amen amen but the only way he could get her and bring her into existence is he had to come himself as bridegroom Hallelujah and now we have come out of him left of Flesh word of his word power of his power Spirit of his Spirit see God when he made that woman he did not take anything outside of Adam he brought it into from Adam and he divided the spirit of Adam divided the masculine part and took the feminist part of Adam and put it in the woman ain't that right and this is why the body of Christ has to have the very same spirit as Christ amen because God promised in this age to take a people out of the Gentiles for his name prise the Lord you do you're not an accident when God promised to take a people out of the Gentiles for his name he had you in mind amen you're that elect lady yes sir I believe can you say Amen you're not just a person with gifts you're not just a person with the healing campaign working miracles prophesying speaking in tongues and all these things but you're one that is subject to all of these gifts in the body under headship amen and that body is the word body word body can you say Amen Lord you love the Lord amen amen so we have those that you know that yeah they're they're working things they're doing things it's around the world but they're without a headship because they've not been in the body if the musicians will come thank God for that headship amen the prophet said we've come through a day of churchianity we've come we've had just enough light to believe on him to accept Christ join Church build our organizations but Zechariah 14:7 says in the evening time it shall be light and brother Bram says what is it what what is that scripture talking about which we know that this scripture is is is for our day but he said it's god making up his bride Body by pouring out the same evidence on the western people that was poured out on the Eastern people yes the same power the same things that was poured out in the Eastern is now poured out upon the Western and God took the rib Prophet said under Adam from under Adam's side and he made Eve out of it so he did the same thing taken out of the sight of Christ the blood and water and Christ is the word and is taking the word and making up his church eeve aren't you glad for that I love the Lord and what has she been identified not just as a church anymore but she's been identified as Miss Jesus Christ amen bone of his bone flesh of his his flesh I hope that we can see the position that we are in by being part of the body of Christ being that word body see you don't have to come out from under the word to be something actually when you come out from under the word Satan's got you and then it's death then it doesn't matter if you prophesy speak in tongues see Visions see angels whatever if you come out from under the word then then it it is no effect at all amen true we would rather be under the headship of the word and be under the inspiration of the word be under the dictates of the word right everything lined up with the the word the church lined up with the word our homes Our lives our ministry everything our gifts everything that is done let it be lined up with the word of God want amen can you say am man amen you know when you think of the Pentecost and you think of the churches in the nominal and things it looks like maybe we're not just doing much at all God's bride just doesn't seem to be doing much which first of all the prophet of God says that this revival Brides Revival won't be a public show that's right but it seemed like maybe they're they're they're they're

of iniquity I never knew you all right can you amen amen I'd rather be the one that whatever we do it really counts that God says that's my approval I approve that amen you love the Lord yes sir amen
