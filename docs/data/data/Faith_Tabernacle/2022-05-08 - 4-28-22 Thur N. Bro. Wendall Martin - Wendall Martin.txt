and amen god bless you you may be seated amen now this um nighttime air is a little bit rough on on my voice and and uh so y'all just help me pray for my amen my voice so just stay with me here praise the lord this is a wonderful psalm that we had just read this is a bride song this this is a psalm that correlates with revelations 5 where they sung a new song because this is a day tonight is not the typical church service amen of the last seven ages amen while they worship god under the toning lamb yes they were anticipating the future they were looking forward to the resurrection but i say tonight that the bride is singing a new song amen the lion has roared and the seven thunders have been heard amen and what was the mysterious dark amen symbols has now been unsealed and the people of god has yesterday behind us with all of the bondages denominationalism and there is an elect who has come out of those dark tombs of denominations and they are standing afresh and revived in the presence of the lord the way that god had it at pentecost can you say amen amen i say today our souls have heard the voice come out of her my people that you receive not of her plagues can you say amen i say tonight what a fellowship amen we sing the song what a fellowship what a joy divine leaning on those everlasting arms of god amen can we all say tonight that god has been good to us amen god has been good to us hallelujah i don't care whether you're in a valley tonight god's been good to you i don't care whether you're walking in the valley of decision god has been good to you you may be walking through the valley of the shadow of death tonight i don't know but god's been good to you because you have heard a voice in the darkness you've heard a voice in this hour that says come up higher what can you say man amen psalms 92 and 1 it says it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord and to sing praises unto his name uh is uh of the most high to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning and i have faithfulness every night amen upon an instrument of ten strings upon the salt triple on the harp a solemn sound for thou lord has made me glad so so it's not the music that's making you glad hallelujah it's not some kind of fancy singing that's making you glad that thou has made me glad amen oh amen the critics will say well amen it's just preachers working people up and amen it's just singers working people out but i want to tell you we are rejoicing in the king the king we have found favor with the king and he has made me glad oh are you glad here tonight if you're not glad let me show you my king if you're not rejoicing tonight let me tell you one who can give you joy who can give you peace oh hallelujah amen for thou hast made me glad through thy work i will triumph in the work of thine hands o lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep he says a brutish man or a stupid man a dull-hearted unreceptive man knoweth not neither duff a fool understand this hallelujah but when the wicked spring has the grass and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish it is that they shall be destroyed forever for thou lord art most high forever for lo thine enemies o lord lo thine enemies shall all perish and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered but my strength shall thou exalt like the horn of a unicorn and i shall be anointed with fresh oil i i'm talking about a bride that's rejoicing i'm talking about a god that has been waiting for this season to get here i'm talking about a god who has seen the seven ages and he foretold the seven ages but he also told what was going to happen in this generation hallelujah well come on now amen it's incredible that brother branham says that the opening of the seven seals is when everything must worship amen why because she has come to her finality amen it's a people who has caught a glimpse of who they are oh come on church amen i would say to you amen you know it's nothing different than what it was there in jesus day amen when when the worship was going on amen jesus was amen coming through riding on a donkey amen and they were throwing out the garments and cutting down the tree limbs amen and everyone was rejoicing everyone was shouting and the rest of the city was saying who is this what is going on where is their church manners amen this ain't church order what can you say amen but they were fulfilling zachariah hallelujah i want to say today if you want to know what's going on tonight amen it's not a bunch of hooping and hollering it is the word being vindicated it's the anointing of the day resting upon the bride of jesus christ the bride has come to her light she has come to her fullness she is his desire hallelujah oh can you say that and when jesus came amen according to zechariah 9 and 9 it says rejoice greatly somebody say it with me rejoice greatly oh daughter of zion shout somebody say shout out turn to that neighbor that's that's a little bit annoyed at you right now and said the bible told me to shout ah shout o daughter of zion thy king cometh unto thee [Applause] well they looked over there amen john's disciples came to jesus and said man why ain't your disciples mourning we're fasting every day we're amen we're going around all sad and gloomy amen jesus turned around and said hey man you don't the bride isn't going to be all gloomy when she's got the bridegroom the dad ain't going to go glue me around with a frown amen i want to tell you it is time to rejoice it is time to rise this is your predestinated hour come on church of zion amen the anointing is upon you to make this word to live [Applause] hallelujah i said hallelujah hallelujah i don't think i need to stop to remind you of the day we're living in i don't think i have to let you know that the seals have been opened [Applause] i don't think i need to tell you it's time to worship i i don't think it's it's necessary for me to go back through amen this opening of the seals because you know this happened we're living in the hour the twilight zone we're living in the hour where all creation has been longing for we're in the hour where you are fixing to take full possession of this earth again [Applause] we've heard the eagles scream that eagle scream has has screamed out oh that that eagle scream is a man it is still screaming and it's still calling and it's saying come up hither he meant at the end of the layout of sin church age a door was open in the heavens and amen a voice is heard and the scream the voice is saying come up hither and i will show you things which must be hereafter amen let me just tell you something it is a call of the seed of god back into the heavenlies it's a call not to some station not to some denomination amen not to some church order it is a call to your position in jesus christ amen are y'all listening to me it's a place amen it's a rank a position is a place it's a rank and god is calling us out of laodicea into a bright age if you will aiming out of gloom out of them oh come on now amen out of even denominationalism amen and skepticism but god is calling you up into a realm amen with faith amen it's nothing but all things possible it's nothing but god and his church oh church of the living god if you're needing healing here tonight you can have it if you're needing deliverance here tonight you can have it [Applause] it's a return back to your position [Applause] what's my position go back and look at adam [Applause] i praise the lord what's my position it's authority it's dominion it's god's living here on the earth it's the power of elohim living in you now i know that when the church raptures amen and we're caught away satan comes down but i say today we have already mounted up on the wings of an eagle hallelujah because the flying eagle has screamed that flying eagle amen has screamed come up out of that chicken pin get out of that chicken pen well praise the lord amen you don't belong in that chicken pen you're ordained to see things differently than others see it if you come up higher don't learn this message in a seminary fashion don't sit there and listen to the messages and eman and get your computer and amen and and type in and get all of your favorite quotes together amen but i'm giving you not another earthbound creature but i'm giving you a heavenly anointing i'm going to take you above spurgeon i'm going to take you above fine amen now fanny i'm going to take you above amen these other great men of god they were all under the man age but i'm

god and he fell oh with god are y'all hearing me today amen god's not calling you to sit in a church he's not calling you to just a man a preacher he's not calling you i'm gonna tell you he's calling you to rise i say it's time to rise it's time to rise under the anointing of this day you're ordained to see things differently some of you've been set in a message church and you see things no differently than you did in the baptist church it's another man's opinion it's another idea it's a better frame of mind but god's calling eagles back to her position [Applause] come on up higher he's asking tonight come up higher hallelujah i'll show you who you are i'll show you where you came from i'll show you what's going to happen i'll show you what i'll show you how you got in the chicken pin to begin with [Applause] if you just come on up higher i'll explain the whole thing right now you're just looking at boring aiming barns and buildings and outhouses and amen come up higher come up hell there's another wall there's another anointing there's the grace of god for you [Applause] two thousand years ago the lamb paid the price of redemption he's been interceding for 2000 years [Applause] but because we had an eagle and because we're we're riding upon the revelation of an eagle [Applause] amen god has shown us hallelujah that the bloody lamb is going to come out of intercession amen well praise the lord amen he's going to take the title deed of the earth that's been redeemed he's going to rip off the seals are y'all with me he's going to hand that open book to the seventh church age messenger [Applause] and then the prophet's going to declare it to the elect of that church [Applause] and through divine revelation the bride is going to take that book uh you said now i thought we took it from the angel amen the the mighty angel i i want to tell you it was the mighty angel speaking through the seventh angel well come on church where is the mighty angel he is in your [Applause] oh come on hallelujah i ain't got much voice but i'm going to scream it out to you anyway hallelujah amen yes the mighty angel came down to a seventh angel amen but when he declared the word you're commanded to take the book eat the book because now you are going to prophesy you are going to beat devil's heart hallelujah in my name they'll cast out devils in my name they'll heal the sick in my name come on church in my name they'll make a rapture [Applause] through that divine revelation you have been empowered by god to speak the words [Applause] where is the third pool you are the third pool you and the message have become one [Applause] you want to know why we're rejoicing it's because we can see you want to know why we're shouting [Applause] look over that baptist sitting next to you and say it's going to get better than this hallelujah hallelujah amen you're not an earthbound bird you are the royal seed of abraham you're living from glory to glory

there's some people sitting in the church they got their they got their message books oh they love brother branham they love hey oh and they love to defend brother branham when you're taking all of the glory away from him instead of putting it on the word which is in a bride [Applause] revelations 10 7 it was one voice revelations 9 10 and 11 is is the anointing upon the bride [Applause] now you can sit around being defensive you can sit around being defensive all you want but all god is asking of this age is to produce what you said you've got [Music] i praise the lord all god is asking oh god you you you don't even have to provide the spark he will if you got the true gasoline and you let the anointing of the holy spirit come upon you your poor she's gonna be walking down riding down the road how can you say amen hallelujah but there's too many people that ain't got the goods and when you ain't got the goods then you become a good old church of christ amen saying the miracles was only for the prophet amen that the miracles were only there to vindicate his message there's only one thing that's going to vindicate his message today and that's his pride and the anointing of the holy ghost upon the pride of jesus christ amen will defeat the devil any place anywhere under any condition come on church you're anointed for this [Applause] why are you sputtering around all defeated why are you sputtering around going from church to church if you get the goods in your gas tank god is here to vindicate what he's got in you you get the you get the correct gas in it

down to god's soul-filling station and let the anointing of the holy ghost you need to quit taking this message according to some amen doctor of message interpretation and you need to go back and listen to those tapes the way the holy ghost preached them you need to listen to that message the way the prophet said it in my name you will do the greater works oh come on church we're not one of these we are the bride of jesus there's an anointing on you today [Applause] greater work shall you do greater work shall you do [Applause] [Music] [Applause] well they used to do it back then well it was done in the amen the old testament you know at the beginning of the church did you know it's the church of christ that says that those miracles of the apostles were simply the framework [Applause] it was the scaffold that we don't need it anymore [Applause] some of you sitting here and you think you're quoting you're thinking you think you you think you're defending william branham and you're nothing more than a glorified church of christ you are bound by a denominational devil and you would have been the one screaming out crucify him you would have been the one saying who is this what's going on but there is a people that have been elevated somebody say hallelujah [Applause] somebody say thank you jesus somebody say i'm enjoying the heights of the heavens [Applause] oh it's a glorious day come on church amen what did brother branham say he says when you get the correct interpretation of the scripture it is the manifestation of the name of god it's the manifestation amen you're not just talking about a name you're not just wishing you had a name amen but god gave you the best thing he sent a messenger he sent an eagle so that you could see who you are you've got to have the correct interpretation you've got to have and understand what the scripture is saying because you you you and you are the ones that's going to bring on this rapture [Applause] anything that's ever talked about our day i want you to catch anything that is talking about our day is talking about joy even joel 2 23 be glad then ye children of zion rejoice in the lord your god somebody say be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former ring moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first months and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore unto you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the pomegranate my great army and ye shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god oh come on church [Music] you shall eat and plenty and be satisfied punch your neighbor tell him he's hitting you good again and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that i was with the prophet you shall know that a long time ago god done wondrous works quit amen in me if i'm not preaching scripture and you shall know that i'm in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed [Applause] if you don't understand what john the revelator was crying about the church looked like it was going down it looked like the tree was going to be totally defeated it it looked as as though the deed amen even though it was redeemed even though the inheritance was paid for even though christ paid the money it it seemed [Music] that satan wasn't ever going to give it up [Music] it seemed that amen satan had claimed this title deed whenever he took adam and eve out and he snatched the title deed and satan's been going around all this time saying yeah amen it's mine and every time you try to raise up every time you try to raise up and say i'm a son of god satan just goes back and starts pointing at your failures he starts pointing at your weaknesses and he says well you can't be that one you can't be that bright amen what was that thought you had yesterday what about what you said what what what about why ain't your mama healed he meant why are you still struggling amen with diabetes why are you still struggling even with cancer why are you still struggling you must not be yet come on church man and the enemy was right there amen accusing saying i'm not giving up the title deed adam forfeited it it's mine and i'm not giving it back i praise the lord my brother branham said satan's a squat and that he don't legally own it he's had two thousands of years of fuss whether he owns it or somebody else owns it but christ has come as the kinsmen redeemer and he's rebranding them back to us satan still possesses it but we need a judge to judge the case well praise the lord hallelujah there's a reason why we're rejoicing in here tonight [Music] amen satan is boasted as a raging lion he said he's had his fun in the sun so to speak he's a man he's he's he's a manipulator he's he's found a way into the garden and found a way to eve and then he deceived eve and and then all the race has been in a fallen condition and then he exploits the weaknesses and takes advantage of your flaws a man very clever cleverly and skillfully he'll sit right there and use as that that situation to his evil means amen what is he trying to do

kinsman redeemer but today he's the kinsmen kinsmen avenger today well praise the lord he is not just interceding for you but today he's finishing the redemption process he's putting the final nail in satan's coffin well y'all with me here tonight hallelujah now the scripture says that in this day amen that the judge was going to take that book of redemption and when that judge would speak it would be like a lion roar and how many knows what a lion is a lion is the king of the jungle when he roars everything shuts up even the little beetles all of them they just all shut up because the lion the king has spoken and when god wanted to show you in this day and age what was happening with you when he was handing you the book he says behold the line of the tribe of judah has prevailed has prevailed the line of the tribe of judah has prevailed to take the book are y'all hearing me and when the lion roared seven thunders came out of their mouth and i don't want to just they meant a state i don't want to get too slow here they remember when that judge stands to speak that is when the case and this is what i'm going to drive home before i quit that is when the case is adjudicated that is when god comes down the judge settles the case once and for all [Applause] hallelujah now it's going to require the act of a competent judge it's got to be one and there ain't no better than the judge of all judges the competent judge to judicate are you hearing me amen now satan has been right there trying to take the book the entire time he's claiming it but to judicate means now get this it's a matter that is finally decided on its merits by a court that has competent jurisdiction and is not subject to litigation again by the same parties it is final never again to be tried again [Music] are you preachers listening to me we don't need to try the case again [Applause] already been tried already been vindicated the wicked one has already had his picture taken come on church amen you've come up with another revelation you are a quack judge god's given us a vindicated word the king has came down and judged the case [Applause] preachers you better say what what what the what the judge said that is you better say what the judge said mamas you better say what the judge said they've got a legal term reads judicata and it is a principle or doctrine that bars relitigation or reconsideration of the matter that has been settled it's a judgment a decree a ward or other determination that is considered final and cannot be tried in court again once the verdict has been decreed nothing can change it and when it says the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed to take the book and to open the book [Applause] and to release the seals of the book case closed [Applause] there is nowhere there is nowhere where god comes and takes the book and hands it to the devil but god takes the book and he hands it to us adam's fallen race he hands it to adam's fallen race and says welcome home welcome home welcome to dominion welcome to authority welcome to god's privilege welcome to god's design welcome to god's eternal purpose adam's fallen race shall rule and reign on earth again we have a right to rejoice [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and i'll say amen as long as i am the original pentecost i've been delivered from that bondage of denominational pentecost i have an open book in my hand it's no wonder that when the book was opened that revelations 5 12 says saying [Music] saying with a loud voice it just seems like everyone in that courtroom is loud [Music] y'all saying you don't have to scream you don't the mighty angel was doing the screaming the mighty angel said with a loud voice sorry folks sorry folks amen he was doing this with a loud voice worthy is the lamb [Applause] that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne unto the lamb forever and ever satan knows it i said satan knows it satan knows who has the book and if you will stand on your god-given right he has to leave i'll praise the lord amen now it's no wonder that brother branham said the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2000 years bound because those denominational rivers were keeping them in fear and doubt through man's interpretation they were anointed of the evil one but it is to be loosed in the evening time by the judge the evening i said judge the evening time message it's the judge's message the evening time message is the revealing of those seven thunders the revealing of the book and it is the oh come on church the holy spirit is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ

i could just stand before the judge again come on you're chosen in him he judged him [Applause] hallelujah i've been yelling too much so i'm not going to be able to finish my thought but i want to i want you to think on this the kinsmen redeemer is become the kinsman avenger the kinsman avenger now the one now the redeemer was the one that would go and buy back oh but there was one that would mistreat amen a next of kin would murder a next akin then it was up to that next of kin to go find the man who kills oh come on church and i i i want to tell you there's been there's been too many of our young people [Music] that have been taken outside those doors and it's time for the kinsmen adventure [Applause] there's two come on he will avenge his elect amen there in second thessalonians one and four it says for uh so that we ourselves glory and you and the churches of your patience and faith and all your persecutions tribulations you endure which is the manifest token of the righteous
