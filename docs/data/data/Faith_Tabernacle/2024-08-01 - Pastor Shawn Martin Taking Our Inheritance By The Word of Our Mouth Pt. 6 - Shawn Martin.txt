to turn with us to uh first of all the book of Titus amen praise the Lord wouldn't mind keeping my wife in your prayer she's done something to her back and so um that we believe the Lord to heal amen and um let's see uh before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we come to you Lord with Humble Hearts father thankful for what you've done for us you've done an eternal work father within us and we're so thankful for that and Lord we see the times that we're living in and the turmoil the troubles Lord but we so thankful that we're safe in your arms father that we have a bright future ahead of us and Lord as we Endeavor to speak your word I pray father that you would anoint father uh help me Lord just to get myself out of the way and may you speak through these mortal lips and I pray father that the people would be anointed to hear and to receive of you father if there's any sick here I pray that you would touch them any one discouraged or whatever the need would be I pray that you would meet that need father Lord we just commit the service into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord uh so we're going to read a few scriptures uh Titus 3 and3 um here it says um for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish uh disobedient deceived serving divers lust and Pleasures living in Malice and envy hateful and hating one another but after the kindness and love of God our savior um toward man [Music] appeared not by by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the Wasing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior that being justified by his grace we should be made Hees according to the hope of eternal life aren't you glad for that then if you'll turn with with me to the book of Galatians amen um the book of Galatians and the fourth chapter and we'll start at the uh fourth [Applause] verse praise the Lord or let's just uh the sixth verse and because you are Sons God hath sent forth his Spirit the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God to Christ amen then one more the book of Colossians the first chapter book of [Music] Colossians um chapter 1 and um we'll start at the 12th verse amen giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat everybody say made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have Del delivered us from the power of darkness and ha translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins so so who has that Redemption through his blood it's the Hees it's the the the those that the father hath made meat to be partakers of The Inheritance you can have your seats this evening and um got a little bit of ground to cover but hopefully um uh we can get through it and it'll be a help to you but um the words we we read here is uh the key word is air and inheritance and and both words go uh hand in hand uh see an and air uh is is uh what is considered to be an inheritor a possessor of an inheritance Lord so then and we we've talked about it about the an inheritance is something that has been left by someone amen uh uh you don't have to earn it you don't have to work for it you don't have to plead brother brah said you don't even have to be worthy of it you you it it was just left to you by by uh we'll put it by divine grace and so um uh that's that's what an inheritance is and that's what it means to be an heir so the person that gets the inheritance uh is considered to be the heir and as we see in the scriptures that the sun everybody say the sun uh is is the air he the sun is the air and and uh uh Galatians 4 And1 now I say that the heir as long as he is a child deth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all amen he he he's he's he's the heir he says but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father amen so then we We Know by the message that at the appointed time of the father then the son is adopted it he comes into adoption and and brother bradam says now notice if the child become a gallant child a a good child obedient then it was told to the father he said oh I just love the word at an appointed time set by the father alone the child was his glory and honor was manifested before the public see the father taken his own child under celebration and took him into the public places being his own son born in his own house yet the son was positionally placed in the family to inherit all things that the father had amen aren't you glad for that amen see at the time appointed of the father then then then the the the the the son comes into an adoption and becomes heir to all the father had amen so now it's for for for most of us I I guess we would believe that we are living in the time of adoption that that's that's the time and and which means that the sons of God are in possession of The Inheritance it's it's it's that way and and so I I looked up this word possessor it it means someone who has possession a or a legal or rightful claim to ownership amen so the heir is possessor amen that that's that's what we are as The Heirs of Jesus Christ The Heirs of God or The Heirs of promise and and so uh according to 1 Corinthians 6:10 uh uh we possess all things aren't you glad for that not some things but we possess all all things if if you get a chance go listen to the message possessing all things uh brother brandham uh preached it and and talking about powerful amen but possessing we possess all things not not some things not part but all things and and uh if you if we that could really uh uh uh uh strike our heart amen that we are possessors of all things then then we don't have have to be sick brother Braham said you don't have to sin you don't have to be bogged down you you don't have to be in bondage you you're you're possessor and and and another thing he says is that we we are possessors of everything that we can see we're we're possessors of the earth we're we're possessors but not only are we possessors of what we see we possess the Unseen as as well we're possessor of all things amen and so Paul would tell us we're heir according to the promise which which means that we were elected we we didn't stumble into this we we did it's not just happened you know uh by chance um uh uh but we were elected and our name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen so as the bride of Christ amen you know there there's all kinds of uh Parables that God uses as Sons were HS but as the bride of Christ we are heir of all things as well and and God shows that even through Rebecca in the Old Testament amen when she met uh um uh um um uh Isaac and she was the type of the Bride in this day and and brother brandham says as Rebecca got a straddled of the camel and rode away to meet her lover Isaac and Isaac had already left the camp and was out in the fields at the evening time when he saw her coming see it was love at first sight she jumped off the camel and ran to meet him she was taken into Abraham's tent and there become an heir and inherited all things amen she she was connected with with uh uh uh uh Isaac through through uh a marriage and she become heir of everything that Isaac had aren't you glad for that Isaac a type of Christ and and Rebecca a type of the Bride SE so now we know we know that we're living in the evening time where Christ and his bride which is you and I amen are being united together in in a wedding ain't that right we are united which again makes us heir of all things amen Zechariah 14 is now now being fulfilled in this age where it says at evening time it shall be light you see we're not walking in Baptist light we're not walking in Methodist light we're not walking in Pentecostal or nazing light or or what other light you know or or glare or whatever it is we are walking in the evening light amen we are walking and it's important to know what kind of light that we're we're walking in and and and the message makes it clear we are walking in the evening light and brother brandom identified the evening light as being the manifestation of the Resurrection amen there was no manifestation of of the Resurrection uh uh in Luther's day Wesley's day the uh uh uh uh down through the church ages but now has come the evening light amen man which is the manifestation of the Resurrection which fulfills Luke 17:30 the son of man is being revealed again the son of man not a church not a preacher not a personality but the son of man being revealed so brother BR said what that means is is the same head that was there in the East is here in the west again the same Christ that was there in the East uh uh uh uh uh East is now here in the west again amen oh aren't you glad for that amen so then we as the Bride of Jesus Christ being connected to Christ through a a marriage ceremony amen you see we're we're not going to a wedding we're going to the marriage supper of the lamb but the the union between Christ and his bride is an invisible Union and it happens in the age right now on in in this time and I pray that you have been United with him amen and if you're United with him then know that you're heir of all things amen see God made it very plain to us through many types and shadows that we are heir of all things he wants you to know that he doesn't want us living beggarly amen and and struggling and and and and and don't know uh who we are and and and and what benefits that we have well just to settle it all every benefit is yours they your heir of everything that God has amen now I've been dealing with Caleb you know going into the promised land and CA uh claiming his inheritance you see he had nothing to claim outside the land amen there was nothing outside that land amen uh uh that was his inheritance his inheritance was not in Esau's land it wasn't in moab's land it wasn't in Egypt amen it it wasn't there so so uh Israel had nothing to claim outside the land of promise amen so this was God's intention was to bring them out of Egypt and take them down through the to the promised land amen so they had to keep following the pillar of fire amen all the way through amen but then we find that there there came a time when Moses died and and the unbelievers died and and all of those that just complained and grumbled and and and would not follow Moses and and believe the message of the hour and all of these things amen they died and and we know what that meant is is not just a natural death but it was an eternal separation amen they died and see and and and then God raised up a new leader who was appointed uh by God and that was Joshua with a new ministry amen and and uh Joshua by that Ministry took the people over into the land of promise and positionally placed them in the land Amen brother brandham said Moses that great miracle performer that brought down Israel uh down through the land and brought them up to the promised land but did not not Place their inheritance to them see and Christ brought the church up to the place to where their possession was made to them was given to them just the Jordan to cross but the holy spirit is the one that sets the church in order that Joshua of today puts the church in its order given to each one gifts places position and he is the voice everybody say he is the voice he is the voice speaking to the inner man that Christ has saved the holy spirit amen see and so we we know that the prophet said Moses represented the law amen and the law condemnation could not take the people over into the promised land it would take a Ministry of Grace can you say amen amen a Ministry of Grace and he says the law and Grace were two different aspects of God's command now the law brought them out amen and mo uh uh which was Moses and Joshua Grace took them in amen Grace aren't you glad for that amen Grace brings you to your inheritance Grace amen brings you into the land of promise Grace amen establishes you and and positions you and and and you don't have to deserve it you don't have to you don't have to beg you don't have to plead you don't have to nothing like that this is a Ministry of Grace amen God looking at the predestinated seed of what he ordained you to be what he called you to be and there is a Ministry of Grace that's not looking at your your faults not looking at your complexes and not looking at your inabilities but looking Amen to the for for ordination of God Amen and placing you in the land amen now the Book of Joshua of course as we said deals with the second part of Redemption for a natural people and God brought them out of a natural land amen which was the first part of redemption amen and then uh uh if you notice in in that 2 and a half million people come out they were part of that uh uh first part amen uh two and a half million come out brother Brown said they were all baptized un Moses through the Red Sea they all follow that same spirit being the cloud and the pillar of Fire see they they all were led by the same Angel they all come out by the same Pastor they all was baptized into the sea they all eat of the spiritual mana and that Mana was Christ Christ coming down the mana come down every night from heaven and perished here to sustain uh the the people in their Journey amen he says they had repented and were baptized and come out to walk in a new life in a new land in a new of an a newness Journey amongst new people and the hands of God upon them amen but it finally come to a place in this walk that they had that they was not satisfied with their walk of Grace amen they come through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it come to a time they were not satisfied with their walk of Grace amen see he says uh uh see repented and were baptized and come out to walk in a new life in a new land in a newness Journey see but it finally comes to this time they were not satisfied see amen with their walk of Grace see and they all perished everybody say they all perished they all perished in the wilderness amen you see God knows what he's doing and he wants it done right he wants it done the way he says it and and nothing else ain't that right you can call it being narrow-minded or or whatever you want to call it but this is what God says it ain't that right now this tells us that all kinds of people can experience justification they can come through the stages of sanctification and even the baptism of the Holy Ghost and still not partake of The Inheritance can you say Amen you see Luther which was the age of justification did not put the people in the land of inheritance Wesley amen which was sanctification did not put the people in the land of inheritance Pentecostal age amen which put the gifts back into the church yet it could not put the people Amen in the land of inheritance but then God would send a message of Grace God would raise up a Joshua Ministry in this last day with the message of Grace to put us in the land and and positionally place us why to bring us to an adoption that you and I don't have to wait to heaven to be partakers of the air of promise but we are now we are the sons of God not not when we change this old body amen uh uh you are now the sons of God you are now The Heirs of God and you are now partakers of the Divine inheritance amen see now justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost is all one work of Grace amen see it's it it it's it's all one gra uh uh part of Grace Grace was with Israel Grace provided an atonement for Israel Grace provided a mercy seat Grace provided a a smitten Rock uh where water would come out of that rock U uh Grace provided the a Brazen serpent but no notice Grace also provided them a prophet who would lead them aren't you glad for that amen uh uh Grace provided a prophet amen when God sends a prophet to a a generation a nation that's the grace of God Amen and when he sends it it's it's a sign that God is ready to speak to his people amen see but see they were not satisfied with their walk of Grace amen see they wanted to walk by their own ideas they they wanted to go by their own interpretation they didn't need the prophet to interpret the land for them amen they wanted to go by what they saw by what they felt by what they amen was experiencing or whatever see amen and they went by their own interpretation of the word they wanted to walk by their own leadership of of uh appointed leadership amen but the problem was when they got to the land a promise they didn't have what it took Amen to go into the land amen they trusted in themselves but when they met something greater than themselves amen fear struck their heart amen but see it doesn't matter amen if you're able or if you're not a it doesn't matter about your abilities it doesn't matter amen about you at all it's the grace of God that's going to take us over it's the grace of God that's saved you it's the grace of God Amen that that pardon your sins it's the grace of God that's bringing us into our inheritance do you believe that see so amen they needed Grace amen but they had turned Grace down amen see and chose law amen they couldn't take the land on their own they couldn't defeat the Giants and and overcome the world cities on their own amen their own appointed leadership failed them it wouldn't work for them their own ideas and their own interpretation of the word amen wasn't strong enough wasn't good enough to bring them in to the land oh my amen and look at the churches falling apart today amen the enemy is coming in like a flood and the people don't know what to do amen But Here We Stand amen a sinless spotless bride because there is a Ministry of Grace amen I couldn't do it brother Tim you couldn't do it we couldn't overcome in oursel that we're under a Ministry of Grace that is keeping us protecting us providing for us and I thank God for itlu through the church ages the carinal church hasn't been satisfied with their walk of Grace amen God sends them a Revival by grace and then before you know it they they kill it and they they they go after their own ideas and their own ways and amen God would send the other AG uh uh uh a Grace or another Revival and and they would denominate and all of these things but now we're standing here it's time to possess the land it's time to come into this land of promise into our our inheritance oh my and and they don't have what it takes their Bishops ain't got what it takes to bring them over amen their clergy their seminaries their their their Theology and everything that they have it it it it they don't have what it takes Amen to defeat the enemy with can you say Amen you see but when when God raised up Joshua and gave him the ministry of Grace see Caleb that True Believer which is a type of us amen he's the he only types us as far as Caleb he didn't type any other age he types us he crossed over into the promised land under that Ministry of Grace amen he represented the True Believer of today who has crossed over into the land under the ministry of Grace aren't you glad for that and and we know we're not confused as to what what where is this message of Grace amen God says behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet amen and he will have a message of Grace anden he will restore your heart he will turn you back he will he will uh call out amen and bring a restoration to the church amen it's the message of Grace the message of Malachi 4 is the message of Grace do you believe that see and so the elect of today is being positionally placed Amen in the land of inheritance it was not in Luther Wesley Columba uh uh to the Dark Ages it it was not amen it's today that there is a people by the ministry of Grace that is being placed in the promised land so what are we doing all right this is why it requires us not just to be church goers amen church members and and just going through the ritual we are here to lay claim to our inheritance lay claim to our inheritance I don't care how bad the devil is I don't care how dark it is I don't care how many demons are surrounding your Mountain you have every right to lay claim to that inheritance you have the right you are the people we are that generation of people amen that have the right to speak with authority to the devil and say give it up amen you you ain't got no hold on me why because the time appointed of the father has come the fullness of times have arrived aren't you glad for that amen the manifestation of the sons of God you see has not been promised to any other age amen outside of the age that we're living in this is the time everybody say this is the time this is the time for the sons of God to be m manifested this is the time for the sons of God to have full Authority amen not just a little portion of authority full Authority amen this is the time for the sons of God to speak with authority amen this is the time amen uh for the sons of God to act with authority why because we're not living in a leot sea of Pentecostal age we're living in Bride age this is seed time bride time bride age this is time amen for the for the the the the uh the son of man to be revealed in the body of Flesh amen yes sir now see outside of that you're not you're not possessing or in in any of your inheritance see you're not in possession of that amen see amen so so as I said in Luther's age it wasn't time to possess the inheritance for that was the age of the stock in Wesley's age it wasn't time Amen to possess the inheritance for that was the age of the tossel amen neither was it time to possess the inheritance in the Pentecostal age for that was the age of the Shu that was the time of the shock amen the fullness of time hadn't come yet amen but now it's the bride age everybody say it's the bride age now we wouldn't know the bride age we wouldn't even know such a word amen if it had not been for a prophet to tell us amen where we're at it's the bride age amen and the sons of God are coming to maturity and adoption ain't that right and what is it that's when the bride is be being united with her mate the word which is Christ amen see United couldn't happen in any other age it's now that the bride is being United with the word of God Amen yes sir now if if you look you know uh uh uh at the first church age or we will look at the day of Pentecost and uh that first church done many things many wonderful works and acts and and things like that and the book of Acts tells us what they done and and the the power that they had and and uh uh you know it it was was a wonderful wonderful uh Church in in that time and and you know but but it was a word seed that God planted on the day of Pentecost it was only a seed can you say amen amen and and and and even though it was a seed it had not yet died it had not yet rotted and and it had still had to go through the process amen amen it was just the seed and and the ible says except a seed uh fall in the ground and die and rot it it abideth alone ain't that right amen see and so uh uh that first church what God planted amen that was the beginning of the Masterpiece as go listen to the Masterpiece and brother Brandon talks about it it was the beginning of the work of a masterpiece but it was not the Capstone age it it wasn't the Capstone Ministry can you say amen amen but but look now amen if you notice the work we we've come through all these ages and we're standing here amen uh uh and and and the message of Malachi 4 is to take us back to the original Pentecost amen that's what the prophet said amen why we've come to seed that went in the ground has now come and it's now ripening everybody say it's rip rening see so so it it is to take us back to the original Pentecost like it was on the days of Acts plus everybody say plus plus it is to bring us to maturity to where the son of man is revealed in us can you say Amen the son of man is to be revealed what what what are you saying the word is now being made flesh in us the inheritance the promise The Heirs of Promise is now being partakers of this Divine word not by law but by Grace amen amen and so it it's there and now notice it's the ministry of the son of man in the sons of men go Amen brother brandom said the pillar of fire which was upon the son of man see and has now come to anoint sons of men everybody say sons of men to bring back a Ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together oh my aren't you glad for that now I'll I'll try to hurry here but when people hear us talking about this age of bright age and talking about way we preach and and and believe and all that you know they they tend to think that we we don't think that the previous Ages were important and and uh that they were just you know kind of the the you know run of the meal and and all these things but I I no no real True Believer feels that way at all see because we know by the message of the hour that each age had its purpose it it had its time time it had its placing and and all these things and we know as Believers of the message of the hour that each age each Church age there was a elect group of people in that age and they are going to be part of the Rapture do you believe that amen and I know you believe that see so it's no mystery to anyone who believes the message of the hour because brother Bram taught it that way amen he says this the true bride will be made up of thousands times thousands of people but it will be the elect out of every Church age amen you realize that that we we have come down amen the the the it started out wide in the first church Age and and then it's it's beginning to get narrow and narrow and narrow can you say Amen now now you know it's not that we're narrow-minded it's it's just where we're we're at it's it's narrow and and the Bible says very few are going to make it in this age we we can't help that that's that's the Bible That's the Way God's got it and very few amen the Bible even says that the Lord's going to come amen uh uh uh how how is that that he will come uh uh for the very elect sake uh uh if if he didn't come no flesh would be saved or something to that effect if I I got at all but but see it's it's be it's so narrow that it's going to be very very very few in this age make it in the Rapture but there's going to be thousands that come into the Rapture but it's going to be the elect out of every Church age can you say Amen see now what what that elect had was the genuine Holy Spirit how many beliefs that it wasn't make belief it was a genuine holy spirit that they had in every age amen but everybody say but amen they only had a dip of the the Holy Spirit that's what the prophet taught they only had a portion so so the elect in Luther's age had a portion of the Holy Spirit the elect in Wesley's age had a greater portion than did the elect in in in Luther's age see and and so then then in the elect in the Pentecostal age had a greater portion than what Wesley had amen see uh than then the elect in Wesley amen they had it see it kept getting more and more and more amen but now we're not in the Pentecostal age we're beyond that Pentecostal age brother Brown says we're way on up to the coming of the Lord where the ministry that Jesus Christ exercised himself has to be ex exactly it's here it's here Church there is a people on the Earth that has that same type of ministry amen and it was proven through brother brandham amen see the same power the same Christ the so he says see like The Headstone on the pyramid it has to be so honed till every stone fits perfectly and the church has got to get in that condition to receive the headstone then take the whole thing in the resurrection when the body is is raised up so what the church has done it's moved on up amen into the full promise amen that that's where we're at we moved up not impartial but we moved up into the full promise full power full Dynamics full Christ can you say Amen yes sir see now no notice brother brah said what is the Holy Ghost it's God in you well what's it for to continue his work among his people to bring his church together to bring a church to a place in this day far beyond Lutheran methodus Pentecostal into a place to adoption and rapturing Grace that when this part of the church when the spirit moves into this church it will just raise up can you sayen the power has come to Quicken our mortal bodies the Dynamics is here that's right see when the son of man cometh he will come in what power and great Glory or great power and glory amen see at the revealing of the son of man comes power what is it not partial power not a dip of the power but the fullness of power every everything that God was he poured into Christ and everything that Christ is he poured in the church and you say Amen notice he says and it'll bring forth all the redeemed oh my that's touched that spirit amen remember what brother Brown said the power that you're watering right now with your Praises is going to take you home one of these days this isn't fanaticism this is a power there's something that's holding us there's something that's keeping us there's something that's motivating us there's something on the inside that's quickening us what is it it's the same power that's going to take us home yes sir and it'll bring forth all the redeemed that's touched that Spirit those Lutheran who stood with all the light they had in justification those methodists that fell on the floor and they throwed water in their face from the spirit striking them through sanctification those Pentecostals that walked up and down the streets and they called them tongue uh uh demong tongues demong and jabberers and Goose language and all of that they'll stand in the righteousness in the sight of God at that day just as certain as the Bible stands here why there was an elect in every age can you say Amen yes sir see and 1 Thessalonians 4:14 Paul says for if we if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him every age that died in Christ they died with the promise there will be a resurrection amen they died believing the same thing you did there's a Rapture we're going to be in that Rapture they may have not had the understanding that you had they may not had the full power that you had but they had enough to Quicken them that when they went in the ground it's that power that they had received is going to Quicken their Bo mortal bodies now notice the Holy Spirit has come upon us in the last days and identified himself right in our church and has proven the same works that he did when he was here in the fullness Upon Jesus Christ he did the same thing upon the bride and doing the same thing what he did in full Upon Jesus Christ he's here doing the same thing in the Bride of Jesus Christ not in one man but a many membered body can you say Amen see so we're all part of something amen we're all part of it now he says the last thing that the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power in fullness everybody say in fullness in his church just before the fire falls say that again what a promise you're heirs to this now amen the last thing that the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power he's going to be man he's being manifested in Housewives he's being manifested in fathers he's being manifested in the preachers and the deacons and the lay members he's being manifested in the children the young people of all ages Christ is being manifested in this last day in fullness in his church just before the fire falls no we're not dead we're alive and well we're not retreating we're going forward amen we ain't weak we're getting stronger every day do you believe that so what is it we're living in a Time the prophet said where the church is being positionally placed where the fullness everybody Say fullness the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church it did not happen on the day on ausa Street it did not happen amen under Wesley and Luther and and and on down it's happening right now the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then comes to pass the scripture if you say to this mountain amen be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say shall but believe that what you have said shall come to pass you can have what you've said really you you understand that that prophecy was that was prophetic what Jesus was saying and yet that scripture laid dormant all these Church ages until now where a prophet begin to understand even even greater than the first church age or the first church amen even an a greater understanding standing amen and and in one place brother brandom said that Jesus never outright created he would take dust he took dirt and he spit in it made a little spittle clay and he put it on the Man's eyes he took water and he turned the water into wine he took something and he turned he took the bread and he multiplied it he took the fish and he multiplied but in this day this day he would speak his creative word and say Let There Be squirrels and there was squirrels it was a creative word can you say Amen think of it Church think of the day that you're living in say to this mountain amen say to this mountain see so now who were the elect of each age those who believed and accepted the message and all the light it was when sent forth to the age do you believe that what who was the elect those that believed and received the message that was sent to them in the age they were living in see and they are the ones who were truly filled with the Holy Ghost for brother Brown said the true evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives amen yes sir what was that elect they were over Overcomers of that age brother Ram says each son out of each Church age overcome the temptation of that age that was the elect amen they overcome the temptation of the age they were living in amen see he overcome the Beast overcome his mark That's Catholicism uh protestantism denominationalism see who overcome the Beast his Mark the letter of his name see they were Overcomers but notice now what Paul said but they without us cannot be made perfect brother Brandon uses that scripture for us today they without us everybody say us cannot be made perfect well then who is this us amen well they're the ones that are uh overcoming this last Church age brother Braham said overcoming the nicians overcoming the things of the world overcoming these denominations overcoming these pre to uh uh overcoming everything of the world and selling out and loving Christ and Christ is that manifested word right they're overcoming overcoming the sins of the age overcoming the pleasures of life see they're not getting bed down they're overcoming every de uh denominational critic and all the popular sins of this day of this age that we now live in like he did in all the other Church ages see that's the US they without us if they could overcome we've got overcoming to do do you believe that if they overcome and they overcome by the message of the hour in their day they lived it they believed it they confessed it and if they overcome then we must overcome and the way we can do it is by the message of the hour yes sir that's right you say well I thought it said you know overcome the Lamb by the word of their testimony well what is your testimony it's confession say the same thing as by the word of their confession can you sayen then what are you going to confess some doctor so and so you're going to confess what what you know the the the physici said you going to confess what you know what your feelings say and all these things no you're going to confess what the word of God says for this age God says I'm the heir of promise for this age so we we find now and I'll try to hurry but as message Believers we also know that there there are going to be those who receive eternal life that are not part of the bride and they are not the elect but neither do they inherit all things according to Matthew 25 the foolish virgin will be given eternal life brother Bri said they missed being the bride because they did not have the Holy Spirit that's right they missed being in the Millennium he said but these people being a separated god-loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end time another place he says they will be judged according to the way they treated the light that they received you say Amen and now that part will be up to Christ see they they were not lost though see then we find according to Matthew as well that there is going to be those who receive eternal life due to being good to the bride now the Bible calls them righteous they are called the righteous see but they are not the bride for they are standing before the white Throne judgment being judged ain't that right see the bride will not be judged but rather she will be sitting with him in the throne ain't that right not not not standing in judgment see see brother BR says it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride now foolish virgin is not a word bride that's true amen a ain't that right whoever else is not a word bride see there's going to be those that receive eternal life but they're not word bride but God's intention was to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was forn beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never everybody say can never come into condemnation she can never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her that's the bride what is it she's been redeemed now uh Jesus said in John 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life notice brother Brown said that is the believer is already everybody say already is already the recipient of eternal life which he has in his possession now that's right hello not going to receive it but you have it now you are the recipient of eternal life and have it now in your your possession and shall not come into condemnation in other words brother Braham said shall not come into the Judgment but is passed permanently from Death unto life well aren't you glad for that amen now all everybody say all who are not part of the Bride will have to stand before that white Throne judgment and will be judged according to their Works amen why because they did not have blood they they they they were not loosed they did not come to a perfect loosening brother Braham said if it's perfect blood that brings perfect brings the loosening then it is a perfect loosening so now brother brandham he says see there will be both righteous and unrighteous come before the white Throne judgment righteous and unrighteous not the bride but yet God calls them righteous that's see now uh uh Jesus himself taught this in Matthew 25:32 you if you go home read the whole whole chapter there uh well you can start with 32 on down but and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them from one uh one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats notice this separation happens at the white Throne judgment but the bride the separation for the bride happens here on this Earth why how By the Waters of Separation by the word the water of the word that washes us separates us but there is a separating that is going to take place at the white Throne judgment and the 46th verse and these shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous into eternal life not speaking of the Bride she's already got eternal life she's possessed her now ain't that right so now notice many many names are cast into the Everlasting punish M into Everlasting punishment were written in the Lamb's Book of Life now if if you look he he she separates the righteous now what what is that why because they were good to the bride ain't that right the righteous receive eternal life but here there were many names brother Braham said who are cast into Everlasting punishment and their names were written not in the Lamb's Book of Life but the book of life but they were blotted out I want you you notice how important this is they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of God who were living the manifested who were the Living manifested Word living Epistles for their day right think of that there's a people that receive eternal life that that that come into eternal life that are allowed to go into eternal life by being good to God's people and there's people that have their names blotted out and C they're cast into the Lake of Fire amen uh uh uh how they treated yeah on because they failed to honor the people of God who were the living manifested word for their day another place those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed that is who will lose out they will be cast into the Lake of Fire but then the righteous are allowed to go into eternal life because they were good to the bride notice now brother Brown said now speaking of that righteous they are not his Brethren that would make them joint hirs with Jesus they are not hirs to anything but life ain't that right they share No Throne or Etc with him their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed now because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and Gale they stood for the children in the time of trouble ain't that right so so there there's that foolish virgin there's the friends or or we call it Friends of the Bride or people that were good to the bride uh and such stood for them and and things like that and and then according to Revelations 6 and9 uh through 11 there were the souls under the altar which brother Bram uh uh tells us that they were the Jews and they're given a white robe which shows that they are given eternal life but brother Brown said these were not born again people with eternal life as their possession that's hello they are allowed into eternal life at that white Throne judgment see he says but they were slain for the word of God for the testimony which they held and they received life because of their stand for the word of God see these Jews aren't born of his Spirit they don't even believe that Jesus is the Messiah but as they were blinded by God for the Gentile sake God gave them eternal life on the grounds that though they could not come to him yet they were truly faithful to all the word that they knew and died for it as multitudes died under Hitler Stalin Etc and yet will die ain't that a merciful god now those who are not part of the Bride see uh uh or those who are part of the Bride they are already recipients of eternal life and no one else I don't care how CLA they claim to be saved if they're not part of the Bride they ain't recipients you say Amen see so but these These are allowed to go into eternal life at the white Throne judgment now notice I hope this is all right uh uh won't keep much longer but John 5:28 Jesus said Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which that all that are in the grave shall hear his voice everybody say all all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation notice that scripture is is not speaking of the Rapture for there is only one group of people that comes forth in the resurrection at the time of rapture so then this is speaking of the second Resurrection now there are only two resurrections ain't that right the Bible preaches teaches us that see the first resurrection is for is only for the bride those that have already are have eternal life as their possession see they go in the Rapture see and and so the first resurrection is for the bride only see now 1 Thessalonians 4:15 speaks of that for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ not all that are in the graves Only The Dead In Christ shall rise first what is it those that make up the bride that's right the elect out of every age can you say Amen so this is the first resurrection which happens at the time of rapture now uh uh if you look uh Revelations 20 and 1 we'll start there and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season and I saw Thrones and that set upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshiped the Beast neither the His Image neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ A Thousand Years speaking of the Millennium that's the bride but the rest of the Dead live Liv not again until the thousand years was finished this is the first resurrection can you say Amen in other words see the bride amen that that that has come forth is the first part of that first resurrection blessed everybody say blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priest of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so remember those who are part of that first resurrection they are Hees of all things aren't you glad for that blessed are you who are part of that first resurrection in closing did you know that only the bride will be living in that City that's true amen Revelations 22:14 blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have a right a right to eat of the tree of life and to enter in through the gates into the city praise the Lord what is it it's to the Overcomer how many Overcomers do we have it's to the Overcomer ain't that right amen see amen because you go go look in the Old Testament or in in the church ages God promised to that Overcomer the tree of life he that overcometh will I give unto him the tree of life amen ain't that right see now notice see it's it's it's to the bride it's where the bride will be brother Brown said that City can't you see it there is where the bride and the groom will settle amen well what is it it's an inheritance praise the Lord your heirs it belongs to you you believe that notice Isaiah 5713 he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit everybody say inherit my Holy Mountain who's going to inherit it the prophet asked the redeemed ain't that right well then what is his holy mountain Daniel 6 or 9:16 oh Lord according to all thy righteousness I beseech thee let thine anger and thy Fury be turned away uh from thy City Jerusalem thy Holy Mountain hello so then the New Jerusalem is the new city the Holy Mountain the Lord Brother Rah says in one place Abraham met him speaking of MDC and they took communion right on the literal spot where the city will be raised up the Holy Mountain of the Lord where the redeemed will live he says in another place now have you got the city it's a Holy Mountain nothing shall hurt or destroy in all my holy mountains sayith the Lord see the city is not a cube it is a mountain one place brother brandham called the city the bride's chamber prise the Lord hello here he says here the new city and the new Earth the new creation the city on the hill with the throne in the top of it see the throne up here in the top and the Dwellers all up and down the mountain well then who are the Dwellers living all up and down this mountain brother Ram says on this Throne on top of it500 Miles High the whole world will see the light of the world Jesus sitting on the throne on top of the world top of the church top of Mount Zion which is, 1500 miles see half the sides of the United States and raises Plum up till you can see him the world over 1500 miles high and all up and down here will be the redeemed amen amen hello aren't you glad for it see and there will be the houses of pure gold there will be Avenues and parks and Gardens and the River of Life coming trickling out from the throne running down through the little chasms and Over The terce Terraces see and the tree of life will be blooming in every yard and bear its fruit 12 times a year a change fruit every month oh my it's going to be a wonderful place you know the Bible says I and Earth hath not just can't even understand it can't even comprehend the things that God has prepared for us but I'm so glad that God has revealed it to us why we're heirs if the musicians will come see brother Bram says the Revelation comes to those who are air god Reveals His secet secrets to those who are Heirs of the promise Oh my he says Oh Holy Mountain there will be streets of transparent gold Avenues and houses and Parks he said if you want to read this Revelations 21:18 the tree of life will be there 12 different manners of fruit each one each month will be born on it the people that eat these fruits they'll change their diet every month and it's only for the Overcomers amen he said did you know that it isn't for the denominations it's for the Overcomer amen so all I can say to you is keep pressing the battle keep pressing because you're not only heir of what you can see you're heir of of the Unseen hallelujah we're laying claim to it this world is not my home that's right politics is not for me government's not for me all of this natural materialistic things is not for me Amen Let the world have it but the prophet says we already own it we already own this Earth he says I don't own one Speck of land he said I don't own one inch of land but I yet I do own it because the Meek's going to inherit the earth it ain't going to be this old Earth of rotten sin and filth and muck and all this nastiness that is going on and the sinful waves and all that that's not what we are inheriting we are inheriting an earth that's going to be changed renovated Heavens that's going to be renovated all over again the devil's going to be gone there be no Temptations nothing nothing to destroy nothing amen that belongs to us aren't you glad for that oh Caleb they claim to your
