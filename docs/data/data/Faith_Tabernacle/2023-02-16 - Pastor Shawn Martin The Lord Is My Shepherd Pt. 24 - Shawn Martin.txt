not to visit with uh Sister Walker and her daughter as well and just had a good time of Fellowship but uh I had sent out a text earlier today about the rehabilitation center asking this to anyone that did want to visit with brother Walker to uh maybe come in the afternoon or the evening time due to his therapy and so I told him we would honor that and so just keep that in mind if you do want to go visit with him and and they do welcome they welcome you know visitors um but they just said it would be better to do it uh in the evening or afternoon so amen but um before we go into the word let's just bow our hearts and heads to the Lord and just talk to him father we come to you this evening with grateful hearts Lord just believing that you have ordained this service tonight Lord that all things are in your hands and father we just pray that you would just be with us and speak to our hearts Lord you promised father where two or three are gathered in your name you would be here and oh God we are under great expectation to meet with you and father we're just asking that you would take what simple words we would have and that you had planted into every heart those that may be listening in tonight by internet Lord we just pray that you would bless them father those that are sick God we just pray that you would touch them is our prayer we give you all praise and glory in Jesus Christ's name amen Psalms the 23rd chapter starting at the first verse the Lord is my shepherd I shall not mourn he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake amen you can have your seats this evening and I want to just continue with the title the Lord is my shepherd and looking at that where psalmist said he leads me in the paths of righteousness and as as we've talked about that the the righteousness is the word of God and the Lord Our Shepherd our guide is leading Us in the paths of his word for he leads me in the paths of righteousness and so as we we talked uh last Wednesday the elect of God uh need a guide we need a guide to walk this path because we have never passed this way before and we've talked about how that God had ordered ordained Joshua to lead the children of Israel over into the land of promise and and you know Moses now um Moses um God had sent him uh uh down with the power of Jehovah and with the message uh saying come out you know return from this land message was to come from this land and let's go to the Homeland and so that that was the message that Moses had and and now when I'm I'm looking at these Paths of righteousness he leadeth me into in the paths of righteous this I'm I'm looking at it as the second part of redemption it's it's it's the Redemption and and so Moses dealt with the first part of redemption and that was to come out uh uh there and uh but then God sent Joshua uh with a message of Grace and that to deal with the second part of redemption and that was to come into it was it was going into so two Ministries but yet I believe that brother branham's Ministry actually fulfilled both of those Ministries uh uh there and and Moses and Joshua for uh we've heard the voice say come out of her my people amen and and we wouldn't have come out uh uh if it had not been for the message of the hour so it was the message that brought us out a man of our Creeds and out of the world and out of dogmas and and all of these things ain't that right another thing we look at that we're living in the evening time and it was in the evening time that the token was required amen for E for Israel and God told Moses now when I see the blood I will pass over you ain't that right so so it was it was the ministry of as as uh coming out it it there was a token a man that was required and that Tolkien had to be on display and and we realize that the prophet said that this is in this evening time it's the token that God is requiring a man to be on display and it's not the the the literal blood of a lamb but it's the life now they had to have the literal blood of the Lamb because the the life of that animal a man could not come back upon the believer but in this age we've had the true Lamb of God and and and and and and so we're we're not required to have the literal blood but we are required to have the life a man uh and and that's the life of Christ and he is the word ain't that right so the token man is the word living itself out in you and I for that is the display of of the token and and the prophet said when we can display the token that's the word and we become the same it shows that Jesus Christ met their requirement for our sin and death and his has displayed his token within us ain't that right so he says when God places his spirit in you which is God and when God places himself within you you are as Eternal as God is because you're a part of him because you become a son or a daughter of God and you are displaying his word you're not quoting his word you're displaying his word his word is now living inside of you ain't that right so he says see that he says hallelujah I feel religious that's true God identifies it himself you've got eternal life and that's God in you and this word is God and that word lives and produces itself see just exactly what God has ordained for this age you have it amen the Holy Ghost see and and so um he says uh the holy spirit being displayed and what is it the Holy Spirit the word has been quickened to you by the Holy Spirit to vindicate this age that you have passed from Death unto life amen so again uh the token the uh uh uh the token is Christ as we we believe that to be so and Christ is the word made manifest for the promise of this age the promise of this hour must be manifest and and the prophet would tell us again in another place they evening time message is to apply the token ain't that rhyme amen so we can see how his message a man uh dovetails with Moses's message Amen brother Brown said take the message take the message and take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ being you when I see that I will pass over you ain't that right so we needed this message just as they needed Moses's Ministry in in uh before uh uh they they left because spiritual or death natural death was striking the lamb fixing to strike and so it would strike every firstborn it didn't matter who you were if the token hadn't been applied a man death would come knocking amen but when the token was applied death had to pass this this went went on its way it lost its old it's lost its power hour over that home that had the token that life that had the token but in this day we see that spiritual death is going throughout the land and so when I see the blood or when I see the word manifesting itself a man through you I will pass over you ain't that right amen but we also see how brother branham's Ministry fits with the ministry of Joshua a man for he was the one who took Israel across Jordan into the promised land amen and and many of us uh no doubt have have listened to the message Paradox in 62 I believe it is and and brother Branham talked about the the vision that he had uh uh now now he was you know the uh um uh he had this at three o'clock in the morning and he said I got up and I looked at where in front of me and I was coming down to the Jordan looked like I was standing ending on the map of Palestine and I coming to Jordan and seemed like I could hear the song I'm going down to Jordan someone was singing and as I drew near I looked back and seen which way I had come and I was two-thirds of the way there to Jordan meaning that he had already come in into the first two pulls the first second pull of his ministry he had already come through there now he's at Jordan amen and he's seeing this in a vision and he says I I I was there and I at Jordan and I looked across Jordan and I said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in the promised land ain't that right which he was referring to that third pool Ministry every promise laid right right there see and so and in the same message following that statement just a little bit on down uh brother Branham said years ago when I saw seen the Bible come down he said I got it wrote right here come down and a hand came from heaven and pointed down to Joshua and read the first nine verses and stopped there that's Joshua come to the Wilderness but never did he said when he got near Jordan God called him out and said this day I'll begin to magnify you before the people and then he took the children of Israel across Jordan to the land where gay he gave them or divided to them the promised land amen so that was the ministry of Joshua amen it it it uh to divide to them their inheritance the people had come out a man under the token amen and now they they were coming into the promised land a man and so another time I'm brother Branham um was talked about the time that the angel of the Lord visited him and showed him different things and and he said this he said I raised up and looked around and I heard something the leaves turning and I looked and here come my Bible write down and it was turned to the uh uh the same scripture where I read tonight and then it was turning back uh towards the front of the Bible and as it turned towards the front part I it stopped on Joshua the first chapter and the finger began to read down and point down along the lines the Lord thy God is with thee wherever thou goest no man shall stand before thee all the days of the life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee be very courageous ain't that right and so forth like that till it read down most of the chapter of of Joshua chapter 1 one then it went away see so God was showing him showing brother Branham that his ministry would be the the just like the Joshua Ministry a man and and so uh again I believe that all the promises lay in in the third pool ain't that right the third pull Ministry and and so what is the third pull and and brother Branham talked about it in different places but in one place he said the third pool is the opening of the word ain't that right the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed amen so that that that is where the promises lay is in the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed and he said there is no more higher order to reveal the word than the prophets but the only way that the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word of God ain't that right every promise had been sealed a man in the word of God that hid the third pool was the opening of them promises revealing of the promises of God now Moses did not reveal the the mystery that had been hidden and we we understand that that the the uh uh uh brother Brown talks about every tribe them men amen as they were babies or being born uh mom under the the travail would cry out their name Ephraim and and and uh manesses and and and this went in and and brother Rams says their name was actually the meaning of their name was actually placing them in the promised land he ferment oil or something to that effect and the other one meant corn razor and another one meant is and another meant that well them men didn't know and I don't even think their mothers knew but they said it under inspiration see and so Moses didn't reveal what their names meant amen because that wasn't his ministry But Here Comes Joshua under the ministry of Grace takes them over into the land amen and under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost the spirit of Truth amen he began to divide the land and reveal to them a man that they were part of the land can you say amen amen that their names amen and he positionally placed them and so if you notice we had read last Wednesday of how that the Levites Who Bore the art of the Covenant which was the word the Ark of the Covenant amen they bore it upon their shoulders the word amen and yet they were directed by Joshua ain't that right a man sold their headship was Joshua amen and the people were told to stay behind the word don't go in front of it but stay behind it don't get too close don't you try to lead the word amen but you stay behind the word and let the word Lead You amen so here was the ministry a man which I believe that the fightful ministry amen the Levites bearing that that Ark a man represented the fifo ministry under the direction amen of the of the messenger of today amen and and so uh we are being led today in the paths of righteousness under the Joshua Ministry amen see the the the ministry of law a man condemnation and and these things cannot lead us into it for the land deals a man with what was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Amen these Paths of righteousness deals a man with with what God had ordained before the world began and law a man cannot deal with predestination law cannot deal with them things because it it only dealt with you as a sinner amen as long as you've done right amen the law was there but as soon as you done wrong amen it condemned you ain't that right amen so the ministry today is under the the uh that are carrying the word is under the direction of Joshua amen now brother Branham Likens the pastors as The Innkeeper that was entrusted by the Good Samaritan to take uh care of the man that was beaten remember Jesus talks about the the Samaritan uh that takes that man that was robbed and beaten and and he took him to an end and left him there Amen to be taken care of and the prophet said they are defeat you and to Shepherd you until Jesus comes they they they're the caretaker at the end again see and so he said Jesus give them two pins the word and the spirit ain't that right if they need any more he will give it when he returns amen so that the Levites who carried the word of God upon their shoulders a man noticed they had to stand in the River Jordan amen first the people could not go in amen until the ministry amen went in there and uh before the people could cross over and and so uh uh which tells me because Jordan represents death and and and and you just have to allow me but I believe that it's a sign that the ministry a man that is carrying the word today amen under the Joshua Ministry has to first die out to their ways and die out to their thoughts and die out to their Creeds and their dogmas and and all of these things that they're going to take amen the word of God for this age amen die Elsie and so and they came to Jordan at the time when when the waters was overflowing their Banks and but yet when the priest walked into that that that water a miracle took place and that was that the waters rode back a man so that the people could cross into the land uh without any interference can you say amen amen as long as the priests were standing there in that water amen the people could go over into the promised land a man see and the prophet said Joshua delivered the people into the promised land amen I love that amen he just didn't take him over he delivered them into the promised land the you know the prophet had way with words amen and and he knew you know just God knew what he was saying there amen and I just believe that the people that are going across into the promised land ain't there by chance they ain't there by Will hour it was a Deliverance amen that God in this age the message of the hour would deliver them into the promised land ain't that right so we as the elect of God Amen are in the land of the open book amen uh uh that that's where we're at we are that third pool is working in this age a man for it is the opening of the word ain't that right our understanding is not coming from a psychologist or from a theologian or understanding is coming from a third pool Ministry a man that is lit us amen into the land of promises amen see so what what what that means then is we're in the land and we are seeing we are understanding things amen that have been hid from the foundation of the world you are the most privileged people Amen to Faith amen that in this age amen that you're understanding things that the angels of God have longed to see you are seeing things and hearing things and understanding things that the prophets long to understand hey oh my amen I know people say well you know brother Branham just uh there's nothing anything new and and and they understood it in the first church age I beg to differ with you amen now Paul talked about a Rapture but he talked about it in a mystery form amen he said yes amen the Lord shall descend with the shout but we didn't know what that child was amen we didn't know what the voice of the Trump was we didn't know what the voice of the Archangel was amen until in this age right here do you believe that amen we didn't understand the things that amen that that Paul it was talking because he was talking to things a man that would be later on in the land uh the third pool Ministry would be revealed and opened up to the bride of Christ amen so oh to think of it we're in the land of promise amen the mind of God is no longer hidden to the people of God by the opening of the word ain't that right amen that's right I I just think that is awesome I thank God for allowing us to be right here I'm I'm so thankful to be in the age that I'm living in it would have been nice yes to be in the age where Jesus walked the Earth but still we wouldn't even have the understanding that we have today hey oh my because we are in the second part of redemption amen see so everything that has been promised a man of this bride is now to be not only understood but to be manifested amen yes sir so as Jesus told John it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness and remember uh uh uh Jesus came to the river to be baptized to John and I'm going somewhere so just follow me now but he needed to be baptized for a different reason than what we need to ain't that right you know we are baptized for the remission of sins amen John baptized unto repentance but see we we find a man that Jesus had no sin for he was the Spotless Lamb of God Amen so he wasn't there to be baptized to have his sins washed away ain't that right amen but yet he needed to be baptized and the and Jesus said it was to fulfill all righteousness amen that's why he had to be baptized it had to fulfill all righteousness not one scripture could be misplaced not one scripture could go without being fulfilled in his life every scripture that talked of him prophesied of him had to be fulfilled ain't that right so the word had to be fulfilled you see the prophet said God cannot say anything without it being fulfilled and God had already spoke of Jesus and foretold what he would be and what he would do when he came ain't that right and and the prophet said this when God has spoken it then is already a finished work amen now you think of that oh I wish I could get that to us all amen that when God has spoken it now becomes a finished work amen Jesus wasn't trying to make things happen it was already spoken of him for it to happen amen he just had to walk in the path amen of righteousness he had just a walk in the path of the word ain't that right amen but it was already spoken of him amen so it was already a finished work amen as we have read many times Isaiah 55 and 11 and so shall my word be that going forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void amen but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall pray prosper in the thing where to I sin it ain't that right so every thing that God has said it's already a finished work uh uh before the beginning or from the beginning of of creation a man see so the prophet said when we receive the word into our heart it's already done it's already completed ain't that right amen so we're not struggling here tonight amen you're not struggling to be going to Rapture you're not struggling to come into manifestations of sons of God you're not struggling to these things it's already been said by God and it's a finished work I think that's awesome ain't that right it's awesome hey man so why did Jesus then have to be baptized amen well the prophet said he was the high priest and and he he he had to be anointed but before he could be anointed he had to be washed ain't that right we've read this before I'm going to read it again Exodus 29 and 4 and Aaron and his sons Thou shalt bring unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and shalt wash them with water Aaron and his sons and thou shalt take the garments and put upon Aaron the cold and the robe of the ephod and the ephod and the uh the breastplate and gird him with the Curious girdle of the ephod and and doubt shall put the miter on him upon his head and put the holy crown upon the miter then Thou shalt take the anointing and pour it upon his head and anoint him ain't that right that so we find in Matthew 16 or 3 and 16 and Jesus when he was baptized washed amen went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him see that anointing came to him after he was washed but it would have never happened if the scripture hadn't been fulfilled amen he was there to fulfill the scriptures ain't that right he was anointed and later on Jesus would say the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he hath anointed me ain't that right so then the prophet says that as priests unto our God now speaking to us we must first confess our sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and as the prophet said what is it it's washing our sins away we've got as Priests of God we have to be washed as well a man say then you shall receive the anointing of the Holy Ghost the gift of the Holy Ghost and we can say it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness ain't that right so we see that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament and and uh the prophet said all the Old Testament characters represented this the Messiah until it was all fulfilled in one man so so David represented the Messiah Samson represented the Messiah amen uh uh uh Moses represented the Messiah Joshua and and all of the the Saints of old when that anointing would come and the acts that they'd done and and these things they represented amen the Messiah their lives their testimony their their words everything about them represented the Messiah amen and until it was all bottled up into one man hallelujah amen see and he fulfilled every part of the Old Testament that spoke of the Messiah amen what David lived out he fulfilled what Joseph lived out he fulfilled amen everything that they lived down under that anointing he fulfilled ain't that right even to the fact of David going up on the mountain and crying over Jerusalem amen rejected as a king and here later on at the real David the king amen David amen Dairy was sitting on the hill just as David did and crying over Jerusalem a rejected amen King ain't that right amen but as he fulfilled the Old Testament now amen the New Testament has got to be fulfilled if brother Brown said it's another piece to be fulfilled ain't that rhyme amen so Jesus was God's master Beast that fulfilled all righteousness that spoke of him in the Old Testament and he says as it taken him 4 000 years to make this masterpiece now he's been nearly 2 000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece and in so doing it now listen he does it by his never changing method the same way made the Masterpiece his word ain't that right that's the way he makes his masterpieces because he can only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's the perfect word no Creeds mixed into it no ideas of man tradition it must be perfect word ain't that right and he said his bride will fulfill everything amen that's in the New Testament whole mind to think that's where we're at tonight we are now at the Finishing Touch of the Masterpiece amen why how do we know that because the Capstone himself has come down to finish her off ain't that run so you know what that means then then we are becoming word word by word word by word flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him him what the word ain't that right now we find that Satan has his bride as well and the prophet said this bride is made up in the form of religion called Creeds and dogmas and and he calls Satan's bride the false uh uh Vine and it's in this age now that this false bride Satan's bride comes into full fruition amen the full fruition her fruit is maturing and ripening he says this evil spirited Church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree where enlarged the fowls of the air and at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity ain't that right and what is Iniquity knowing to what to do Ryan and yet not doing it ain't that right no to do good and yet not do it and so here at the head of her amen uh this bride Satan's bride will be the mystery of iniquity amen but notice what he says after that God's children everybody say God's children is made up correctly on his word amen see for they are living examples and the word of God Amen living through them amen and it's also in this age that the true bride of Christ will come to her maturity as well the prophet said her rightness shall be an identification with the Lord by means of the word and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness not iniquity but the mystery of godliness will be her headship which is Christ ain't that right so we see that that we're living now it's the word the word amen the prophet said as she nears The Headstone which is Christ she becomes like him through the word and Jesus will come that she the bride and him the groom may be United forever as one oh I hope you understand the vision that God has in this age is for you as the Church of the Living God to become one amen and that is power of his power life of his life word of his word amen to where you become him ain't that right so so we fine now now notice what the prophet says about the false and the true he said as the false church with all cunning and diabolical uh uh Power made uh made up of political force physical force and demons of Darkness come against this true bro this True Vine so the false church will come against the the True Vine and we're seeing it happen right now amen the laws are being passed everything is being passed amen and it's it's directed Amen to stomp out the Church of the Living God Amen but notice what the prophet said the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did amen see that that's what he's saying of this bride today she will amen she will with the full power of God do the very works that Jesus did so I say to you it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness ain't that right amen the Bible has already promised it amen of all the things that we see of the mighty acts amen that was done in the Bible I believe it not only spoke of Christ I believe it spoke of this age here amen because it's it's not this not you that's doing it it's Christ in you that's doing it ain't that right amen the prophet said he did not do everything amen uh uh uh uh when he was here on Earth there was other things that had to do and what would he do it he would do it not in that body he would do it in your body amen that's right now all of God's word must be fulfilled do you believe that amen so we're not taking these promises lightly amen we know we understand amen that all of God's word must be fulfilled oh my and we're looking now into the promised land the opening of the word and we're seeing these promises now made life amen we're seeing that they've been laying dormant for our day and age we're seeing that no other age could fulfill it but this age that is right here amen now Jesus was the word do you believe that amen and notice what he said he told him search the scriptures search the words scriptures written word for in them you think you have eternal life but this written word testifies of who I am so and now we're standing here understanding this word actually testifies of Who We Are it testifies of it because we are a word bride ain't that right so the prophet said the word must deliver the word bride Church amen that's where you're at right now the word has delivered a wordbride church I believe not must I believe she has I believe this word I believe this message that's what we are you young people are a product of the message of the hour yes sir not some denomination not some traditional idea but the message of the hour and notice the prophet said she's fixing to bring forth the perfect word back there and the word is coming for the word bride now we all know that the Rapture is at imminent I mean it's it's here amen Rush is coming to her place every nation is coming to their place politics and religions and everything of this world is coming right to their place now church if that be the case then I believe that this word bride is on the Earth today I believe that she's ready to be raptured out of here for he's coming the word is coming for the word bride a woman see as a woman is part of the of the man taken from him so the church will have to be a word a word biting church can you say that with me we'll have to be a word abiding church that's why we take this message very seriously that's why we believe the word of it can you say amen that's why we don't we I I don't want to ever confuse you a man and God forbid that any minister in this church would confuse you Amen to tell you that this is part of brother branham's opinion and this and start picking this thing apart amen look at the promises look at the ministry amen this is a Joshua Ministry can you say amen amen it is the open book amen amen I know they say well if it's not in the Bible then then then then that's just brother branham's opinion whatever he says if it's not there then that's just brother brother branham's opinion and who are you old blind man a man that can look at the scripture and tell me where brother Branham was wrong can you say amen amen I can tell you this amen I would rather Sean Martin to just to say Sean Martin is wrong than to say a prophet of God is wrong that way I could be corrected that way amen I can repent ain't that right amen but when I've come to know it all when I've come to know more than what the prophet says that I've set myself as the standard for everybody to believe amen then something's wrong amen received the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of this Bible can you say Amen every word of this Bible That's why why would god require us to be a word bride in this age and that's all he's coming for is a word church and then not give us the promises not open these Mysteries up to us and we don't know what is us and we don't know what to fulfill and we don't know but we're in the land of the open book where we could take every promise and say that's mine he's leading us in the paths of righteousness see so he says see the church will have to be a word biting church every word of the Bible not systems dogmas nothing added to it it'll have to be uh in an unadulterated pure virgin word amen so that's what this bride is she is a virgin word unto him virgin bride unto him now we talked about it amen to thank now amen because you got to know your day amen and and we we find that God planted a Pentecostal seed remember on the day of Pentecost and then that seed went into the ground at nicaea amen and then we find the prophet taught us that the life that was in that seed amen began to manifest itself Amen in Luther's age and brother Brown shows us that the church has gone through three stages amen three stages of growth just like the corn of wheat the stock the tassel and the shuck ain't that right amen now thank God for a Joshua Ministry that we couldn't know where we're at ain't that right amen see we are not the tussle neither are we the stock and neither are we the shock ain't that right amen see we are the seed amen like was planted in the ground amen and notice what the prophet said the shock has give forth its strength into the seed it's went on out it was a good shut but it served its time see it is the word Bride of the word groom amen that's where we're at what are we we are the Masterpiece just like he was Hallelujah that's why we could say it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness amen he says see the Shucks have to dry the pollen has to dry everything dies so that the seed can produce itself amen the thing that God would choose you to reflect his full power in in this age I think that's powerful amen now notice brother Brown says the little virgin word flock bride of Christ don't care for Satan's knowledge we don't care for his knowledge I don't care what Technology's got I don't care what science comes up with the medical field and all these things that that doesn't move us we don't care for Satan's knowledge amen the seminaries and the theologians and all of that that's that that we don't care for that amen you know uh uh sometimes just to be honest listening to them the radio preachers and and their theologies and all that it just turns my stomach amen I'm just that's that's not where I'm at that's not what I want that goes that doesn't help me you understand what I'm saying amen we don't care for Satan's knowledge brother Brown said she the bride keeps free from him amen we're not going to be entangled by his his nonsense we we we've been cut out from all of that you understand what I'm saying amen we we didn't hear the voice come out of her my people only to keep giving an ear to that amen give your ear to the message of this hour that's what you give ear to brother Brown said she waits for her Lord and his Millennium honeymoon right with the word groom as she is the word bride that's what you are you are the word bride as he was the word groom ain't that right and what is the word bride the prophet said the manifestation of this hour she is a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living all to think that it's already been written of us that this is what we will do that we will come to the the fullness of him once again remember that's what Paul said did he not he talked about the church which is his body the fullness of him that feeleth all in all see so he leads us he leads me in the paths of righteousness you think of Jesus and John brother Brown talking about it and it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness he said they were the light for their age so it was up to them it was up to them nobody was going to do it it was up to them to fulfill the righteousness they were the lights of the age can you say amen that's right see and brother Brown said the light of every age should do the same thing you are the lights of this age no one else is the light to this age you are the light of this age amen so you cannot just amen be passive about it you cannot procrastinate into this thing you can't just play around with this thing and twiddle your thumb amen it lays on you it's already been written amen of what you will do there is a power behind it there is a string behind the promises of God that's right now notice we're not sitting around here wondering what needs to be done brother Brown said we know what's to be fulfilled now listen church it's one thing to look at politics and say well yeah we know that has to be done it's one thing to look at the natural church say well we know that has to be done we can look all around everything else and say yeah we know it but where do you fit in where do I fit in what do we know has to be done by us so brother Brown said we know what's to be fulfilled you who are spiritual and know the word of God you see everybody say I see you see what God has promised amen we're not guessing well what are these promises we know what's been promised we're in the land see we are in that third pool the word has been opened up to us and we're able to look as we talk to last Wednesday night we're able to look through the eye of God by the message of the hour now we know what the prophet said you know in the word in the countdown and I'm not going to take much longer but but hopefully it's it's it's it's it's ringing true but in the natural we have gone from the horse and buggy to the automobile amen and and and then from there we went from the automobile to fly on the airplane then we progress from the airplane to the astronaut amen going out in space brother Brown says see science has been able to prove that there's an astronaut that can go so far till you couldn't see it with your natural eye see it can go whether it can go whether there's any pressure there or not see amen no matter the pressures it can go Hallelujah amen see he can just go on out because he in a pressurized tank he can go up there and sell around and see the worlds around see where what is it he goes out where a few people can go he goes out see and he doesn't hear the hustle and bustle amen that's going on on the earth he's left the Earth he's in orbit he's away from all the the confusion and the mess and the honking of the horns and the traffic jams and and and and the busy life of of the Earth he's out there soaring above and yet we can't even he's seeing things that you and I or in the natural can't see he's beyond all of that brother Brown said it's the type of the church the church isn't in the horse and buggy days it's not in the automobile days it's not in the airplane but we are in the astronaut age he says it's beyond the any natural things that's where you and I are what is it it's a Promised Land and it took a special message to get us there it's a spiritual age brother Brown says a spiritual time where God has got spiritual astronauts astronauts people that can take the word of God and prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever spiritual astronauts are those who stay with the Bible and say that he's the same yesterday today and forever and not afraid of the promise regardless of what anybody said they just stay with it wow they're astronauts they're doing things they're able to accomplish things in the spirit amen that no other uh people on the Earth has oh my God you love him he said what is it you become in an astronaut that can go so far it's beyond denominational thinking it's beyond anything else it's beyond the things of the church out yonder with God and him alone you stay astronauts and he said now listen remember in order to be an astronaut they had to get in a tank and they can't control themselves it takes a radar power an atomic power to lift him out beyond space and then he's controlled by a tower and the church is the same way he leadeth me not me leading he leadeth me not the church leading me not the pope leading me not some uh uh Theologian leading me he leads me in these Paths of righteousness as the man had to get in the tank it suited up the prophet said so does this bride the spiritual astronaut have to get in in the body of Christ if she's going to go up you got to be in the body can you say man and then it's not you that's doing it it's not me that's doing it something is taken over and is leading us up there it's taken control of Our Lives isn't that what God wants to do is to take control of Our Lives he's got the promises laying there and when you see the promises you can't fear when you see these Giants around you you cannot fear when you come into failure and you're full you cannot fear let him lead you he'll lead you into these words the prophet said God wants men who can come into Christ and believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever and don't take their own thinking and move out into space controlled by the Holy Ghost see he leads us in the paths of righteousness so look how far this world has advanced from the horse and buggy day amen and yet yes and yet we still have people that ride the horse and buggy they refuse to move on we've got the car people that ride the automobiles but they refuse to fly we got people that go in into the you know into the airplanes but they can't they they can't go up into the astronaut and same is it in the church people get hung up in these ages they get hung up and lose them they get hung up in Wesley they get hung up in that Pentecostal age and that's as far as they go that God has taken us over into the Promised Land it's an astronaut to where you can see the word differently than than what they can in the horse and buggy you can see the word differently than what they could in the automobile or even the airplane you see things that you can't see any other way and you say Amen I hope it's all right brother Brandon said first they were lizards then they became chickens then they became crows but now they are eagles and no one can follow them you understand you see why it's different no one can follow you and remember what brother Brown said about the third pool it cannot be impersonated remember that now you're part of this third pool it cannot be impersonated amen you were ordained for this you were ordained for this land this land was ordained for you and it can't be impersonated so don't look around and try to compare your life with everybody else amen but don't don't look at that and but you just stay following the message of the hour and you just thank God for the grace that he has given you to see these things and the Liberty Amen to go amen across the Jordan into the land and claim your promises it's what you were ordained for amen and you remember this the astronaut doesn't leave Earth by his own power can you say man brother Brown said he gets into the tank and is fired out he just sits there and he waits for countdown and when the countdown is over something takes over that that thing and he's there for the right he doesn't have to work it up it's already there amen the fire is ignited and it just pushes off and he's fired out into space Amen brother Brown said that's all you have to do is get into it God will do the shooting and the placing it ain't gasoline power no more neither is it some church Creed it's God's Adam power that pushes you Plum out of space out yonder aren't you glad for that see it's beyond your control every promise is yours by God's power brother Brown said to how much greater is the astronaut these things now from the old horsepower automobile power airplane power you see the astronaut he's so high that he can see things that a man and a horse and buggy can't see he's so high he can see things that a man in the automobile can't see he's so high that he can see things that a man flying an airplane cannot see he's done went Plum out of reasoning amen glory that's it he done he's done went beyond any achievement man could think of the organization the denominations do you realize that Supernatural power belongs to the astronaut of this age amen it's not a makeup it's not a pushing it's not a striving it's it's not anything that we can conjure up it's just a super Dynamic power that we've been able to tap into as the astronauts yes sir see he's an astronaut he sailed Plum off Plum out into space notice what brother Brown says any man that ever lives for God will have to go beyond any five senses he'll have to go beyond any education any achievement that man's been able to do and believe God break everything everybody say break everything and lay it aside see you got to break through the sound barriers you got to break through that unbeliefable barrier you've got to break through amen that skeptic barrier you got to break through every critic you've got to break through every barrier in your life amen and it's not you again it's not you trying to be a Christian it's not you trying to overcome it's not you trying in your own power get into the body of Christ there is a Dynamics to it amen he said break everything and lay it aside and sweep up into the heavens Hallelujah another place brother Brown said the astronaut is any man or woman who will dare at any time to take God at his word you understand that church you see as we said uh Sunday night that God would have not claimed to said these promises if there was not somebody there to catch it to catch that word and God wouldn't have wasted his time amen bringing that third pool in opening the word the promised land to us if we're going to sit there and be skeptic and you remember this amen that the people that were skeptic they refused to go into that land and they died in the wilderness amen they complained about it don't complain about the promises don't complain about the things that you're looking at amen that seems to be a barrier to you look at the word of God and say I can I will I do believe don't complain about them don't let your heart become hardened when you see things that you cannot do yourself you with me don't let these obstacles dim your vision of the land that's that's there amen them Giants are there it's already written they'll be there the Giants in your life it's already been written what them now natural people faced amen God was only testifying through that that you would face it just as well except you would face it in a supernatural in a supernatural realm you had faced the Demonic Powers it isn't people it's demonic's Powers it's not you it's demonic Powers amen the thoughts that come against you amen these negative that's demonic Powers everything around you his demonic Powers amen the negativity that comes from the devil but the promises are the positive look to the promise amen notice now the word will not come easy you got to press your way into doing it you got to press your way in to do it the prophet said Luke 17 20 breaking in the kingdom of God cometh not with observation you know it it amen it's not something that everybody just looks says oh wow yeah no it doesn't come that way Matthew 11 12 breaking in Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force don't come just with observation amen if it's shown to you you got to take it by force you understand what I'm saying don't be passive about this message don't just sat there and just say well I'm just a mess of believer I believe God sent a prophet woe is me no no no don't you let these don't sit in the message church and let promises pass by you identify yourself with these promises they claim to these promises God you said it in your word I believe it that that settles it that's how you take it by force that that's how you fight it can you say amen amen you got sickness say God I thank you for healing me and promises are mine every service I thank God for healing me when you go around testifying everybody says how are you feeling just say I thank God for healing me you don't have to give them the blues about it just thank God for healing you're testifying of the promise of God you're laying claim to the promises of God you don't feel like raising your hands raise your hands anyways God I thank you I love you amen push past the discouragement push past the negativity in your life amen you say well doesn't that make me a hypocrite no if you're honest and you're true to God you can lay claim by faith to these things and watch it work for you that's right amen now notice you have to know now Jesus knew that John was the prophet of the hour John knew that Jesus was the Messiah of the hour so they they weren't on Earth without understanding I hope you understand that now you didn't get into the promised land they didn't come into the promised land just wander around without understanding understanding came to them now Jesus knew it because the word had spoken of John John knew it because the word had spoken of of Jesus and the prophet said they both had a clear understanding see the word has already spoke of them both right see so they were predestinated to fulfill the prophecies concerning them you realize that only God before the foundation of the world knew who John would be now in Malachi 3 and in Isaiah and all this he spoke of John did not call John's name he just prophesied of what John would do in the voice he would be he would be the voice of one crying in the wilderness and yet God never put John's name in the book literally to where everybody could say oh John the Baptist yeah that's you yeah yeah yeah yeah no no he didn't do that but as he began to prophesy through the prophets God already had John on his mind right he knew what John would be he knew what John would look like he knew what John's family would tree would be ain't that right see and so he knew amen that John was the one Amen to introduce the prophet amen and Only God knew who was going to be the Messiah only God knew who who married who was going to be the Virgin girl amen and all of these things amen it was revealed to John as to who he was ain't that right it was revealed to John as to who he was so he wasn't just preaching without knowing it was the people around him that did not know who John was they thought he was Elias they thought he and when I say Elias they saw that he was the literal Prophet Elijah hold on they thought he was Messiah look look it up John 1 21 and they asked him what then are thou Elias and he says I am not art thou that prophet in other words brother Brown said the Messiah he said to any answered no then they said unto them who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what says Thou of thyself he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah he knew who he was oh my it was a personal revelation to him as to who he was and what he was to do ain't that right amen and Jesus being the word knew who he himself was everybody else didn't know who he was but he knew who he was he knew he came from God and he would go back to God he knew that he was sin of the father to do the will of the father ain't that Ryan yeah he was misunderstood by others but it wasn't revealed to them so notice if the Church of the Living God could only get that into their heads this morning in their hearts that the church would not be separated by denominational bearers and that differences in Creeds and colors and so forth that we might come together in the name of the Lord Jesus and not have anything to Bear us away from the true word of the Living God and while straight down that line of scripture to fulfill all God's righteousness of today amen so so I'm hoping this is is making some sense to you tonight that we're not just sitting in this world wondering and guessing as to who we are young people you got a purpose and and and if you're just wandering through life just just wondering who you are and and and you say well I've already got my life mapped out I've already got my education I've already got my my degrees and I I know where I'm going but but before you go all that amen and that's fine and dandy but you better just look what the master has for you amen because there's there's a higher purpose there's a greater call amen than this just this life amen you could be successful in this life and Mr Rapture you could be successful in this life and be doomed to hell but if you fulfill the purpose of God I I thought of hearing brother Branham today and he says everyone that is fulfilled the purpose of God will raise again they're going to rise again ain't that right amen and so here we are amen we're not just wandering around amen but we're now identifying ourselves as the promises of God are made known oh my soul see what light are we living in because we are the lights of this age we're we're in the evening light ain't that right Zechariah 14 7 but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that evening time it shall be light your lights it's already been written of you to come ain't that right notice the prophet said it'll be evening time in the it'll be light in the evening time these gospel lights would turn back again like the same sun rises in the East and sits in the west it shall return again in the last days and here we are in the last days we have received the Holy Ghost we know that we spoke in tongues like they did at Pentecost we know you can receive it and we know that the seventh angel has given the message we see it Vindicated with signs we know we're at the end of the layout of sin age we know that National Strife signs and wonders are appearing everywhere we know that we're at the end time see god-bearing witness amen nations against Nations perplexed the times distress and all these things that we've heard see and it's becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness we know what's going on in the world and now we know it's behooving us to fulfill whole all righteousness ah brother Ram said we should be ready for the Rapture at this time of the age look where we're at there's something needed and that's back to the word back to the word we're promised over in Malachi 4 that we would be brought back to the word our homeland then you say amen back to the word what word the word that was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and the prophet of Malachi 4 taking us back to what has been promised by God ain't that right amen I gotta hurry brother Brown said the Royal seed would see it the Royal Sea will know he said can't you see Malachi 4 come to pass restored to the original Faith the word of God surely you people can see that we won't have to make it any plainer let that denomination go man get back to the word and the voice of the last day and the sign of the last day is to swing the people back to the original Faith Malachi 4 said so back to the word and he was the word not her him amen the name of the Lord Jesus the Vindicated word Now by The Promise the word that's promised and he says the voice is return to the word hey man I gotta go but I I just love the Lord remember I'm talking about the voice of the sign now the sign there's there's always got to be a voice following it if there's a sign and without the voice don't believe the sign he said but listen to The Voice and he said the voice says return to the word return to the word return to what God has called you to be return to what God has predestinated you to be can you say Amen will you say how can I do that well amen another another deal this message has is is fulfilled is is the the trumpet of Jubilee do you believe that amen we've heard this message is The Voice or the trumpet of Jubilee letting you know you're free you don't have to be a slave anymore you don't have to be away from your Homeland again you can go right back to where you started at in the beginning everything that you lost is yours you're free go back go back to where you came from how did we know except the open of the word and we realized we were in God before the foundation of the world we were saved before we ever become unsaved we were holy before we ever became Unholy amen we were faultless before we became full of faults Hallelujah and here we are we thought this was it this is the we were doomed and then we hear the voice return to the word that was originally spoken of you in the beginning can you say man for the word is your inheritance do you love the Lord and he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness if the musicians will come you're free whatever Satan has tried to make you to be you're free whatever Satan has tried to make you do you're free with whatever bondage Satan has bound you with you're free can you say Amen brother Brown said you really resisted the devil's lie in the beginning you never did do it in the first place you were saved in the beginning you were always the son of daughter of God if you've got eternal life can you say man praise the name of the Lord didn't the Lord wonderful
