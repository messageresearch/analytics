going to commit this service to you and we ask you to lead us now in Jesus name we pray amen and amen God bless you if you have your Bibles with you tonight we'd like to look look into the word of God and uh we're going to be looking the book of Ephesians first chapter amen I've uh just been studying it here in this book a little bit and if you're studying along with it and you're listening to the sermons you're you're going to recognize that there um that there's a lot in here and that you can glean a lot in your own studies and things um I'm not a systematic teacher you already know that uh so uh when I say that I'm looking into something or series that means I'm preaching along the thoughts and I'm I'm not going to take a lot of time sometimes to slow down and read some of the areas but but but I like us all to know that these things are things the prophet said amen we're going to be reading the first six verses of Ephesians chapter 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ for the will of God and to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus now Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ now blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessing blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now having predestinated us that's that's not a bad word I actually believe that that is one of the great words of the end time amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved amen God bless you as you be seated tonight uh tonight just want to take just a few minutes in the word here in the book of Ephesians and I'm going to be speaking to you I want to take a subtopic so if we can title these it helps us later if we want to go back over them uh but I do want to take a subtopic so you can kind of see my focus tonight but I want to speak on Vindicated Sons on Vindicated Sons so we're uh speaking from the book of Ephesians but I want to make it as as as much as I can to attach you or connect you to the point that it's not just uh abstract from the church it's not just something written but it's written about someone and it's written for something so I want to talk to you tonight about Vindicated Sons now here in the adoption series brother bandam has a lot to say about uh about this section of scriptures and and I just love how he says he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings and I want to read a little something he says now now just uh not just to some Apostles or some to this or but he's blessed us with all spiritual blessings and the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost here tonight the same holy ghost that made Mary shout and speak in tongues have a wonderful time and rejoice and the things that she did is the same Holy Ghost here tonight the same holy ghost that let Paul on that Old Ship where it looked like it was water logged and was gone and 14 days and nights no moon or Stars he looked out there and every wave had a devil on it glancing and gleaming his teeth he said I'll sink you old boy now I got you now and while Paul went down to have a little prayer there stood an angel said don't you fear Paul this old ship's going to be wrecked Upon A Certain Island go ahead eat your supper it's all right now he come with those chains and little arms and dragging them the feet and said be of good courage men for God the angel of God whose servant I am stood by me and they said Paul don't you and said Paul don't you fear and he said that same Holy Ghost is here tonight that same spirit of God ministering to us the same spiritual blessings amen the same one that was ministering to Paul in that place is the same one here tonight ministering to us amen I want to welcome the angel of the Lord here to minister the spiritual blessings to the church amen he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Heavenly places now not just out anywhere but in Heavenly places and that's why we're assembled in Heavenly it means the position of the believer I'm prayed up and you're prayed up the church has prayed up we're ready for the message and we have assembled ourselves together tonight as Saints called out and baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessing called elected set together in Heavenly places we are in the heavenlies in our souls we Spirits has brought us into Heavenly atmosphere brother there you are Heavenly atmosphere what could happen tonight what could happen tonight would be sitting here in Heavenly atmosphere the Holy Spirit moving over every heart that has been regenerated and become a new creature all our sins is under the blood perfect worship with our hands up to God our hearts lifted setting in Heavenly places in Christ worshiping together in Heavenly places and here's a prophet telling us amen that we have a position in Christ that's a Heavenly place but we are assembled here tonight together in a Heavenly atmosphere amen and a Heavenly place in other words we're not just placed here amen but we have a heavenly atmosphere in this place that God has given us of course we're here tonight knowing that we have found the place that God has gave us and chose us to be in now when did God choose you you that's got the Holy Ghost I love how he differes this because the book of Ephesians is not to just everyone it's to the ones that's received the Holy Ghost it's to them that are in Christ Jesus now he he said so when did he choose you that has the Holy Ghost he said he chose you before the foundation of the world see amen he chose you he foresaw you and knew you and before that was the foundation of the world he chose you and sent Jesus that he might be a propitiation for your sin to call you into reconciliation to himself Oh my he said if we just had a few minutes to go back and pick that up and he immediately goes to Genesis 1 and verse 26 and says later we'll get it a little more he says but see amen God made man he said before he made man he was called Elohim amen how many remembers the quotes brother B talks about El Elohim he said being self-existent one of course the word L is plural but God existed by himself now the word L being plural does not mean plural in person it means plural and attribute but those attributes was in God they were in God they wasn't manifested yet they were in God so he was existing by himself amen but when God began to create he began to create angels and brother B said there it was that's because he wanted to be worshiped is that right he said now of course he was God he says but really he wasn't God in the English way of saying it because God means an object of worship and it wasn't until after he created angels that he began to be worshiped now why did he create Angels because he wanted to be worshiped he desires to be worshiped amen do you know tonight that he's God but he don't become your God until you begin to worship him until you take it in your heart to worship him he is not your God and I don't know about you tonight but I don't want him just to be Abraham's God or Moses's God or brother brandom's God or Brother Ray or or somebody else's God I want him to be my God Amen I want him to be my God I Want To Worship him amen and I want to make him God tonight now I know amen that sometimes we don't feel worthy to worship him but that's all right because you know that he had the Angels who were perfect who could worship him but he wasn't satisfied with their perfection he wanted somebody to worship Him by choice so he had to find somebody who wanted to redeem to worship by choice now he made the Angels he made the world he made he created for six days amen but God still was known as Jehovah when you go through the scripture or Elohim when you go through the scripture in Genesis 1 it's amazing cuz it said in the beginning God created and on the third day God and on the fourth day God and it keeps calling him God meaning Elohim but then it changes in Genesis 2 and it says and the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground you ever noticed how it changes there from God to the Lord God and it means it's changing from Elohim to Jehovah so he takes a name change when he creates man because brother bam says he's not self-existing anymore he has created something off of himself so whatever man is it is enough in God's creation to make him change his name in other words they couldn't call him by the same name no more cuz he didn't exist he existed with something like him in his image see he had created a temporary God amateur God in other words something off of himself he is Jehovah who means he now exists with family now he's just Jehovah he's not Jehovah Gyra yet he's not Jehovah shamai yet he's not Jehovah rapi yet he's just Jehovah he's taken none of his Redemptive names because he hasn't redeemed anything see but yet we find that because all of that was in him there we find the necess city of the Fall In the Garden of Eden to bring out what God was so his name could be further revealed and how the name Jehovah must unfold now the prophet of God says here's the thing he says now when was we called to be Servants of God now we know we're Servants of God Sons and Daughters of God but when were we called to be so brother man said when oral Neville was called to be a servant he said this staggers me I'll tell you but we got to get some scripture to prove it he says let's see where it is and let's get uh first Peter uh 1 Peter chap 1 verse 19 and 20 brother bam actually has them in the room to get different scriptures I'll just read them for you 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 19 and 20 we're going to talk about when you were chosen but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained somebody tell me when that was before the found foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you now let's go ahead and turn to uh Revelation 17 and verse 8 or he can bring it up Revelation 17 and verse 8 now the Beast that which thou saw and is not and shall send out of the Maus pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and and is not and yet is amen when was it from the foundation of the world now let's go to Revelations 13 and verse 8 now if you like to study scripture I think it's a powerful thing because if you reading Revelation 17 you're reading about the Harlot system you're reading about the uh about all these things and always amazes me is right in the middle of it God puts the Lamb's Book of Life and talks about people who won't be deceived by it just in case a Believer is reading that and thinks everybody's going to be deceived by it there's a place in there for you to remind you everybody will worship except those who have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life in Revelations 13:8 this is right between the image and the Beast the beast in Revelations 131 down to about seven then it changes to the United States and in the middle of it it said and they that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world Amen now when was our names put on there the lamb was slain from the foundation of the world when God was Elohim the self-existent one when God was Elohim that's when he put our names he said he put our names there and then he slayed the lamb from the foundation of the world now I know this will shock you a bit but brother Bram said the blood of Jesus don't save you he said actually it kept you saved amen see therefore the blood is only for the redeemed amen therefore see God seeing he knows and that's why the brother Ram says predestination is really not a bad word if you understand it because election looks to for knowledge and predestination looks to Destiny predestination looks to something see it looks back here I was a cuckle bird born in sin shaped in iniquity come to speak in lies born against sinners father and mother and whole family Sinners but all of the sudden I become a weak grain how did that happen it was election God before the foundation of the world see it was election amen now watch what does it do predestination looks to Destiny he looks to where he's going to take you where you and I where am I going see there it is amen for knowledge I'm I'm skipping a bit for knowledge for Sol us knowing that he was a savior self-existence No Angels no nothing Elohim the self-existing nothing but him alone but him was a savior how's he going to save when nothing is lost but he had to have something lost to have something saved that was the plan of his Redemption amen now what we would like to do is disqualify ourselves from salvation because we needed saving but he couldn't use you if you didn't need saving so therefore we find that was where the need of the Lost of The Sinner King is to show the Salvation or the reality of God do you see what I mean for knowledge the infinite God he actually knew now I won't stay long in this but I just want to make this point to you that the prophet is teaching us that God does not run his business so lightly as to as to crucify his son and then see if someone would receive that he said but he actually knew that was people who wanted to be be saved so he crucified his son for your salvation therefore showing you that you were saved before you even came here but you were saved in the mind of God but now is come time to manifest that salvation in the end of the world the same as Jesus was in the mind of God and had to be manifested so is there a bride who was in the mind of God that had to be manifested so here tonight amen we're not trying to be something we're not not but we're actually here manifesting what we originally were in the mind of God before the world began so whatever it was whatever's coming into your life whatever situation that you have interacted do you know this that before you were lost he was a savior before you were sick he was a Healer amen because God needed this attribute to be redeemed therefore he could show who he was amen therefore we find this is the Great mystery that he had hid in his mind now real quickly you if you if you like studying this at home you can go in the master message of Christ is the mystery of God revealed so we're going to tie the adoption Ephesians 1 and Christ is the mystery of God reveal cuz see if you just stay in one area of the message you can start getting what what we uh you know like a focus and you can start determining things or certain ways without using the enlargement of the progression of the Revelation brother Adam brought to us now we're not progressing his Revelation but we should move in his progression and as he progressed we should progress with the Revelation therefore you see predestination now brother BR said we got to see the mystery that he had in his mind before the world began so uh in in Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother brandom actually tells you that he's going to tell you the mystery that was in God's mind before the world began if you never heard Christ the mystery you definitely need to hear Christ the mystery he will tell you the mystery that God had in his mind before the world began and brother RMA say it like this in in in in in Ephesians chapter 1 he'll pick it up and then he'll say all right see this ain't address to the outside amen we can't tell this to The Sinner they know nothing about it this is not addressed to The Sinner so you you have to see we're not trying to address it to The Sinner and sometimes people say well brother Wayne are you trying to PR destinate everybody no because it's not to a certain class of people but to the people it's to it is very powerful and it and it needs to be preached without the the hindrance of our unbelief we need to preach it like we really believe it and we need to believe it like it's really true amen do you see what he's saying to us that he has blessed us with spiritual blessings in Heavenly places this is your position in Christ that he saw you in it's where you stand with him predestinated there's the mystery there's the mystery he before Christ or anything else was ever on the earth you see the great mystery he chose the bride amen now I tell you one of the most powerful scriptures one of my favorite scriptures is in John the 15th chapter he said for ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you amen isn't it beautiful when you realize that God actually chose you of his own choosing that he was the one that made this choice now amen here's what he's saying the mystery is before Christ or anything else was on the earth you see the great mystery he chose the bride knowing that Eve would fall from disbelieving the word it did not surprise him that Eve disbelieve the word the prophet said watch he made her after the original Creation in his great wisdom knowing she would fall he didn't make her fall but he created her so she could fall but when she failed the all-wise god already knew now you'll never believe this but he actually knew you were coming in this end time and when she was falling he knew that Satan had not defeated his purpose but Satan had only set in the plan of his purpose and God had the battle won knowing you were coming before Eve ever even failed now I know you don't think you're important but that's all right in God's plan and economy he had you in his mind in the Garden of Eden and his whole plan rest upon what he knew about you and I listen friends sometimes I just say God you need to reveal to me what you know about me because what I know about me amen I'm not a very good man but what God knows about you you are more than able amen what God knows about you he's anointed you and put you in this age to meet the challenge of the age that we're living in I tell you this you're predestinated of God and there's the mystery when she fell amen from disbelieving the word now you got to keep that in mind disbelieving the word was her fa see he would choose that bride knowing that that would fall that would he said but he would choose a bride that would not fall she was predestinated to fall this bride is predestinated to not fall hallelujah oh glory be to God Amen then that means you're going to walk and if you stumble you're not going to fall this bride will not fall do you see what she's there regardless of what the rest of the world has to say about it they would hold to that word there you are they're predestinated to stand there the adoption of the children of Jesus Christ predestinated this church to a glorious stand you're predestinated unto an adoption you're predestinated unto a stand you're predestinated under holding on to the word no matter what nobody else does no matter what the rest of the world does somebody is going to believe this message and brother I'll tell you this it's not just a general reference God knew you specifically and anointed you and ordained you in the Church of the Living God sometimes we need to get revelation of indiv individuality amen sometimes we have good group mentality we we realize group revelation we realize the need for church and the need to be a part of the body amen but sometimes we miss that there is individuals in the body we can't just rely on being a part of a group but as an individual youve got to have a relationship with God that will reveal to you what he had in his mind a personal relationship of the appointment of almighty God in your life now some people got a good individual relationship and they forgot about the group relationship that's the reason they don't come to church they forgot how important it is to be a part of a group y'all's here so I ain't preaching to you amen you see they forget they forget to make a a little extra effort to be in the house of God they forget that because they've lost the reality of what it means to come together as a group and I know as the days go on people seem like it means less not so much here true word but it seems like it means less but Paul said it should mean more as the further we go we it should mean more to us than it did when we first began amen because group is important because it's the atmosphere of Believers getting together so if it's important to be together as a group then as an individual within the group we have responsibility Amen to amen the word of God and build an atmosphere in the word of God now I know amen some sometimes people say well how what you know I don't maybe you feel like a roller coaster sometimes one guy will say something this way another guy say this something but we're we're at home here okay amen so y'all just go ahead and relax and enjoy the word and if you feel like shouting go ahead and shout if you want to amen the word go ahead and amen the word amen but I if one thing that I I think we certainly want to do is we want to create an atmosphere amen where the power of God can bring Revelation in the room and the anointing can pick it up and begin to move it amen I'm not much on that intellectual and dry atmosphere it just don't it just don't do good for Sons and Daughters of God Amen do you see what it is now the adoption of children by Jesus Christ predestinated to the church you see the secret to restore a fallen Eve a prefigure of the church and notice he of course he opened up Adam's side and he took a bride out of Adam amen right he took a bride out of Adam is that right yeah so her body was the word amen right but her spirit Was the Same Spirit that he had amen so he knew that he would have a body he knew that there would be a place for his spirit in the last day now in God's only provided place of worship watch how brother Braham approaches this now don't forget our subjects Vindicated Sons he said now The Headstone is going to begin crying Grace Grace and you have begin to pass from death and Creed into the Living Word of the Living God God's only provided plan for this age see God's only provided plan his sons in this word age is quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive and Now setting in Heavenly places already alive and subject to every promise isn't that beautiful that's what it does see you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men is a part of God's word then we begin to be seated together and the entire then the entire body see because there's no leaven among you no leaven among you just the word only amen no leaven see it brings the entire fullness of the godhead couldn't do it in Luther's age somebody say couldn't do it couldn't do it in Wesley's age see couldn't do it in Pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man is manifested or revealed it brought the church back together with the entire deity of God amongst his people showing visible signs manifesting himself like he did from the beginning when he manifested on the earth in the form of a prophet God do you see where it's at we're watching now the sons of this age are quickened by the word of the age they're living in Eve fell from disbelieving the word sons in the end time will be proven by believing the word watch what he's going to bring and things that are to be brother man says see the only way to be a son or daughter of God is you have to have eternal life and there's only one form and that's God's life he said to be a Son of God you had to be in God to be a Son of God you had to always be in him the gene of your life your spiritual life tonight was God the Father before there was even a molecule and you were nothing but the manifestation of the gene of that life that was in God as a Son of God now you're expressed after the word has coming to you to light up this age now Jesus said he was the light of the world but tonight do you recognize that you are the light of this age you are the light of this age you're here to express God's life in you because you're Sons and Daughters of God you get what I'm saying you're made you're setting in the church church tonight because your duty is to Feld the whole thing's waiting to find out who they are everybody's want to know who is this who is this woman who is this bride who is this that Paul's talking about adopted sons and manifested Sons true Sons born Sons Holy Ghost Sons amen pure Word Church who is this they're talking about is it somebody Through the Ages that's why brother bam said churches churches Brides brides but there's got to come one there's got to come a church that has been predestinated unto the position so somebody has been pre-planned to set where your setting tonight God ordained it to be there some people say well I don't know uh if it's right for God to ordain something but you you but we we're just in a an amateur God Amen and sometimes we plan events a year in time we've already got the camp rented for next August we've got February already a speaker coming it's already ready amen because we're pre-planning for something we're making plans we're predes we're making Destiny for something to happen now the problem with us is we have limited knowledge so something could come up to cancel our plans but God who has all power and he also has all knowledge if God pre-plans something amen there's nothing coming up Church there's nothing going to come up that can cancel the plans of almighty God and he's the one that plans your success tonight I tell you what you might as well tell the devil amen you can't tear me up God's already Pro me up amen when God does something to pre-plan for a church amen I pre-plan a sermon amen God pre-planned an age he preplanned a people he preplanned situations and because God could do so he could manifest his glory and his will amen see amen but there Comes A Time to manifest in other words we got a special speaker we don't tell the name maybe we got a special speaker coming amen everybody's wanting to wait who is who's coming you know all kinds of people who's coming well you sometimes you got to wait for it to manifest see then it's manifested then the mystery of it is revealed because the name is put to something then you start identifying a person with an event with a pre-planning and I say this God has pre-planned this bride this church and he did since the foundation of the world and every Prophet has prophesied and every King has known and wanted to understand men have long to see this Revelation some of them getting in a glimpse but the whole thing has been waiting for the manifestation of these Sons brother bam said since the foundation of the world he said for the manifestation of the sons to display them to the church amen I love how he says it he says I'll stop on my story he says maybe uh talking about the prophets of Moses and them some words he said they've waited until this Latter Day for these things to be displayed now if you want to take that word display and run to the Token right quick you'll get a blessing they've been waiting for these things to display they've been waiting somebody to display the attributes of the sons from the beginning amen it it's to be revealed in the sons of God now brother bam immediately takes it to the pyramid so you you study the message you watch the Pyramid of the Statue of the perfect man you watch the pyramid over with Enoch and brother Ram says see there's a bottom but there's a top yes sir see now we're not down there in the bottom of this pyramid we're up there in the top of this pyramid right and and at the revealing of the headship at the revealing of The Headstone that's when it will become clear who these people were that were in the mind of God Amen sure from the beginning it's a pyramid building closer and closer now I don't believe this could happen in another day I believe Ephesians actually Ephesians is wrote I believe it's positioning Us in this generation it's the Book of Joshua can I can I read you something in Acts chapter 3 watch the scripture and he shall s Jesus Christ which was preached before unto you whom the heavens must receive until somebody say until isn't that amazing that Romans the 8th chapter says that the whole thing's waiting until so we we've got things waiting until something now the scripture says it's until the times of the restitution of all things that God has spoken by the prophets now you that study scripture know that's Matthew the 17th chapter Jesus coming off a mount Transfiguration they said we thought Elias shall come he said he has come but he shall come and restore all things so the heavens receive Jesus until the restitution of all things which is Elijah's Ministry opening the scriptures to the end time generation in Daniel the 12th chapter it'll agree with it in the ninth verse Daniel seeing the book open the angel tells Daniel to seal the words and close them up till the time of the End Amen he keeps using the same language in Revelations 10:4 when John sees the Thunders he said the Thunders uttered the voices and I was about to ride and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying seal up the things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not but in the seventh verse of the same chapter but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God will be finished as he's declared to his servants the prophets isn't it beautiful he's telling this all of this is until this seventh angel sounds but when he sounds the mystery of God would be finished I love it in second Peter chapter 1 you can climb the pyramid and you can come and cap it with love but in the 11th verse he said an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior Jesus Christ what's he telling us he's telling us amen that something's going to break out in the last days that's going to be about the Vindication of the sons of God that have been predestinated it's a beautiful thing to me in the church AG book brother bam will tell us this he said them Thunders uttered said write them not what was in those Thunders no one knew but we need to know and it will take a prophet to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing scriptural Revelation except for a prophet so it was going to take a prophet Romans 8 was waiting on a seventh angel isn't it beautiful that Romans the 8th chapter is directly connected to the seventh angel messenger of Revelations the 10th chapter do you see what it is in the third seal when brother randam is breaking out these seals he says it like this he said the bride it hasn't had a Revival yet that's powerful isn't it with all the things that's happened and no Revival for the bride now we've had we've had healings and miracles and we've had discernments and we've had signs we've had everything happening but he said there's been no Revival for the bride because there's been no manifestation to steer that bride yet now that's in the third seal so some people will read that and they'll look forward and say someday we're going to have a great Revival but in 1964 brother Randon balances it and comes along and says there's a great paper out here and they're praying fast and pray fast and pray he says see they're asking for a Great Awakening for a Revival but what they don't know they've not recognized The Awakening of the Bride they feel the pull of the hour but they didn't recognize what's being done they know some something's supposed to happen but they're looking off in the future when it's all already happened right by you now look at this some people looking for Revival listen let me say it real clearly we're not looking for Revival we are the Revival that was prophesied some people don't recognize it amen but to the bride the elect of God she heard her name called and she come out of denomination she feels the pull of the hour now brother Brandon going lay it out very clearly that Revelations chapter 10 and Malachi 4 is the same guy same Prophet but he said that it would turn the hearts Elijah would turn the heart of the children to their fathers it would turn us to the faith of our fathers is that right now watch that adoption message in Malachi 4 what was it that brother random taught so much about adoption that a son would learn his father's business and here the scripture is telling us that Malachi four would give the children the faith of their fathers they would teach them the same thing that their father had now these mystery truth will literally turn the heart of the children back under their Apostolic fathers amen now according to the message of Grace brother M I'mma tie the two things together he ties the Capstone and the revealing of the word together when he says when these Mysteries unfolded I cried Grace Grace unto them so he's telling you that Zechariah 4 the spirit has brought the unfolding of the word that unfolding of the word is the headship of Christ or the seven Thunder revelation of God that was promised to the church do you see what it is it's a capping Stone brother Ram says it in the adoption he'll say it like this he said the capping Stone in the days of the manifestation of sons in the Bible where are we at we're at the end time adoption Part Two Brother Ram says see it's the manifestation it's the making known in adoption part two he said it would be manifested in the last days waiting and groaning for the sons of God to rise in the last days with the power of the Holy Ghost at the end of the age to reveal the secret things from the foundation of the world to bring it up see from the foundation of the world you it's amazing to me that brother bandom identifies this that this man this this Prophet will reveal what was before the foundation of the world then he says now let's go back now and begin to talk about what's before the he said now when this man comes he's going to unfold the mystery from before the foundation of the world he said now let's go back now to the Book of Genesis oh he must be the guy because what he's doing is unfolding something to the church he's unfolding what real Vindicated sons are going to look like the whole world has ideas of what sons are going to be but here a prophet is going to unveil the true sunship he's going to give us the message that will reveal the bride in the last days what has been hid we're living in the last days see see it's got to come brother B said the angel is here now to testify the day is here now that's the reason in the serpent seed I don't know if you've read this one paragraph 149 you'll love it he says see the eyes of the wise and prudent promis to reveal it to the sons of God in the last days when the sons of God will be manifest God's sons that rejoice even before the foundation of the worldj when the Great revelation of the godhead and things would be brought down in the last days he would manifest these things through the sons of God a't that powerful and you know the scripture teaches that and here we are it's amazing that's the reason God is is opening these things to us God is bringing Sons into manifestation that's the reason the revelation of the message has come it's to bring Sons into manifestation see it takes us beyond the limit of human knowledge it takes us beyond the limit of schooling and puts us in Revelation sons of God to be manifest think by the living presence of the living Christ amen now here in 1962 Blasphemous names uh brother Bram will say something this is very much where I'm drawing uh this point from Brother Braham says it like this he said see you become one amen this thing out of my way it's hard on your arm see you become one you you you see life you see Christ live together now at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me then that's a sealed unit of the Lord now then they are Vindicated and placed when that time takes place they become Vindicated Sons and Daughters of God when this time comes they become Vindicated Sons and Daughters of God see it's way past that guessing stage now it's way past that I hope maybe I might get to be a part this has come to vindicating Sons according to scripture you're predestinated unto the vindicating of sons brother bram's going to enter he literally is going to switch out the words adoption manifesting vindicating placing he's going to keep interchanging them words to let you know that whatever it was God had in his mind is Now setting in the church and whatever you thought a true son is you're looking at Vindicated Sons so this has got to be where your mind comes to see we look out in the future we think Well a true son's got to be this way it's got to be this way it's got to be this way but a true son is a son that's been revealed by the message of the hour that's what a true son looks like it's a true son that can stay with a message that's what a true son looks like it's somebody that stays with the word of God if he was the right kind of son see if he was the right kind of son he would obey his father remember brother R's business he he brother brother uh Ray done a tremendous job the other day so I'm not going to teach on it remember Brother Ray took a farmer and and and I'm not going to teach I'm going to remind you he took a farmer and said he's got a boy in the house but the boy don't know how to farm so he's going to make that that boy raise up and start farming cuz he's got to learn his father's business and someday the Daddy won't be there and he's got to know how to put the seed in the ground he's got to know how to lay the plow he's got to know how to hire he's not he's got to know the business of the father and I tell you shouting ground y'all remember brother brand brought brother brother brandom brother brother Ray brought it up and I thought it was so powerful amen is when he said it like this he said but our father's business is not farming y'all remember that our daddy's business is not farming our daddy's business is vindicating the word word of God that's the business that God is in now I tell you when brother Ram says this he said the secret of the message now is the father's business it's not a secret it's our Revelation at this generation he says what it must be is the father's business the weak cries back what's it doing it's vindicating Malachi 4 it's vindicating Luke 17 Hebrews the 13th chapter it's vindicating John 14:12 see Revelations the 10th chapter the opening of the seals what's God doing he's vindicating the word and how is God doing that by the bride who is believing that word she is a Vindication herself of the word that has come in this age God vindicates this to be true and it's the fulfilling of the age the proving denominational has just been characters he said another one of the father's businesses to prove this the father's business is now to show that denominations are not his denomination is not his they are manmade systems that deny the word see what it is is in Luke chapter 18 He says will I find faith when I return y'all remember that remember the unjust judge amen that and she just kept bugging him and finally he answered but the scripture says amen that Jesus is telling us here that the WID of the city of course she went to him but shall not God avenge his own elect which cry to him day and night though bear long with him I tell you he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh he will find faith on the earth he will avenge them speedily now now if you want to if you want to take time I don't have time to preach there but you want to take time to study it that word is vindicate amen he will vindicate them when you go to court what do you need Vindication when you go and you're actually maybe you're innocent you go before a judge and you're looking there innocent guilty innocent guilty you need Vindication of your innocence and it takes a judge to bring a Vindication of a Believer see you think you're a Believer you say you're a Believer but without the message of the hour you have no proof you're a Believer oh but when the message of the hour dwell upon the Church of the Living God it is the Vindication from the mind of God these are they that withm me before the world ever began isn't it amazing somebody can shake your hand confirm you they can they can we can confirm you that don't vindicate you do you see what we could have all kinds of emotions that does not vindicate the believer right amen but what vindicates the believer is when the word comes upon them and that word manifests itself in their life it vindicates them that they never were there in this land they were in him before the world ever began the Vindicated word see the Vindicated word it's what vindicates the church it's what brings them man I got too much in too little time it's what brings them see it's what brings them a Vindication do you know in in Matthew the 12th chapter that this Bible says that God would show judgment under these Gentiles that God would show judgment under the Gentiles but the Judgment that he brings would be a judgment for victory it will be a judgment for victory the scripture says Matthew 12:2 he said he will send forth judgment unto Victory and in his name shall the Gentile trust that's why Isaiah said he would be a light under the Gentiles brother BR said when Isaiah said that he wasn't talking about Jesus in that day he was talking about Jesus in this day he would be a judgment under the Gentile he would bring light under the Gentiles he would Quicken and manifest true sons who were in The Darkness but he would bring light to Spring them and bring judgment and bring life unto them my goodness say too much amen do you see what it is the message is bringing Vindicated Sons when you when you study the message and you you hear Brother bam in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says what God is doing in this season is bringing life to the body body is that right he's bringing life into the body now the life in the body is Vindication of rapture how do you know you're going in the Rapture you see how do you know apart from someone else that you're going in Rapture do you know that the church today is Vindicated for Rapture the prophet of God said when the life of this word is in you you're already Vindicated for the Rapture the token is displayed so there has to come forth a holy spirit to ripen or vindicate or Manifest this evening light now what this word is this Living Word it's his own personal presence bringing Vindication which proves his church look at that look at that he proves his church how's he do it puts the word test on her he puts the word test on her it was a personal Vindication God In the Flesh personally Vindicated people born of his spirit in this last day in this great denominational Age We liveing the Living God takes his living word and vindicates it personally this life that's in the word The Germ that's in the seed and the word that is s forth to seow the life is Christ in the word personally in you vindicating something you cannot do proving himself that it's not you it's him you've become one with him Len what he's saying Christ it's powerful paragraph 5:28 he the word do you know what's right the word is Vindicated he the word properly Vindicated is headship my somebody get out the way this ain't a headless church it's a church with head see not the headship of Rome it's the personal headship of almighty God you see what he's doing he properly Vindicated that word he is the headship properly identifies his own spirit being in the the church do you see what it's doing it's recognizing this body with his resurrection see he didn't leave us in the grave of the Baptist he didn't leave us in the grave of the Lutheran he didn't leave us in the grave of the Presbyterian he brought us from the grave vindicating by this word you are that that was in his mind to begin with see amen if you had just been another church he would have left you in the tomb but this word had to live so he resurrected you in the power and he Vindicated you with his own headship now life is in the body is a Vindication of rapture now when this church comes near The Headstone she will have his potentials she will be a super Church sir now I I think I think it's amazing to hear this a super Church a super race amen isn't that powerful and you don't have to go to Hitler to find it Hitler was on a pipe dream I'll have a super race but isn't it odd the age he lived that he caught something that there would be a super race but he just missed that it was Abraham's Royal seed amen and it would be a super race because it would be a predestinated race a predestinated church now here's the thing brother bam says and I I think it's a I think it's a very powerful wisdom versus Faith 1962 in these last days every seed is sold everything is in order the time is shaped up the church in its order the seed the evening lights the signs as it was in the days of Sodom an angel of God the Holy Spirit coming down performing signs as he did Malachi 4 promised he would sin we see it all right here amen amen amen amen sure right here in the last days a predestinated church knowing where they're standing sold with the seed isn't that now that's powerful Church they know where they're standing they're sowed with the seed the holy spirit is in the church I love how he says it now Satan be careful the church knows where it's standing do do you see this watch what he's doing Satan be careful because now you're approaching the same thing you approached in the Bible when you came to Jesus see immediately he said if thou be the son looking for Vindication do this do this do this and Jesus did not play any of his games but because he stayed with the word he defeated Satan by staying with the word look at the power of this and the Church of the Living God will defeat Satan anywhere any time any place in any form by just staying with the word when you stay with the word you have you have brought your Victory Satan be careful now I I was just thinking about this uh we're we're going to close very soon I was just thinking about this today and I was just thinking about the snake handling churches out in the Appalachian Mountains you know why they you know why they're handling snakes they're trying to prove right they're believers they think if they carry snake and all this even snakes bite people and they just keep they keep trying to prove it right in the face of death and lot there's been a lot of them buried cuz God never said pick up a snake to prove you're my son I just seen something the other day somebody said that there was a an African Pastor got into a a lion's den with some they said well they were tamed before he got in there though just but he's trying to prove that he's a son but God never said pick up a snake to prove it he never said get the Lions Den to prove it though that did it in the Bible Daniel got in the Lion's Den and Paul shook a snake off in the fire but God never said do that to prove you're a son but the Vindication of your sunship is the message of the hour and as you stay with that word vindicating that you are that bride that was in his mind do you see what it is you're sold with a seed do you see what happened brother Bram says now watch this Satan when he met Jesus he flew into him with all of his ecclesiastical Force I know the word he flew into him denomination dust had that he had he throwed it onto him but it didn't have any life in it yeah he put the word to Jesus but he didn't have no life in it he said did did did he ever fly off he come off a lot quicker than he flew on he hit that 100 billion volt wire there and it singed his feathers well Satan you better be careful you're going to get your feather singed again playing around here he come off of him see he come out of him cuz the wire had a vault in it now watch brother Bradon now Satan had a wire too but no matter how how nice copper the wire it was it didn't have no life in it it was dead see it wouldn't act but it was the same wire see one had been energized with a diamond o the other had no connection that's right the reason it'll work in a predestinated vessel the reason the word will work there because it's connected se but where it's connected to a denomination it's a dead socket having a form of godliness but denying the power see but connected with the word see which shall never pass away and can produce the same power that he had there at glory now watch brother Braham says it like this I love I love when he gets into this he said see it was the same wire Jesus used the father's word and Satan used the father's word but Satan was Satan and Jesus was God see that's the difference one is a Creed and the other one is the word one is true the other is false one will produce it the the other can't produce it the same kind of wires see Hebrews 2 4 and2 said we just got it like denominations by wisdom denominations by wisdom says the days of the current is passed so what they do they got the same wire but the days of the current has passed so brother Ram says but watch this now he says see Lord this is my prayer take every believer in here and put current in them put life in them let him buzz and Shine for the glory of God turn on the current you know what I believe the seed has been sown you believe that he said for the great church and I love how he says it the LI the wires have all been laid out in the building the seed has been sewn can I say it like this the church has been wired am you got a house and you say it's all wired now it's ready for the current he said every socket has to be tested by that word so what you can do is you can you can come in here today and you can look over there and say I don't know that looks like a socket but has it got current to it it's got a wire but it's got current but what you're going to do is walk around and test the test the socket to see what's in it and that's what God has said in this age I've laid it out I've got the word here I've laid out the wire but I've got to vindicate every Outlet of the circuit amen Sons and Daughters of God are not here tonight just as a dead current or a dead wire but God is connected a current to the church and when Satan comes against it with the same word brother B said he's going to get his he's going to get his feather singed because they're Vindicated sons and they stay with the word amen God bless you won't you stand to your feet come in music if you would oh don't you love him tonight isn't he a merciful god he is amen he's a merciful god I hope that makes a little bit of sense predestinated under Vindication amen and real simplicity it takes the message to vindicate Sons may look like one may talk like one but how does he stay with a word that's where it comes to how do we stay with the word the beauty the beauty brother Andrew is brother Bram said it like this he said now that first Eve she fell from the word he said but that second one she wouldn't fall from the word because she is the word but now she's been Vindicated She's Not Just word she's Vindicated word praise the Lord she's connected to the headship and ready for rapture amen ready for Rapture Ready for token amen thank you Jesus [Music] amen
