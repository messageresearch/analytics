God there is none like [Music] you God bless you tonight you'll be seated for a moment just want to get up at the beginning got a couple light-hearted things to share with you a couple announcements uh uh there's a brother in our church that I should have been wearing one tonight you've seen people around the campground wearing the little Cloud pins uh there's a brother Levi Bish from our church who makes those uh likes us to hand them out to Believers when we gives us to the gives them to the ministry when we travel around and things so there's going to be a box of them out there by the t-shirts those are complimentary I've been uh asked about them a few times so if you'd like one of those you can have one of those uh free of charge and amen and uh that's that's our headship that's our Lord up there amen we're we're uh we're happy to be identified with that cloud amen uh and also we want you those of you making travel plans and things uh every year if if it's your first time here every year there's a gathering at the mcnalty home uh for kind of the camp after party on Sunday afternoon so um if you if you can stay around that long you really don't want to miss that that's a wonderful time of Fellowship right after the camp so we'd like you to have that now some of the uh some of the boys here on the camp have asked me to to notify the church tonight that we've got a new rule there's unfortunately we we've had to add a rule those of you in the back uh what we do here we're a very new Youth Camp you see and so we don't have a lot of rules because what happens is you can kind of operate on mostly Common Sense until all of a sudden you need a rule so what we do is then when we have to come up with a new rule then we name it after the person who's responsible for the rules so now but would you ever imagine that we would need to have a rule against attempted vehicular manslaughter but uh unfortunately we've had to add the micaa rule this year and so you know uh we don't want you to run over your friends we don't want you to run over your enemies either that's against the rules so you know we've had a lot of bumps and bruises you know uh this weekend but by the grace of God no no serious injuries uh We've really kept sister Lily busy but um but we we are overcoming amen uh the Devil May fight but no weapon that he has will prosper against God's people so we're grateful we've had a wonderful day today on the campground we started out with a morning worship the presence of the Lord just came by amen we've had some some great activities got some funny pictures made some good memories hasn't it been a good day [Applause] amen yes sir had our camper versus staff volleyball uh game and um unfortunately the staff team lost yet again amen but we want to congratulate The Blue Team I don't even know your team name but congratulations blue team and we just had a good time time you know we like to get a little noisy and and have a little bit of fun kind of like brother brandom talked about you know people get in the spirit of a ball game you know so how come we can't get in the spirit of a service we like to do both amen cuz we're Christians we're the happiest people on the face of the Earth we love life we love Fellowship we love to be together it's good to be a Christian amen it's it's it's been good to be at Camp can you say Amen to that Hallelujah uh tonight on a serious note will be our prayer line service and uh so we're just asking that you would with your poll with your expectation amen enter in uh to this service with us because we're dealing with very great need the environment that our young people are overcoming in is darker than the world is ever seen amen there's there's very grave needs come through this prayer line every year uh I I think it was the first year a young lady came through the prayer line spoke to brother Andrew Spencer and and told him said brother Andrew if the Lord doesn't do something for me right now said then as soon as I get home I'm going to take my life amen and and that's that's how serious amen uh uh the condition can be that's that's how lives even hang in the balance of Deliverance services like this and so you know but that sister by the grace of God received her her Deliverance she's alive today amen pressing on no doubt still having battles still having struggles perhaps making mistakes but as we heard last night a true child of God they fall down but they get back up and they get back up again and they get back up again did you enjoy that word last night amen what a crucial what an important message that we heard amen we just praise the Lord so we're going to have this prayer line service uh we got a a team of brothers and sisters that we' worked with um to uh to to help with this and to uh just to administrate this we got the deacons directing things so so uh we just want to let you know we we have some people together uh uh to to do the work of the prayer line it's not to anybody's exclusion but to keep things orderly and efficient amen and and just stay out of the way of the moving of the spirit and and so we just ask you to join in Unity with us U we've had some afternoon sessions with our older youth with brother brother uh Aaron Oglesby brother Samuel Browning have done a tremendous job and it's amazing how they dovetailed together amen uh Friday afternoon brother Aaron spoke on unity and today brother Samuel spoke on individuality and you see that's how the unity of the spirit Works amen because we've come here to unite together in Fellowship but you've come from different places you've come from different churches different kind of Ministries that you've sat under and so we're a very diverse group today but our Oneness is not sameness but we are united under one head and when the head comes down on the body that headship the life of it flows through the body and every joint will supply in a unique way amen where nobody else can take your place even in this meeting you have a role to play and pulling on the word and creating an atmosphere amen and exercising Faith to bring bring the presence of the Lord on the scene and nobody can replace you it is essential amen that we join together and bring our licks of fire together from wherever you've come let's put our licks of Fire Let's Overlook all differences amen let's honor one another enough to bring those licks of fire together and brother Bram said when we do that it restores the presence of the pillar of fire amongst the people now the headship of the word is going to be is going to come down tonight amen cuz we've got a message Preacher Brother Andrew going to preach tonight he's going to preach you the message of the hour amen and that that headship is going to come upon the body amen and uh and so it's going to be the message that we hear tonight and brother Bram said wherever the message goes the angel of the Lord accompanies it always always so we're not just hoping uh we're not just uh begging for the pillar of fire to come into the room amen but it's promised to us that because we're gathered in his name and under the identific a of the hour amen he'll be with us he'll be amongst us it'll be the presence of the pillar of fire you might say well brother Nathan I've never seen any strange light flash across and I've never seen that brother brandom said uh maybe you've never seen the pillar of fire he said but you feel it and he said one sense is as good of as another tonight you say well I I don't even feel anything in particular tonight amen but use that six sense amen exercise your faith say God you promised you would come amongst us if we would come together in one mind and one Accord I believe if we would do that tonight not one sick person would leave here amen unhealed there would not be one that's bound that would not leave delivered amen I believe we would see a total Victory a total Deliverance if we'll bind our hearts together invite the presence of the Lord and believe that the angel of the Lord will accompany the message as it's preached tonight amen God bless you uh I I just ask you to enter in tonight as We Worship the Lord and we enjoy brother Andrew when we have the prayer line it'll come around in a clockwise fashion and the deacons uh will direct you and so just be reverent amen and Peaceable and and and uh pray for one another amen God bless you tonight [Music] let's stand together for the prayer this evening we'll be receiving the offering if the

our hearts together in a word of prayer we believe he's here the atmosphere is in the building all things are possible tonight to them that believe may we just join our faith together tonight and as the prophet of God would say let's go into his presence by the way of prayer you got a need I believe you can leave here tonight with that need met amen you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe you can receive it right here tonight amen maybe we could just play that only belief softly tonight as we just approach our Lord Heavenly Father Lord as we come before you tonight father your Prophet has t us that this song that we're hearing played now Lord he said the angel of the Lord loved that song for Lord that song introduced him around the world seven times Lord he walked into many Arenas he walked into many coliseums churches missions wherever he went but Lord he walked in there representing the angel of the Lord and represented by the angel of the Lord and father he said it over and over there's never one time that you've entered a battle but what you've left carrying the Victory and tonight Lord we know the devil has done everything he can to stop and hinder this group of young people but Lord greater is he that is in them than he that is in the opposition against them and Lord I know as we come to this service tonight under the expectation of your word father look into a coming prayer line knowing that you are the same yesterday today and forever I pray Lord you would open the windows of Heaven tonight dear God lord may this atmosphere that we feel Among Us Lord father may it not just come Lord and just leave but Lord may we entertain the atmosphere for lord it's not a feeling it's not an emotion but Lord It's a reality that the same Lord that was in a grave rose again and he's right here tonight in the power of your Resurrection now father I pray for those that are suffering their body tonight Lord may this be the night that suffering ends Lord for those that are bound oh God may this be the night that the chains are broken Lord father I pray for those that are maybe empty Lord needing the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire lord I believe you're more than able to come right among us tonight you're already Among Us Lord so father May our faith reach out tonight and receive that which we have need of Lord we pray As We join our faith together tonight we we rebuke the devil in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Satan you have no power you have no Authority our Lord stripped you 2,000 years ago you're nothing but a bluff so in the name of Jesus Christ take your leave and May the angels of God come Among Us and Minister salvation and healing and deliverance to your children we commit this service in your faithfulness hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we want to go to the word of the lord we just have one place we want to read tonight in the Book of Romans the 8th chapter amen how many loves the Lord amen I believe the spirit of the Lord is moving Among Us in a special way this week and amen we thank the Lord for the for the platform to preach the message of the hour from here tonight amen Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 it's a very famili you're reading Amen to the Believers in Romans chap 8 and: 11 the Bible here says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you so not around you or on you or above you but if it dwell in you then he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now we have to recognize tonight that we're not Immortal in our flesh we're mortal bodies here tonight our soul has passed from Death unto life and our soul is Immortal but we still have a flesh body but the spirit of the Lord is still available to change the situations of that mortal body and one day it will come a final change and our body will match our soul if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you then he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing into the reading of his word as you can have your seat here tonight amen for just a few moments if I could amen if I would take a a title tonight I want to speak to you here on this thought of we must not lose our enthusiasm we must not lose our enthusiasm and you know I want to begin tonight by saying that I believe that the enthusiasm of an age amen is the message of the hour amen that God sends into that age I don't believe amen that it's a it's a church or it's a song or it's a certain preacher amen but I believe the message of the hour amen is the enthusiasm among the church now in 1965 brother BR preaches two very powerful sermons and he preaches these both on the subject of quickening power he preaches one called the Easter seal and then he preaches another one and he calls it it is the rising of the sun now to draw our thought tonight I want to read here from the the Easter Shield paragraph 47 he said now as Christians we all claim that he is alive how many how many can claim that he's alive tonight we all claim that he is alive and we believe amen that we have been quickened from Death To Life by his Spirit now if we haven't been quickened then we've not been made alive now he says we're going to speak into this or subject for a minute he said how that are we quickened and can we be sure amen that this is the truth you know I believe the time has come Amen to move be on hoping that we're believing the right thing or guessing amen that we're believing the right thing but I believe it's time to come to a 100% confidence and Assurance amen that we know in whom we have believed we know who we're believing we know what we're following amen but we also know where we're going he said see this is your own life this is my life and if this isn't the truth amen what I'm fixing to say that I'm one of the most foolish people in the world he said I've give my life for something that there's nothing to and so have you but if it is the truth then I owe everything that I am see amen if this message is the truth then we owe everything that we are unto it see amen I owe everything that I could be to the cause of which we're standing for now listen to these words and I think amen that we must not lose our enthusiasm now that's a direct quote from the prophet amen I think that we must not amen lose our enthusiasm I want to begin by saying thank God amen for a Vindicated Prophet that preached amen a balance on enthusiasm he said now I'd rather have a little enthusiasm amen then no ASM at all see amen just to have somebody get enthused about it brother Ram would go on and make an announcement in 1958 he said the church today has lost its enthusiasm why because it's got out of the vine see it's no more being energized by the spirit Wells of water bubbling up into everlasting life they've lost that Zeal amen something is missing now watch amen God Remains the Same and Christ Remains the Same amen but his church has disassociated itself amen with his connection which is the vine the spirit so there the prophet of God identifies amen that the holy spirit is the source amen of the Zeal or the passion amen or the energy that is coming into the church amen which is causing an enthusiasm in the church he said let see have you noticed today's crop have you noticed today what we do anden we got enough God about us to we we'll come up to the platform and say well yes maybe I better come up now this is the experience of worldwide he said yes I better go up and stand and say well well I don't know here I am see huh amen what a place to be in he said there's no fire burning there's no enthusiasm now listen amen there's not a go into it amen there's not a go into it and as an evangelist he said that just k KS me to see God's people in that shape amen we are supposed to be on fire you all know the prophet of God had a vision amen of a map of Palestine and he was standing Amen on the map of Palestine and he was 2third of the way there and he's looking across the Jordan and he says over there amen is where all the promises were laying amen now now you know that that was two pools right amen of the third pool Ministry but the promises were not in the first pool the promises were not in the second pull amen but the promises were in the third pull amen so in order to go into that there had to be a let's go into it amen and I want to say tonight young people amen we are well established in the fact amen that God has sent a prophet amen we are well established in the fact that he was a Vindicated Prophet amen now let's say let me just say this amen it's time to go into amen what a prophet is taught in the age we're living in we're not just coming up to the board and saying there's healing in the land there's miracles in the land there's Deliverance in the land there's Revival in the land amen but there is a generation that is sitting before me tonight who is Anointed with the same Pillar of Fire Amen to rise amen and to move into every Divine promise that God has made Amen in this generation I think it's time to move amen into the revelation of the message of the hour I know it's getting to where people are getting a little bit scared Amen to preach what a prophet said said amen but I don't believe I'm looking at scare cats amen I believe I'm looking at Eagles amen I believe I'm looking at young people amen that's not afraid of this message you're not afraid of what a prophet taught you're not ashamed of the pictures you're not ashamed of the quotes amen there is a reality in your soul amen that this is more than a religion this is more than a church camp this is more than just an experience once a year amen but this is a bride's Revival and there is a fire that is burning and the hearts of the Believers amen there is an enthusiasm with this message now I love what the prophet of God said he said people misunderstand enthusiasm they say well amen they they misunderstand it see he said they misunderstand the power of the Holy Spirit they call it amen a bunch of Holy Rollers they call it a bunch of people that ain't got their right mind he said see they misunderstand that you had to lose what you call your right mind and you have to have the mind of Christ in you you cannot have the mind of the world Amen and the mind of Christ at the same time amen one is carnal amen and the other one is spiritual see he that walks after the flesh is carnal but he that walks after the spirit is spiritual he said so I'll lose myself amen and find it Lord in thee yes sir so God is misunderstood now let me just say this to you he says it's not you that's misunderstood amen it's the Holy Spirit making you do amen that they misunderstand amen so they're not misunderstanding you amen but they're misunderstanding the Holy Spirit on the inside of you that's making you do amen what you're doing see they're not speaking against you they are speaking against him let me say Amen it is not a man amen that makes me say what a prophet said it is not a man that makes you a man what a prophet said it's not a man that makes you young ladies dress the way you dress it's it's not a man that makes you young boys amen conduct yourselves the way you conduct yourself amen but if the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead if it dwell in your mortal bodies it will Quicken you and you'll begin to think like the word you'll begin to dress like the word you'll begin to talk like the word and worship like the word see because you are a word born bride see it's not you doing these things amen but it's the Holy Spirit that's on the inside of you amen that's making you do these things now amen just to just to lay a foundation here when you read this word amen enthusiasm it is a strong excitement amen of feeling now I'm pulling this definition amen of enthusiasm from a from a public dictionary amen it is a strong excitement of feeling it is something inspiring it is a Zeal it is a fervor now listen at this young people it is a belief in special Revelations of the holy spirit amen in enthusiasm is a belief Amen in special Revelations of the Holy Spirit do you realize in John chapter 1 when Jesus amen begin to call his disciples amen he chose Phillip by name and the prophet said after philli got converted amen he was all enthused amen and any man when he finds Jesus and gets saved amen there is an enthusiasm amen any man that finds Jesus and gets saved amen there is an enthusiasm he said you've got to be born again and when you're born amen then there's an enthusiasm amen that rises with that birth and it sets the solar fire and it takes all the differences away and the isms and comes straight to Calvary and recognizes Christ amen with the Burning Love and Zeal amen for the lost and Fallen World another place he says when he comes amen he will come in the fullness of his power he will come exactly amen the way he came on the day of Pentecost listen church if he comes and I believe he's already here into this building tonight he will not come amen any other way but the way he came on the day of Pentecost and you know how he come on the day of Pentecost he came in power he came in reality he came in transforming power he came in anointing he came in Supreme anointing well I say to you tonight amen devil get out of our way amen we've not shook a preacher's hand we've not put our name on a church roll but we been on the back side of the desert we've stood on Holy Ground we've stood on sacred Sands and we' met the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and we've been born again well you wonder why I shout it's because I've been born again you wonder why I dance it's because I've been born again you wonder why I can't stay in my seat when a man of God preaches the message it's because I've been born again there's an enthusiasm in my soul that responds to the word when I hear it and enthusiasm will burst out of your heart it'll make you so happy and so full of joy amen do you'll stagger like you were full of strong drink amen the pro of God said because the Bible said amen be not drunk upon strong drink amen which biteth like an Adder amen and stingeth like a serpent but be ye drunk on the spirit be ye drunk on the spirit now when I read that part of the definition amen a belief in Revelations of the holy spirit amen I just had to know Amen brother Wayne how could that be in a public definition of the word enthusiasm a special belief of Revelation from the holy spirit so I went back and looked up the word enthusiasm and let me just read you a little bit of history on it it may come as a surprise to many people when they first Look up the word enthusiasm Amen to see that its original meaning has to do amen with passion for religion religion amen rather than passionate or eager interest in general it is a brief explanation amen of the word emology should clear this up enthusiasm entered the English language around the beginning of the 17th century it was borrowed from the Greek amen enthus meaning inspiration or possession by God Amen so when the Greeks released this word it had a connection to inspiration amen and by that inspiration the God Amen that was inspiring you would take possession of you so they connected enthusiasm Amen to more than just excitement amen but they connected it to reality amen that you have been claimed by the almighty God see for the first 200 or so years it was used in English enthusiasm was primarily employed Amen to refer to beliefs or passions that related to religion but by the beginning of the 18th century however the word begin to describe having strong feelings amen or interest in interest in secular matters now what's amazing to me amen is that in one century amen the world changed what the word enthusiasm meant amen now you all know that what happens in the natural amen also happens in the spiritual and a prophet comes on the scene in 1962 and says now the sincerity amen the church has lost its enthusiasm and it's lost its sincerity he said we don't have it it seems to be such a small interest it should be in a time of this Jubilee right now after we know and they're positive these things it should be that Street Port would be buzzing like a buzz all amen the jail ought to be full hanging out the windows preaching the gospel amen the street quarters corns ought to be full of men and women testifying to the power of God yet we believe it and we say Amen but we've lost the sincerity amen and the enthusiasm is to receive it now that's the truth see and we'll never come back until we come down to that spot of appreciation of God Amen for making a way for us now watch this making a way for us and then calling us in it and vindicating it to us by his spirit and by his word amen that's the assurance that we have listen God did not just make a way amen but he called us into this way and the way that we're in he has Vindicated that way now watch and we have the answer to the devil's question let me say it as plain as I know how the message of the hour it must be received with sincerity and it must be received with some enthusiasm the prophet of God said what a tragedy Amen to see our churches in this condition I'll just have to stop and say thank God Amen for sending the message of the hour amen that restored the element of sincerity back amen listen we didn't even know how to come into church amen some would come in talking some would come in chewing gum some would come in hollering back and forth amen but God sent a prophet with a message called Church order and he begin to lay out how to create an atmosphere he wasn't doing that out of legalism he was doing that because he wanted the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead Amen to come among the church and to change hearts and to save souls and to F and to seal with the Holy Ghost listen I'm not ashamed amen of what a prophet has established in this generation I don't care who don't like it I don't care who don't enjoy it amen our Prophet never put music out of the church he never put joy out of the church but I might as well preach I feel good he never put shouting and dancing out of the church amen and listen he never put the Holy Ghost out either because don't forget it wasn't the holy ghost out of order it was the church out of order but when a prophet begin to lay the order the Holy Ghost begin to find a way Amen to move and to help people I say we welcome the Holy Ghost into this meeting tonight we welcome him to be the preacher we welcome him to be the speaker how many say I welcome him I welcome him to be my savior I welcome him to be my healer we welcome the message of the hour we don't want it watered down we don't want it diluted amen we want it with sincerity and enthusiasm yes sir amen he he even went as far to show us how to take communion he said communion ain't some little something you do he said no it's a it's an ordinance of God Amen he cleaned up the altars right amen he took the soda crackers amen and the grape juice off and he said here's how you have Community listen young people amen if you want something to shout about amen I'll give you something to shout about God has sent you a message in an age of confusion when men don't know what to preach they don't know what to teach you've got 1,00 books and tapes you've got a pillar of fire you've got a Vindicated message I say oh church we better shake off this old layout of sin amen oh God ease and z and let's get back on fire with a message amen let's get back to having message meetings and quit worrying about somebody reading too many quotes and worrying about somebody reading the scripture and tying it to what a prophet said let's get some enthusiasm hey bring back the oldfashioned meetings where we just said what a prophet said and Liberty broke out in the church and people got saved and homes got put back together I say God bring back the enthusiasm or a passion for this message we ain't here to play with this message we're here to preach this message we ain't here to play with these quotes we're here to believe these quotes we have purged out the leav amen and have made room amen for the quickening power of the Holy Ghost Amen to come into the church now I'll just say this we are message Believers and we ain't ashamed of it and this is a message Camp are we going to preach what a prophet said come on somebody amen a Baptist Camp don't invite a Baptist preacher and tell him not to preach Baptist Doctrine I don't know why people have message camps and invite message preachers and tell them to preach something different than the message hey I'm not a Baptist I'm not a Pentecostal I'm not a Lutheran I'm not a I am a Holy Ghost Field fire baptized P of fire following son of the Living God I'll say what a prophet said until every Devil Falls at the feet of the Believers well let me just go ahead and say this it ain't just on the platform it's out in the pews I see some Holy Ghost fill fire baptized young people who believe this message with all their heart yes sir this ain't mixing it with a with a leaven bread this is unle bread and it's come as sincerity and Truth now you know the prophet said some people amen they make the gospel a funeral procession he said they go to church I give us a funeral procession and he said then others make it a Frolic see amen some of them just make it a Frolic just a big time to go and play a bunch of music and jump up and down on the platform Dance all over the platform or down in the aisle run down sit down and talk about their neighbors that's right amen some of them thinks they ought to stand and say the doxology in Apostles Creed I wanted somebody to show me where that's written in the Bible he said but here's the thing of it they're so busy making those things up that they make at a funeral procession when you add to this message amen you make it a funeral procession and when you add to this message you make it a Frolic I say but come back to what a prophet said the Gospel of Jesus Christ is it's not a funeral procession and neither is it a Frolic amen it is a feast with Christ where Believers come and die you know what I say I say come on over here amen come on over here where the table is spread and the Feast of the Lord is going on listen there's good food on this table there there's healing on this table there's miracles on this table there's salvation on this table there's reality on this table come on over in the third pull come on over in the opening of the word come on over in the message of the hour and feast till you get enough strength Amen to drive that devil back to hell where he come from yes sir this message is not a Frolic neither is it a funeral procession it is a feast I'll say to you tonight I believe there are some things amen that we as a church can afford to lose I believe we can afford to lose the cold the complacent and the critical Spirits I believe we can afford to lose the formal Spirits amen the fussing spirits and the fighting Spirits I believe we can afford to lose the doubtful Spirits amen the dull spirits and the dead spirits but there is one thing that we cannot afford to lose and that is our sincerity and our enthusiasm about what God has sent in this generation we can't afford to lose it because the prophet of God said it like this in both sermons he would preach Easter seal rising of the sun he would take his text Romans 8:11 he would say these words if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead amen if it dwell in you that he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken somebody shout Quicken shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit amen that dwelleth in you look at this word Quicken it means to be Gat or to Bear living young it is to restore to life it is to give the increase of life it is of the spirit quickening amen as respects the spirit it is endued with new and greater powers of life now I love this definition brother Josh amen was speaking about this last night in closing amen metaphorically of seeds amen that are quickened into life and they germinate and they spring up and they grow so quickening power don't just excite you and get you a start and it don't just take you halfway amen but it takes you from the germinating into the springing up into the growth listen all the way into maturity well I might as well say what a prophet said he said we did not become seed amen by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were able to be reborn because only the elect can be reborn listen friends because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to quick hey devil hear me and hear me well you've done everything you can to bury this young people you've done everything you can to bury this bride but the devil forgot you had a seed I said the devil forgot there was a seed on the inside of your soul and it don't matter what you lay that seed under if there's life in that seed when the sun begins to rise it's going to pull it listen can I say this to you amen some of you all begin under mud you begin under mck you under M you was like the Pond Lily you was buried underneath all these complexes and all these pressures and all these situations and and generational curses and all these things amen but in the evening time there shall be a duel sunrising it will not just be the Su n it will be the s o n and it will be rising to do one thing Amen to bring life to God's promised seed that by for knowledge he said would be laid upon the Earth so he come to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed that God seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in The Book of Life and here they are on the earth without a hope but he come not only to be the blessing but to share the blessing he didn't come just to be the blessing he come to share the blessing with every predestinated seed amen let's just goe with that devil how many can raise your hand and from the depths of your soul say I believe there is a predestinated genan seed of almighty God in the depths of my soul I believe there is a seat there I don't believe there's one coming I believe it's already there then can I say what the prophet said he said you belong to God before the foundation of the world and if you ever was a part of God if you ever belong to God you always will belong to God listen Young people somewhere sometime you got to whip that devil and quit riding an emotional roller coaster of one day I'm a son and the next day I'm a serpent seed if the Revelation ever strikes your soul that I am a seed Gene of God on my good days I'm a Child of God on my bad days I'm a Child of God when I'm on the mountain I'm a Child of God when I'm in the Valley I'm a Child of God it don't matter where you put a child of God there'll still be a child of God you can put him in oh high you can put him in Virginia you can put him in Louisiana but because they're connected to the vine and they've not disassociated their s with the quickening power there is a witness of who you are somebody go ahead and tell that devil I don't belong to you I belong to God now if that spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead if it dwell in you look at this word dwelleth it means to dwell in one and to influence him for the good to dwell in one and influence him for the good now do you realize why you got to put the leaven out you know why because leav has the ability to influence for the good or the bad so you can have le and brother it can influence good a while and then brother Austin it can influence bad a while but if you ever put the leaven out and replace it with quickening power the only thing you're being influenced is by something that's good can I say this what is the quickening power it is God Amen dwelling in the soul of The Believer by the power of the Holy Ghost amen quickening you to manifest every promise of the word for the age you're living in I want to tell the devil we are under the influence but it's not of wine it's not of liquor it's not of alcohol we are under the influence of quickening power and that quickening power has the ability Amen to change any situ ation that we're going through listen I'm just going to go ahead and say it amen devils are going to lose their whole tonight amen situations are going to lose tonight amen because we're not preaching this message with some psychology and some education and a better approach we are preaching pure message so if you are a seed the only thing you can receive is the quickening power and that quickening power will transform you into what God called you to be but said we know what it done for Jesus but I I want you to see amen not what it will do but what it has done the same for you what does it do it quickens the Mortal body see this Mortal body that we live in it quickens it in other words it brings it to life brother sister the quickening power brings this body to life now you once walked with a long great big cigar in your mouth and a bunch of cigarettes and you women once had short hair and painted and carried on and wore shorts things like that amen but something screamed and you look down here and it was the word see it quickened and you said now come on cuz we get so caught up and how we going to get the the earrings off and the makeup off and the high heel shoes off how we going to get heyen we start trying to get a little legalistic amen and trying to do with ourselves amen but I tell you what a prophet said he said quickening power will strike F seed and he said here's what it'll say no more shorts for me no more liquor for me no more lime for me no more steal and no more this that see the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in you will also bring your mortal bodies amen the dust of the earth into subjection you see what is it subjection to what amen Christ and who is Christ he is the word so quickening power is bringing your mortal body into subjection to the word against its own will oh God do you see right now amen right now it's not your soul that don't want you to go to church it's not your soul that don't want you to raise your hands it's not your soul that don't want to hear this message it's not your soul that says the preacher's too long and the sound system's too loud and the service was too long that's not your soul amen that's just oh sorry stinking rotten flesh but if the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead if it dwell in that Soul it will bring this body under subjection to the Holy Ghost let me say right now the devil don't wants you to get healed but he don't have a choice because greater is the quickening power in your soul than what the devil is Anointed your flesh with if God says you are healed you can stack every devil and hell up you will not defeat the healing power of Jesus Christ now there's a war goes on there's a war between your spirit and your flesh and your soul but a prophet of God said if the spirit raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you it will also Quicken your moral body it'll make you do things you didn't do before Oh My it'll make you do things you didn't do before see they was full of quickening power if that spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead it dwells in you it will Quicken or make a alive your mortal bodies because it's already life now listen what a prophet says and when it comes into your body it brings your whole body under subjection Amen to what to the word of God listen friends as the message of the hour has been revealed to us it has done more than just touch our feet to dance it has done more than just touch our lips to speak in tongues it has done more than just touched our hands to raise but this quickening power has taking control of our feet it's taken control of our hands it's taken control of our eyes it's taking control of our lips listen friends we are not church members we are walking Messiah who are reflecting his dominion and power in every Dimension that we live in it does not just affect one part it affects the whole body see what does it do to our mortal bodies I'm going somewhere it turns your opinion it changes our Notions it sets our affection on things which are above see the smoking the drinking the gambling all those things you used to do amen they are dead it's beneath you oh God so what this quickening power does it takes task Masters that used to be above you and it puts them underneath you see this quickening power come on this quickening power also brings your body into a raptured condition already glory to God so you're not waiting for the morning the Rapture to get Rapture Ready but if the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead if it dwell in you it'll bring your body subject to the message of the hour it'll take you beyond 45 it'll take you beyond 55 it'll take you beyond 61 it'll take you all the way to 63 where a prophet said rapturing faith is laying on those tapes and as you feed on that word it will bring your body in condition for Rapture see God by his Spirit dwelling in The Believer as a manifestation of the word is a scriptural promise in 2 Corinthians 6 as God has said I will dwell in them and I will walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people another place he says let the word of Christ amen let it dwell in you richly another place he says the good thing which was committed to thee amen keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us he says it's very beautiful he said Lord Jesus we're certainly a blessed people above our thinking above our understanding if there was an Noble one among us such as some Personnel from some country amen but today we have the god of Heaven not only among us but he is in us and he's dwelling living his life through us it's beyond our understanding listen it's a mystery to the devil how that God got into you it's a mystery to the devil how that God could take a sinner that was born in sin shap in iniquity come in the world speaking lies with all the marks against you but by quickening power and a seed in your soul he could reach down and pick you up and transform you yes sir what are you saying I'm saying the spirit of God is Not Just on us but the spirit of God is in us now there's one way of interpreting enthusiasm it is like this the spirit of God within job says that there is a spirit in man right and the inspiration of the almighty giveth him understanding look at this word Spirit it is the spirit of Heaven amen as impaling Pro profit to utter instruction or warning it is imparting a war like energy executive and administrative power so when a prophet comes he doesn't come to play games he doesn't come to have a picnic but he comes possessed by God with a warlike energy with an executive Authority with an administrative Authority upon his life and he begins to say things and what he says are not ideas they're not suggestions they're not opinions amen they are instructions amen they are warnings and they are separating you from the confusion of the age you're living in that's why Jesus said when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth now listen what the prophet says he says I want you to notice amen the symbols of Christ in the Bible and here on Earth he said now on Earth he was a prophet and he said a prophet is the word so the word Prophet means a Divine interpreter of the word so the Divine word is wrote and the prophet has the Divine spirit of God within him and you know the prophet in the Old Testament was called God he said now see because he was called God was because he packed within him the word of God which was thus saith the Lord therefore now listen to me therefore the word Prophet means his interpretation isn't to be mingled with a prophet's interpretation is not to be mingled with now let's just go ahead and preach since we're here amen somebody say well I don't think it matters if a boy wears shorts well that's your interpretation but a prophet brought interpretation upon on that and he said shun the evil things so what we start doing is we start mingling interpretations and before long we got the message believing this and meaning that amen but let's just say what a prophet said he said it means thus sayth the Lord yes sir and then you see the Divine interpretation of the word it has to coincide with this last Revelation to the church so you're not just a generation amen receiving a feeling or receiving a sensation you are a generation that God has claimed Amen to live in You by the word but also to walk in you I'm going somewhere the Bible says in third John 1 it says for I Rejoice greatly and when the Brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth now listen what he says I have no Greater Joy than to know that my children they walk in truth God Has No Greater Joy than to know you are not walking in mingled interpretation you're not walking in imaginary interpretation you're not walking in private interpretation but the joy over God's life is there is a teenager in the middle of Satan's Eden where Lucifer has become the god of this evil age but they have a seed on the inside of their soul and the only thing they can follow is the Vindicated word of the hour in the age they're living in listen I can't follow anything else but this message amen my seed won't let me my seed won't let me follow mingled interpretation my seed won't let me follow feelings and Sensations my seed will only allow me to follow thus sayith the Lord through the Vindicated message of the hour you want something to shout about that's something to shout about you want something to dance about that's something to dance about when boys don't even know if they're boys and girls don't even know if they're girls but God through his sovereignty put a seed in your soul that in an age of such confusion when men are becoming women and women are becoming men and kids are becoming cats that God gave you a s he gave you a vision he give you a message he gave you a pillar of fire he give you a clear Direction it's not a religion it's a special Revelation it's not a feeling it's the sayth the Lord Brother Ben it's not my idea it's his word talk about Joy I got joy I got joy cuz I know how to baptize I got joy cuz I know how to pray on you want something to shout about amen thank God that there's some men of God that know who they are in the word of God and when you come up for prayer tonight there ain't a bunch of sissies up here with a pair of gloves on Amen trying to deal with Spirits that's trying to destroy you but there's men of God who the spirit of God dwells in and when they lay their hands upon you they don't say Mr devil would you please come out Mr devil would you please move on when they lay their hands upon you they say Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ take your hands off of God's Property you know where that's coming from that's coming from an enthusiasm they've not gotten stale with the message of the hour I just tell you what a prophet said he said somehow or another I just feel we're going see there's something laying right ahead for us 1965 now just remember I believe I am prophesying that great Joys lay ahead woo brother brother Ray great Joys lay ahead so it didn't end in 65 but the prophet said great Joys are laying ahead he said great Joys are laying ahead believe it that's right many sadden Hearts he said will be see great Mysteries will be made clear and people who are sad will be turned into Joy oh God people who are sad will be turned in Joy when Mysteries become Revelations sadness is going to lose its effect when Mysteries become more than symbols sadness is going to lose its influence come on Copus you're walking on the road of the meus and you're saying it's sad our Lord has been crucified our Lord is in a tomb amen if he had have been here this would have happened but there they were sister Ella they were walking with the resurrection they were walking with the Lord but their eyes didn't come open amen their eyes didn't come open till they went in a little room and he took the bread brother Jesse luk he took the bread he broke it like he did before and he blessed it and when he broke the bread and blessed it their eyes come open and they knew he's not in a tomb he's right here in St Mary's OH high on a Saturday night in twt our God is Not Dead Brother Levi our God is alive he he's a well God he's a healing God he's a moving God Mysteries being revealed was prophesied to bring a great joy in the church and turn sadness into Joy oh somebody say well amen don't you preach on the Rapture brother we can't help but preach on the Rapture somebody said don't you preach on those Mysteries brother we can't help but preach on them because that's the only thing that brings us some Joy is God knowing that his children are walking in truth want me prove it to you amen go down here to a local church and get up and start preaching on the Rapture and every person there will stop shouting they'll stop rejoicing you know why because the Rapture to them is a heavy thing it's a scareful thing but you come to our meetings you come to some Eagle meetings you come on over here where it's not a funeral procession and it's not a frolic but it's a feast you come on over here where quickening power is dwelling in hearts and start saying there's a Rapture saying there's a body change saying there's a coming of the Lord and our meetings will go to another level because we are the Fulfillment of the prophet's prophecy when the Mysteries become revealed there will be great joy it'll be joy to shout in it'll be joy to dance in it'll be joy to preach in there will return an enthusiasm well I'm going to go ahead and say it you ain't taking my joy you can turn off the music but I still got joy you can turn off the keyboard but I still got joy you can turn off a microphone but I still got joy how do you have joy because I'm walking in truth and my Lord is supplying me joy now now the Bible says there will be a p room right would come among the church what he would do is he would eat away the joy off the tree now let me just say this there is a connection between eating and the fruit Palmer worb begins to eat the fruit of the joy off but the bride begins to eat and as she begins to eat Joy begins to return so the Palmer worm through mingled interpretations ate the tree down but the spirit of Truth through a prophet begins to place the word of restoration and begins to build the tree back up now he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now watch this to him that overcometh so not him that stay underneath but him that over will I give to eat of the Hidden Mana said the hidden Mana it's a little something special what is it the Special the blessings of the Holy Ghost oh no that's for the whole congregation but the hidden Mana was a special Revelation because he had to teach the other SE was a little more knowledge of the scripture that he could teach others so that hid Mana was a type of the shoe bread which was reserved for the priest the propag God said was a special thing made for the priest see the leaders and this man overcome now the whole congregation got the Mana but he got a hidden special Mana or a special [Applause] revelation of Jesus and what was about him and all about him see he got it through the angel so the angel got the Mana and he brings it to the church now listen and when the church stopped eating eting the Mana enthusiasm move from possession of a god into some passion for sports so that's why people have to get up and say well this ain't enthusiasm amen I heard our brother Nathan last night have to stand here and say listen this ain't enthus this ain't enthused amen this is revelation this is now listen he had to say that because the devil took the word that originally belonged to the Church of enthusiasm and perverted it to a passion for sports to a passion for Hollywood to a Zeal for education and so now amen it's look like enthusiasm just come in the message well let me just say this amen we did not go to the Pentecostal church and take the shout from them they took it from us we did not go Amen to the Pentecostal church and take the dance from them they took it from us see because we were seed in the beginning and because we were seed is why we could be Quicken well if we can take our dance back back and if we can take our shout back then I think we got a right tonight Church to take back the true meaning of what an infused Holy Ghost filled fire baptized son and daughter of God is it ain't a bunch of shackles and Creeds it's liberty in his presence it's reality in his presence yes sir what is it it's the word listen we're not feeding on enthusiasm no sir I'm not serving you enthusiasm tonight but what I am serving you will cause some enthusiasm because according to scripture Jesus will come in three sons names he will come as the son of man the Son of God and the son of David but in between the Son of God and the son of David according to Luke 17:30 he will reveal himself as the son of man now watch this brother said even th shall it be in the day when when the son of man is revealed he said see the son of man is now being revealed from heaven heaven will it come after a while brother brandom it is now the son of man has already come from glory and is revealed himself for the past few years to his church and mercy and he's showing them his great presence doing the same things that he did when he was here on Earth revealing himself like he did to Abraham before the destruction what is it he reveals himself in Mercy saving your soul giving you of his life giving you Joy in the stad of sadness giving you faith in the stad of fear here healing in the stead of sickness revealing himself to you in his Mercy listen the very same way that he did back there what is the revealing of the son of man it is the word coming back in human flesh again see what kind of revelation will it be it will be a revelation of his living after being crucified 1900 years but is raised from the dead if is raised from the dead and is alive with us can I give the devil one more black eye in that day when the son of man has been revealed a son a man Jesus Christ made manifest among his people I have just identified to you where our shout comes from I have just identified to you where our dance comes from we thank God for the music and we thank God for the good songs but where our shout comes from and where our dance comes from is when those Mysteries begin to to be made clear and our eyes begin to focus on what a prophet said and we begin to turn from sadness into Joy come on some of you right now are sitting here and you're sick in your body but if you'll not focus on me or focus on any other preacher but if you will focus on the revealing of the son of man while you're hearing the word he will take away your sickness and he will give you healing he will take away your depression and he will give you Joy he will take away your condemnation and he will give you just J ification the son of man is in the building tonight and he's not held down with denominational shackles he's here in Liberty he's hearing power he's heing reality it ain't a man it's the son of man we're feeding on the unfailing body word the unfailing body word the unfailing body word of the son of man now where does our strength come from our strength comes from feeding fully not partially but fully on the revealing of the son of man brother Josh quoted this last night he says we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication 1965 but as it is in every age people let man put their own interpretation to it by Theology and will not believe God's Divine Vindication of it that's God's interpretation now do you realize in Malachi in Genesis 3 that there was a Messianic prophecy and if you study the Bible all the way through the Bible there is a a a a line of Messianic prophecies they started in Genesis 3 and they culminate when the word become flesh so in other words when Jesus became flesh the word among us they were no longer prophecies but they were now fulfilled in other words you no longer have to wonder what they are brother said the Bible described him he said but by the time he arrived on the scene the people to whom he was sent had their own interpretation of what he was to be their own imaginary interpretation now do you see what stops many of us is imaginary interpretation we begin to imagine the way God will do something we begin to imagine the way God will Deliver Us in his Spirit we will begin to imagine how God will give us the Holy Ghost listen we are not following imaginations We are following Revelation imagination has no Authority it is open for any power to come by and influence it but but this Revelation is only influenced by one person and that is by the one who sent it and that is the son of man and he's returned to the church in the form of the spirit of God which is quickening power now listen the Bible never changed the Bible is always the same that's the reason I say the Bible is of no private interpretation all right they lived right in the word now listen now I'm just going to can I take my Liberty brother Nathan a man could not be a teacher a priest until he was born in a certain lineage after Levi just think his great great great great great great great great great grandfather that's a lot of greats was a priest and he was laying right in that word in the temple day and night like the Catholic preacher or the minister that had handed down Minister from generation to the certain churches and so forth and they said see my great great great great great great grandfather was meist Bishop so my grandfather was a bishop and so forth see all right they lived right in the word but they had formed their own way of it and their children had accepted it their children had accepted it in such a way that the fathers had taught it until the fathers had taught it off of the real way and there had been such an organization out of it till when the spirit tried to present truth When the Spirit come in the meeting when the spirit Spirit come in twt and begin to present truth they could not receive it come on Church their great great great great great great great great grandfathers taught how the Messiah would come by imaginary interpretation so when he come walking in the flesh and he looked at him and said I am he they said that's not the way Granddaddy taught it that's not the way so and so taught it that's not the way the rabbi taught it listen it didn't stop at the elders it went into the Next Generation brother B said it's the same thing today he said they make it so complicated some of the way to teach it he said listen God don't have grandchildren God only has sons and Sons only follow the leadership of the holy spirit let me say this church I pray to God that they never comes that a man of God stand behind the pit and preach to you young people the infallible word of God sent by a prophet and somebody say well that's not the way brother so Ando taught it and that's not the way this guy amen forget all that church you are a new generation you are a new generation I said it before I'll say it again we are not following imaginary interpretation we are not following private interpretation you know what I say I say is there a young person here that can stand up and say give me the word and the word alone give me the message and the message alone tell me what a prophet taught teach it the way he taught it and let it change my life if it worked before if it worked before it still works today so what are you saying I'm saying the message still has enthusiasm it's a special Revelation to the Overcomer listen somebody's going to overcome well we might as well preach somebody's going to overcome somebody's going to overcome Le osia somebody's going to overcome Hollywood somebody's going to overcome fashion somebody's going to overcome pornography somebody's going to overcome homosexuality we might as well preach amen them Devils ain't exempt from our young people they try to attack our young people but I want to stand here today as a message preacher and say what a prophet said amen Satan take your hands off I renounce you in the name of Jesus Christ you have no Authority you will go home and be a real man somewhere sometime the spirit has got to die somewhere sometime the devil's got to die somewhere sometime the curse has got to be broken somewhere somebody has got to raise up and say today it stops with me I will no longer carry imaginary interpretation of this message now I know what the devil says the devil says well this bride's Revival is just for the adults well let's say what a prophet said he said it's the open of the word now listen what the prophet says he says now the word ashamed could be also translated embarrassed can I say something to you when we lose I was I was just sitting the other day studying one night and praying and the spirit of the Lord just spoke these words to my heart so if it's okay I'll share them with you I wrote him down if we lose our enthusiasm of the belief of special Revelations we will become embarrassed of them and will no longer talk about them we will become embarrassed and say well you know that was just brother br's opinion and we really can't back that up with Bible I defy that devil I stand here on this platform tonight and I take a two sword of that devil it says William Bram taught something it cannot be backed up with this Bible anything a prophet taught can be backed up with one scripture Malachi 45 and 6 behold I send you Elijah the prophet I say away with that devil I say away with that coward his spirit that wants to become ashamed of what a prophet said you're a new generation come on we ain't going to the border of it and back up and say well somebody else put your walking shoes on let's go across the border let's go over in the message let's go into present day truth let's go to where there's reality let's go to where there's unending Joy come on Church it ain't from camp meeting to camp meeting this message once it ever strick your soul is an eternal enthusiasm of a passion and a Zeal listen it'll burn in school it'll burn on the job it'll burn at work wherever you go the Zeal of this word will burn can I say it I'm not ashamed have I got any Witnesses here I'm not ashamed of the special Revelation what are you saying brother B said like this he said see they become ashamed they become embarrassed and so when you become embarrassed you back up and you don't want to talk about certain subjects because you're not quite sure what you're saying so the devil starts backing you up and backing you up and backing you up and now you can't talk about this area of your life because somebody put a question mark with a quote over that quote now you can't quot you just start backing up before long it becomes another generation Bound in Tradition but you know what I say I say we ain't sissies we're Messi hates we know know where we're standing we know what we're believing we're not afraid to walk up toe to- Toe with the devil and say yes sir you're right I've made mistakes yes sir you're right I don't know all the cloaks and scriptures but I know the god of the cloaks and I know the god of the scriptures and he's in my soul and if the same spirit that raised him from the dead if it dwell in me it'll do the same thing for me that it did for him listen when he walked up to Matthew 4 when he walked wed up to the devil he didn't stand there and say Mr devil I wish You' just let me go no he walked up there and you're not the devil but you're going to be right now he walked up there and said it is written did he feel like it I doubt it because he just come off of a fe of a fast and he was 40 days but it didn't belong to his feelings it was a revelation it is written it is written you know what I say tonight I say as we start turning towards war with that devil it's time to take your position as a believer this word and walk up Toe to Toe that devil and say it is written Satan it is written it is written I am healed it is written I am saved it is written I may not feel like it but that don't change the fact it is written it is written I'm Justified it is written I'm Sanctified it is written I'm glorified what are you saying I'm saying take your stand on thus saith the Lord now can I share something with you here you didn't come out of the lineage of Ahab do you realize that you're not Ahab Ahab is not in your genealogy you didn't come from Ahab you came out of the same line that Elijah come out of now in the book of 2 Kings 17:1 the Bible says Elisha the tishbite who was the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I sit and wonder who I am and that know what it says let me read that again before whom I imagine that I am a Son of God and before whom I stand there shall not be duom nor rain these years but according to my word Elijah stands there as a human man but he stands there not upon imaginary interpretation but he stands there upon a revelation and says they'll not be due and they'll not be rain until I call for it listen what the prophet of God says just paraphrasing he says then God would send Elijah to cherith then that drought comes in then God would send him from cherith when that when that Brook dried up he went to zerath there he found a widow and the Widow fed him and then he raised her son but then you come to First Kings 18 now listen he's been in this drought he's been moved from cherith he's been moved in the zerath but now he comes to First Kings 18 and he goes up on Mount Caramel and there comes a showdown between God and Baal now watch this and they say these words he says prepare the altars Make Ready the altars for today we're going to have a showdown he said now here's what we're going to do we're going to build the altars identical wood on yours wood on mine Bullock Fair Bullock fair but there's one thing we're going to leave off what are we going to leave off church he said don't you put no fire on it because the God who answers by fire let him be God do you realize in first King 2 Kings 18 the Bible says this that Elijah went up there and he actually be to mock them and he begin to say maybe your God's asleep maybe he's on a holiday maybe he's per adventure and you can't wake him and they begin to cut themselves and begin to call on their gods they were trying to make something happen but Elijah stood there in his position as a Son of God with a secret special Revelation in his heart and here was the special Revelation the fire don't come till the evening time hello somebody the fire don't come till the evening time so the whole time they're trying to get something going trying to get their God answer Elijah just stands there full of enthusiasm because he knows that his God is going to show up in the evening time and confirm the sacrifice and about that time brother south of fire come down and the fire struck the Altar and the fire consumed the sacrifice and there the battle was settled who is God but then we go to 2 Kings 18:41 and the Bible says Elijah goes to Ahab and says get the up eat and drink for there is a there is a sound of an abundance of rain so Ahab went up to eat and drink and Elijah went up there to the Mount top of caramel and he cast himself down upon the Earth and put his face between his knees and said to his servant go up now and looked toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times go again seven times seven times seven times right oh seven Church ages right seven times seven Messengers seven times but it came to pass at the seventh time that his servant said behold there ariseth a little Cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he he said go up and S Ahab prepare thy Chariot and get thee down that the rain stomp thee not and it came to pass in a little while that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and Ahab rode and went to Jezreel and the Hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he GED up his loins and he ran before Ahab to the entrance of jezrael Amen can I can I read Joel 223 be ye glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain modly and will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month do you see why the prophet prophesied I see great Joys ahead I see great revivals ahead I don't see this word dying I see this word moving forward because the pro God had that vision and he says there will be a teaching rain but then there will be a harvest rain can I say this to you tonight the Harvest rain amen is rapturing Faith and the pro of God said this he reads that and Elijah said an Ahab get the up and drink for there is a sound of an abundance of rain amen can I just say this to you it's not strange to me that he uses the word sound you know what the word sound means voice there is a sound amen which is a voice and he said go again seven times and behold it the seventh time time he said behold there ariseth a little Cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up the pr prepare thy chair now let me say this to you there arose amen a clout maybe I'm in your way there arose there arose a cloud before the cloud there was a sound and the sound was a voice and the Bible says in the days of the voice of the sth Angel when he shall begin to sound Bram comes along and says this he said see that Mystic something way up there in the Spheres they could not figure it out there was no evaporation or anything it was 30 Mi High 27 miles across coming right up from where those angels were now they asked to know amen science the one of them in Tucson wanted to know any significance but I didn't tell them I didn't tell them you know why he didn't tell them because it was only for the predestinated come on somebody if he would have told science they would have continued trying to figure it out tear it apart add to take away but he told some believers who had a jean seed in their soul that was going to follow that crowd they were going to follow that voice they were going to listen to that sound and as they follow that that cloud and they listen to that sound there's going to be Joy come in the church there's going to be Revival com in the church well I feel like closing on this point right here I don't see the cloud the size of a man's hand but I see the cloud the size of the son of man's face I see a clown it ain't the face of brother random it ain't the face of any other preacher it's the face of Jesus Christ and in him is quickening power in him is reality in him is healing brother can I say what a prophet said I believe right here tonight great sadnesses are going to be turned into great Joys I believe right here tonight sicknesses are going to be turned into healings I believe right here tonight prodical are going to become transformed it's only it's only to the predestinated what was it doing it was raining down quickening power amen amen I just want to close on this point right here the quickening power has come to us to open the Seven Seals was it the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of God see the quickening power of God foretold this would take place the quickening power of God made the world testify to it the angel Lord told you was around in a pillar of fire Quicken power let the word testify it's the truth and then in that they didn't know what it was but we knew we knew just look this away and it's our Lord It's Our Lord up there quickening power let us see his coming quickening power snatched us from death to life quickening power gives discernment to know what's wrong with you what to do what you have done what you ought not done what you should have done what you will be quickening power all these things so you ask yourself for you ask ask me who said like this brother Andrew what is so significant about seeing this Cloud well first of all some people seen it and it enthused them others seen it and it embarrassed them but when I see you tonight when I see you tonight it don't embarrass me because because I know without this Cloud we might as well go play volleyball for the next two hours without this Cloud we might as well go just out there and drink coffee and just talk about the world but if this cloud is here devils are fixing to die if this cloud is here sicknesses are going to leave bodies if this cloud is here I hear the sound of an abundance of rain I hear quickening power I hear chains falling I hear demons running I hear SP spirit's breaking I hear sins falling off of the lives of God's children if the cloud is here we're not just a church member we are an invincible Army if the cloud is here greater is he that is in you you know what Satan wants to do Satan wants unbelief to catch you when you see that cloud brother said that's what he tried to do to Elijah now if unbelief now I just going to give you something here if unbelief would have C that right quick it would have said this if that's the best you can do see if that's all you can do we'll take it back could you imagine Brother Ray a spirit of unbelief getting a hold of Elijah and looking at that sign and saying if that's the best you can do well just take it back he said but what was it he was looking for the supernatural God have mercy he was looking for a cloud he was looking for the supernatural but the supernatural just happened to show up in a cloud glory to God I tell you what amen when they can you give me that third picture amen when they took a picture in Houston Coliseum they were looking for some pictures of fighting they were looking for some pictures of brother best or Dr best and brother Bosworth they weren't looking for that Pillar of Fire hey but that Pillar of Fire was looking for you so he had his picture he had his picture taken with the voice of the reality that would reveal the special Revelation can I say something to you can I say something to you do you realize the prophet of God said he said when they went to develop them pictures he said they tried six times he said the first picture didn't develop the third picture didn't develop the fifth picture didn't develop he said the sixth picture didn't develop he said but when the seventh picture developed he said they saw the filler of fire and they said that's a supernatural being can I say this he didn't see the cloud on the first time he didn't see the cloud on the third time but on the seventh time he saw the cloud and it was the announcing of an abundance of rain well young people I don't see what the world wants to see but I see what God wants me to see I don't just see brother brandom I see the pillar of fire but can I say this to you that Pillar of Fire is not just in that picture and it's not just in a filing cabinet in Washington DC but that pill of Fire is right here in this building tonight and you know what it's doing by the preaching of the message the pit of fire Brother Ray it's whipping through this building and while it's whipping through this building it's whipping Devils it's whipping Devils it's whipping the devil of depression the devil of anxiety the devil of fear the devil of cancer yes sir when you see it something jumps to grab it now listen brother I going to say this or I'm going bust brother I believe that right now in this minute that the power of the Holy Ghost that's in this room to cheer every sick person there is that you can feel the cloud the size of a man's hand scream and holler I hear the s of perfect [Music] healing Brother Ray I hear the sound I hear the sound of total Deliverance brother Gideon I hear the sound I hear the sound of total healing I hear the sound brother Landon I hear the sound I hear the sound of devils falling at the feet of you young people I see the cloud but I feel the influence of quickening power as it's moving across this building I hear the sound God had to if you reject and say well I didn't get nothing then they'll die out the hot waves of hell and doubt will fade it out of your soul but when you get that little grain of seed brother Gideon just stand on it it's not like the rock of jalter but but it's like the Rock of Ages now now now can you take a prophet's words I know you can stand there and you'll feel the sound feel the sound feel the sound of an abundance of rain really feel brother Noah feel the sound see right now the devil's trying to get you to say it's just a feeling but I'm getting ready to give that devil a black eye and identify what you're feeling you all have heard this story over and over how down there in Florida they built an Air Force Base right next us to a neighborhood you've heard that story right amen and there was a group of people got together and they went over there and they said listen they said we're tired of this noise we don't like all this amen I got to read a little bit on that one day and I found out really what was Bing them the most was not so much just the sound but they were getting tired of feeling the feel of the sound because when those planes would take off things would start shaking around the ground would start shaking listen I've been there a few amen things would start shaking around a few months ago brother brother Ron Peterson took me out there Amen to the Air Force Base there in Phoenix and we stood there and when those when those planes took off amen you're standing under them amen The Rock you're sitting on you feel it shaking amen everything around you shaking you can feel the sound of what's happening so they were not mad just because of the noise Oh Glory they were not mad just because of the noise they were mad because of the feel of the sound of the noise so you know what they said they went out there and wrote a banner you all know the story and the banner said this it said pardon the noise it's the sound of Freedom well you know what I found out I found out the devil he really don't mind the noise he don't mind the shouting he don't mind the rejoicing but what he hates is when those quotes become Revelation and he begins to feel the sound he begins to feel the sound of quickening power and it begins to Quicken your feet it begins to Quicken your hands it begins to Quicken your mind I stand here tonight and I say there's quickening power and it's in this building tonight it's come to shake hell it's come to shake depression it's come to shake confusion it's come to shake anxiety it's come to rebuke fear I feel the sound of an abundance of Revelation and who the son has made free is free indeed oh hallelujah what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying even death don't stop that quickening power right here tonight in this building is Witnesses of God's quickening power right here tonight is Witnesses they heard more than a quote they felt More Than A Feeling but they had some enthusiasm there was some enthusiasm which was more than just an excitement it was a revelation amen I think about our brother Andy Thompson here amen are you in the building tonight Brother Andy amen can I see your hand is he here tonight amen amen he's outside well that don't matter he's still this healed and delivered of organ cancer listen I'm not talking about the Bible days I'm not talking about 1965 I'm talking about right here in this generation there is a cloud the size of a man's face and it's got healing in it it's got the sound of perfect healing amen amen amen brother John guny amen delivered of cancer right here in this church amen can I say this one Amen brother brother uh brother Ronnie and I was he was sharing some of these with me amen right here in this in this assembly amen sister Cara crook amen delivered of anxiety amen I think she's in the building amen can she raise right there amen delivered listen she didn't just get a feeling she didn't just get a sensation but a sound of perfect healing shook anxiety right off of her life Amen brother way told me just this week on Tuesday his daughter sister Bethany amen received the deliverance from a spirit of anxiety amen can I say this it wasn't a feeling that shook Bethany it was the sound of an abundance of Revelation it was more than a man it was more than a service it was quickening power hallelujah hallelujah amen Amen brother Ronnie Shar with me his wife sister Feliz amen fear gripped her amen where are you sister Feliz amen fear gripped her amen but she's not fearful today because she felt the sound of an abundance of Revelation listen friends he did it for them I'm talking about Elders in the back but I'm going to say this I feel it right now moving through this young people I feel it moving through the audience right now devil get out of the way you can't stop it it's an abundance it's an abundance of Revelation listen tonight as as we enter this prayer line you're not coming through this prayer line with feelings or Sensations yes sir I pray the Lord they leave that up there you're not coming on this on this prayer line under imaginary interpretation under what some man thinks about this message you're not walking in this prayer line underneath a Frolic or a funeral procession approach you're walking through this prayer line under the headship of the revealing of the son of man can I say this he's here he's here how can you say that because a prophet of God said my Ministry is to declare him that he is am here he's here yes he's here don't question the rain don't question the symbol don't question the cloud accept it brother BR says it like this if you had an artisian well blowing up water on the side of the hill and your crop is burning you could holler all day long oh water come over here spring up water my crop so I have food you could holler till you couldn't holler no more it wouldn't act but if you'll work according to the laws of gravitation you can bring that water right around to your crop the law of electricity is right now here in this building right now if we walked in here and it was dark and there was no lights in here at all it was complete pitch black dark and you walked in and said oh light up the room light up the room oh great electricity I know you're here I know you're here light up the room brother BR said it never would work he said but if you'll go over there and flip the switch the law of electricity will come a manifestation and God doesn't heal the people just by going to church or making a confession he heals you upon your faith in his finished work it's your faith to accept what he has already done what are you saying brother anderw I'm saying tonight you see the cloud do you see the cloud can you bring it out of a picture can you bring it out of that picture and can you say Lord by the supernatural I see the cloud I see it tonight I see it hanging over my situation I see it hanging over this problem I see it hanging over this issue come on now I see the cloud it's not the size of a man's hand but it's the face of the son of man brother B says this healing comes from God now let me give this to you young people as you prepare to come through this prayer line tonight we just stand to our feet healing comes from God he's already done it can you accept that tonight he's already done it but if God could do something to make you understand that he's still here he's here to keep his promise now how many tonight will say Lord I'm done accepting the lies of the devil and we talked about imaginary interpretation and the devil will have you imagining ways to get out of things have you imagining ways that you can get above this sin and get above this besetting sin get above this habit you just can't break it so so here's what you're going to have to do you have to get this approach and his brother brother Nathan I believe was saying last night don't let's try this 10-step program or let's try this psychology approach that's imaginary interpretation but that cloud is not psychology and neither is that cloud a 10-step program that cloud is the Lord Jesus Christ and the Propet of God said the first thing you must do is surrender yourself entirely to Christ surrender your mind to his word and say Lord I want Act upon my feelings upon my own thoughts I will only act upon your word I'll have no control of my own thoughts concerning it I will act upon your word another place if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one Accord with not one Shad of Doubt anywhere there would not be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes listen how many tonight would raise your hand honest and say you're desire iring the baptism the Holy Ghost you never had it you're Desiring the baptism Holy Ghost you're Desiring it tonight prophet of God said this there would not be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed can I say this to you tonight the pillar of fire has fixed that certain thing it's not a man it's the

[Music] in the year 1965 just before he passed off the scene brother Brandon began to major on that quickening power that brother Andrew was preaching about tonight many great messages that he preached on the subject one place I believe it was God's provided place of worship maybe shreport he even said that in the prayer lines he had moved away from using his own gift of discernment and move toward laying on of hands and see what I see there amen is a son of man of ministry that didn't pass off the earth when our Prophet passed off the Earth but the quickening power moved from a prophet's personal gift into a body and he would challenge the people to believe he would go from the beginning he said say you do believe the quickening power led the children of Israel through the Wilderness in the form of a pillar of fire you believe that the quickening power raised up Jesus Christ from the dead you believe that quickening power was in those Apostles in the upper room he said it was in their hands it was in their feet it was in their eyes it was in their mouths he said now do you believe that quickening power is in your hands am now this group of ministers that stood shoulder-to-shoulder tonight are not superhuman people just mortal men but a super God has commissioned us to lay hands upon the sick and they shall be healed and that is why we hold prayer lines and we will continue to hold prayer lines and we will continue to see that Mighty hand of God manifested Among Us because quickening power is in the Bride of Jesus Christ now let's move one step down now from the ministers do you believe that quickening power is in your hands after what you experienced tonight do you believe in that quickening power then let's do as the prophet said let's lay our hands upon one another tonight brother to brother sister to [Music] sister and let's go to him in prayer Lord Jesus we thank you for a message of quickening power this is far more than a religious tradition this is far greater than a than a private interpretation of a man-made [Music] Creed this is the literal life of Jesus Christ the same power that raised up Jesus from the dead has fallen into this building tonight and Quicken mortal bodies now as we lay our hands on one another I pray that that quickening power would run all through this building all through the body of Jesus Christ it's not superstitions of feelings and vibrations or electrical currents it's the Resurrection Life of Jesus Christ you promised it would be in your true church oh we believe it Lord for we have experienced it tonight and we thank you for it let that quickening power go to every need now and manifest the promises of God that we would leave this place in total victory tonight thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy and your goodness for the blessings which have rained down amongst us tonight we love you we praise you how could we not oh God you're so good there's no one like you
