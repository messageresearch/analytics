we give you all the glory and all the honor in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen and God bless you today if you have your Bibles I'd like to look into the book of Ephesians the first chapter hallelujah amen we want to welcome all these men of God that are here today and it's a great honor to have brother Matthew McGary with us God bless you brother Matthew and amen I know it was a sacrifice just for him to turn down the engagements at speak coming from and then just come here and fellowship with us today we appreciate him to do that amen and uh we we certainly appreciate I seen Brother Kyle over there God bless you Brother Kyle and amen uh I think brother Richard's here this morning a lot of visiting ministers and we want to thank you and welcome you amen amen and if we could Ephesians chapter 1 verse 9 and verse 10 amen uh verse n and verse 10 now having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times that he might gather together in all one one in all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated this morning amen I'd like to take again this portion of scripture here for the book of Ephesians and um I want to I want to speak about the mystery of his coming revealing the mystery of his will and I'm going to use this for a subtext so that you can kind of see where my uh where my thought lines are laying amen uh amen and uh we certainly appreciate uh having Brian and Gracie with us today and amen it's always a blessing amen and uh I know the Lord's been working in his life and Ministry so maybe it won't be long we'll be hearing from him sometime I mean I know uh I know God's moving on his heart in a great way so y'all be praying for him amen amen uh I want to just speak just a few minutes today uh here in the scripture and just uh something something that's just been uh speaking to me personally from this I want to read here um a little bit of from the Amplified Bible I love how this reads it said making known to us the mystery secret of his will of his plan of his purpose do you believe God has a plan he has a purpose he has a will amen and and here it is in accordance see with his good pleasure his merciful intention so God has an intention he has a plan he has a purpose amen and he has previously purposed and set forth in him so this is a previous plan it's a previous intention and it's just been hid until this time so what you're what you're coming into is not something new it's something that's been there the whole time it's just not been made known now he planned uh in the 10th verse for the maturity of times now this speaking the dispensation the fullness of time the maturing of times in other words God planned for scriptures to be manifest he planned for the specific times uh that these things would happen and the climax of the ages to unify all things and head them up in the consummation of Christ you you see like even the the climax of The the Resurrection the fullness of time brother B actually places this as the resurrection but yet we know there's some things that are connected to the resurrection right we're not we're not just going to look around one day and everybody's bodies are changed as such as denomination would have us believe that the world's just going to go right on then there's going to come a change and it's all going to happen but God has previously planned how he would bring this consummation or how this climax would come and then we of course then understand the mystery of his will is then tied to the mystery of his coming and so when you go back in this I love the word Myster on here it's a powerful one it literally means amen something into which one must be initiated it means in something in other words there's there's a plan there's a purpose there's a mystery but it means you must be initiated into that mystery so it isn't something maybe the whole world will even know about but the ones that have been brought into it then they will actually know about it can I say it like if you was in Military and they said we're going to deploy at a certain time the whole world doesn't know that but it's more on a need to no basis and since you're the bride of Christ and you're a part of this plan and purpose there is a need for you to know the will of God and the time of this Resurrection because you're actually a part of it amen now watch to be initiated it means to be fully known this a mural it means to initiate or to instruct anything which is concealed or hidden we commonly use the word to denote that which is above our comprehension like a mystery it's above comprehension or it's unintelligible but there is there there but this is never the meaning of this word in the New Testament it means that there's some Doctrine or fact which has been concealed or which has not been before fully revealed or which has been set forth only by figures and symbols which is the case these things brother man said had been revealed in every type in the Bible but not known until it's revealed that's why when the seals open the Bible become a new book it was in every type but not known right now in which it has been set forth by figures and symbols with the doctrine made known then it becomes as clear and as plain as any other so in other words when when someone builds their Ministry on the Mysteries well you know automatically something's wrong with their Ministry because there's no mystery left to the church amen the mystery has been revealed to the church at this given time uh hillbilly are to be able to preach the greatest depths in the in the Bible because they've been plainly revealed to the church amen so that takes away the oneman Ministries right and it takes away the personality Ministries where you must follow me or you're out in the darkness or amen what a lie from the devil this message has been made clear to all the people of God so that this is not just a pull pit Ministry it is a bride body Ministry of Jesus Christ and you each one have been inducted or initiated into the things of God and and and we got I I don't want to just brag on them but we got young people that can confound theologians because they have the answer they might not be able to say John 2 equals John 6 and this goes here and this goes here but they have the answer to it already they they just simply got the answer which is what everybody's looking for but see we got the cheat sheet amen we got the code we got the original intention of the word and here we are taking the test with an open book that's right you bypassed your theophany to come here to be tempted and tested and the Bible tells us amen that there would come a bride who will not fail amen and brother Bram says the bride cannot fail well how do you not fail the test it's because the book has been opened and you've received the answers from the one who gives the test amen it's almost seems like like it's a locked in thing right amen that God has locked you into his purpose and plan and now he's revealing this amen so it's clearly known it's something that has been open brother baham says it here in the adoption he said see there's tied something together for me he said the mystery of his coming and the Mystery of his will and the Mystery of us sitting together now there's three mysteries there and you're using the word mystery and I'm using that because brother bam is saying this has been unknown so we're going to call it a mystery but today it is a revelation in the church see so we could just change it to the revelation of his coming the revelation of his will and the revelation of our position in it see now the mystery of his coming or the revelation of his coming simply I just spoke on it the other day so I won't go deep in it but just to remind you here that the mystery of his coming we're speaking about the coming of Elohim right that's what we're talking about when we let's go to Abraham's one of the greatest View views of it that we could see Abraham was promised Isaac to come through Sarah and it would take a supernatural birth a change of the body before they could receive Isaac so he was the coming son but before Isaac could come Elohim had to visit the tent so that they would be in a place to have Isaac and brother R says we were expecting to receive Jesus Christ in a glorified body but the bride meets him in the air he said so we must have a life a a body change to go meet him as Abraham and Sarah then their body change came through an Elohim Ministry that stood at the tent door and revealed the secrets of the hearts is that right so has the church in this hour receive the ministry of the son of man which was none other than Elohim himself coming from Jesus's own words as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so we call son of man milk kind Elohim whatever we want to speak of now that don't never get that mixed up and say well that was brother Bram brother Bram said I can't be him he said but he is here right and my Ministry is to declare him he said now now now you know the prophet is saying over and over and over who is that that knows the secret of your heart and who is that that knew where you come from and who is that he said I don't know you amen but come and know the one that knows you isn't that scripture that the Bible said You shall be known and you shall know even as you're known that there would come a Ministry like that amen just before the changing of the body that would come the coming of Elohim now now the Revelation brother Ram delivered us is that he is an unchanging God with an unchanging nature amen and an unchanging attitude but he does have a changing of mask and he moves from the son of man in fatherhood the son of man in Jesus as the son but in the last days the Holy Ghost would manifest that same ministry again right so we find out it's a changing of mass not a changing of God so here we're looking in this age of a bride coming of Christ amen the son of man coming amen now brother Bram says very clearly he packs three names he PRS the son of man the Son of God and the son of David the same God just under a different Administration right and in the fullness of times if you read Ephesians chap 1 and: 10 you'll see that the actual word means the administration and here we are under a son of man Administration now simple put the little woman the sodan that came to Jesus and she wanted the healing of her daughter remember what she did she said thou son of David have mercy on me brother Ram said he wouldn't even look at her amen because she was a gentile he was him he was God In the Flesh but wouldn't ADM wouldn't speak to her at all all amen because she was coming in the wrong office but when she changed from saying son of David amen and she said Lord then she found her power because she came in the right Administration man I don't know how to maybe say it to you I'll say it to you like this if you're still trying to approach God as a Pentecostal you're not going to get anything from God Amen he has changed from the Son of God to the son of man and it's now under a prophetic office you can't ignore this message and get what you want from God it is his administration in this hour it's the way to come to the mercy of God in this dispensation of Grace that we're living in the fullness of times has come the scriptures have been fulfilled look we're not have the resurrection yet but there's no scripture at would bar the resurrection from happening this morning in the Church of the Living God the scripture have been fulfilled we are at the maturing of times we are at the climax of all things amen when the Bible said he would swear amen that there would be time no more the prophet said no more delay upon the visions of God it is the administration right amen amen now amen you you if you want to if you want to see it from a different view maybe political view you can watch how the presidencies change amen and you can get the same power but you have a different Administration amen you you've seen it in the driver's license office and amen and in a little one Horse Town there's one person walking in working in there and they're they're working in one office and maybe it's the revenue or the tax office and they said well you can't get that done here you got to go to the title office and you go over the title office and the same person rolls their chair over to the desk amen you just can't do it at the same place it has to be done at another place it's the same God sir but he has a different Administration in this hour we are under a word Prophet a king God has returned as the king of the church amen right he is the headship of the church not the prophet the pillar of fire now watch because what is happening is that you're seeing the mystery of that coming if you can see that's him now you're opening yourself to something Matthew or Daniel chapter 12 the Bible said go thy Way Daniel and seal the words and close them until the time of the end in the 10th verse Daniel said many shall be purified and made wide and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand amen but the wise shall understand isn't that powerful amen here's prophecy over your life the wise will will know the mystery of the will of God now if you uh I'm getting ahead of myself in the book of Ephesians but I'd like to just read it Ephesians chapter 5:14 wherefore he saith await thou that sleepest and arise from the dead for Christ shall give thee light amen see then now give thee light now I don't have time to preach on that but y'all understand light scriptural light is word manifest God will manifest the word for you amen he will give the light then when you see that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise he said Redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is isn't that amazing understanding the will of the Lord listen you'll never understand the will of God without the word of God Amen the only way to know the will of God is the word of God now now you you can go into the brother Ram's Ministry and you can see he said there were first two pools and there was a a gift of Divine Healing and prophecy he said but they were both permissive will of God he said but the third pull brought the perfect will of God now what's he talking about because he's not just Discerning the person but under the third pull it is the Discerning of the heart of God concerning the scriptures so we're now getting the perfect meaning of the word from the original word that was written now let just go into it like this brother R said unless we know the word of God we don't know what to do we can't have faith until we know what it is the will of God then see then if we know it is the will of God the word of God says something then we can gladly follow it but we got to know what the will of God is now how would we know the will of God something beautiful I seen years ago when I was uh there in in in Jerusalem I went to the temple Institute and there is actually kind of like a new Sanhedrin Council basically and they're a temple Institute group of people that are building the're they're building the new Temple they ain't got started yet but they're going to build it I I mean it's neat how they're doing but they said we can't get on the actual uh Temple Mound any if any of you ever been there a rabbi Rickman I think his name is he's a great Theologian there and he took us up on the Temple Mount itself but they got rules you can't pray up there amen up on the Temple Mount because there's the the the mosque of alar is there you know it's one of the second I think holy sites of the Muslims and and if it's it's a big study but there's three seeds right there's ishma Isaac and then there's uh the the super seed which is the Christian so there's three seeds after the same land and but but Ishmael right now holds that land as a stronghold but actually Israel legally holds it but political pressure keeps them out of it but Rabbi Rickman can still go up there but he can't pray up there so Chris was up there with us it was the neatest thing cuz we get to walk and this Rabbi starts talking to us he knows we're all Christians and most of us was preachers on this trip and he starts walking and he starts walking around this Temple Mount he said y'all just go walk with me and we just start walking a complete circumference around that Temple Mount And he says you know they won't let us pray but you all from the Book of Joshua know what I'm doing and he was just he was just walking that Temple Mount he said he knew his footsteps were possession on that mountain he was bringing prophecy to it you know and and and when we got to got to talking to him later he went in and he started showing us I I I pronounced the word odd I know I think it's called a manura manura amen it's the it's the seven lampstands that goes into the temple and they got that thing made out of gold he said they're going to come a time we're going to build the temple he said but we want the Articles ready for the temple before the Temple's built so like if they ever get the temple built they got stuff ready to go in it right then the furniture is built and and so they were doing this but one thing that I found that they were doing is they had a lot of guys studying scripture to figure figure out what color or shade of blue that the inner Veil should be like there's a there's a blue curtain that hangs between the holies and the holies of holies and and that curtain was important to Moses and he said it would be a shade of blue but but how many shades of blues right here in this building this morning I'm wearing two shades right now amen so if you just say blue that's one thing but what shade of blue now according to the Old Testament you get something wrong like that and you die so the shade of blue was an important thing to the Israel and there's men who are spending their whole lives looking into what shade of blue a curtain supposed to be and I was sitting there watching that and I thought isn't that something they're studying and studying and studying and at their best guess they're never going to KN know for sure which one cuz they if you're more influential than that guy is and they trust you more than that guy then his idea of the shade of blue has more opinion than his shade of blue and maybe there's 30 says it should be this way and 40 says it should be this way and really will you ever actually know for sure what shade of blue that is but let let let a prophet walk in that room let Moses walk in that room and said well when I seen it in heaven it's this shade of blue now you have thus saith the Lord on the will of God according to the shade of blue well they've had 2,000 years of doctors of divinities and theologians trying to figure out water baptism they're trying to figure out the godhead they're trying to figure out predes ation amen and and they got one's got a bigger denomination and one's got a bigger group one's got more money amen but how would you ever know unless God would send the prophet among the church and say thus sayith the Lord here's the answer according to the original documents and we have received of the Lord in this hour a Vindicated truth to know exactly what we were looking for yes sir amen do you see what it is it's a revealing of the wheel now according to Revelations the 10th chapter it is prophesied that mystery would be settled in this age now the real thing see what what we what we look at if you want to pick this up third seal it's a beautiful uh first portion of the third seals beautiful readings but when you start reading brother Bram is telling us he says that see there's supposed to come a real thing now now if if you're if you're in comparison of scriptures that God sends something to bring reality to what substitutes are now we all know that from the time of the Garden of Eden Jesus was promised to Eve in the garden in the time of her fall he said the woman shall have a seed and he shall bruise the head of the serpent now brother man says what he was promising her was that Christ would become the word see the word would become a seed and a woman would have a seed and that seed the word would redeem the woman he said and until that time come he gave her substitutes of blood sacrifices right he said but when Jesus came who was the Incarnate God who got into the blood cell and was the real exact thing that God had promised in the Garden of Eden see when God made the promise everything from the Garden of Eden all the way to Jesus Christ was a substitute of his coming he was the real thing that God promised in the garden of Eden but by the time he got there there was so much tradition and so much misunderstanding that the people missed him the original word and Let It Go by them now I got I got scripture here amen it's amazing to me that the very Apostles that walked with him missed it y'all now I mean I'm not talking about just everybody missed it his very Apostles missed it the scripture in Matthew 17 when Jesus come off of Mount Transfiguration it said the scribes asked him saying why sayest thou Elias must first come and Jesus said to them he's come already and you didn't know it the Apostles of God the elect of God missed John the Baptist as the coming of Elijah but that very one turn around and says yes he has come already but he shall come and restore all things now in that beautiful that little word restore all things now now the Bible tells us in the book of Acts the third chapter that the heavens must receive Jesus Christ until the restitution of all things so whatever you think about John the Baptist he didn't fulfill all things he didn't restore all things even after the death burial in Jesus there was still a need of restoration isn't it a m now that's a powerful area to study but when you start looking at this now here's something brother Ram will load up if you like to study the message in in in and if you like to break it in context and really see the the Deep meanings of what brother Ram is talking about he begins the third seal with talking about everybody missed it yeah amen he begins the third seal by saying look the scripture said the apostles missed it amen it was so humble even the apostles missed it amen in John 1 and: 10 the Bible said he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not and he came unto his own and his own received it not now it's is amazing they missed both the messenger and his message they missed both Elijah and the Messiah they had a double portion of evidence of the scriptures being fulfilled and they missed it now watch the prophet of God says it he said they missed it there he said now now here's the thing they all missed it they missed it he said they missed it a million miles and they missed it with John they missed it with Elijah they missed it with Jesus he said they missed it all the way through and they'll do the same thing today they miss it now isn't this amazing because when you start looking at this they all missed it it's now we're we're looking back and we're saying well we would have knew it would you have knew it the apostles missed it on listen this is powerful it wasn't even prophesied to be a secret the Bible in Isaiah 40 said that the mountains would be made High The Valleys made High and the mountains made low amen there would be a great movement and and they wouldn't be able to but when it came they missed the prophecy so brother Ram says it he says they missed it all they missed Jesus they missed Elijah they missed everything now here's the beautiful thing he then turns around brother BR he he's such an amazing preacher cuz he's building the idea everybody missed it and then he stops and says now you're sitting here saying brother B then why should I try if they all missed it amen what makes me different than anybody else wouldn't I miss it too and the real truth of the matter is yes you would but brother BR says see but you haven't he says but now if you say there's no need of me trying he says listen you got the wrong kind of Faith he says if you're going to say it like that see you got the wrong kind of Faith he says because I want to live close to him and I know he's going to come and take me when he comes if everybody else misses it I'm going to be there by his grace he promised me that amen if everybody misses it I'm going to be there now listen youed to preacher you ain't got no listen there was eight in the days of Noah but there was eight of them there was one in the days of Enoch but there was one of them so you have enough scriptural evidence to know no matter how narrow it becomes that will always have one and I say this this morning I'll be that one if there's only one I'm going to be that one and I believe you could say the same thing about yourself this morning and say brother count me in I'm one of them amen am man we could break out in song couldn't we I'm one of them I'm one of them now you see what it was because it was substitutes were hung on to in the place of the real thing now the first bride that fell from her husband he says well she fail because she reasoned the word that was why she failed but when she failed brother R says but God full of Mercy made a way to redeem that woman and promised her telling her sometime in the future the true word would return to her again the true word would be made known to her now remember he promised that through Christ he says watch now the true word would be made known to her remember he promised Christ through the woman right he promised Christ through the woman now I hope you're hearing me Eve amen his promise was Christ through the woman there's a promise over your life Christ Christ through you in this day is the manifesting of the will of God of your life you wasn't put here just to be a carpenter you wasn't put here just to be a mechanic you wasn't put here amen just to be a computer technician you were put here to descend Christ into this godforsaken age Christ should come to this age and you are the provided and chosen vessel God did this before the world ever began listen amen I don't care how faroul you fall it was a promise to you and God always keeps his promises you said brother Wayne I can't do it the Bible said you'll do it Christ is that word that's right he is that word the word is coming back to you after so long a Time the word is coming back to you I want your class to see this what did she fall from now that's a powerful question a prophet is asking you if you're going to be restored you got to understand what you fell from she did not fall from being a woman that wasn't her she didn't fall from being a human she fell from the word isn't that amazing amen the only thing she fell from was the word everything else was an attribute of the Fall yes sir every other thing was only an attribute because of the Fall all these other things are there you said well she fell from this and fell from this and fell no she fell from the word because if we can see what she fell from we can see God's intention of restoration if God had her fall by the word then God has to restore the word and if he restores the word everything else is restored when the word is restored listen church we don't have to restore all the gifts restore the word we don't have to restore the shouting restore the word if you restore the word the church itself is backing the power and the atonement of God and what it was meant to be for you restore the word come on we're not living in the age of reformation of gifts we're living in the age of the restoration of the word of God that'll put us back the mind of God before the world ever began my B were there incidentally I I really appreciated brother Ray's sermon last Sunday wow wasn't that good I think it's the best I ever heard on 1 Corinthians 13 honestly powerful thought amen now the word is coming back God said he would make a way to redeem her the word had to do it watch this The Substitute will be given until the time the original word comes you can have a substitute but it only there until the word comes isn't it powerful when Jesus came the Bible said here ye men of Israel Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you even yourselves also know brother said God approved him man missed him look at the power of that wow man missed him God approved him but even in God's approval he was still missed he was the real promised Messiah David spoke of him Moses spoke of him Elijah spoke of him listen every one of them was a type of Jesus but none of them was Jesus but Jesus was all of them he was David he was Elijah he was John are you hearing me now amen do watch this now justification is not the real thing though it spoke of it sanctification is not the real thing though it spoke of it even the baptism of the spirit is not the real thing though it spoke of it but when the word came it is all of them it is justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is everything that God is when the word is restored the real promised has been made now here's the thing she was promised that original Eve was promised to have a Redeemer and that Redeemer would be the word amen that Redeemer would be the word I need a handkerchief somebody got one amen and that real Redeemer was the word and when the word came and made flesh thank you which one's the clean side the Redeemer would be the word and when the word came and was made flesh it was rejected because of her substitute in that thing isn't that amazing someone would take something God give them as a substitute and use it to reject the real wow is't that something because in the substitute was the original it literally spoke of it but it wasn't it but when that came amen now watch brother bam says see you got a natural and a spiritual type when e fell she was given substitute until the time Jesus came yeah amen he said which she held to her substitute and turned down the word y but then he says the ones that received the word went up to Pentecost received the spirit and became the Hebrew the Hebrew children became amen the the second Eve was birthed there at Pentecost he said but watch this but she went to NAA the same way that the first Eve spoke to the serpent in the garden he said and and she fell the same way that Eve fell one fell in the garden the other fell in NAA two eeve both had a fall and he said the same way God promised to the first Eve that I will redeem you by the word he said so as the second received a promise before they ever fail Jesus already talked about a restoration before they ever even fell at n because he knew they would fall at NAA because the sea had to go into the ground for the bride Church come on friends they come to perfection in that early church for one reason to be planted in the ground but one day Perfection will return one day Perfection returns under this word and we're receiving Perfection today not to go into the ground but to be raised up from the dead and our bodies to be changed in the age we're living in amen when that which is perfect has come that's when the bride of Christ will be changed we're being changed W Hallelujah the Perfection of the word returns to the church for our [Applause] Redemption hallelujah thank you Lord now the prophet said the same way they missed him the people today will miss this if they miss it does it make it any less real you see people are thinking okay they're thinking the church needs to receive a Jesus and then get the message now I know this church don't teach it but I've heard it a bunch we need to get them to this to to Jesus and then get them to the message let me put it in let me put it in different words for you in the days of Jesus Jesus is walking on the shore of Galilee amen and and somebody say John I know you're pointing at this man here but what you need to do is get the people to the traditions and go back into the elders and then let the elders get them there you mean with the word manifested clearly before us and you want me to point to the substitute that was given until this came listen friends I refuse to point at the history of the church to find the God who is alive when that sh Jesus has resurrected in my day with perfect manifestations we have evidence we have evidence the infallible resurrection of Jesus Christ has come into this age amen and I'm not ashamed of it come on if you're trying to preach William brandom as Jesus Christ you're an antichrist yourself but the real bride knows that it wasn't him he was introducing him amen now folks brother Ram said that he said you're an antichrist you make me an antichrist that's why people have a hard time introducing the message CU somebody has taught them the message as brother brand brother brandom didn't teach that God's Ministry don't teach that we are Christians from the very essence of the word Christian we are not Baptist we are not methodists we are not Lutheran we are the original church that God had in the book of Acts amen the book of Acts is living again a branch has come out of God well I feel like it hallelujah it's a reality the word they miss the word because they held to the substitute now you can hold the substitute all you want but you're going to miss the real thing when you do it's up to you yeah you can't have two husbands at the same time you got to die to one and let the other live now brother Bram said that's the reason today I know some of you heard this quote a lot but I want you to hear it in in this direction yes sir that's the reason today the revivals we're supposed to have but we don't have them now isn't that amazing that's the reason today now now you can hear a lot of excuses of why there's no Revival well brother see we just believe in teaching here we think you people are a little fanatical over on that emotional side so we try to keep things a little more sane a little more sensible that's the reason there's no Revival see but the prophet is telling us there a Revival he says we're supposed to have we're supposed to have Revival you see because it was made promised to us look at this the reason there is no Revival he says because we haven't had that staring don't think we got revivals we haven't we got millions and millions of church members but Revival nowhere he says see but the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stare that bride we're looking for it now now y'all was with me the other Sunday remember look to it prisoner on the sell look look at the message and see if it ain't look to it and see he says see they're looking for that Revival I love how brother Ram says it now it would take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he'll send it he promised he would now because somebody made something out of the Thunders that it wasn't everybody's got scarecrow religion when it comes to the seven Thunders but the seven Thunders were to give us faith for Rapture Grace they were to give us faith for a change of the body the seven Thunders were supposed to awaken the bride and put a Revival back in them and if you put the seven Thunders as some understanding of some man I got why you're scared of it bab but before they gave you a substitute there was a real seven Thunders and the real seven Thunders is the voice of God that sounds in the last days y'all know I'm in the message I don't have time to preach all of it amen but it's a voice that sounds it's the ministry of the seventh angel God sent the Revival by the word do you see it hey man why are they missing it now why why they miss things back there see but why are they missing watch watch what prophet's trying to lay something out he sends it he sends it such a way but they miss it cuz there's been no manifestation yeah now now I don't want to get into deep areas here but let's just just just touch this can we just touch this we've already had the Revival in South Africa 30,000 were saved blind eyes were healed uh insane man was touched cripples were walking but there's been no manifestation y Amen to awaken the bride so that wasn't the wakeup call for the Bride come on church that wasn't going to wake this bright up but the prophet said it would take the seven unknown Thunders and y'all know I'm in the scripture in Revelation 10:7 the seventh angel sounds in Malachi 4 it's Elijah is to turn the hearts or restore the church brother random are them two different men oh no it's one angel with two aspects to his ministry he will reveal the mystery of the seven Thunders and the preaching of that will literally turn the hearts of these children back to their Apostolic fathers We Don't Preach the message here because we're Fanatics we're not preaching the message cuz we're cultish it is the very reason there is Revival is because we have a message we are not just shouting to shout we are not churching to church we're not singing to sing there's a message there's a message of a king and he's coming to this earth yeah and we're a part of the coming of the Lord Brother man said the reason they're missing it is because they won't plead the promise if they would plead the promise it would become effective to them that's right now y'all know what he says by your Traditions you made the word of God in no effect brother R said the word manifested in that day said to them disciple or said to the Pharisees your Traditions make the word no effect here the word in this age is saying to another group of people the Traditions you hold are making the word without effect isn't that something now y'all know the scriptures and you know the message brother Bram said I Indi the generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ he said not his flesh but they're crucifying the effect of this word yes sir but it would become effective if we would see it in the promise if you could see that this is that that the Bible prophesied of this hour brother wouldn't nobody have to excite you we'd be trying to figure ways to calm you down it wouldn't be nobody have to sit amen try to pump you up and try to make you do amen we be figuring out ways to quieten the church down Hallelujah I say preach the message and let the power of the message andite the church in the Revival that God has given to this age I don't know about y'all I'm dead with Dead traditions I'm done with disaffected messages of a former age I say preach the message of the hour and let the coming of Christ be the Revival of the Church of the Living [Applause] [Music] God now brother manam immediately goes into recognizing your day amen he does it there in that third seal and he says they've missed it Herald of his coming we need a prophet but in recognizing your day he says you've missed you've not recognized third seal he keeps saying it again and again they missed it they missed it they missed it they missed it the title recognizing your day yes sir they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride it's happening right before them yes and they don't see it isn't that something well he's a drunk soldier's son oh he's illegitimate he's a bastard child am something they could ridicule make fun of and talk about and put a black name on and push it out of their churches and so have they done it again in this age behold I stand at the door and knock and if anybody would let me in if anybody lets the voice of God in I'll come in unto them isn't it amazing they missed the Awakening and brother Bram said if we would plead the promise if we would plead the promise he said it would make it effective it would make it effective now can we just take just a moment let's read this he says listen now God promised it that he would vindicate the word for her and still she wouldn't do it all right but God promised her by servants the prophets God promised prom through Jesus Christ so say Jesus made the promise he promised through Joel he promised through Paul he promised through Malachi and he promised through John I love how brother Bram does this he then turns and says now if you want to write them down of course Jesus made the promise in John 14:12 may I add Luke 17:30 yes sir Joel made the promise in Joel 2 and 38 Paul made made the promise in 2 Timothy 3 Malachi made the promise in Malachi 4 the 4th chapter John made the promise in Revelations the 10th chapter what is it see you would you could exactly what would take place now to the church what is it the Incarnate Word made flesh amongst his people again now watching the third seal now brother Ram says the church is coming out of the age justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word right listen he goes see it becomes Incarnate Word in the Masterpiece brother Ram said justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the spirit and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost himself to come into Perfection back to the word word again what was it amen the word came and they missed it the word has came and the world is missing it but there was some that saw it and I'll say this to you had it not been pointed out to them they would have missed it Peter would have missed the whole thing fishing out there and and and busy with life but Jesus came to him Jesus found [Applause] him Hallelujah that's right he come up to him remember this he says thy name is joh uh Peter Simon and thy father's name is Jonas brother mam says it like this he said see but in here he said down in his heart was a predestinated seed and Jesus walked right up to him and said I'll go down there to the meat eat and see he walks right up there Jesus standing there just an ordinary looking fellow walked up he said your name is Simon and your father's name was Jonas that deflated him that listen to this that little eternal life seed it struck in there why didn't Peter miss it eternal life seed watch the prophet he says it he said oh that's the truth you've been he comes to this woman at the well he said you've been running around with five and this is the sixth husband you've had five I've told you the truth watch what was it the light struck that seed it had been laying there that was spoke by God yes sir the seed was on the earth when God moved the Mars away the sun hit it and it come up that's right when the Holy Spirit in him mooved moved away her past life and showed it to her that light Struck it now I don't know if you see what brother Brandon's doing here but he's made this little woman the Earth that was back there without form and void and darkness was upon the deep and seeds laid beneath the water brother BR said the reason it happened so fast there at the whale is because the seed was already there isn't it amazing that's why it happened so with you that's why you didn't have to go through maybe 10 years to figure it out but something happened to you it happened fast it's because there's a seed in there listen you might be sitting here this morning and had all kinds of questions but let the spirit roll back the past life and watch God Quicken that seed come on Amen I love altars but you don't need an altar you need the light to strike the seed you need the light of this word to manifest over your life and when the light strikes the seed brother it's over then it's not up one day and down the next day it's over then I know in whom I have believed when that light strikes that seed finishes the matter Lord oh brother man said see because the light Struck it they couldn't see it because of their Traditions but that prostitute isn't that something but that prostitute that farmer all of them saw it that was predestinated when the doubts are rolled away the seed went to Growing see they were ordained to eternal life before the foundation of the world and when the light Struck it they knew it when this true Vindication the revealed truth of God's word strikes a heart he'll strike the water and Y with the Holy Ghost as hard as she could go you couldn't stop him from doing it because life had worked forth hallelujah amen this is in the fourth seal brother ramond says in Genesis 1 he lays out the picture of Genesis 1 and he said I believe every seed was laying there from another civilization or something and as soon as the water lifted off the light Struck it and up come the trees and everything and the same thing with a human being all the mids moved away the revealed true seed laying there is gerti as the light of the Gospel can Strike It by true Vindication so preacher what are you talking about brother B said them seeds were there from another civilization somebody said well I maybe there were other worlds or whatever I'll tell you what I believe I believe God had a civilization in his mind before anything ever began that was something in his mind and the will of God in his mind laid the seat seeds of a future civilization and when he laid them seeds all he had to do is move the water and strike the seed and that same God foresaw this lay out TOA age and in it he put seeds he laid seeds in this age and in this age with all the water that was over it when a prophet stood there amen and begin to prophesy over this generation he moved the waters back off of the seeds I was upon your life and when the light Struck it brother it was over then it's over after that she left her water pot and said come see a man sir listen listen if it was just a good story why did all them disciples give their life for [Applause] it you can carry it to visible Union if you like that book your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life that was the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural Union right your new life is a Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah you were true Eternal germ from the beginning isn't that amazing isn't amazing you come to church you're a little mad at the pastor but you can't even stay mad because there's an eternal life gene on the inside of you that overcomes it you ever get in your mind I'm going to be mad and I'm just going to stop this service sorry on I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to sit on this brother this will blow you out the water this is eternal life je speaking back to seed it's word to word and it's greater than your troubles and it's greater than your family problems and it's greater than Church troubles and it's greater than your sins it's greater than it is God's Eternal Word Redemption speaking back to the redeemed so I tell you what you ought to do do yall just throw up your hands and say Lord forgive me I want to get in on the Revival I want the Holy Ghost of God to strike my life like never [Applause] before hey glory to God your new life your true Eternal Journey from the beginning you Lord invisible Union you were pred destinated for him to be in his bride before the world began you are the predestinated seed give you another one that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world and God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life that anointed word of God being Vindicated before any man that's born to be a Son of God when the predestinated Jour into him at this hour he'll see that that message as sure as there is a God in [Applause] heaven amen you can't hide it from the believer what do you mean going to miss it brother we can't miss it it has our name on it Hallelujah God has called our name on this matter y'all know Luke 24 and my road y'all remember the story brother bam said he walked with him all the way to the evening made like he was going to leave but he didn't and they drawed him to come in and brother Bram said they stay he stayed with him how long did he stay brother brandham till they got it how long's he going to stay with the church how long's he going to stay with an eternal life germ seed until you get it the anointed word of God which you are a part of in this day what is it it's that in mayus road walk what happened he appeared unto them so that they could recog recognize him in his resurrection why has this word came so you can recognize this is your Redemption this message is your Revival amen come on Church we're not looking for Revival the Revival is not over we are in the middle of the greatest Revival that has ever struck the planet Earth and if you would notify yourself and let your doubts roll way you would have the greatest Services of your life you would have the greatest time of your life because your Revival is here ah don't let it pass you by the devil's working on you every corner ain't he amen he's working on you every which way to try to find something wrong do something everything's working like this lift up your head your Revival is here forget it all drop your water pots drop the laundry drop it and go into the city preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about your Revival it's here thank you Lord Hallelujah Lord now thank you Lord there is a bride there is a bridegroom and there's a friend of the Bride Eastern weddings right you're the bride Jesus is the bridegroom the word and the friend of that bridegroom in this case was William brandham he was not our bridegroom he was a friend of the Bride now watch this he was a friend of the bridegroom in John chapter 3 John says it like that he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom standeth and heareth him and rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled he must in increase but I must decrease he must increase but I must decrease what in the world were they talking about John was a light for a season but he wasn't the True Light but Jesus was the True Light of the World and John said I've got to decrease now but he's going to increase now Church don't throw me out but let me say something brother random very clearly is telling us in the end of his ministry I am now decreasing I'm going to leave the field amen but the God he served did not leave this field he stayed with the Church of the Living God and now there is an increase of the son of man in the Church of the Living God it is getting greater and greater and greater and greater and greater I feel an explosion lifting in the Church of the Living God he has increased in our [Applause] lives he fulfilled it see he was bringing the word once the word was introduced The Prophet stepped [Music] away I don't have time to look into it but I I I'll simply just put it like this amen you're trying to get through here to Christ and all the denominations are between you and Christ brother random comes along and said okay boy go through the hole message preachers are coming back now and they replaced it with brother brandom so now there's something between you and your maker it is an antichrist teaching he said there is no man between God and man except the man Christ Jesus William brandom introduced us to Jesus Christ the son of of God which is his word and any preacher that says he's not the same yesterday today and forever did not get his anointing from God anything the book of Acts did this Bride Can Do Anything is in God's word belongs to this church not yesterday not tomorrow but [Applause] [Music] today Hallelujah now somebody said well brother Wayne is that a little offensive to brother Bram not brother brandham oh no not brother brandom brother BR be shouting higher than you are somebody got the point there's a bride understanding his message see the bridegroom's voice this is where the joy was fulfilled of the bridegroom's friend yeah when brother Bram heard his voice this was his Joy the voice was speaking if you want to look at it brother Bram says we have seen and heard the voice of God speaking through the word and we know what hour we're living in on listen the pillar of fire is here it had a voice in it and that voice was the voice of God that Vindicated this word now the voice of vindication speaks the loudest it's the Roar of the line when Vindication speaks you've heard from God brother said for a man to say it is one thing but when God fulfills it it's another thing the voice of vindication is the voice of God that speaks to the bride Church the voice of God through the word that's what the eagle heard and that's what he recognized was a voice he recognized the voice that's where the church has recognized the voice of God God vindicating this word listen when you catch the Revelation this really is Malachi 4 sir this really is Luke 17 this really is first Thessalonians this really is Matthew 24 and Daniel the 12th chapter this really is Revelations 3 and Revelations 5 and Revelations 9 and Revelations 10 and Revelations 9 this really is the word of the age brother I'll tell you what it'll do it'll explode something in your life you can't fast and pray long enough to get where I'm talking about amen fasting and prayer are great it will never put you in the place I'm talking about you can come to this altar every day of your life you will never get where I'm talking about I'm talking about the one that has placed you in the mind of God from the foundation of the world only the word can put you there yes sir now now it's a powerful thing to me cuz this is the the whole message of the third seal brother Bram keeps talking about this and then he comes down and he says listen let's get to the good part now I know it's getting late I'm not going to take a long time on the good part but it says this is the good part I love it when a prophet says we're getting to the good part yeah hurt not the oil and the wine brother BR said that wasn't one of those beasts that said it right he said this one spoke from the throne he said it was the lamb said hurt not the oil and the wine brother B said what is the oil he said the oil is the Holy Ghost it is the spirit that moves through the church don't hurt that don't quench that don't touch that that's what brings life that's what brings quickening that what's brings anointing in the church Jesus said don't touch it Paul said quench not the spirit of God do you see what it is it's a spirit that moves and brother man said oil and wine always went together always went together in worship he said but I wondered what that wine represented he said then I saw it he said natural wine when it has its effect natural wine stimulates a person in their body it's when you drink natural wine it has an effect are you hearing me by your Traditions you make the wine of no effect brother man said but Revelation is as natural wine it is a spiritual wine he said or as the Bible calls it the new wine amen amen am he says and it should have the same effect I didn't make it up folks a prophet said it it ought to have an effect on the [Applause] church Revelation stimulates the bride [Music] church it's the wine at the marriage and he saved the best for last it's the miracle of the wine we are in another marriage but it's our marriage it's our marriage we are the marriage Le the lamb and the wine of Revelation has been spread out among the church I I'm not trying to be mean I'm trying to be honest let me just say it real honest where does this leave all of our great teachers then when the more they teach the colder the church gets by your tradition you're killing the effect of this Revelation this Revelation is built to stimulate this bride should not have to suck on a Pentecostal bottle to find an anointing this bride shouldn't have to clap their hands till they're crazy to get into an anointing the message should produce an anointing that would change your body that would change your life come on church this is not coming from emotion this is a word based and if this word is preached with re Revelation it will bring stimulation and faith and it'll bring an effect upon the church it's the truth funny thing is you won't even have to be in church sometimes I don't think you just shout when you're in church amen I was down in North Carolina and heard Brother Ray breaking open that 1 Corinthians 13 I wanted to get out of the car and do a jig when he started into that I said glory to God that's the Revelation that was meant for that scripture and it would just it was just surging over me I could feel the life of it it had life in it it didn't kill my tongues it didn't kill my gifts it didn't kill my anointing it let me know it's okay just keep it in the word come on Church anybody's preaching that takes the shouting out of the church wrong preaching anybody's preaching that takes the amen out of the church wrong preaching but if you preach this message with power and without tradition it'll bring Revival in the heart of your people stimulated by the revelation of this word it should have the same effect upon you as natural wine has upon a human being oh I think we ought to pass the wine bottle again in the house of God let us lose our cares let us lose our Ambitions let us Le our dignitary ways and our formalism let us get so drunk we don't know what our family name is or what the ideas of the others are and God I say pour out the blessings of God until Every Soul feels the anointing of God Hall brother car I believe we can drink where our sorrows woo I believe we can do it beautiful thing about this you won't have a hangover [Applause] tomorrow brother Nick if you do we got an old remedy from the world just stay drunk that's right natural type the spiritual you wake up with a hangover over this get your book down listen to your tape and get drunk all over over again cuz I'll tell you what it'll do have you ever want I just love a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost meeting when God pours out his spirit and kills all the situations going on around us amen because we are the children of God we have heard his voice we are stimulated by his power he has come near us it is the will of God for you to be saved it is the will of God for you to be healed his coming brought his will that's right will of God for you to have the Holy Ghost it's the will of God for your body to change it's the will of God for you to not miss a Rapture well if that don't put you in a shouting mood I don't know what [Applause] could his whe and it's broke out on us if you're study the message third seal brother Bram don't finish the oil and wine fourth seal he he starts it over again yeah amen yep he don't finish it in the third seal he goes so far in the fourth seal he begins it all over and repr preaches the understanding to the church because it was the good part yeah good amen he used them words good part oh wi don't touch it yes sir sir leave it alone I was sitting there studying yesterday and I was going across these thoughts I'm I'm out of time I'm not out of thought we'll get to it again serious I sitting here going across these thoughts brother Abraham as as I was reading through them things I was I just started shaking my head but Jim I just said out loud I get joy when I think about what he's done for me and I sat there and started going over them promises do it sometime take them promises and just start going over and watch all of them fall all in your lifetime 2,000 years of church history but for you all these promises fell right in your life I guarantee you they wasn't put here for a cold Theologian to take it away from [Applause] you you can't have my Revival I like brother R what he said you can't have my tongues you can't have my tongues you can't have my Revival you can't have my word call me anything you want to but I'm happy like I am brother Ben would you come I mean think about this this morning what God has done to put you in this this place thank you Lord think about it brother mat we we don't this is beautiful as preachers y'all understand this Ron's traveling a lot you understand as you go to a place and they're all sometimes just really beat down and you're thinking sometimes you got to preach two or three services just to get the people high enough to preach to them and and you're sitting there thinking with all this lovely things y'all I'm sorry but when I come to church I thought enough I don't want have to come to church that two I want some preacher to come in here with a two before beating on me devil been doing that all week already I say take the word and hit the devil with it turn that word the right way I'm not your enemy The Devil's your enemy get that devil wear that devil out I believe we can have Revival true word Tabernacle we don't have to be Fanatics we've got the word the word has been restored to the [Applause] church if I shout when no one's shouting forgive me but I've been thinking when I get to thinking about what he done for me and I get to reading through these sermons one after the other and they start stacking up my heart I get to run I get to want to walk on water or something I I want to express it in so many ways I just don't know how Hallelujah John knows what I'm talking about when you Hey listen you you know what I mean you know what you know and you know what you don't know you're sitting there in a private of your study and all of a sudden somebody somewhere unseen starts bumping you toward one scripture bumps you toward another scripture bumps you back this way and after a while you sit back and see a parall and you go oh I'm fellowshipping with him oh I'm fellowshipping with him sir Hall brother Seth he knows just how to lead you to that tape don't he more than a couple accounts him
