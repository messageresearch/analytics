preaching today so amen but if they here I don't know where we would put them uh so amen but uh we thank the Lord he's using these men of God Amen amen and that you are not only uh Brother Ray says it as good as I've ever heard it the difference between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea both of them have inlets but only one of them has an outlet and when a church don't have an outlet it dies and we want to thank God for these brothers that put their boots on and go preach this gospel amen and take this light amen uh we want to thank you for that and I I just want to this morning we have some uh word here from the book of Ephesians the 2 chapter uh the 19th verse down to the 22nd amen um I I pray these Series has been okay with you uh it's been an interesting study for me personally and I pray that it's a blessing to you Ephesians chapter 2 verse 19-22 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the same Saints and of the household of God I don't know how much deep I'll get into that household of God but in God's provided place in 1965 I believe it is in Louisiana brother mam deals with that a little bit the household of God and I'll probably get it into the next chapter but uh if you want to look into that it's God's provided place of worship the household of God and are built upon the foundation of Apostles and Prophets and Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly Fring together groweth and holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also I like that inclusion don't you in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit we ask the Lord to bless his reading this morning I want to speak to you today on Holy habitations you could be seated uh I want to speak to you from that last line there I want to speak to you about holy habitations amen that's a very powerful word that that Apostle Paul has spoke to a people that he just laid out the idea uh Thursday we were there that you had no business in the Commonwealth of Israel you had no hope and were without God lost in the world and that has now transitioned that you are now the holy habitation of almighty God I mean what a transformation what a reality that God has brought us to now the scripture will tell us here amen that Paul is saying this whole building is fit together but it is built of on the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets and Jesus being the Chief Cornerstone it is built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets I I think that's powerful personally amen if you want to know what kind of building you're going to get look at the foundation that you have amen if you're going to build a 20 by2 shop you're not going to lay a 100 by 100 Foundation amen the foundation is a reflection of what is coming and and if the foundation are Apostles and Prophets what's going to be set on it amen Jesus Christ being the Cornerstone also will be the Capstone now in Revelation chapter 3 brother bam will tie these two scriptures together from Ephesians chapter 2 and he'll tie this to and him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is the New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write up on him my new name brother Bram uses this and he says see him that overcometh in Philadelphia and age he said I will make the pillar in the temple of God a pillar or a foundation a foundation in the temple of the house of God the Temple of my God the house of my God it's a pillar the foundation there's those that took the word here in verse 8 and went back to the foundation in Ephesians 2:9 over in the Church of Ephesus you know uh you go back to Ephesus you're going back to the beginning amen let's go back to Ephesus with Paul see the church was established and let's see now all right the church Ephesus let's go back now and see the foundation back there and see that Paul the foundation in the first church he's talking about the Ephesians that he's saying that he that is a pillar of I'll make him a pillar I'll make him in the original church I'll put him back in the original uh I like it here out of the uh 1960 as the church ages here brother M said I will give him see and I will make him a pillar in other words a part of that Foundation what will I give him now this is very powerful and important to the rest of our service I'll put in him the doctrine of the apost Les and prophets from the beginning and give him the Revelation I will make him a pillar in the house of God I will put in him the doctrine amen it now that's that's that's going a long ways from reading a Doctrine and from hearing a Doctrine but he said I will place in him the doctrine amen and give him the Revelation amen that's what it is what did the prophet say about him he's the C counselor the peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father see and he that overcomes all this synagogue of Satan keeps himself free I'll make him a pillar I'll put him back in the foundation of my word in the house of my god oh I'll put him right there in the pillar in the foundation you stay right with that word see what is it when he's a pillar he's not going out anymore amen uh uh from the uh same same book here he says he's a pillar he ain't going out no more he's the bride amen he there it is you're going back to the Ephesus you're going back to Paul that's what it is amen he has made him a pillar in the house of God he has put the doctrine in him he's not going out anymore I think it's amazing when you look at habitations and you look at the habitation of God because actually a God who we know as the invisible God a god whom the heavens couldn't hold nor the Earth could contain but the Bible tells us that he desired to dwell among men in the first temple that we realized God had built was when God had Moses to build him a house it was God that told Moses to build a meeting place and and y'all remember that when he told him to build the meeting place it was out in the wilderness of sini and he was going to build a place and that place was going to be a temporary dwelling and something that could move along with them throughout the Wilderness Journey it was a place that would house the word and it would be able to be moved now it's amazing because when Moses made the things this Tabernacle he made it like the things he saw in heaven when Moses built the Tabernacle on the earth he made it like what he saw it in the heavens uh when he made these he laid them out now in Hebrews chapter 8 you'll read it in the fifth verse Who Shall Serve unto the example and Shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle see he saith thou shal make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount so Moses saw it in the mount in Hebrews 9 and 2423 and it was therefore necessary that the pattern of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifice than these so he was seeing that in the heavens there had to be sacrifice and in the earth there had to be sacrific in the heavens there was a temple and upon the Earth there was a temple and the thing that was built in the Earth was only a pattern of what he saw in the heavens now if you've ever I wish I probably could should have brought a picture but if you've ever seen the Tabernacle in the wilderness drawled in a picture it's draw with three different courts remember the outer Court was where all the people camped and there was your daans and your chorus and there was all the mumblers the grumblers mixed in with the Believers and they were all out there and then there was a next phase of that Court as they approached the word there was the next phase of that where they come into the inner court and there in the inner Court they they they had that where the Brazen Altar and the approach last Thursday I spoke the approach to God they had to come to the Brazen Altar and then the Laver and then they come into the holy place where the candlesticks were and then we walk right into that place amen of of the of the holies of holies where they would come into the word of God now when you see that pattern you see three different phases of that pattern there's the outside the inside and the inside of the inside amen and we see that very pattern laid over the human being we see a body we got a spirit and we have a soul right so there's three phases of it the same as it was there there is also Al in man then the pattern that Moses was building was to show you that God's original plan is to dwell in a man that's God's original plan and being that God couldn't dwell in man he had to build a temporary place that would be a shadow of what he was going to do so he had a temporary dwelling place with temporary uh atonements and temporary symbols that was set there but every one of them was saying that God wanted wanted to dwell with a man he wanted to dwell upon the earth now it was shown in David's desire when you go back in the uh the book of kings and you find that David wanted to build God a house remember he wanted to take that God that he had saw in the Tabernacle and and and he said how is it that I dwell in a house of Cedar and my God dwell in the tents out there and and and he wanted to he wanted to make a place for his God it was a great it was a great thing on his heart and even the prophet said to him said David do all that is in thine heart and and it was then that then the prophet had to come back and God spoke to him and said you go tell David it's a good thing that he wants to do but there's too much blood on his hands and he'll not be able to build me a house he said but oh how be it when Solomon comes I'll let his son build me a house and remember then David wasn't building a house but he was building the material for the house right and he was making preparations for it to come because then Solomon would be the one that would be able to put together the house in 40 Years of Silence it would be stacked together brother M goes through this in a message dedication and he said look at the material that they had he said it didn't all come from bluon he said it all didn't come from uh Lima he said see it come from different parts of the world and it was shaped in different places but when it come together he said it fit perfectly because there was a design see Solomon never ever deviated from the design that Moses had and mo Moses had brought it to a place now Solomon was going to make it in a in in a in a place where they could have it solid it's amazing I was reading the scriptures last night that when Solomon began to build this Altar and he began to build this H this Temple amen that the word already existed right amen and they had to carry the word and place it in that temple in a certain spot and the Bible records that when they put the word in there and the and the and the word fell into its sockets the Bible records that the glory of God filled the house and so that they wasn't able see because the word had come to its place it had it had come to a resting place the the city that it was coming to was Jerusalem the place it was coming to was the Third Realm of man into the soul and it was all symbol because it was a natural City and it was a natural building amen but it spoke of another city that would come one day it would be a New Jerusalem called the bride of Christ and they would be the bride and in them is where the word belongs and when the word Finds Its sockets in the soul of a Believer there is where the glory of the Lord will fill the house amen where they were sting I I I think of this because I see that it was even Solomon when he began to witness the glory of this in First Kings chapter 8 in the 27th verse I amazed at reading this he said will God indeed dwell on the Earth he asked the question will God dwell on the earth the god of Heaven can you imagine behold the Heaven and the heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee how much less the house that I have build it did God dwell with a man listen this is exactly what Isaiah asked in Isaiah 66 And1 he said thus sayith the Lord for Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house shall you build unto me and where is the place of my rest this was a Prophet this was a pro Isaiah wrote the whole Bible in 66 books of his own of his own book 66 chapters and he is asking where is the place of my rest where could a god dwell that can't fit in the heavens where could a god dwell that the Earth itself is his creation and the univers is of universes but God brother Ram said is a person and he desires a Dwelling Place he desires a home come on now you you that like your home and you love having a house and you love being able to be there and you just enjoy it it's because you're getting that from somewhere else there's something made you that way it's that Dove nature on the inside of you it's a home loving bird it wants a place to call home God desired it and it's not until Matthew 16 that the the real son of David Jesus Christ comes along and he said I say unto thou Peter on this rock I will build my church isn't that amazing that the the the son of David the natural son was the one that built the Tabernacle where the word was going to dwell but here's the real son of David here's Jesus Christ himself and he said I will build another Temple and this won't be like that one that Solomon had that they could tear down amen but he would build another and it would be called his church it would be a temple of it and I can I say this to you this morning and you forgive me if I skip ahead a little bit but I I would say this to you that Jesus said 2,000 years ago I will build my church but I believe this morning that we could say Amen that he has built a church amen I would say that he's not looking for a church I say the church has been built by the grace of God we have come from the bottom and we're all the way up to the top this morning we have been seeing the building of the church now I could see give it to you in the countdown brother man said the achievements of man he said man has achieved to get to the moon he said but what is God's achievement made in this age what has God achieved in this age he has achieved a church amen that every word of this Bible can be released in that church he's got a church this morning that the word could come into glory to God he's got a church this morning that there's not one word of this Bible that we are resisting this morning there's not one word of this message that we resist this morning because God is not building a church he has a church Hallelujah he's got a bride Hallelujah in Acts the 7th chapter it's in the book of Acts it's amazing in the book of Acts is this is where Steven says the 44th verse our fathers had the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness and had appointed speaking unto Moses that they should make it according to the fashion they had seen which also our fathers that came and brought Jesus into possession of the Gentiles whom God drave out before the face of our fathers under the days of David who found favor before God and desired to build a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon build him a house but how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophets now he's tying together Solomon's house with high he don't dwell in buildings made with hands as saith the prophets with Isaiah's prophecy Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol and what house will you build me sayith the Lord what is the place of my rest now if you're reading brother brandham he he he takes this out of the message as Statue of the perfect man and he takes acts 7 and then he reads Paul right behind it in Hebrews 10 and verse 5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body thou Hast prepared me oh my but a body thou Hast prepared me now what is this of course brother random is reading two scriptures together and preaching the stature of a perfect man it's a powerful thing to me brother R said what is it then the Tabernacle is now a body what's he saying God doesn't dwell in temples made with hands but Paul said but a body thou Hast prepared me then what is it the Tabernacle today is a body it's not just any body it's your body ye have been built into the holy habitations of God that you may house the god of Jacob in these bodies remember this God reveals himself he reveals himself in the pillar of fire called the fatherhood the same God was manifested in Jesus which he built a body made his body thirdly through the death of that body he Sanctified a church that he can dwell in it is God above us it is God With Us it is God in us the same God the same God in dedication 1962 brother Bram said see Sten is speaking our fathers found favor before God and Solomon built him a temple but how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands you ever wonder what that really meant he dwelleth not in temples made by hands what he's saying is is God was there but he wasn't going to stay there he doesn't it wasn't a final resting place for God he was there but he wasn't going to stay there because it was a body he was looking to dwell in amen Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol amen then a body thou has prepared showing God was going to dwell in a body that Tabernacle back there was pointing that God was going to live in a body Hallelujah and when this body had been made a sacrificed the correct lamb had been sacrificed that was coming forth God came to his own body which is his bride Oh Glory he came to his own body which is his bride amen there was 120 temples that God had created and was ready for dedication and they got all their unbelief beat out of them and they gathered in the upper room and waited 10 days for dedication service and then completely surrendered God came again in the shakana glory and filled the house where they were sitting what did God do light the AR dropping into its proper sockets the message of that day God dropped it in its proper Channel not into a denomination not into a building made by hands but into the heart of man amen you said brother when does God fill the house when the word is dropped into the in oh in the heart of man I tell you this morning I say lift up oh your Gates of everlasting life and let the king of glory come in let the word of this message come into our souls amen and anoint our lives this morning you were made for it you were ordained for it you were elected for it amen all the way back there when Moses was building the Tabernacle this was on God's mind my goodness not in a building but in the heart of his people that's where he finds restall amen not in the house that God dwells in it's not a building with a big Bell on the top or a high stle but it's body thou has prepared a body that God can dwell in a God can walk in God can see God can talk God can work in it's Living instrumentality God walking on two feet Glory the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of God God is walking in you you are the written Epistles of the word of the Living God Amen God has wrote upon you the doctrine of the Apostles and the prophets and made you a pillar in the temple of God where God dwells where God comes into the soul of man come on church we are not a we are not a church group we are temples of God that have gathered together and brought the fire of God collectively together because God does indwell in temples made with hands Hallelujah the god of the Bible Steven spoke of Solomon build and said God don't dwell in temples made with hands Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol what is the place of my rest but a body thou has prepared watch He's tying them two together every time he says what shall be the place of my rest a body thou H has prepared showing you scripturally that the question that Stephen asked them was answered in Paul's Hebrews a body thou have prepared a body thou have prepared God dwells in the stature of a man reflecting himself into that being perfect worship woo glory to God come on I'm not talking about denominational worship I'm not just talking about a congle of people amen shouting and under the gifts I'm talking about perfect worship I'm talking about the God who the heavens couldn't contain the god whom the Earth could not contain has bought himself a body and stepped into that body and that is perfect worship God and His Temple have come together again oh Church of the Living God you have been brought back to worship this seven seal brought true worship the seven seal brings him back to the Earth he's not an emotion he's not a Doctrine it's a person it's God the word he's coming to his Temple and we are here this morning in perfect worship Hallelujah I'm not even going to explain myself you know I'm not against emotion cuz everywhere God was it was loud come on church when Isaiah saw the glory of God filling the temple what did he do he said I heard the voice of one Angel as it shook the Temple Gates brother B said if the voice of one of them angels in the presence of God could shake the temple how about hearing the millions of them that are there right now amen listen the prophet of God said if Jesus is there behind the veil he said they could hear the sounds of Aaron walking around the word crying holy holy holy it was the speaking Bells it was the Bells on his skirts that the walk he made made a life that came out of it that you couldn't refuse it had life in [Applause] it now I'll go ahead and finish what the prophet of God said and he said any religion that doesn't have emotion in it is dead and it needs to be buried amen so we're not talking about our our worship we're talking about perfect worship we're talking about worship that God has came into the church wo glory to God well I could stop and Shout a while perfect worship has returned amen God in us tabernacling God manifesting how we could stay on that till we suffocate brother B says God always has all time reflected himself in a man now I'm sorry if if this would rub a little but I I hate it for some of the of the builders that have built organizations around the message but brother Bram said Christ never sent me to build an organization he sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be powerhouses and the dwelling of the spirit amen I'm sorry they they built a lot down in Jeffersonville but William brandham never orchestrated an organization William brandham never left an idea that we ought to build an organization of this message and put some man over it we don't have a headquarters in Jeffersonville and we don't have a headquarters in Rome come on we don't have a headquarters in any state we've got a headquarters but it's the Lord Jesus Christ for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout we are not following a personality we're following the person Jesus Christ the son of God the God of all gods the very person has come and returned to us again and I say all hell that make power of Jesus name oh hell the power of Jesus name I say God we salute the [Applause] return hallelujah we're not here building organizations and neither are brother Ericson and I trying to build an organization we're not trying to build you follow us program we're not doing it we only have one thing to introduce and that's the word of this age him and I are perfectly in Harmony on this every preacher we know is wrong this message is right and the only time we're right is when we're preaching the message of the hour this is an absolute truth this is God's word to this generation I pray we build powerhouses I pray we build individuals that the person of Jesus Christ could live on the earth in your flesh in your body in your nature Hallelujah I believe in it folks I believe there's a presence of the coming of the Lord amen the building of living Tabernacles the building of God Dwelling Place upon the Earth living Tabernacles of a living God hallelujah building powerhouses I can tell a little Sid track right there building powerhouses well we're not here to dumb you down and take all the strength we have away from our men we want strong men we want leaders Among Us brother Ericson and I are not here trying to make all of you men come under our thumbs and you do what we say and how we say and what we say and how we think amen amen don't try that with me Hallelujah I certainly ain't going to do that to you I tell you what I'd like to do I'd like to get you so full of the power of God Amen that there wouldn't be nobody could put you under their thumb I pray there ain't never a preacher again in your life can put you under their thumb I pray you come under the headship of the power of God when this message rules in your home it rules in your life it rules in your hearts come on away with that cathol Doctrine have it's a priest and a congregation this ain't that at all I'm one of you I'm one of you for Jesus the prophet of God said it like this he said let the greatest among you be the servant if you want to be like Jesus start washing feet start serving the [Applause] people not y'all come and pay homage to me I don't want no homage I am a man born of sin saved by the grace of God and I don't have no no hope outside of the blood of Jesus Christ but I say God help us to build individuals in this message so powerful no spirit will ever dominate them again this message will be their [Music] life so brother Wayne ain't you scared no I'm not scared a bit the Lord ain't you scared somebody's going to bump you no I'm not scared at all God put me here it's God's it's God who has to take care of it and if God don't take care of it he don't want me there that's all right with me I amen but I tell you what I want to do I want to serve God in the fullness of his serving I don't want to bind myself to fear nor do I want to bind you with fear I say I say serve God with all your heart serve God Wayne you better be careful no the devil better be careful cuz what he's hoping is that he can bind me with fear then that puts fear on you to do anything cuz you're afraid how we're going to receive it listen if you're doing something for God do something for God testify witness tell them of the glory and the power of God hallelujah hallelujah brother when you got scripture I do I do David had an army of Mighty Men amen any of them men could whip a half an army by themselves but he didn't go in there and tell them put your swords boys I'm afraid you're going to take over my kingdom he knew their loyalty he knew their hearts he knew it wasn't David that had their hearts he knew Jehovah had their hearts amen and God if get a hold of a man amen they'll stay in the [Applause] word they'll stay in that word I'm telling you you won't have to worry about them they'll they'll put themselves in the word powerhouses I have strong feelings about that I'm sorry come on come on I say God give us some powerhouses give us some daddies that'll stand up for this word give us fathers give Us Men give us people now Paul says it in 1 Corinthians 3 and ver9 for now you are labors with God and you are God's husbandry and God's husbandry you are God's Building yeah now according to the grace of God which is given unto me wise master builder I've laid a foundation another builth there on but let every man take heed how he builth there upon that's yes sir for other foundations can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build this Foundation of gold silver precious stones wood hay or stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest well if this is a work that God is using Us in I want you to stand the test I want you to be able to stand the fire when the fire comes I want you to have a word I want you to have an answer for if any man's work abide which he builth thereup he shall receive a war if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer a loss but he himself can be saved so as by fire now know you not that you are the temple of God now this is Paul look what he's saying now folks he's talking about Jehovah he's talking about Jehovah God and then he's talking to individual people and he said know ye not that ye are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you now folks that's heavy stuff now it's written again in 2 Corinthians 6:16 Paul says it again and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God as God have said I will dwell in them I will walk in them I will be their God and they shall be my people as God hath said look where Paul went to he's a builder he's a builder and he knows if he builds wrong he'll lose his work but Paul was not building on I think it could be Paul was not building the church on foundations of well I think if you did this maybe this and and and I no he says as God hath said look at where he's building now I can take you to couple of the scriptures it's not exact but this is what Paul is talking about in Leviticus 26:11 I will set the T tacle among you my soul shall not abore you I will walk among you and I will be your God and ye shall be my people in Jeremiah 31:33 but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saeth the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and right in their hearts and I will be their God and they shall be my people in Ezekiel 37:26 and 27 moreover I will make a covenant of peace with thee them it shall be an Everlasting Covenant and I will place them and multiply them and I will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forever more from my Tabernacle also shall be with them I will be their God and they shall be my people God ha said look at what Paul is saying God has said I'll tell you what God Said more than that in the New Testament can you imagine when Paul learned what Jesus had to say in Matthew 28 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I command to you I am with you always even till the end of the world look at this Paul is now hearing the prophets coming out of Jesus's mouth and he never changes than God has said see what Jesus said God has said I will dwell with you I will walk with you I will be with thee until the end in John 14 and 15 to 23 very powerful scriptures if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father that he shall give you another comforter and that he will abide with you forever some people actually use this scripture to tell there's a difference between Jesus and the Holy Spirit so let's read on even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yes sir I will come to you look those trinitarian fathers when the seals were preached they looked back to the trinitarian teachings and said brother randam you're wrong but if you had it in you to be a pillar in the house of God let the revelation of the doctrine of the Apostles come into your heart I will not only be with you I will be in you God will send the Holy Spirit then Jesus says I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye live also there's your two resurrections brother Bram uses and at that day that's this day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you brother BR said the day when the Revelation is made known right if you in John the 10th chapter they said Jesus tell us who you are and Jesus said unto them I don't do The Works my father doeth The Works that you may see that I am the father and the father in me but now he's added another level and he said I'm the father the father in me and I in you and you in me so he added you after the Redemptive work he could make you the Tabernacle to display the image of God look what he does and my and at that day you shall know he that hath my Commandments keepeth him and he that that his love he loveth me shall be L to my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him and Jes Judas said unto him not as scar it Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself to us and not unto the world and Jesus said unto him if a man love me he will keep my wordss and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode make our dwelling see we will come into him now watch this now in Romans the 8th chapter it's Paul again in the ninth verse but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you see we'll make our Abode with him now Jesus himself said I and the father are one same same scripture and when you see me you see the father it was the word with the spirit of manifestation coming into the church now watch this the spirit of God dwell in you and if any man have not the spirit he is none of them and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now we're not talking about a coming and going we're talking about a dwelling we're talking about an abode he didn't want to visit you he wanted to live in you come on church when you're up he's in you when you're down he's in you when you're sideways he's in you he said I want to make my Abode my dwelling my resting place with you now we're talking about another level all together I'm not talking about Pentecostal Holy Ghost folks I'm not talking about a baptism on the spirit and when your spirit Changes Everything Changes I'm talking about a God that dwells in the soul of [Applause] mankind now I love this scripture I maybe I'm not going to preach on but I got to throw it in here you are of God little children and he that overcometh them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world I just want the devil to hear that greater is he that is in you than the bad day you're had Heaven greater is he that is in you than the cancer that's attacking your body greater is he that's in you than the Temptation amen the burning passion that's upon your life greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world who is the he that's in you it's God inside the church dwelling as he promised as God has said in Psalms 132: 13 David is a David's is a powerful preacher folks for the Lord ha chosen Zion and he has desired it for habitation hey man y'all know brother brandom said when you read Zion he said you're reading about the bride let me let me let me shock you just for a moment you didn't choose you God chose you Gentiles wasn't even invited in the court at this time and David said God is Desiring Zion that's what God wants is Zion and it wasn't just the city of Zion it's the bride Zion I desire it for habitation this is my rest forever the 14th verse this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it now we understand Paul's words in Colossians 1 and 27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of his glory the mystery among the Gentiles Christ in you can I change it the desire of habitation Christ in you the desire of Glory Christ in you the hope of glory this not your hope it's his hope you wasn't saved by your desire you're saved by God's desire come on brother you sent them roses to her brother Mike when you started dating her amen was that you or her was it your desire or hers amen because he picked out somebody he wanted and the desire was there so he dated and he chased until he had possessed that's right are you hearing me he came looking for you amen he tore down the middle wall that was between you and him he he took the laws that provoked the laws that wouldn't let him live in you and he nailed them to the cross and he abolished every law that would forbid him a habitation in the Church of the Living God he abolished it in his death amen The Joy set before [Music] him brother I feel like turning inside out the joy that was before him the joy was you it was tabernacling in you it wasn't just church joining it wasn't just coming together and patting our hands it was god Jehovah God the god of Jacob the god of Moses wanted a resting [Applause] place the place to dwell Christ in you the hope of glory there's a bunch of words we could place there now where we're standing today we can look at the names of Jehovah and there there's seven of them I'm not going to stand here and preach on the seven names but all of them are the names of redemption right but the last name of Jehovah that he revealed was sha am I saying that correctly somebody with Hebrew Jehovah shama Jehovah sha means the Lord is is present yeah yeah okay what good would it do if he was a Healer and he wasn't here he's a savior but he ain't here he's a counselor but he ain't here so sha speaks the Lord is present in Ezekiel 48:35 it was Ezekiel said it was round about 18,000 measures and the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is there my what a name for a city so brother Wayne what are you saying about this bride I'm saying the name of this city is the Lord is there yeah so I I I've never through the years I remember growing up and I I remember it being a real a real tag in the message people would say he's here and everybody shout and as a young preacher I didn't really understand what they were saying but I I got an idea that they were talking about his presence and and and I I had an idea that they were talking about seven seal and third po you know what I mean but to really Encompass what that meant I really couldn't but as we studied through the years it was when the question came to me when somebody HED he's here and then I said but where he's here but where and most of the people shouting he was here was turning back 40 years to a prophet and they were showing you manifestations in a Prophet or they were looking some personality that was Among Us and they were looking up like this the Lord is here and he's using this man and he's using this Prophet amen but here through the study of the message of the hour comes and develops the thought the Lord is here in his holy Temple in his habitation he's home yes yes he's at home the lights are on and Jesus is at home where's his home where his bride is where is he he's in his temples he is here his name is Jehovah Shah the Lord is there can I just can I just show you that you are a city a city in Revelation 21 and verse 2 John said I saw a holy city a New Jerusalem coming from God out of God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband brother B said as a bride because it is the bride he says it very clear Philadelphia Church Age The Bride is the New Jerusalem preacher what are you talking about the old Jerusalem amen it crucified the Lord yeah it was a carinal Jerusalem you the New Jerusalem a city not made with hands how be it the most high dwelleth not in tabern Les made by hands but a body thou Hast prepared me as a bride adorned for her husband in the third verse and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with me with men and he will dwell with them and shall be their people and God himself shall be with them he is their God so when you read of the New Jerusalem and you read of her 12 gates her Apostles and you read of the tribes of Israel and you read about the street and the cities when you get down to it he said but there was no need of a light in this city because the lamb is the light of this city you heard brother Bram teach it strongly he said we've had Campbell light and we've had Luther light and we've had this light we've had this light that's brandom light he said but what we need is Christ Light now I I I I know you people people are well taught so I'm I'm not digging up any bones but if somebody's on the side of this let me just give you a scripture John said I was a light for a season he was a light for a season but when the True Light Came William Brandon was a light for a season but William brandom wasn't the message he's the messenger God help us this morning brother brandom ain't going to live in you but the one he introduced is still here he's still in the midst of the Church the Vindicated word is still in the people hallelujah he's the light of the city it can be said of that City the Lord is there Hallelujah there's a place to point to on the Earth today the Lord is there he is there in that City he is there in that life he's in that life he's in that life he's in that how do you see him I see the light of it I see the light of that City you said preacher you're going off on the rails no a city is a habitation yeah people live in a city this is a holy city it is a holy habitation it's where God and His angels and the spirit of God dwells in that City you want to find God is not in lay out of sea no more folks I am not allowed to see it amen I am a member of the Bride of the New Jerusalem Church that has come down in this age we have been taken back by the word to the first day again Hallelujah huj come on I show you Seven Cities natural on Earth but those cities represented spirits that were in people and they were called philadelphians and leans and Ephesians and they were called sardans amen but we are not Le toia 40y old Moses said I refuse to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter and I refuse to be called cold and blind and riched and miserable and naked for God ha brought me out to the rising of the Sun and now the Lord dwells there it's a four squared City brother Guthrie it's built on the foundations of Apostles and Prophets and brought up into a holy habitation of almighty God if you don't believe it in Revelation 17 the Bible speaks of mystery Babylon and it says she has become the habitation of every unclean and hateful bird mystery Babylon is a habitation of devils the New Jerusalem the mystery New Jerusalem is a habitation of God the Lord is there and I could look and see in denomination I tell you the Lord ain't there he doesn't dwell in it he doesn't live in it it's the habitation of unclean and hateful Birds what is it now God has given to this age as prophecy in Isaiah 59 he said so they that fear the name from the West the glory the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against it when the enemy comes we've seen it but what God is going to do that's the question the enemy's come we've seen all that but what is God doing the Redeemer shall come to Zion the Redeemer shall appear he shall come to Zion in Psalms 2:6 David said yet have I set my king upon my Holy Hill of Zion these are these are these are powerful scriptures 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse4 to coming un the living Stone this allowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious these are Lively Stones built up to a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded and unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed is made the head of the corner isn't that something we've seen the Cornerstone become the Capstone we have seen the alpha become the Omega and I in Malachi chapter 3 it's been very one of my vvor favorite lately just it's one of those lately Scriptures it it's been it's really stuck out to me behold I send my messenger who shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple Lord that you're seeking is going to come to his Temple he's going to come to his Temple for it's written in Isaiah 2 and3 for out of Zion shall go the law of God so preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about God coming to his own Throne have you asked yourself why in Psalms and in Hebrews both Paul asked the question what is a man that God is mindful of him why is it that Psalms that David ask what is a man that thou art mind for him why are you mindful of a man God why not just let him go his own route why not just throw him away when they get to a certain place and let's just cast them why are you mindful of this man yeah wouldn't it be something if you looked at your own life and You' seen the situations you seen God pick you up and bring you back and pick you up and bring you back and you seen work and work and work and work after a while you turn around and say God why are you so mindful of me isn't this something brother Isaac you're not an afterthought of God and God is Not absent minded so if he ever had the first thought of you he still got the same thought he thought of you and there's nobody can change his thought nobody can alter his thought so if he thought of you as bride in the end you're going to be bride and that is why God is mindful of a man because man is God's habitation because man is the Throne of almighty God your heart is the seed of Mercy in the last day I got hundreds of quotes I won't be able to take them but I'll say this your heart is the heart is the throne where God lives that's why he is mindful to his church that's why he allows the battles but he never quits brother right because God because God's Throne is a human heart Unity One God 1958 God's heart human heart is God's Throne God wants to set on your heart's Throne so brother wayang where we come where are we at in this age I'll tell you we've come to Zion we're not at the mount thei we have come to Zion where we have come to the Bride of Jesus Christ you said preacher how far has it come I'll tell you how far it's come Elohim is back in the bride Elohim now resides in The Bride of Jesus thing see God is becoming tangible in his own church it's a promise let me give it to you the same Jesus in Bride form same power same church same word Christ The Mystery of God revealed took from Colossians 1:27 brother man said justified in his sight we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in the last day with the Glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose we are proof of his victory when we see him coming down and living among the church when we see him coming down and living among the church you know you know good and well how many times you heard brother Braham say it's not me I don't know your thought I don't know you I don't know where you're from I don't know your room number I don't know your house number I don't know your name I don't know that but there's one here that does remember then he would switch and say your house number is so and so your name is so and so and when you were a little kid this happened that happened what was he doing he was showing you the presence of God now he was dividing he was dividing the humanity from The God Who Lived in humanity a son of man revealing thee son son of man in Revelations 10 out of Heaven come another Mighty angel watching he has a book open in his hands what's this open book in his hands now watch when the enemy comes like a flood let's go to that scripture the spirit of God will raise a standard now what's the standard what brother say it was he said the word would become flesh Isaiah said the Redeemer would come into Zion the word would come in the only thing that can defeat Satan is the word so the word would come into the church now now there's a real meaning to this because the word is going to come into the church that's what we're looking for amen there's actually a there's actually a quote here where brother random says it will be the spirit spoken word in the unveiling of God brother Ram speaks it like this and he says watch he said God had to get behind a human Veil to speak natural words to be placed behind a natural Veil and then Moses was Moses again but between that time Moses had to Veil his face because he became God to the people because he was speaking the words of God now when those words were compiled into the into the book you know what they done with that book that word that was spoken by that Prophet They Carried that book now to me it's very powerful They Carried that book out see because you had the you have the outer courts right so They Carried that word through that but it didn't stay there there was no place for it so they carried it through there but they didn't stop at the Brazen altar yeah or the Laver he didn't even stop when you got into the holy place where the seven candlesticks were there was no place for the word to sit there was no resting place there was no furniture built for it there but it was in that third place now I've always loved how brother brandom takes it and breaks it justification sanctification Holy Ghost right yeah so brother so somebody said well brother Wayne then there's three and then watch what brother B says justification made way for sanctification and sanctification made way for the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself and let me put to brother bram's other words the word itself so in the third part back there in the Holy place in the third step that's where the word was yeah right because it was a a body it was a spirit and it was a soul so the word would never rest In the Flesh realm the word can never rest In the Flesh realm there's too many battles out there folks somebody somebody asked me the other day they said brother Wayne how is it that a person could believe the message and then get get LED away or how could they start uh uh maybe even uh considering ideas that brother Bram could been wrong or something I said because they're living in the wrong place because if you're trying to discuss this message with an unbeliever you've went to the outer courts and you're out there among all the unbelief and you're out there among the doubts and somebody said well preacher amen but it's if it's the word of God it ought to hold out there you you watch your tip now because the bread fell in their six days a week and the word said don't you try to hold this over for tomorrow because if you do it will rot on you the word of today will rot yet tomorrow if you hold it in a certain atmosphere and when you try to entertain an unbeliever and discuss brother bram's message as if it's a reasoning power you are in a place this message will turn to dust on you overnight because you're in a reasoning Channel you said preacher if it was God's word eve went to the channel of reasoning in the the Garden of Eden and God himself was her pastor don't go out to that realm and discuss this message with that devil if he wants to talk about it you tell him come on in here with [Applause] me said preacher what do you mean because if he comes with me he's going to have to get the Holy Ghost and if you ever get the Holy Ghost you'll amen every word of it I won't have to convince you of it I won't have to beg you into it if you ever get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost sent this [Applause] word but see what it was amen I I I I think it's a powerful thought if you just take it to brother bram's own Ministry and you take it to the first pull second pull third pull that's exactly the setup right that's exactly what brother Brandon was showing you three pulls he was showing you he preached it in a message inter Veil when he talked about the Third pull and he said the fire went over that little room remember it's an inter Veil yeah and Watch What Happens brother bandam held the hands of a lot of people folks but the word never rested there he held hands with a lot of people told them their sicknesses told them what God was doing he tried to call them out but the word never went no further than that now I've talked to them it was people set by the Groves and heard the second pool when brother Bram stood there under messiah's sign and discerned the heart of man and proved that it was the resurrection sign of Jesus Christ himself proved it without a shadow of a doubt we was down in uh Gatlinburg here it's been several years back we were with a group of of friends family we were at a at a ice rink and and uh there was a lady sitting up there and to our standard she wouldn't have appeared to been a Christian uh but she was sitting there and she seen everybody sitting around there in their skirts and long hair and you know and and she looked over at my wife and she says what do y'all believe and Carissa answered her and she said well we follow the message of William brandom and cuz she knew we the conversation would go you're Christian yeah well what do y'all believe so she just cut the chase she said well she said we believe the message of brother brandom and the lady said oh I was in his meetings she said I was back there years ago I believe it was in Mississippi it and it was her it was yeah it was in Mississippi and she was healed of throat cancer in them meetings she said my son actually is a Full Gospel preacher because of the belief of that she said I was with brother random in Oregon when the maniac was put down before him she said I was in those meetings as well but you know what I could look at her one time and tell you that she never went no further than that amen and and the anointing was so real and she was so CAU up in it and it was so great and it was so wonderful but it was just in the spirit realm but the Bible said the word of God discerns between the spirit and the soul of a man this message was the first time I ever heard anybody say you can have it in your spirit but not your soul you can have the Holy Ghost every day of your life brother bam said and go to hell how could it happen brother Wayne because it only got in your spirit cuz it only went in the spirit because you had some reason you couldn't let it get in the soul listen folks there's one curtain between the holy place and the holies of holies that curtain the prophet said was self-will he said it's self-will and if you're going to let the word come in amen you can serve God and man at the same time you can't serve denomination and God at the same time come on the third angel of Revelations 14 come and said you can't worship the mark of the beast and serve God too so it's self- will you got to make up your mind what is it for me what am I going to believe I'm going to believe this man or am I going to believe the message am I going to believe this church or am I going to believe the message am I going to stay with the Baptist or the Lutheran or the pope or who am I going to go to listen the word of God is in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and Jesus was the Tabernacle of almighty God amen now it never got further than that and the Pentecostal World why did Pentecost fail I'll tell you why they failed cuz they never went further than that but oh there's further to go that prophet's words had to be carried past oh God can you imagine when they come to the to where the furniture was built can you imagine the moment that they could set the word down and it knew that's where it belongs they did it when they went the holy place in the Tabernacle in the wilderness they put the word in his place in Solomon's Temple it put the word in his place when Jesus was there on Calvary the word was in his place and this morning God has sent a message to you and I to Usher the word into our soul realm that it would magnify this message in this hour in your life listen we don't have to come here this morning on a on a on on on the kind of experience amen that we're up one day and we're lost the next listen amen you you don't realize the terror of that the preacher why you have all these alter calls for these young people and why y'all have all these youth events and all this I'll tell you why we have it because I would I would absolutely be terrorized to think that these young people have not had an experience with that word to get further than their feelings further than their emotions if they stop in that emotional realm then they're saved they're lost they're saved they're lost they're saved they're lost they're saved they're lost oh but if they ever let the word the word richly come into that soul you can let them face all of hell and they'll say I know who I have believed I know God God is in my soul this morning the word abideth with you I will make my Abode in you I tell you when that word makes it into the soul of a young person the devil's finished right there fashion is finished right there unbelief is finished right there if you want to help mankind get this message in their hearts come on folks that's why that's why our ministers are out preaching this morning that's why we're spending $2 or $3,000 a month in translations overseas that's why people are giving amen offerings to buy uh uh Buy tablets one brother up to $10,000 just to buy tablets for hubs for for men of God to read you know why because this message is more than the mind of a man it's more than just a bunch of ideas it's more it's more than opinions of William brandom it is the word of the age it's the opening of The Seven Seals and it needs a resting place I say God help us to build a church that this message can rest in their souls but a body thou Hast prepared me amen when you get born again and filled with the Holy Ghost the energy of God open your life up the let deity God Tabernacle himself in you testimony of a true witness let the Holy Spirit bring into your hearts now these things don't count it's tabernacling deity in our heart that's what counts the Holy Ghost is tabernacling deity Therefore your bodies are the Temple of his Dynamics is amazing is it amazing that God has brought a message that wouldn't fit and lay out a see can you imagine can you imagine carrying a message in congregation after congregation how many message churches was there when brother brand left he said I only got one door per green had Tucson and brother Brown preached the message what house will you build me this message didn't have a home it didn't have message pull pits it didn't have men of God that are sold out to preaching it it didn't have it folks but God knew it was coming he knew men was coming he knew that this message would be preached he knew this message would be believed I'm I'm not saying there wasn't any believers back then of course there was 98% of them was following William brandom and very few of them went beyond his person now when I put Honor on our elders I do it because they respect it they earned it when I say something about Ray Ericson look folks this man was back there in that dispensation but he's not there now he made the corner brother bisc made the corner brother meno made the corner these men of God helped establish a place to put this message now you can see it when Samuel goes to anoint a king remember he tried all the heads of them Sons but there was no place for the anointing to go on but there was one more it was that last son of Jesse it was David and there he could place the anointing he could pour the word out and so is it in this age this message didn't have a place but God has put you together that the message might have a place think of this that it might be able to have you say well well brother Wayne what how how do you how do you how do you how do you view this I I was just I was just studying over it I was thinking about this and I I I I want to I just say this somebody was asking me about this picture the other day and uh it's funny if our musicians could come somebody asked me about the picture the other day and they said brother Wayne what about that picture I said well you know what why are you only asking me about the one pitcher cuz we got more than one you remember there's that one brother B standing in front of that old door and that pillar of lights over his shoulder where's it at Dallas Texas is in Dallas and then he's another place remember that pillar fire is over his head and then they went over to uh Germany and they set the cameras up to catch it they said we've heard we've heard that that you got a picture of this and we would like to catch it with our German cameras and brother Bram allowed them to set up the cameras and it's in the is it footprints on the sands of time is that where those pictures are somebody it's footprint SS of time when you you get that booklet and in there are the pictures brother Bram tells them the anointing is coming in now and they start taking pictures speed camera pictures and they catch this light coming in the room and it's at a it's at a Full Gospel businessman breakfast and that light comes in see because the word that same word he had preached in Dallas Texas he's now preaching over there in Germany when you you get all of those uh all those testimonies from South Africa and he'll talk about the angel of the Lord being there and it's even one place there it's amazing cuz even that one you there was this guy I forget his um my goodness my memory uh he was a 7eventh day Adventist I believe it was and he went to Brother bram's meetings there to and he went to tell his buddy you remember and he said told him about that angel and how brother Bram was Discerning people's hearts and the guy he just totally didn't believe him and and the fell left the room and went outside and knelt down out back and started praying for his friend so he wouldn't get in trouble with God and something walked up and put its hand on his back oh yeah it was that same Angel right and it burned a handprint in his in his back on his shirt they took that shirt to brother bandam he said tell them bring it here it'll fit my left hand and brother man lays his hand over and it fits it perfectly see it wasn't in Jeffersonville it wasn't in Tucson come on church it's not in Rome this Tabernacle is built wherever God's children are the message of the hour is a company come on friends this Angel is the Angel of the Covenant and wherever this message is there's that angel now I'm going to tell you this morning if this message is in your soul realm that angel is protecting that message wherever it goes you say I tell you you said brother Wayne I want that angel to walk with me like he does with other brothers I want the angel with me I tell you what you do you take this message and hide it in your heart and you watch and see if the same angel of God that preached the message is the same angel of God that'll stand with you in your trials this word is real folks this is true we don't want it in our we don't let let me be clear just in our flesh Realms we don't want it just in our spirit real we want to go back there behind them curtains yes Lord whe soundproof I always wondered what that meant and you know there had to be some Supernatural involved brother Eric CU it was just goat skin right or or it was just uh Badger skins animal skins made a tent brother Bram said it was a soundproof room he said the way it was when you was in there you couldn't hear the outside he said but they could hear the bails out there and he said that one place they said they even tied rope around them I don't know how I don't know how real that was but they said they tied a rope around them and if they ever heard the bells stop ringing they had to drag them out cuz they had died in there CU they wasn't allowed to go in there it was a soundproof room so I was listening this morning on tape I had it was the first see that noise cancelling God's always way ahead everybody and I had on my noise cancelling headphones this morning I'm listening to a sermon man it's blasting away and and my wife's just talking and we get out she said well I told you the kids had to leave a little bit for the Sunday school and I'm laughing cuz I never heard a word of it and she was just talking we were all right there in the same room and everything and I wasn't ignoring her I literally just couldn't hear her because I had noise canceling the headphones in and I was listening to the word listen amen you can get to a place in your life right well you can't hear what the devil's saying you can't hear what the what the critics are saying about this message you get into that Holy place somebody somebody I told somebody that one time they said brother Wayne you people just stick your head in the S you don't even look at brother bram's faults I said it's not the S brother it's called the inner Veil and I put myself in that inner Veil and I got no time for the nonsense I got no time for the arguments amen I know it's God I know it's his word and it's coming to my soul you said preacher why are you saying that I'm saying if you make that devil go with [Music] you we had a little old dog around the house there Dixie y'all remember some of you remember coming over she was a rambunctious little fella she didn't like nothing better than tug of war that
