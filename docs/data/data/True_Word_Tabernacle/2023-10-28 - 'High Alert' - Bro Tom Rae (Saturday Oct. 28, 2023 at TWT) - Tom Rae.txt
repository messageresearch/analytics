certainly glad to have him with us and he's been a great uh great encouragement to us and we love him uh him and Sister Irene for taking their time amen and um so take our love back to all the saints there and amen we we certainly love them the church there brother Dwayne and the families and we got a lot of good memories there sitting around the table and y'all wouldn't believe it but we drink coffee and talk that's uh what we do and talk about the word and amen I I I certainly appreciate uh these men of God you know uh I was just listening today uh this afternoon I was listening brother brandom he's talking about from that time and uh he got to talking about Moses and he'd got down on the back side of the desert and brother Bram said Moses had lost his burden for the word yeah and I just I just listened for a moment CU I thought wasn't that something here he is a Prophet but brother Braham said he got back there and you know he got offended over and he took off and went it back in the back side of the desert he said he he had lost and forgot about he he' forgot the promise and he said he had lost the burden of the word forgot all about the promise he said but one day he stepped in front of a burning bush and he said God begin to speak out of that bush I have remembered my promise and brother Bram said Moses wasn't interested but God was still interested he he said God hadn't lost his burden for his people he said he remembered his promise to the children so he said out of that fire I have come down to deliver these people I have heard their cry now friend we know in this age that we're living over there in John 6 Jesus said I'm the bread of life that come down out of heaven now no man seen Jesus come out of the heavens but it was the words of Isaiah and it was the words of Malachi that was being fulfilled in that for fulfillment of the word was the bread and that same language is used in Revelations 10 when it says a mighty Angel shall descend out of heaven and that Mighty Angel brother Bram said was a covenant Angel he's a covenant Angel to that word and God was so interested in us in this last day to send the message now according to Romans the 8th chapter the whole creation yeah this message would set the whole creation back in order yeah the whole creation will come under this word it'll set it back in a millennial order it'll set sons of God where they are to be put the devil where he are to be so if it's going to do that in the Millennium what would the word of life you're going to hear tonight do for your homes and your families if this will cause a millennium and a new Heaven and a new Earth you could have a new life tonight you could go home with a new family tonight you can go home with a new a family a new marriage a new finances God has come and he's interested tonight and you're interested you're here and God was so loving the S brother Tom all the way from Cloverdale he's got a lovely congregation a lot of

I got I got told by a pastor down in Virginia area he says we don't call each other friends down here he says you're more than a friend I said who what's more than a friend is we're buddies I said oh is that new terminology uh so us Canadians had to learn to say well these are my best buddies Amen brother menow God bless you really have a hard time sometimes I've known brother Mano since I 21 years old and you want to know how old I am too don't you just round in 70 just round in 70 but I had the privilege to have brother meno in my home as a a single man he impacted my life and always has though our paths cross in various times in our lives it's always meant something to me brother men thank you Pastor Lawson and how do I say senior pastor Ericson I we have the same problem it's a good problem uh I love you so much and I love the Church of God here and brother Jonathan friendship growing and different ones you've been you've all held special place in my life when we pray for you I I remember faces where you sit sometimes you mix it up on me when I come and you're supposed to be sitting here but that's all right that's all right I I just deem it a great honor to be with God's bride around on the world and Sister Irene you've been also a light shining light to my wife and to us held torch been a mother been a helpmate to a pastor you've been tremendous to us amen chissa where are you we we're just she's just amazing I mean when we get together we just have a wonderful time don't we brother with our our our wives and what's Heaven going to be like really I mean we get a taste of it here and a little bit of it here and we just oh Lord draw us closer pull us higher move us Lord into that great realm where you dwell and uh I I deem it again I want to bring greetings from my church in Cloverdale all the loved ones and different ones that would love to have been here here but I've got a A friend of mine brother Ken ardal he he says um I'm either going to have to quit business or fly because they've been traveling quite a bit they would have loved to have been here with us and so if they're streaming God bless you brother Ken sister Linda brother Ed sister Ruth God bless you and it's always nice to be traveling with my wife Joanne and God bless johie she has to put up with me all these years and you know you hate I don't know about you but when you hear your own voice you hate it and I I hate mine I think my poor wife has put up with this for over 47 years she's going to get a double crown when she gets over there but there is one voice here I love and his brother menos yeah that's right yeah you thought I of course we love the voice of the bridegroom but brother menow has that reson resonating sound yeah you're right brother that when he things that just melts you and um I didn't actually know and I'm I'm just getting all my butterflies all lined up here but the top of my note here is mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord and I thought how am I going to start this service with that song and to think that the Holy Spirit you Lord would have a man of God come up and sing mine eyes have seen the glory that means more to us than when they wrote that song because because the glory of God is the opinion of God and God's opinion is his word and his word has been unveiled mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord we are in the coming of the Lord Saints and we are closer now than we've ever been in our whole entire lives there's trouble in the East again and the whole world shaking and now it is a time for us to maybe prod ourselves just a bit and if the Lord would just help me tonight I'd just like to do a little prodding not not intentionally trying to hurt anybody but but I'm going to provoke you in love to press the kingdom like you've never pressed it before and I I I I believe that the holy spirit is present and I'm just so happy to see you sister Haley and brother Ryan God bless you amen comeing all they're they're from our assembly I don't know how this all works but assemblies win and lose but God bless you both and thank you again for putting up with me and brother Wayne thank you for the kind invitation can we stand to our feet please can we turn to Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes chapter 3 very very very familiar scripture Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 and verse two Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 and verse two scripture reads to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die time to plant and the time to pluck up that which is planted so before we we just start preaching for every SE time there is a season every season there's a space of time in that time God's allotted certain events to take place and so we'll be just looking a little bit at time maybe at a a different uh way this evening so if you would pull on the word and all by the grace of God try and preach the word and and and we'll have a a time in his presence so let's bow our heads heavenly father I bow my head yes to give you thanks thank you Lord we love you with a great love these are the Blood Bought of God that are standing here Lord we would want to encourage one another in the faith move us into higher objectives deeper depths as your prophet said in the word Lord and father God we just pray that the Holy Spirit now will come behind the word and speak to every life from the youngest to the oldest we ask it in Jesus name amen amen you may have your seats praise the Lord I like to if I was going to have a little title I spoke a subject and I'm not going to speak on it as such this evening but just before I left home on high alert high alert but that that will be that'll be a subject maybe we'll touch on uh tomorrow but it it it's more or less letting each and every one of us know that I believe as we're sitting here and now preparing to delve into the word that it's different than it was last Sunday it's different than it was even last Wednesday and you know we we can so um categorize Time by being a time at service or a time that we're just going to set aside for certain events and and and we get in our in our minds and in that time frame that certain things are going to happen but a lot of times when God has something in his mind in time because he's Timeless many people Miss what God has in that time and to me that's that's dangerous because you've heard the prophet say you've had your pastor preach and you've been well aware that this could actually be the last service and that's more than just a saying now that could be very very true so if there's somebody in this service that is not right with God you can be right with God right now because we get into our minds Catholicism we get in our minds we got to do a certain thing to make things right you say well I got to kneel at my bench or I got to come to the front or I got to do something Saints when people were coming by that prophet he just said you need to be saved do you want to be saved sir he said yes sir he said then you're saved I thought my and and we go through certain events because we say it has to happen a certain way well then we miss something in time and we don't want to miss nothing that God is doing so time evolves and in time let's just say since the Garden of Eden time has moved on sin came in time started in the beginning time okay are you with me yes sir so time moved along and and man fell Adam fell uh e fell they fell in the garden but God wasn't going to leave them that way right he was going to have Redemption but in that time we never they never thought how would you have dreamt Redemption was going to come the way that it came oh yeah right I unless God sent a prophet and prophecies were now written in the word and even though they be written in the word people were missing it so you say well it was in the Bible but you could have said well I read that Bible but I never saw it melai 4 was in that Bible and we'll just leap we'll go right over you can go right over to Malachi 4 people it's laying in the Bible and how many billions of people have missed Malachi 4 and Malachi 4 is come and gone but we say yeah praise the lord we saw Malachi 4 but Malachi 4 wasn't pointing you to him Malachi 4 was pointing you to him so in this time Hallelujah he's the one that's been elevated through the message and so now time now God's got you on his mind is that true he's got you on his mind and he's got Rapture on his mind he's got you on his mind and he want to get you there but in this space of time from now to rapture we want to be very sensitive to what the holy spirit is doing in time amen so we can say time and I just looked up the different titles of times that the prophet used he used time quite a bit he had Junction of time time is at hand time tested memorials signs of the times time tested Faith time of decision from that time beyond the curtain of time end time seed sign end time evangelist he used time and yet a prophet was piercing in from time to Eternity trying to bring a people from time to Eternity but we are somehow still caught in time and yet brother BR says we're Eternal beings that's right so now we want to be changed from time to Eternity all right so there's certain events that take place that are are are memorable that are Memorial uh they they just stay in our minds or they've been locked in it um I I I I I remember when I was I in grade three and in grade three you said grade three Alpha how old were you for the time well that's for you to figure out I was old I was young once yeah and now what do you mean yeah of course I was and I come home and my mom was making my lunch and and she was crying and I thought what's going on I'm I you know you're in grade three and you find out that President Kennedy was shot so there's certain events that happen they say that you will always always remember that moment of time and so certain events you say well brother Tom when did you get saved I got saved in February 1975 there's a very pointed time where God saved my soul and so there's events let's take Pearl Harbor Pearl Harbor is an event it started the German invasion of Poland was 1939 and America never entered the war until Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese and 3,000 Sailors were killed war was being waged for two years and three months before America was forced into war they say that and brother Brenham makes mention of pearl Pearl Harbor they were unprepared in that time yes their security or they felt secure in their time right they had the biggest boats they had the biggest guns they had the big but the enemy I I just want you to start now getting start coming now into where we're going to go the enemy is always ready to destroy you but God has sent his word so that you can destroy the enemy this is not playing church this is where the Bride Comes to her position that's right and she stands on thus sayith the Lord not words but action action where you can say in your life and look and see the hand of God moving in time absolutely they were unprepared they said when when the Hamas came into Israel they said how did the mostad which is their intelligence arm how did they miss the invasion and and they've had they had the intelligence come on Stay With Me you can have all the intelligence you want but if you are not on high alert I don't care if you're a mother a grandmother a s a sister a young lady a young man an older man there is a time in your life you must always stay in high alert because there's a Punch Coming there's a Punch coming on now there's a punch coming and there's a Rapture to make and there's a tribulation to [Music] leave they were unprepared and in one week they went from a nation of peace to a nation fighting for survival within the last eight or so days Israel was holding their own but now they are fighting for their existence and World opinion now you just watch now World opinion was on their side but those how can they say the enemy has got their propaganda machine working the people's minds and you watch popular opinion as time will go on their popular opinion will be against Israel but I just don't want you to leave in natural Israel I want you to start thinking spiritual Israel because your Prophet said in Feast of the trumpets 200,000,000 Supernatural demons have been loosed on a people those are extra Demons by the way but your Prophet said you could put every demon under your foot that is not a slogan that is not just something to repeat that is when you go out these doors and the enemy comes like a flood you are God's standard I'm not looking for tomorrow to be the Super church I'm telling you right now I am the super church hallu so are you so are you we have withstood everything brother men we have withstood everything brother Ericson brother Wayne we have withstood everything and anything Satan has tried to throw at us they've come underground and they have maliciously tried to take your children well Israel it natural is going into a land to get their people then what should we be doing what should you be doing going after your children [Applause] Hallelujah you say it's impossible are you limiting God are you limiting God all things are possible only believe Hallelujah so they went from a peaceful nation in a moment in time in a moment in time we lose one of of our Warriors in a moment of time brother Billy Paul in a moment of time we can be taken in a moment of time just in a moment of time can I say I had it written down and the brothers were saying the other day and I go well I'm not even going to enter this conversation because they're going to take everything that I thought I was going to preach and ruin me they said do you think that this is the start of World War I that's why I got written down here it started the Winds of War May blow in different directions but sooner or later it's coming to America sooner or later it's coming to America but there is a promise to an El elected lady and that's where you want to stand tonight I've got a promise before one bomb Falls come on stay with me I am gone I got the quote mark of the beast brother Bram said Ro Russia was raised up for one purpose come on you st in the message brother Ram said in mark of the beast Russia was raised up for a purpose to drop the bomb on the Vatican sir sir what does he say in the church a book watch Russia watch Russia the pope my goodness really the pope stands before the people and stands with the Palestinians okay listen I want you to remember something I did a I haven't even preached this at home yet so I want to get there in World War II Rome was used to take the Nazis from Germany to South America they were the ones that supplied the passports the ID cards it was all through the Vatican they sided with the Nazis they didn't think Russia and the Allies were going to win we see inside the enemy's t through a prophet's Eyes Lord there's no question whether the bride's going to win or lose you are the winners in fact the prophet said rising and the sun you have already won you have already won Hallelujah but in time time moves on we've gone from as we Prophet often said in the countdown from the horse and buggy age to the model T4 to the to the supercars that we have today to the jet airplane to the Jet Plane to the astronaut age we've gone all through the that progression of time we've gone from the Hubble space satellite that shoots pictures into space to the web that's looking Beyond universes they never even dreamt that there was he's a creator right the attribute of God is Creator he can't stop creating they're looking into universes they didn't even know were there and stars and galaxies what the thrill of my soul is your Bible says and my Bible says that God knows every Star by name oh here's a good statistic for you you yeah how many how many have gone to a beach before you [Music] know like is it a sin to go to a beach I don't know right we've gone to a beach how many how many have seen a grain a sand okay you seeing a grain of sand and you put that grain and you let that fall through you go man that's a lot of grains of sand well there's a lot of beaches in North America there's a lot of deserts in the Mojave Desert there's a lot of sand there's a in Arabia and in in Africa there's a lot of sand in in Mongolia there's a huge desert do you realize that they say there's more stars than there are grains of sand on the planet Earth that's just a statistic and he knows everyone by name what a mighty God we serve Angels bow before him Heaven and Earth adors him and we limit him some way Brother come on how do we limit this unlimited God so as we see in time there's a process in time and and and and and prophecies are laying there uh can you turn to Ezekiel 37 please Ezekiel 37:1 and the Hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of a valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest again and he said unto me prophesy unto these bones and say unto them oh Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and many people have have preached on valley of dry bones and brother bar makes reference to it in restoration of the brid tree but in recognizing your day in this message brother Braham said Hosea said in 61 return to the Lord remember he said that they would be scattered they will return they were torn they were blinded that's exactly what happened he will heal us and he will bind us like Ezekiel 37 Dry Bones the valley of dry bones Ezekiel Saw their return again Israel's return was coming through a prophet prophecy and so there was nothing that was going to stop the word of God to be fulfilled it was laying in scripture in time and we've taken it of course for the bride and you can take it of course you can see the parallel but I'd like to get into the parallel because remember just remember when Naomi and Ruth got Boaz it was church natural Church spiritual it was Jew and Gentile and Rose got Boaz amen and Boaz redeemed Naomi amen what day are we living in that's why the prophet said recognizing your day and his message it was God that brought the Jews back amen amen remember the prophet said in 1946 that was when they first raised the flag of the Israel flag in 1948 that was when the United Nations recognized Israel become a nation but he says the day that they raised the flag was the day come on the day that the angel of the Lord visited me because Naomi was coming back and Ruth is coming back and I don't care how dry you are let the Breath of God breathe on you Hallelujah parallel yeah and that's why I love the flag of Israel two blue lines one star of David Naomi and Ruth wow that's just me you don't have to think I just like that I look at that why are they got a parallel because it has always been parallel my not eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord and the Lord himself shall descend with a shout and the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and the last trumpet to Israel is the seventh seal come on Roose sir how close are we come on how close are we we don't want to play church we got this set up here and this set up there say we're Beyond playing church it's pulling on the word pulling on the men of God pulling on thus sayith the word hallelujah what an hour we're living in Bible said when go in Revelation 81 when he opened up the seven seal there was silence in heaven but in that silence the trumpets were gonna sound the trumpets were to Israel and brother Brown wanted to preach on the seven trumpets and he said I spoke them supernaturally under the six seal and then he said the seventh trumpet to Israel is the seventh seal to the Bride of Jesus Christ which is his coming so now we're looking at 1946 when the way flag was waste 1948 when the United Nations established here we are in 2023 75 years down the road but what did it take to drive Jews out of the United States of America mommies took babies daddies took children come on that was in your newspapers they said if my mom and dad and my brothers are fighting for their existence oh man I want to preach now if they could leave America to go to war come on Brother come on I I'm getting really serious I'm getting down to your address now brothers and sisters M left their comfortable life to go to Israel and fight the enemy if Israel natural can do it come on I want to see a church in Ohio that raised to their feet and say I will fight the devil to the nail Hallelujah I don't care if I get a new car I don't care if I get a new house I don't care if I get anything but I'll fight that devil hallelujah hallu praise the Lord you with me still see this is not for lukewarm message believing people I'm sorry friends they might not ever invite me back here and that's okay I'm going to be what I am what I was 20 21 I was fervent then I'm fervent now people don't want to amen that's fine I will be your Amen Corner people don't want to raise their hand I will raise my hand people want shout amen I'll shout amen I'll glorify God when I'm in heaven what I am here I am over [Applause] there Hallelujah I'm not hiding behind somebody's head because the preacher's going to look at you no sir I want to look at you and I want you to look at me yeah amen we're in a battle and war w War's already told remember I don't know if I ever told you this years ago might had a Michael might be my son might I believe is coming right he's coming for young people my son but he had a he had a unique characteristic when he was growing up he would always read the end of the book we'd go to the library Sam would bring a stack of books Michael bring a stack of books and my son Joel would bring a stack of books his were all pictures and the other ones were all writing but that's okay Joel understands what I know if he hears [Music] me but Michael would always read the end of the book I said why are you reading the end of the book he says I want to know how it turns out I've already read the end of end of the book amen my favorite chapter in the Bible come on Saints the New Jerusalem is descending once again glory be to Jesus let the Hallelujah roll praise the Lord you know ra anybody know what general Romo was he he was he was a military man for the German Army he was in uh in the desert in in Africa right and who was the who was the General that was fighting him Patton yeah mhm but General General raml had already written the books of strategic movements if the enemy does this then I will do that and if the enemy does this I'm going to do that and so Patton he started to see the pattern and he opened up the hatch of his tank you know what he showed it raml I read your book come on now Hallelujah I read the book and because you read the book you defeat the Devil every time hallelujah hallelujah poor raml never had a chance man but you say well what was that all about that's for you to know I've read the end of the book M I want to know how I turn out I turn out quite well as I actually I go a I go to a city who's 15 100 miles high actually I'm in in that City and my streets are pure gold how hey that's pretty good end of the book isn't it and the devil we also know what happens to him so I think he started I think you should be talking to somebody in the next couple days and the next time to come just say devil I've read the book I read the book and I know where you're going and I know where your imps are going and I know where sickness is going amen so let me tell you something Satan I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ because I've been given power to bind can I read the book power to bind and power to loose those are listen says listen I might use these phrases of the message but they're not phrases those are announcements not William Brandon I want you to know this now it was God speaking through the man and it was God telling you you got the devil under your feet if you got an unsaved daughter mothers you can stand under your feet right now and go stomp stomp stomp I claim my daughter I claim my [Applause] son yeah put some action to your faith works is indeed Faith expressed amen am I okay are we still okay all right so we understand now by reading the scripture and sister ericon I want you healed so bad the word of God declares you're healed by his stripes you're healed that back pain shoulder pain I don't care what pain people say are you some sort of an evangelist type of preacher if if evangelism is preaching what the prophet said then I'm an evangelist well if you slow down and talk like a teacher are you a teacher well if that's the way the prophet said it I'm a teacher what's this arguing you got this and I got that Saints brother Brenham didn't make his message yeah p evangelist he said there's gifts in there and he describes the gifts sir that's nothing wrong with that at all but it's not for us to categorize that's good amen so now here where are we the trumpets are sounding and the last trumpet now we let let's just slow down a bit Tom all right 1946 so we understand then the trumpet sounded supernaturally under the six seal and so then we got the Feast of Passover we have the Feast of unleavened bread we have the Feast of first fruits we have the Feast of Pentecost those are all broken down as trumpets sounding okay and he said the Pentecostal Feast is for 50 years or or 50 days typing seven Church ages all right so at the end of the seven Church age will be the next Trump that's right which is the Trump of what that gathers Israel to their land that's right so in their land they can now come to the Feast of what atonement and in atonement is where Jesus reveals himself to his 144,000 thousand oh my goodness so there's Israel now coming back to their land driven back through Hitler and Stalin World War II and World War I driving them back to Israel and God again in his tender hand of Mercy is driving them back to Israel amazing times we're living in because remember if you start to do all your math and I I I can't imagine their files because I know what my kind of files I've got brother Tom my timeline CHS in 1982 at such and such a time as when we're leaving in the Rapture I go really you know where that goes file nine I don't have a file drawer for that all I know is that I'm a part of the Rapture when it happens is when I happen amen I Don't Need No Man no church no nobody to tell me the date the time and the hour I'll take God at his word when the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise that's right amen uhhuh that's what I'm waiting for saints of God go praise the Lord and what an hour what an hour we're working so now in time in time here we go spread time let's spread some time out from the garden till now Jesus ransomed me Jesus ransomed you because he had to meet the justice of God so in the process of redemption he did the work of purchasing us right wonderful work and prophecy was getting see to the woman see to the woman unto us a child is born a virgin shall conceive and prophecy was going and prophecy and brother Braham said in things that are to be then there was a virgin God found a womb for the word to Lodge into Hallelujah and once that word lodged into that virgin's heart it brought forth Christ he's looking for another Bride come on that can open up the womb of their hearts to let this word produce Jesus Christ himself so he did his purchasing work he did his ransoming work in time Jesus therefore received the vinegar and he said it is finished The Ransom is finished your Redemption is finished your healing is finished your salvation is finished your deliverance is finished do you believe this I want I'm going to actually ask show a hands do you actually believe what Jesus these are the three greatest words ever spoken by any man but that was the man Christ Jesus it is finished hallelujah it's finished Satan I have my family it's finished Satan my wife's healed it's finished because he did that ransoming work he did that purchasing work Jesus did [Applause] it omnipotence did it Almighty did it Alpha Omega whatever terminology you want me to use he did your purchasing work in the space of time it is f finished your deliverance from booze finished cigarettes gone dope out the door pornography gone outall it is finished now I want you to say it it's finished believe my Deliverance is finished amen I'm free you started with joy brother Mano or brother Ben Joy joy unspeakable come on Full Of Glory victory is [Music] mine doesn't that look ridiculous and it's not because I'm enthused you say man you're an enthused preacher no no no no this is stimulation of Revelation folks I when I was in the world I was a dope smoker when I was in the world I was was a drugie when I was in the world I was a drinker but as brother Bram said in one place I changed my [Applause] brand Hallelujah I got a stimulation of Revelation that comes with this [Applause] message how many know the scripture as it was in the days of Noah how many know that I've got the corner on the market of using it brother Ken said every time I witness to somebody you said as it was in the days of Noah because that was real to me God sent a prophet you didn't get in the ark you're dead yes sir you don't get in this message I'm sorry absolutely have a nice tribulation at best at best so God did his purchasing work and he cried out it's finished when he purchased the work the ransom price was paid Justice was met then the three greatest words spoken by any lit lit if you look up in literacy doesn't matter Homer Iliad doesn't matter how far back you go or how far forward you go because if you can say the three greatest words ever spoken it is finished it's finished what you said well I I don't have a job you got a job tomorrow are you a Prosperity preacher no I'm a word preacher he said ask anything in my name believing ah but are you believing I have I've asked so long keep on asking yeah oh my my my so now we come to this place place where the scripture declares in Matthew 2028 even the son of man came not to be ministered un but to minister and to give his life is everybody listening to me yes sir because if you don't I'm going to stop and we'll have a we'll have church tomorrow right so you got to pay attention okay I've been to school enough and I know what it is to have pupils looking counting light bulbs so now let me go back to that scripture if you want to memorize it or put it down Matthew 2028 even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister yes and to give his life a ransom for many notice that word that's very interesting it's many it's not all yes sir it's only many many are called few are chosen so God knows exactly who's his own but he came now to Ransom Jonathan came to Ransom and that is a very key word in the Greek very key word we use it we preach it but let me give you a little bit uh a definition of it and I I might butcher the Greek of it but I got it out phonetically so this might help x a garazo so just say exaro man you're Greek already man you already know Greek exaro ex Garo Ransom that means he ransomed he purchased especially he bought you and the Greek goes into this and this is amazing brother man because brother brother uh brandham uses this in kinsman redeemer slave market slave market now I'm going into the Greek here and he goes now he says this scholar says especially to those that are in the slave market with the view of being purchased for Freedom free free free all right so he purchase you young ladies amen for your freedom amen free from sin free from the enemy free from bondage all right you still listening now so it it makes reference to a slave in the slave market referring to a Jewish believer in the Greek that has been purchased and delivered as from the law because the law binds you it's Grace that sets you free so now it goes on to say then that person or persons that have been purchased never never can I say it again never return back to the market so you say oh that brother backslid that brother is in the world come on brother if you are under this Ransom and you have been bought with this price and this Blood you Lord that's why the scripture declares you must be born again praise the Lord when you're born again you will never ever ever never ever be purchased have to be purchased again Lord this blessing is to the Believers only it's a effective are you listening now it's an effective Ransom and it's permanent Hallelujah permanent devil I've been Ransom permanently he doesn't save me to lose me I have been permanently ransomed my that's music to my ears because I don't know about you with the devil just like church or church natural they got tunnels yeah amen they got them they got Bazookas rocket launchers they got the AK-47s they're out to shoot and to kill but I am come to give you life and life more abundantly they might have the Iron Dome and that's what they say yeah we have the Iron Dome and you know what they call this brother M do you know this right I don't know they call this operation iron sword and I thought wow they got the Iron Dome and they got the iron sword but I got the blood Dome and the King sword I don't care what missile gets launched at you none are going to hit you none are going to land do you know that do you know that Napoleon went to war one time you know swords are very important in the in 17 and 1800s swords are very important and a special sword maker was making special swords because if you can have a certain steel you can cut the other sword so nap Napoleon he always wanted the best and so he he ordered all these tens of thousands of swords for his army they have these special swords and they went into battle and they had the harah ray hooray raw ra and when they went to fight the other sword their swords were cut in half they forgot an ingredient but in our King sword is the full ingredient called the open book prise The Lord Glory Hallelujah it's not a king sword it's the king sword and it was put into your and my hand so now he's done his Ransom work as a son of man Ministry he has now done his intercessory work as a Son of God Ministry now he's turning to the Jews for his son of David Ministry amen okay I know people don't hear son of David much but right it's it's okay brother Wayne can correct anything I say wrong he's doing the intercessory work he's now doing his claiming work at this time amen amen and John went to look for don't weep John for the lion of the tribe of Judah ha prevailed right but when he went to look for a lion what did he see he saw a bleeding lamb because he was your intercessor he was your purchaser but he couldn't see him at first brother brah said because he was in the eternity because he was the land slain before the foundation of the world Amen so now here we come to our time and I'll won't be much longer because I know we have church tomorrow morning right we have a people as brother Tim pu often say we are people of the open book yeah it's a great title I think he's used it 260 something I just think he he like me man I can't even make up a title the brother say what's your title tonight the open book Tim you didn't hear this please don't let brother Tim know that I love brother Tim but we're people that know who we are we've read the end of the book we've seen the typ in the shadows that's right and they're not for us just to say I see the type in Shadow that's right you know I I I read this article years ago and uh a little girl was laying on the ground it was a nice bright sunny day sun was up up up above and this gentleman walked by this little girl and she's just laying there and the fellow looked at her for a little bit and said okay honey why are you laying there what what's what's so special about ler she says I want to make sure my shadow fits of course if you lay down in your Shadow Your Shadow fits yeah I'll leave that one to you you can fig that one out tomorrow so now here we see in this time Ruth moving yeah Naomi moving we hear and see what's happening on the world stage in time can you imagine your universities pushing what they push look don't worry Canada's just as bad where Sodom your gomorah or your Sodom or gomorah sorry folks there's nobody here righteous no not one but let me just say something to you when Pharaoh when The Exodus was on Pharaoh was out to kill the children when Jesus came Herod was out to kill the children let me tell you in this Exodus Satan himself is out for your children amen he'll try and get you an education he'll try to pervert their minds twist them yeah amen and cause problems in their lives and as parents of the word we need to rebuke Satan and say not my child I got the blood on this door you can't have my child our education system is so perverted yeah yes it is that they're bringing it into your classroom of your grandchildren and children and the majority of the people there is a little bit of an uprising now there is but is it too late for the world too late but to us yeah amen that are covered by the blood the Dome still covers praise the Lord Jesus perfect love cast out all all fear amen all fear yes sir I know in whom I believe and am that he is to keep which I have committed unto him against this day hallelujah what a time we're living in what an hour we see Israel gathering in their Homeland and we're finishing the Feast of Y kapor for those that know their Bible Yong kapore is the day of what atonement think about it now so at the end of the Feast of young kapor there's an 8 Day celebration that the Jews have it's called shim chat shim chat and that is to rejoice because of the atonement but at the end of that day on the eighth day after the atonement that's right there is a feast of Torah and the Feast of Torah is a feast to Rejoice that God has given them the word that's right that's come on come on a day people we got to know that God himself amen has given us thus sayith the Lord hallelujah Pearl Harbor party Israel party the enemy comes in at Party Time saints of God we're not at brother Ram said we're not called to a picnic we're called to battle they said what was wrong with their warning system there's nothing wrong with our warning system because a prophet preached to you warning then judgment praise the Lord Jesus what an hour we're living in and what a day what a gathering when Israel went to war in 1976 brother Ericson I know you know this but in 1976 in the war of Yong kapor that was when all the Arab Nations encircled Israel interesting very interesting in the day of Y kapor did you know that the president of the United States at that time was Richard Nixon and do you know that your secret AR of state was Harry Kissinger and Harry Kissinger was a Jew but Harry Kissinger only wanted to send one plain load of Tanks to Israel one in the young Kipper war and golday year had come to America to ask for Armament so that they could defeat the enemy and they were down to just a handful of bullets right but Richard Nixon did not listen to his secretary treasurer he said send every planeet possible fill them up with tanks fill them up with Armament fill them up so that Israel could defeat the enemy ah but you said well Richard Nixon he got booted out of office but you know your Prophet liked him whoa I'm going to give you a curveball right now he voted for him I that's just extra that's just extra but you know what Richard they asked brother brother Rich Richard Nixon I guarantee you we'll see him somehow good to the bride you know somewhere in there right they said he said they said why did you send so much arm to Israel he said when I was a young boy my mother told me she said God has raised you up to help Israel Hallelujah but you've had another mother that's called you and he called you to raise you up yes sir and given you all the Armament you need to defeat the Devil at every turn of the road Israel is returning back to her country it took a another attack to bring them from America Europe Africa South America they came from everywhere to go back to their land you know you know I'm working with on this one too so don't worry I'm now I'm going to give you some of my thoughts what aren't worth much but just to help you out you know you think that these you anybody here ever heard of Rabbi Richmond we had them in our church years ago brother visco wanted to just find out where is Israel where is Israel at but you know SS of God without the word you're going to go somewhere left field sir so I was sent a little clip the other day and his Rabbi Richmond talking
