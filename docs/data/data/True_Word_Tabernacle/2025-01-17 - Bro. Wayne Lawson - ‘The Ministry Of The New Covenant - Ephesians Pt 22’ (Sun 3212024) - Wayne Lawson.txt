he's here strong and healthy this morning and we're we're much thankful for the Lord and his Mercy amen amen the book of uh Ephesians the 4th chapter and the 10th verse amen uh I want to just take these three verses Ephesians 4 verses 10 11 and 12 and he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all heavens he had the lowest name on the earth yeah he took the lowest seat in the house yeah and become a foot worse flunky but when God lifted him up he set him in the highest seat in the highest Place far above all things amen that he might fulfill all things and he gave some and I I want you to notice what he says here he gave some he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelist and some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ yes we ask the Lord to bless his word as you can be seated today I want to look here in this Ephesians uh series again today if I'm going to speak to you I want to take it just a context title here today I want to be speaking to you on the ministry of the New Covenant the ministry of the New Covenant uh Paul here is speaking of of five offices you many times hear it referred to as the five-fold ministry or the Ephesians 4 Ministry amen but what it is is it's a it's five offices that God has in placed in the New Testament Church that they were responsible for the gospel to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ now go to mark 16:1 15 these words are Lord Jesus's words as we was if he was here with us Thursday we went into the work of his Ascension and how that the Lord Jesus uh in between the time that he met Mary and said don't touch me and then he later appears to Thomas and says touch me and the prophet said there was a there was something happened that he ascended unto the father and returned back and had Thomas touch him of course you find it in the scripture that he done the work of the high priest in the book of Hebrews chapter 9 he said he was the Forerunner of the church so he in in a lack of better way to say it he made a secret appearance by himself like a high priest would but then he returned for the church that the whole world might understand that he had made the way for the Church of the Living God to be resurrected and when he took the Saints in high of course as he's resurrecting as he's ascending his Ascension was a public Ascension the world might see his Ascension they seen his body I it must have been something to see him ascending off of the earth that and and the leader of them now as he was ascending the prophet said these were his words his final words mortal words to the church he says like this and he said unto them go ye unto the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature now this is different because it was just in Jerusalem and he said not don't go after them he said I have other sheep there of another foe but not now he said but now he says to them go unto all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature so the Gospel of Jesus Christ must go to the whole world and is to every creature and he that believeth is baptized and shall be saved so now I know there's a lot of different systems and people has applied that you got to maybe lift your hand or you got to shake a hand of a preacher or you got to join a church or you got to come to an altar kneel a certain way or you have to you people put a lot of things on this but Jesus said he that believeth is to be baptized and shall be saved so the significant part of the Gospel is he that believeth amen now I don't know amen what that sometimes entails I know there's different levels of that but he that believeth and of course believing takes you onto an experience with God we don't do away with those things but he believeth amen shall be baptized but he that believeth not shall be damned now the reason being is because they're condemned already right amen now and the these signs shall follow them that believe and in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and set at the right hand of God now it's amazing to me these is his last words and this is and can I say it these is his final words this is the final commission You Preach my gospel amen and these signs shall follow them that believe now I think it's very powerful that we understand that we have not done away with the signs and wonders of the Gospel of Jesus Christ now one thing's for certain we don't follow signs and wonders but signs and wonders most certainly must follow this gospel if it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ it will follow this gospel because amen this is the thing that we're looking to and see that that we're preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is a living experience with God now this is his last and final words he is commissioning the church to preach the gospel Jesus is ordaining a new way right amen there has not been a five-fold Ministry there has not been the administration of the preaching of the Gospel up until this time there has been a levitical order with the sons of Aaron they've had the law of Moses they've had the Sheep blood and the goat blood and they've had the Laver and they've had all of these Traditions but never in the history had there been the idea that there would be offices of men preaching the gospel and that God would bring Salvation this way now Jesus is instituting it so when when when Paul begins to preach in Ephesians 4 he's only bringing the offices to the gospel that Jesus has predicted and commissioned the church to do he's ordaining them now it's amazing because Paul in the book of Hebrews he is the one that's going to divide the old priesthood and the new priesthood he's going to show the changing in Hebrews 7 he's going to divide the law and Grace and he's going to show you the institution of a new order a new way of doing things in Hebrews chapter 7 Paul being a student of the law he knew the law very well but he had met that Pillar of Fire and now he's dividing the two in part in Hebrews chapter 7 and verse 11 here it says if therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that there would be another priest rise after the order of mcedc and not be called the order of Aaron amen now Paul knows in Psalms 110 that it was David that said Thou Art my son and amen Thou shalt be a priest Forever After the order of mecdc so there was a a promise that there would be another priesthood come upon the Earth all the way back in the days of David we see the we see it when Abraham met MDC that he's predicting he was the king priest of God he was the most high God and he was both King and priest so we're seeing that he was seeing a prediction where God was promising that he himself would be the priesthood of the church and he was showing that he would be able to do this but they had gotten so down in the law and they gotten under the order of the priesthood but now Paul is saying if there was Perfection by the levitical priesthood then why would there have been a promise of another order then why would mecdc be in the scripture if Perfection was by the Levites amen but he was saying so there isn't perfection by this so he says it in Hebrews 7 and 12 for the priesthood being changed there must also a necessity of the law so in other words if we're going to change the priesthood who cannot bring Perfection we must also change the law that was operating under that priesthood so if the priesthood can't bring Perfection the law can't bring Perfection so there's to be a change of both priesthood and what they were instituting amen what is it it's evident there was a change coming both law and priesthood to introduce something that Jesus would be the priest and he would also be the sacrifice isn't that powerful that the that the idea now is that this whole system will be done away and now Jesus will be the high priest amen and the system amen will turn into his sacrifice Amen to substitute all the law for the system of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen I think it's so powerful when he says in Hebrews 7:13 Paul continues and said of him these things are spoken pertaineth another tribe of no man gave attendance to the altar so he's telling you that that mezc it was Jesus was to Spring out of Judah now according to the scripture that the lawgiver was supposed to the King was supposed to come out of the tribe of Judah right amen amen now he was coming out of Judah so Moses spake nothing of Judah being in the priesthood it was all under Aaron and the Levites because they were the son of the of Aaron and yet it is more evident that after the similitude of mecdc there arises another priest who is made not after the law of carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life now what he's saying is this priesthood now is not issuing from Aaron so see Aaron had a the tribe of lebi and out of him come these priests and what would happen is there would be successions of priesthoods like a a father and that they had a son and then they had a son and they and that would be a succession of priesthood by the tribe that they were living in had nothing to do see God called the whole tribe so they were called into the order of the Levites but here it's saying that Jesus was not going to become a priest by descending out of the tribe of Levi but he would come from the power of an endless life amen it's what Paul is saying he said what kind of man was meanc he said that Abraham would pay tithes unto him and giving the best of the SPs this man had no beginning of days nor ending of life he didn't spring about out of any tribe he didn't spring out of any of the former priest he was coming out of the power of an endless life now amen I tell you he testified th are to priest Forever After the order of MDC now they're very is a disen alling amen of the Commandment going before of the weakness and the unpress now here's the beauty of this he's telling you you you now he's talking to the Hebrews and he's telling them the law that you have is both weak and unprofitable now can you imagine this amen everything they knew and believed was based in this law and now Paul is saying it is weak and unprofitable look what he said for the law made nothing perfect somebody say perfect the law made nothing perfect can I say it better amen it had no effect of perfection it had no power within it to perfect nothing it was it was weak and unprofitable but the bringing of a better hope did which we draw nigh unto God Romans 8 and three Paul explains it for the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh that's the weakness it was weak through the flesh amen now in Hebrews chap 10 and verse4 it tells us this it is not not possible that the blood of goats and bulls and goats should take away sin and can I say it a clearer way amen goats blood is powerless to remove sin the blood of bulls is powerless to remove sin so how could it be profitable if Perfection is the goal How could a blood or a bull amen be strong and profitable if Perfection is the goal amen but it is weak and unprofitable if you want to bring Perfection amen so what we see then Lo amen Jesus said I come in the volume of a book to take away the first and that he might establish the second in Hebrews chapter 2 and in verse 14 this is one of the most beautiful thing brother man uses this scripture over and over and over for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified isn't that powerful Heath perfected now the law was unprofitable and weak imperfection but by one sacrifice he have perfected forever them that are Sanctified see if there's a change of priesthood there has to be a change of law am me and you might say well preacher what do we need with preachers anyhow I think I'm glad you asked me that because see amen the law in the priesthood was unprofitable and weak and bringing Perfection but Paul said God gave some Apostles and some prophets and some teachers and he gave some pastors amen and he did it for the purpose to perfect the Saints Hallelujah God's way of perfecting the church will not be through Levi and it will not be through sacrifices but it'll be through the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ can you imagine God's way of bringing Perfection to the church would be through an imperfect vessel hallelujah hallelujah for by one offering somebody said brother Wayne heyen how is a preacher going to bring Perfection I'm glad you asked stay with me a little while amen do you see this Levi amen was in the loins of Abraham was he not for generations and the Bible said he got ties because he paid tithes in the loins of Abraham Levi didn't have nothing to do with it folks he was just there in the body of Abraham when he met mecdc right but he also became a levite by that being in that body well let me say something to you we are not the natural Seed of Abraham this this PRI hood or this ministry this bride at the end time was not in the natural uh uh loins of Abraham but we were also there we were in the loins of mdct as a super race a super well then how are we the children of Abraham Jesus was the son of Abraham and we also are the children of Abraham but not of the natural seed we are of the supernatural seed and we were also in the loins of him somebody said how do he get us in the loin of him because the word was in the beginning and he was the word when he met Abraham in the form of mecdc and every member of this bride was in that word when mecdc met Abraham you were there in that body you wasn't in Abraham but you were in God so when God got ready to bring Perfection he brought out of his own oh God out of his own genetics amen he would bring a priest to good now here's the thing if any man is in Christ he's a no a new creature and all things are passed away and all things have become new now all things are of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given unto us the ministry yeah of reconciliation to Wi that God was in Christ now who was that in Christ God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now he said we had a Ministry of reconciliation now he says we have a word of reconciliation now we are ambassadors for Christ and as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead be ye reconciled to God so Paul is telling us that there was a people that had had the word that could put God and man back together again now if you're a studier of translations of scripture you know that William tendell also tendered this or he rendered this this part of the scripture and he was the one that gave us the language of atonement I don't have all the time to go into it but even the word atonement was given to us by William tendale it wasn't an English word until the 1600s and he he didn't have a word that could really explain what atonement went so he took at one mint and put it together and gave you the word atonement which means that you were seated back like you should have been to begin in other words seated back in at one with God it meant you're at one with God atonement and what he's doing is here in the original translation of this when when William tendel translated it he translated it and Heath given us the ministry of the atonement amen amen Paul says the ministry of the word is the ministry of atonement the preaching of the word is the atonement blood of the church do you see amen Romans 1:16 Paul says this I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ he said it is the power of God under salvation yes sir now listen to that amen it is the foolishness of preaching that'll save man amen it won't be educated and polish Scholars it won't be intellectual talks it is the preaching of the Gospel amen that he said I am not ashamed it is the power of God under salvation in Romans 1:17 he said therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith unto Faith so watch we're looking as the word Goes Forth that is the Revelation as you hear the word your faith catches the word and salvation comes through the hearing of the word listen amen I I I mean it's a powerful thing to me this morning amen that God has a way of perfecting his church in Luke chapter 4 it was Jesus himself that changes amen even in Luke 4 he takes the book of Isaiah and Isaiah had said for he hath anointed me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord amen Jesus said the spirit of the Lord is upon me if anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captive the recovering of sight to the Blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord that's Jubilee I don't want to teach a long time on this y'all remember the law of Jubilee every 50 years they would return back to their possessions it was in Israel Jubilee was announced by a jubilee trumpet sir right they had a Rams Horn and they would they would blow through the Rams Horn so the Rams Horn had none of its own ability whatever bread was put in it was what would be projected now the reason they blew the Ram's Horn at a certain time was because there had been atonement made there's no reason to blow your trumpet unless there's been an atonement and when the sacrifice of Jubilee was made that was how you could return to your possessions because there was a sacrifice for you so the Jubilee trumpet was sounding to the people there's a sacrifice made now maybe you was in other corner of the world other corner of Israel and somebody wanted to keep you as a slave and they hid you back in the back room of the back house amen and they wanted to keep you for the for the purpose of slavery but if you heard the sound of that trumpet you knew you were free to go you didn't see the sacrifice you didn't feel the blood you didn't you didn't see none of the priest but you heard the trumpet tell you the sacrifice is made then Jesus changes that from the Jubilee trumpet being blown to the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ he's telling you you're not going to hear a man with a trumpet but you're going to hear men amen preach words and those words are going to have power and it'll be a jubilee under the hearer and a man that hears the word of God has a got a right to return back to everything that they have lost because the gospel has the power to deliver the goat has no power the bull has no power but Jesus J is the high priest of the church and he has the power of endless life his word has power this morning it is the word of his power that delivers the church listen let me say this very clearly there will not be another Calvary there will not be another Calvary there will not be another cross if you're waiting for Calvary to get saved there won't be another there won't be another beating there won't be no more blood shed all the blood that is ever shed has been shed because it was enough let me say this Jesus blood was enough and one time in Calvary was enough that one sacrifice is enough to change every life to change every heart to destroy every disease to save every sinner one trip to Calvary is enough let me say it was enough for the Old Testament and it was enough for the New Testament it was enough for 4,000 years of sin and it's enough for sins that hadn't even been committed yet I didn't don't never get over the power of the Cross to know that he could take away everything from Adam all the way to Jesus and three days he could wrap it all up and fix it all I tell you brother you talk about a fixer upper God can fix it up he can change everything in three days he changed 4,000 years of what the devil did but he didn't just change 4,000 he changed the future of the church he changed levitical law he changed the sacrifice he changed the order and he anointed men of feeble likes to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah I say glory be to God the atonement has been made God Amen there won't be another Calvary now now to you that study you know these things are very clear in the message brother bam takes Moses smiting The Rock when he should have spoke to it right he said see he broke every Titan in scripture he should have never smoked that rock the second time yeah he should have just spoke to it it had already been smitten we've already had a Calvary we don't have to have a crucifixion this morning we just have to speak to him praise the Lord now God did everything he could do brother Bram said if a man that's got faith in Divine Healing that can point them to the finished work of Jesus at Calvary how many's ever been saved in the last 10 years now brother B ask raise the hands just hold yourself a moment be saved in last 10 years now I don't want to differ from you but you wasn't saved in the last 10 years go ahead you were saved 1900 years ago you accepted that in the last 10 years but you were saved 1900 years when Jesus Paid the price for your sins there at Calvary I love it don't you brother RS argu with them now you didn't get saved 10 years ago you got saved 2,000 years ago but last week or last month or 10 years years ago you accepted what God did for you now that's where God did everything he could do for the human race he did it with Jesus Christ do you believe that amen yes sir now Jesus stands here tonight brother BR said if he's standing here tonight with my suit on that he gave me he couldn't heal you right amen he said because it's already done he'd say to you I did that at Calvary can you imagine him telling you I did that you said Lord save me he said I did that at Calvary Lord Heal Me I did that at Calvary other words amen it's not up to God this morning it's up to your faith this morning can't thou believe that all things are possible come on Amen there was a man laying at a pool one day and Jesus came up to him and he said to him will thou be made whole will thou be made whole I imagine how he must have thought oh there's nobody to help me in the pool well I'm not asking you who's helping you who ain't helping you how somebody's doing this and how some well brother Wayne I don't oh Lord Jesus amen oh brother I'm just not fitting in this situation that and I don't feel like somebody's doing this that ain't what's been asked you it's will you be made whole it ain't how somebody's treating you or not treating you has nothing to do with it that day at Calvary it will surpass every feeling it will surpass every interaction it will surpass every ain't nobody help me in the water I'll tell you this Jesus is standing there and let me tell you he's a help when there is no help he's a father to the fatherless he's a husband to the Widow he's a savior to the Lost he's a Healer to the sick he's a counselor to the troubled I'm talking about Jesus the son of God that could change your life right here this morning no he don't have to go to Calvary he's already been praise the Lord and I accept that and I believe that that's why I preach that I say you're just as far away this morning as your faith puts [Applause] you how far are you from your healing how far as your faith from believing now I tell you this morning he broke the backbone of Satan at Calvary amen he broke the backbone of Satan at Calvary let me say this that was the day all sin was paid for even your sin and you may be sitting here this morning and saying how can I get out of this struggle and how can I get out of this problem and how can I ever get back to what I know I'm supposed to be let me say this this morning that Calvary paid the price that the lowest sinner in the world is sat there in this building this morning and under the sound of the Gospel of Jesus Christ they could believe that in their heart and they could go free free and any devil that don't believe that I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ thou Spirit of be unbelief and skepticism I say Jesus died and yeah he rose and he ascended to the father and paid the debt of the church Hallelujah you got a wrath this morning to go in I don't care where you come from I don't care what your heritage I don't care what your last name is I don't care who you are what you are where you came from Jesus Paid the debts and Calvary levels the playing [Applause] field brother and erold were the same at Calvary preacher Prophet evangelist Apostle whoever you are when you come to Calvary we're all the same matter what our last name is whoever we were born who were born money schooling it has nothing to do with it every human being needs Calvary and it's level Hallelujah I feel like preaching a bit it's level don't think somebody has an unfair advantage of you I I'm not a good basketball player I admit it I'm a short white guy not a big demand in the NBA for me it's an unfair Advantage cuz my dad did it to me and ain't nothing I can do about it heyen but when it comes to Calvary it don't matter my skin color it don't matter my height my statue it don't matter amen my education what it don't matter what house I was born it don't matter I'm from the hills of Arkansas it don't matter that I don't have the right polite things to say what matters is Jesus died for me and he did it at Calvary and he broke the curses and he broke these levels and ideas of man this hierarchy system people got built up in this Nation we're living in it's of the devil there ain't no big eyes or little yous the Hindus have had that for years and you can't even get in a certain Society till you have 13 Generations or something like that and you got to climb and climb and climb but by one New Birth by one New Birth a man can come to the kingdom of God we don't have to do that I know what it is a little Lon Devils go around and they do this all the time and they say well you've been discluded from this club and you've been discluded from this and you've been discluded for this oh it's a lie it's a lie it's the Devil he's a devil of division and I rebuke him in the name of Jesus this church is not divided we are standing together on the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's the truth somebody said well I wasn't invited you know what's funny there's some of these homes I've never been invited to come on what's good for the goose is good for the gander that's old that's old that's an old saying Goose sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander gu in Pakistan y'all don't know this but we've been translating sermons for a long time some of you don't but this one brother he proofreads a lot he always sending me these little messages and he says the other day he sends me this sauce for the goose sauce for the gander what does this mean Brother LA I said well you know what it means you just don't know the term right sure if you put the if you put the shoe on the other fit on the other foot yeah you might see it from a different angle just saying sir see it's a finished work how we get over there anyhow it's a finished work amen see you're already saved in the kingdom of God but it'll never do you no good till you accept salvation you wasn't saved two years ago or 10 years or 40 right you were saved 2,000 you believe that that's the teaching of the Gospel we base Divine Healing upon the finished work of Calvary and every Redemptive blessing lays there in the Redeemer it's all paid for see see everything God's got is a finished work already everything lays in Jesus well I tell you what this Prophet believed in Jesus isn't it funny how sometimes people misrepresent brother brandom that's something i' something I've noticed is is that people misrepresent what someone believes and tries to make them somebody they're not isn't that odd you if you because if you it's if you get the wrong person talking to you they'll they'll make you try to think somebody believes something they don't even believe or feel some way they don't even feel and and I'm proving it to you right here there's some people don't even really understand William brandom and what he really preached because he's got critics out there trying to turn Hearts from this message right but brother random said Jesus it all Lays in Jesus and what he was trying to do was take the people from denomination to Jesus amen the the the the church work the Gentiles had formed another levitical system of denomination and it don't have the power to forgive it don't have the power to save and look what he's saying it lays in in Jesus and faith is the key that unlocks that door everything you need is behind the door of Jesus he is the payment to everything you need and there is a key that'll unlock that door now watch faith is a finished work unlocks every door every treasure there is inside faith is the key that unlocks every promise and the key the faith is the finished work it's the keys that we're speaking on so what happens you as a heathen now hate to call you heathens but that's who we were in Ephesians we found we didn't even have a chance right but in Galatians three he said scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith even the Scriptures foresaw it what we've seen in Rahab when the two Messengers went to her house what did they do they didn't offer sacrifice they gave her a word and that word turned into a token that saved their whole family showing Rahab was saved by the hearing of the word and so would the Gentiles be saved by the hearing of the word you can't be saved as a Jew you got to be saved as a gentile Believing on the scriptures it's preached unto Abraham see so then we be of Faith or blessed with Abraham in Romans 10 it teaches us that we can't hear without a preacher isn't this amazing Romans 10:13 for whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved and how then shall they call on in him have they not believed and how shall they believe in whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher isn't this amazing well brother Wayne and I got the Holy Ghost see I don't have to go to church no more cuz I got this teacher in me the spirit's a teacher right isn't that what the Bible said that he would teach you watch how the devil twist scriptures cuz brother Bram said but now notied if you had the Holy Spirit you couldn't wait till the doors are open he said because the Holy Ghost is a teacher he gets in a teacher and teaches wow he gets in a teacher and teaches that's what he does he gets in a preacher and preaches see the scriptures are are clear how they're how they're written is beautiful and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel to preach and bring Glad Tidings good things I never will forget old brother brother you remember old brother juul forny amen I never will forget I don't know if he done it here in bluon but I seen him do it in the meeting one time he sat down on the platform took his shoes and socks off and put them old ugly feet up and said them pretty well I tell you what I I I guarantee you my wife would disagree with my feet being pretty they some gnarly looking things you know just get it out there but the scripture says they're beautiful but it's not the appearance that he's talking about he's talking about the hearing of the Gospel when the feet of one brings the word of truth it's a beautiful thing when God sends a man among you that will stand with the Gospel of Jesus Christ I say how beautiful are the feet of them that carry good news into the Church of the Living God and what it is written but they have not all believed the gospel of Isaiah sayith the Lord for who ha believed our report then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing hearing by the word of God isn't that amazing hearing the word of God faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God now he's he's telling you something it's not hearing everything it's hearing the word of God so Fox News is not bringing this [Applause] Faith come on y'all you know that they're just as one-sided as the other just a little more on your side maybe right amen but you know that's not bringing Rapture Faith right that's not bringing a true re revelation of discernment of the future events of the world right come on come on Amen you see uh what what we're seeing then is Faith cometh by the hearing and the hearing of the word of God now I know people listen to all kinds of preachers and I you listen to who you want to I guess just bring it back to the word but I'll say this uh somebody sent me some videos some time ago and they said something to this John Jonathan K guy and I think maybe his last name should tell you something uh but he he was the one that preached the blood moons you know back a few years ago somebody asked me said what about these blood moons brother Wayne I said well sounds like he's a good book salesman cuz he's not a good Prophet right now let me say something very clearly if he can't get that Malachi 4 is Elijah is William brandham how's he going to tell you what else is going to happen come on see it's not just hearing every voice I felt that one amen it's not hearing every voice listen but it's hearing the word of God do you see when you hear the word watch this amen a minister must preach the word amen and and watch how brother brand would tell us this Faith cometh by hearing now the only thing a minister can do then is by a Divine gift whether it's a gift GI of healing he's to explain the word in such a way that you would believe Christ and then healing takes place when you accept it and believe it in your heart not mentally now an intellectual conception but a heart knowing that God did it now according to brother brandham in Fellowship by Redemption as you must recognize the blood is an inst substitute through the preaching of the word it will bring down the veil of blood isn't that wonderful it'll bring down the blood veil in other words the atoning power is in the preaching of the word right the gospel Trumpet of the Lord is what sounds over our life it's how you hear from God it's how you're delivered from disease it's how you're delivered in your life it's by the preaching of the word you know the prophet actually says that when a minister walks into a Congregation of people and the anointing of the spirit you are are bound to hear from Heaven my goodness you can hear from heaven when a man walks in the walks in the plate like this morning that sweet anointing and a man walks in there and begins to preach you can begin to hear from heaven now people say I want to hear from God well let me let me give you something brother BR says here he said listen in what is a vision he says the greatest and the highest form there is for God to give a message to the people is for the people to believe his word word the highest form is preaching the gospel the highest form there is no higher form to hear from God than to hear a gospel preacher isn't that powerful this why I need a gift I need somebody to say something over my life listen the highest form you can get is the gospel being preached over your life listen when you come to church and you lay aside all your indifferences and all your feelings and I know how it is I mean I've I've been in church for years we get little things Weighing on us and this idea and this idea and this idea but see that's the thing is as you come to the church you begin to lay all of that aside and then you begin to ask the Lord God I got this need and I got this need and I got this need and Lord amen I'm praying that you'll use the gift in the pull pit Lord that your word will come across my situation and it begins to discern and then the Holy Spirit begins to use a preacher and when the preacher begins to preach you start hearing from heaven but it's up to you to acknowledge it when it happens come on Church Amen brother Carrie in my line amen just the other day you was praying and asking for something I didn't even know I didn't know the discussions I didn't I no idea at all and the Holy Spirit had me leave a context and give a whole little thing that some people probably wondered what's he talking about amen but God was directly answering a question somebody asked and I had no idea who was for what it was about but God uses a gift to use his word to meet the need of the people many of you know I'm telling you the truth you've come right in here and you've sat down and you've been wanting certain certain thing and Desiring all of a sudden Brother Ray be preaching brother Nathan be sitting there and certain word said and all of a sudden Nathan hears it you're going to have a son amen all of a sudden the highest form was the word being preached to him listen when it's the word it is the purest form form God has to deal with his church Hallelujah the highest form there is and the problem with is is it's men amen God uses men God could have used the sun to preach he could have used the wind to preach and wouldn't it been beautiful if he had a because he the son never failed you the son never made a mistake the son never had a bad attitude come on Church y'all know I I mean we might as well just be human right amen you you never bumped up against the sun it's so far from you amen and how easy would it be to believe something that came from that but God chose man with his imp peculiarities with his troubles with his with his weaknesses but God chose man to preach the gospel God's choice is man to preach the gospel God's highest form is the preaching of the Gospel God's perfection it's the preaching of the Gospel the Holy Spirit brother B said fell on man and man is God's agent and the hardest thing God has ever done is to get one mortal to believe another yeah woo brother Glory now listen I I I recognize this that it has to be a Gods sent man and the prophet says it he said God called me to preach the gospel and that is my credentials a God sent man can stand alone on the same grounds the church don't send you God sent man amen so when God sends a man he's a Gods sent man a man that God sins will have an absolute amen a man that God sins won't be Wishy wory and flip floppy on the word of God he won't do it amen and sometimes it may come to a struggle but if God sends a man he sends him to hold the messiahship of Christ straight in the church direct quote if God sends him he holds the messiahship straight now watch the Messiah ship it's the word sir so he holds the word over the church and brother man said what we need in our church is a man that's God an absolute what we need in the Methodist Church in the Baptist in the Pentecostal in the Presbyterian Church is an absolute a man of God that will stand tied to the word and to Christ and bring that congregation under the condition of where each member walks in the condition of the word brother brother isn't that powerful that's what we need men with absolutes yeah amen men who know what they're talking [Music] about we're not here this morning uh trying to figure out whether the message is right or not C can you imagine the confusion of that people still guessing whether Bron R had it right or he had had it wrong or the cloud what does it mean and what it don't mean and can you imagine trying to feed your faith from that kind of voice but the voice must know what it's talking about now the prophet says this in Acts the 6th chapter when stepen went and preached see he me we're just now instituting the gospel and stepen is preaching acts 15 and he the Bible said and they looked steadfastly on him and saw his face and said he see been the face of an angel now that's powerful because brother Bram goes on to explain that his face wasn't an angel's face he said what it was is he was so sure of what he was talking about he so knew what he was talking about that he said there it was it shined on him like he had the face of an Angel he was steadfast amen look at this he was shine like an angel amen maybe a light on his face or something an angel don't have a light on him but an angel is a messenger and a messenger is one who knows what he's talking about I tell you what's powerful you know when old Steven standing there and he's getting stoned it's amazing what he done is he looks up into heaven and brother I tell you what it's a blessing when he looks up there and he said I see the heavens opened yes sir I tell you what he knew of the power of the work of the Ascension of Jesus Christ a few days later he didn't look up there and I see the heavens closed and everything's amen he said I see the heavens opened up and I see Jesus at the right hand what he did he saw and opened heaven and he knew what he was talking about he knew there was no devil could keep him out of the presence of God he knew the blood had took care of the problems he knew what he was preaching was the truth isn't it something a man had a face like an angel like that now in questions and answers brother bam says it like this the inside of you is a supernatural the outside of you is physical and if you are spirit-led by God you became a messenger of God or an angel God's messenger God's angel the same word and which is the greatest Authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pull pit it's the angel at the pull pit Paul said so yes sir if an angel comes from heaven and preaches another gospel then what I've already preached let him be a curs so the angel Anointed with the holy spirit with the word stands next to God Amen Hallelujah I say Lord let me stand with your word when a man stands with the word he becomes an angel of God and stands next to God isn't that powerful Church no wonder the scripture says how beautiful are the feet of them that carry Good Tidings that bring the gospel because there's not a hire for to hear from God hallelujah amen you say well amen well if an angel was preaching I'd believe him brother bam says but God didn't ordain the angel amen he ordained men to preach the gospel the gospel comes by the preaching of the word god manifests himself through human beings let me give you a real quick example when philli was there in the Revival and the Holy Spirit led him to one man out in the wilderness and this great uh Ethiopian unic came was a great man and he was reading the book of Isaiah and when Philip went to him amen remember he said what readest thou the man said well I'm reading the prophets but I don't know who he's talking about here and he said is it himself or of another and then Philip begin to preach Jesus unto him and when he be to preach Jesus unto him amen The Man by faith understood now Calvary ain't even close to where they are he's out there in the desert reading words by a puddle of water he's a long ways from salvation through that other way right but now because of the hearing of the Gospel amen the man's heart is quickened he looks over and says what hindereth me to go get in this water right now amen what was it it was the angel of God that directed Phillip but Angels couldn't preach it Phillip had to do it isn't that something amen I appreciate our preachers I appreciate God anointing men and sending them out amen I'm glad this morning I'm not out I'm glad I'm here I told Brother Ray I was driving down the interstate this morning I'm glad I'm right here this morning not in Oklahoma and got a 15-hour drive home and I'm glad to be here preaching to Brother Richard and brother Carrie and I'm glad brother darl we're here preaching and we're able to share with you amen you all know what I'm talking about I'm all among friends and you love me I didn't have to travel amen but there's people this morning doing all these things there's men traveling like brother brother Alex here traveling and going other places and and thank you all for your help and support for him but he's going other places and traveling I brother Steven spent a couple weeks over here these men of God and Nathan and Ronnie they're going overseas and all the different traveling that's happening amen these men are carrying to God they're not just filling up their days they're not just emptied lives and without heading and just just laced in their lives amen they're carrying the Gospel of Jesus Christ and an angel came go do it but they got to do it in the weariness of their body and the weariness of their homes and and they give their lives for these things because they're worthy of giving your life for Hallelujah I thank God for our preachers I thank God for brother Ericson a pastor Among Us who's give his life for this message many of you wouldn't be sitting here this morning if God hadn't to called this man to the ministry I wouldn't be on Ohio this morning if God hadn't to called this man to the ministry I meant don't y'all just give them a round of applause this morning I think they're worthy of it say preacher you lifted up men no I'm lifting up the God that sent a gift into this age and Men surrendered their lives to these gifts and they gave their life because the angel couldn't preach it God had to get a man to do it so they said well won you display a tape then brother Ram said an angel didn't do it and he said nor did God ordain a Machinery or a mechanical device to do it he did not ordain Mechanical Devices listen let me say it would be real easy when we got ready to we're getting there in Ephesians 5 so if you girls now y'all clean up all you guys clean up we get to Ephesian 5 it's going to get a little rough okay so don't take it personal but when we start preaching about hair and makeup and nose rings and earrings and amen and all the nonsense the boys are pulling in Fashions and stuff when you get there amen now it would be easy to push the play on the tape and sit back here and let brother Ram take all the heat as if it's all on him right amen but I think it takes a coward that won't stand with the message of the hour and preach it like it's his own conviction these convictions of William brandom they're not just brother brandom's opinion it's the word of God and I believe we ought to preach the message of the hour with strength and conviction amen amen it's not listen it's not and somebody said well brother Wayne AR play tapes I play tapes every day in my life I play tapes all the time pise but God didn't ordain a tape to preach this message he ordained men to carry this message amen what did God do God put on a dress wear y'all know what God's dress Weare is brother B said it's the offices of the church is God's dress wear he said of Apostles and Prophets and he said Satan never gets to it see what it is God dressed up in his church these offices in God is his dress wear when you see those offices a pastor and teacher and evangelist what is it that's God's dresswear God's presence God's spirit working in a human being W that's pretty hard to imagine ain't it God unzipped a body I just I get off me let's use Brother Ray God unzipped a body and stepped into it and showed up at church somebody said well I don't like this and I don't like that God's office you see that it's God's office it's not it's not for man it's God's office amen now now it's a dress wear that God puts on so I know you're seeing the man but can you see the God can you see the office of it do you see what it is see many people so and and years ago it's pretty funny when I I was just just a young preacher when the anointing first started getting a hold of us and all these preachers know that when you when you get under inspiration that's preaching and then sometimes you do a little bit of teaching or something and you're reading it's more intellectual side but when the inspiration really picks things up and puts it together and it's it's more preaching and and I remember when that anointing first started hitting me Jaden it was cuz I went from a prayer closet and I learned in the prayer closet that if I just let go these words would come and this feeling would come and I wasn't trying to sort it all out I was just letting it flow and I learned that the more I let it flow the higher I got and and and then all of the sudden when I started preaching first first sermon I preached brother Nick I tried just to I tried just stay with the notes you know and I found out that God didn't want me in the notes he wanted me in the inspiration so when I started preaching like I was praying then I found something happen and all of a sudden while I was preaching I'd say things and I'd think man that was good where' that come from yes sir and I would I mean I didn't forth think some of that but it was stuff IID studied but I hadn't put together yet I right here it true word years ago I was coming in at that time as an evangelist and brother R had me and I never will forget this I was preaching right along and I was preaching about when when hady R looked at brother brandham and he said ask what you will now I'd studied that a lot but I'd never thought about this but what she said was what was in her mouth and it came that moment in inspiration and I seen it had she been feeding on Billy Graham that's what she would have been saying had she been listening to oral Robert she said have said brother way brother brother Bram give me the million dollars cuz they believed money was the Revival but because she had been feeding from a prophetic message she believed in the creation of the word and she just but that come just in a moment and somebody come out to you and they'll say boy I really enjoyed that now it's okay you can tell me that because I enjoyed to hear it and uh somebody said one time to brother Brown they said I don't know how you let them people compliment your sermon he said they compliment me I don't take it brother BR said there's only one me difference between me and that guy he I tell the truth now but I remember early on brother Christopher I'd try to explain to people I'd say well it really wasn't me see I I just and then one day I heard myself I could just hear myself and I thought wow that sounds horrible so from then on somebody said something I just said well thank you well I know and God knows that it wasn't me but thank you it's kind of like one time well I guess we're on them one time days here it's kind kind of like one time you know brother Shawn Martin yeah he's a good singer yes sir and and I I I just I've never been to a meeting yet where they said brother Wayne's in the house would you come sing a special it ain't happened yet but we was over there in the meetings in July and brother shw berries and man Sean got up and sang he sang the house down you know and after the service old boy walked right up to me he said boy I enjoyed that special I knew what he thought he said I enjoyed that special I said thank you [Applause] I knew and God knew I didn't sing see well see but here's the thing your pastor has never preached a message brother BR said the holy spirit is speaking through mortal lips I believe these ministers he said behind me I'll say in front of me Brethren you never preached a sermon in your life the Holy Spirit preached through you a sermon that's right we don't preach the Holy Spirit does the speaking we might write out something and read it but that ain't preaching preaching is when inspiration comes and preaching is inspiration by the holy spirit that gives an unction and we can read something and it just don't matter but when the Holy Spirit gets a hold of it and takes a hold of the people and something gets a hold it's the Holy Spirit that's not your pastor preaching that's the Holy Spirit preaching the pastor is out of it he's just giving you the message I tell you this morning I believe God has transmitters on the earth that he can transmit his voice from the heavens through a human being into the Earth it's his highest form there is to bring a message to the people is the preaching of the word of God Amen I'll tell you this brother man said we are only transmitters that transmit a voice through our agency that's right he said whether it's preaching the gospel by lip or seeing a vision by eye or laying hands whatever it is it's Christ working through his office oh my goodness somebody said brother Wayne I don't know about these men preaching brother Bram said that's the reason all preaching and teaching is it is in preaching and teaching of the word that sheep hear the voice of [Applause] God he these are powerful these are powerful that's how they hear the voice of God now could you God could have chose to preach the gospel by the Sun Moon by the Stars wind nature he chose me to preach the gospel that's where the voice of God will come from amen that's where the voice of God will come from it's preacher the voice of God in Preachers the prophet of God said they will be a final voice yeah under their messenger they will be a final voice to the final Age The Prophet said in the church age book that voice is in the bride brother Brandon will the bride have a Ministry yes she will that's what's going on now teachers and preachers and apostles and evangelists amen and pastors amen what is it she's got a Ministry it's the ministry of the hour amen should what should they be preaching brother B said they're messengers of this same message yes amen now brother Prophet prophet of God is just saying some very powerful things here that these men are concentrating channels where God can speak so brother Wayne I want to get I want to get under the anointing brother BR says it like this the word goes out the Holy Spirit follows the word the word's preached you see your pastor preach and the first thing you know across the building starts going the Holy Ghost it's the conductor of that word and the word conductor is because the word is preached and the spirit follows it we're wherever it goes that Spirit follows that word oh I like that Bible teaching and Bible holy ghost coming back and confirming that teaching it is the apostolic way God has for the church God has instituted today an Apostolic way for the Church of the Living God and he has not changed his way now I I don't mean it as a rebuke to any congregation or any people but God has not changed his way I know today that men have tried to move the gifts of the offices of God out of the church but God put them in and God never took him out and any man that tries never saw why God put him in it is the way the blood comes to the church through the preaching of the message of the hour when man begins to preach the word the anointing comes in the building and you begin to believe the word then the atoning blessing of Calvary start blowing over your over your home over your family over your life why is it that the devil so after preachers why is it so after the church why is he so after the assemblies in the last day because that devil knows that devil knows he's trying to get the people in a place of Separation away from the word of God where he can fill their mind with every evil thing he can destroy your youth he can destroy your young people but I'll tell you this today I don't believe that tww is going to stand by and let no devil destroy the works of God in the last day but God put us here to hold a light in this generation to say God still works miracles God still moves in the Church of the Living God God still follows his sign still follows this message I believe in the preaching of the word of God I believe that's how you get saved I believe them that hear the word they believe the word word they confess the word and that's how they get saved I believe that's how they get healed so brother Wayne I believe with all my heart that God works in and through his bride maybe you got up this morning said God I need to hear a word from you and then you come to the house of God right that gift starts moving and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit start dealing with your life you always got to be real careful when you're hearing a preacher because he's preaching to a lot of congregation a lot of different things so sometimes he addresses maybe one little Spirit or something like that what it is is you you have to trust that the Holy Spirit knows how to break a little something so something can move amen and as the Holy Spirit begins to move begins to change things so as you're hearing the word this morning this is God's office this is God's way yeah this is God's gifts and there's not a higher form than the preaching of the Gospel amen one of our musicians come this morning praise the Lord let me assure you brother there may be a lot of mockery and I don't say there isn't I'm just a man I'm not a judge I'm to preach but there is a genuine Holy Spirit right sir and a genuine Apostolic power of that Spirit the age of apostolic hasn't changed God's way is still the same way that it was the day he left the Earth and said go ye under the world and preach the gospel go ye onto the world and preach the gospel and them that believe shall be saved how'd you get saved how'd you get your life saved how'd you get your heart the same way God Saves you is the same way he deals with you sir and as God begins to move you in life it's it's reason it's important it's important to get yourself in a good church it's important it's important to get yourself under a Ministry that you believe God sent that has an absolute yeah that preaches the message of this hour amen it's important amen sometimes older people they'll say well you know brother Wayne I'm doing all right I'm not going to have a problem but it's them young people behind you I seen a situation years ago it's a bit of a tragedy I seen a situation in a church where there was some fusses started up and and uh the minister was uh he was he was he was a little bit of a different fellow and he he he had set out to prove some things and he got got his Spirit pretty bitter and some of the people asked me and I said well it looks like y'all doing a lot of fighting these days you know I said here's the thing y'all going to make it you'll be okay but it's your children that's where you're going to suffer now it took about 10 years for them to see what I saw but I seen it 10 years before it happen because it's where the it's where the reaping comes is behind it it's important to get in a good church get your family settled let the Holy Spirit deal with their hearts there are people today that believe that they can just sit home and listen to a tape and it's the same as now if you would hear what's on that tape brother Bram said you say I can stay home from the church and it'll be all right he said no you won't be all right amen yeah now that's and you got to be real careful because this ain't legal this ain't like we're going to keep a roll of people that show up to church and wrong Church wrong preacher some of you probably wonder if anybody even cares cuz sometimes you miss church nobody calls you or nothing it ain't that we don't care we just most of us have been under some pretty dogmatic people and we're just a little bit like enjoy your life and we'll see you at the house of God I don't I don't know about y'all feels pretty good don't it brother car Freedom's nice but don't let it make you feel like you're neglected if you need something call somebody and say hey I'm over here I need some help but otherwise we love you and and we appreciate your attendance in the house of the Lord It's not see it's not legal but what you're looking at is this is God's system right yeah so I want this system to flow through my family I want to teach my system to I want to teach God's system to my children I taught my children when they were just kids I taught them to tithe I taught them to go to church we were sick well I better not get into that boy I'm almost finished and I'm going to get in trouble right on the end saying something Ben prise the Lord yall know that you went a little far on that coed did that to you see coed is a spirit of division and it was brought in at a time of a presidential election and they politically use that to divide homes churches families and they did it for a purpose now that has a residue that's been left over and that residue is somebody some well they I think they're the ones that made us all sick well I think it was them I'm going to keep everybody out of trouble I'll quote to you what CDC says it says if somebody's sick and you're running a fever that you should wait about what 24 hours that's CDC yeah yeah without without aspirin or ibuprofen you're not running a fever and then 24 hours later they say you're safe that you're not spreading but you know when you're really spreading when you don't even know it yet you can almost feel that in the building do you know do you know when you know it's a devil that's right you know when you know it's a devil is when that tighten Moves In Your Heart when the holy spirit's trying to give you Liberty but what but what happens is see but that Spirit of division that was brought in during Co wants to make somebody responsible but some of you showed up at a place maybe and didn't know that you might have spread something so what I tell you what we're going to have to do we're just going to have to stay home from church not from Walmart not from Texas Roadhouse not from Lowe's not from grandpas not from Grandma not from the birthday party from [Applause] church woo preacher preach it Hallelujah glory to God God I tell you what tell that Old Devil to get on down the road we are the sons and daughters of a living God you won't take my joy you won't take my peace you won't take my life you won't take my Unity you won't take my heart amen listen amen I am a free man made free by the blood of Jesus Christ ain't no devil going to conquer me amen and as long as we got breath and body we're going to push back against that devil because the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out of demons push that demon out push that Spirit out this morning and say you won't conquer me Satan you won't conquer me Satan amen my joy is my joy my peace is my peace Hallelujah stand your feet with us this morning Hallelujah Amen brother Ben you have something hallelujah hallelujah amen Holy Spirit [Music] rain down rain now oh comforter and friend how we need your touch again Holy Spirit rain down [Applause] R Down Let Your
