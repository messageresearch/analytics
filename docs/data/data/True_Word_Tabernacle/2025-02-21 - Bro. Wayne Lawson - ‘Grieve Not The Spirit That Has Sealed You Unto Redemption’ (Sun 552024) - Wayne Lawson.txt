about that choir huh amen thank God for our singers and amen that was so beautiful amen and uh we want to thank the Lord for the great gifts that he's placed Among Us and amen we uh so thank the Lord for the labor that have been put into that amen and the hours of it I I do want to say this morning we're missing our brother Isaac and sister Bethany they're down at brother Leon's and brother Josh's this today and brother Ronnie's down at brother Shan's and brother Steven's up at brother Andrews and we got preachers all over but that's what we're supposed to do right is go preach and so um uh I I uh I don't see there's brother Eric Amen brother Eric kovi has brought a couple friends with him this morning these Kies travel with their friend God bless you brother Eric we certainly appreciate you and the confidence uh that you'd be able to bring such a a large group of your friends with you and we want to certainly make them welcome this morning our brother Nate Moore is with us I know I know brother Ben's already made him welcome but I just want to say God bless you welcome in the congregation this morning we pray the Lord would greatly bless you and I pray that as you have stepped forth in here that you would feel the welcomeness of the Holy Spirit and of our hearts and and you're just so welcome to be here and I pray the Holy Ghost would just come down this morning and he would speak so personally to every person in this building and we could leave this morning and say did not our hearts burn within us as we amen went along the way amen it's certainly good to have all of our visitors today and amen and so we just want to take a few minutes in the word but just before we go I'd like to just have a word of prayer before we approach this word and just a little something maybe if on your heart this morning there's maybe a special need or something you've come to the house of God with I just pray that God would just move so miraculously and I'm going to ask you to do something with me this morning maybe you just might reach over and lay your hand on someone today and I'm going to ask you that you would pray that God would touch that person next to you that the anointing of the Holy Spirit would speak to them father as we come together it is written in the Book of Mark the 16th chapter that in my name they should lay hands upon the sick now father some are not sick this morning some are weary some are afflicted with different things in their lives and many needs and answers and questions that are needed but almighty God we know that you are the answer to every situation and just by one move of your spirit Lord you answer questions you change circumstances you save lives Lord healings take place in just one breath of your anointing and we ask you this morning as a congregation we come together today and we ask you that the Holy Spirit Lord would take a preeminence in this building father I claim every inch of this room for your glory I pray every heart and every life Lord would be so filled with the fibers of almighty God that there would be no place for the devil there'd be no room for unbelief or doubt or confusion but may your great Holy Spirit take complete control of this meeting this morning Father now we welcome you today we ask you to anoint touch and bless these people of God help the speaker Lord as we would speak your word may you make it Lord the word of life we ask you for these things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you this morning as you have your Bibles I want to look in the book of Ephesians the 4th chapter the 27th to the 32nd verse now uh you that are visiting this morning you've come in the middle of a of an Ephesian series but we kind of have been speaking on them uh in context so uh each sermon kind of would stand by itself so if I refer back to something you forgive me some of the people around you'll kind of know what I'm talking about but we've been in the book of Ephesians for a while and um so that you kind of understand our thought is the book of Ephesians is is a New Testament of uh the Book of Joshua of the Old Testament so when Moses uh brought the children of out and then Joshua took them in the land and then we see that when the Holy Ghost fell in the New Testament Paul in the book of Ephesians placed the New Testament Believers in the promises uh that he had got so I I want to just read from here this morning the book of Ephesians we're going to read uh in the 4th chapter 27th verse and I going read down to the 32nd now neither give place to the devil we just spoke Thursday night on this neither give place to the devil see he don't have a place unless you give him one and so don't give a place to the devil now we're talking to real Believers and Christians don't give no place to the devil let him that steal stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the things which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth and let no corrupt uh communication proceed from your mouth but that which is good to use of the edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearer and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption now let all bitterness and all wrath now he's going to list some things that Grieves the spirit of God let all bitterness how many knows brother B said the bitterness will eat Christ right out of your life now let all bitterness and all wrath and all all anger and all clamor and all evil speaking be put away from you these are things that grieve God now with all malice now you be kind one to the other and tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake ha forgiven you we ask the Lord to bless his word as you could be seated this morning and I want to speak to you if I took it a context this morning for a a title to kind of get our minds in this place is grieve not the spirit of of God that ha sealed you unto Redemption now when I uh look at this here I'm going to read from the 30th verse again grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption now amen when we say the holy spirit of God now that's not a different uh that's not a different one than the Holy Ghost right the Holy Ghost the holy spirit it's the same thing you're just saying it a little different amen but the holy spirit of God now the first thing I I think is that sometimes we've got to maybe Define what we believe that the Holy Ghost is and I think that's a good place Amen to to begin any conversation if you're going to talk about something I believe that you have to uh decide what we're talking about and and the scripture tells us this amen that in the in the uh grieve not the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost brother Ram will say this and what is the Holy Ghost he says now if we wish to approach the subject I think it's an outst standing subject he said of what is the holy spirit so there's an entire sermon preached what is the Holy Ghost he says and now the reason I have taken the subject in line is you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you and you cannot receive it see if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and is for you so you can know what it is but you don't believe that it's possible for you to get it and it's not for you then you still don't get it amen but you cannot know whether you got it or not unless you know the results it brings so then after you get it you got to know what kind of results it brings in your life so other one what is it and number two is it for me and is it available today and then what kind of results would it bring in our lives so the Holy Ghost amen amen the prophet was teaching us amen that number one what is it now number one the Holy Ghost is a person all right now the Holy Ghost is not a emotion and the Holy Ghost is not a Theology and it's not a Doctrine it's actually a person amen amen our lord Jesus said in John 14 that the father would not leave us comfortless but he would send a comforter under us such and you made you think that it was somebody else amen but then he said yet a little while the world seeth me no more but she will see me for I will be with you even in you amen Until the End of the Age so that Holy Ghost is is the spirit of Jesus Christ in the church it is the comforter the Assurance it's the Seal of God Amen it is the promise that has been given to you in Luke chap 24 and: 49 Jesus told him to go be indued with the power on high right and that you might receive the promise of My Father which is none other than Isaiah the 28th chapter amen that there would be a rest that would come to the church a refreshing so Isaiah 28 promised it Jesus uses Isaiah to tell his disciples that now the time has come that the Holy Ghost would be poured out amen and it would be the spirit of Promise according to Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 13 have you received the spirit amen amen after that you've heard the word of Truth have you received the spirit now that's a big thing there because of course there are many uh uh many teachings in this last uh generation amen that the Holy Ghost just not available anymore amen and it's not like an experience that you receive or it's not like a a real kind of accepting of the Holy Ghost it's more like I just believe it and I lift my hand or I shake some preacher's hand or I go to a certain church and that is the Holy Ghost well let me let me just say very clearly that is not the Holy Ghost amen I I don't care what kind of preacher you got there's not a preacher in this world can shake your hand and change your Eternal destination there ain't no preacher in this universe that can shake your hand and change your Eternal destination come on there ain't a church in the world that you could put your name on and it decide whether you go to heaven or hell amen it takes a definite experience with the baptism of the Holy Ghost a god that is alive and real we don't serve amen a dead Idol somewhere we are not a bunch of Buddhist or Hindus and have to pray to some Idol somewhere they can't talk back but the god that we serve the Bible said on the third day he rose up from the dead and our lord Jesus is just alive this morning as he was 2,000 years ago and he is available to every believer to every person in this building to every young person to every old person I don't care your race I don't care your Society I don't care your education it does not matter to God Amen if a man can believe God he can receive of the Holy Ghost is that right amen now somebody said well brother Wayne Amen I tell you what I believed I had it amen I confessed I had it well listen let me tell you you can get a confirmation from God that you have it and if you don't know you can reconfirm that to be sure because it would be better to be sure than to not know somebody said well I don't know that you could know well Jesus said you could he said in that day now there might be a day you didn't know but in that day ye shall know that I am the the Father the father me and I and you we have come to an age of knowing and God wants you to know he don't want you guessing or wondering or maybe I could have it maybe I don't have it there is a definite experience with God that you can know you've been saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I think it's time amen just to have a little church this morning didn't it amen Blessed Be to the Lord what a time to love the Lord now somebody said well brother Wayne heyen what about that Holy Ghost brother BR tells us and what's the holy ghost that there is a vast difference between a Christian and a Holy Ghost Field Christian now there's a real difference between a Christian and a Holy Ghost Field Christian now that is a real difference and if you go back Amen to the Token message you'll find out in the one in Dallas brother bamos say it like this you see that in the Exodus back there when the Israel was leaving Egypt he said which is a type today of the Bride coming out of the church he said listen there was a difference between Israel and the rest of them Nations and that was God Amen he put to one side Israel was like any other nation and when Samson cut off his hair he was just like any other man now put leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it the world and the church are the same lump just like Jacob and Esau were the same parents but the spirit of God makes the difference amen it don't make the difference of what church you go to it makes the difference whether you got the holy ghost or not amen you can go to the best church and not have the Holy Ghost you can amen now watch what he's saying amen the token is the thing that makes the difference between Egypt and Israel they were two Nations amen they were all human beings but all God created it was all the handiwork of God but the difference between the death penalty that was passed of life and death was the token that was the difference that we'll be the coming of the Son of God brings the bride out of the church the difference will be the token Now you listen this afternoon and see the token will be the difference and see the Holy Ghost is the difference between a Christian and a holy ghost filled Christian it is the token now I know that a lot of people's tried a lot of things but let me say something very clearly nothing else is going to work listen you can try anything you want to try but let's just cut to the chase nothing else will work amen the difference is the Holy Ghost no matter what system you're in it still requires the token no matter what church you have joined God still will require the token no matter how many sermons you have heard or how many message you have read God requires the token amen unless the token is there death will strike your home the only hope we have is the token every man no matter if he was a loyal man might have been a pharaoh of Egypt but he was the most important man of that day but the token had to be applied to him he could have said look look I'm the Pharaoh here I'm the king here I don't have to humble myself to y'all's religion amen but unless you have the token amen there was death waiting on you it don't matter if you're a king or what your race or nationality amen of what what what position you hold among your people or who you are listen you must have that token it must be applied no matter how important he was whether he was a bishop or a priest or a president or a king or a potentate or a monarch this is a prophet now God only recognized to token Covenant people the same thing today the holy spirit will only recognize a covenant people isn't it isn't it a beautiful thing amen that the Holy Spirit would only recognize because if you have the Holy Ghost then God has recognized you as a believer in Exodus 4 we find amen that when the Moses had come in contact with a pillar of fire amen and he had been about 40 years on the back side of the desert and he'd been tend and sheep now you all know that Moses had got a bit offended at the Lord amen because he found out he was a deliverer and he went out to deliver the children of Israel and guess what come to find out even if you're a prophet an intellectual conception won't deliver the children of God God now Moses was born the prophet he was a a a proper man 400 years uh promised from Abraham that he would come and when he was born his mama told him who he was amen and how he was born and what he was born for and he thought that the education of who he was and what he was to do would be enough to deliver Israel out of Egypt but he found out all he did was killed one man amen and got through out of the whole the whole country because he found out in intellectual Powers no matter who you are is not going to deliver the Church of the Living God so he got uninterested now for 40 years he lost the interest in delivering them because he had already gave up in the weakness of man he gave up on the Promises amen and had even forgotten about it but the prophet of God said but somebody hadn't forgotten he said God hadn't forgotten that he would deliver his children so he sent a pillar of fire into a bush and Called Moses out to talk to that bush amen and when he stood there talking to it the prophet of God said he got more in five minutes in the presence of that fire than he did in all the years that he was in Egypt at 80 years old he learned more in five minutes in the presence of God I'll tell you this this morning this Pillar of Fire has what we need it's got everything we lack amen somebody said well brother I I lack this and I have I I need this and I need amen where do I go to get this and where do I go to get this amen I tell you God got a burning bush this morning for every believer and if you come to that burning bush it has everything you have need of yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah when Moses got down there after being so busy with his sheep and doing all these things and he got in the presence of God and he come down there and said hey man load the kids up honey we're going to go down and deliver the children of Israel amen and can you imagine amen this fell amen now look nothing has changed amen Pharaoh is still Pharaoh amen Egypt is still Egypt he's still Moses the stick he's carrying is still his stick that's still his wife and matter of fact nothing had changed in the world but Moses amen nothing had changed but Moses and sometimes that's all that really needs changing you don't really need to change Church you really don't need to change the town you live in amen you need to get the Holy Ghost and let God fixed life on the inside it changed that man and the whole world changed the day Moses got changed you know what he did he went down and told his wife said we're going to go deliver this now that what what he did though brother bam says it like this he got neglectful amen and watch even Moses the man of God now met the pillar of fire it came to pass that the Lord sought to kill him can you imagine God seeking to kill his own man man the Bible said the Lord sought to kill Moses God was hunting him to kill him now why was God hunting his man to kill him brother brandom says it very clearly he had got neglectful to the thing he was supposed to do for his children do you see Sephora his wife actually took a sharp Stone and took his son out amen and cut the foreskin of the son and threw it at her husband and said thou art a bloody husband unto me because of this circumcision now brother R said God would have killed Moses and his son had this woman not intervened amen and circumcised that child of God now you say preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about thank God there's still some Sephoras among us today and you say preacher Sephora what do you mean I mean there's still some churches that are reminding people you've got to have a circumcision from God Amen I don't care how well you're taught it don't matter how long you've been in the message it doesn't matter how many church services are you hearing me you've got to circumcise your children you've got to circumcise your lives God was killing God was in a killing mood can you imagine God in a killing mood because somebody didn't circumcise a child and look at this brother bam says to Israel and the church and watch how now neglectful a man can get God met him down here in the end and would have slayed him but Sephora took a sharp Rock circumcised her children and throw the foreskin before Moses and said you're a bloody husband saved Moses's life oh what was Moses doing Moses had got in a hustle and a bustle of the day until he was such a place to go down there he forgot the Seal of circumcision now until we forget the Seal of God which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost now watch this friends we know this message since uh the prophet brought it in 1960s and 65 there has been a generation of people and we have been busy building churches and we have been busy doing Mission work and we have been busy printing books and translations and we've been busy teaching and we've been busy making churches amen but I pray to God we've not been neglectful in the circumcision of our new generation I believe this morning if there is anything needed among the message of the hour is a circumcision of the flesh that people can live again before God with Holiness and purity of our almighty God now watch this I want you to watch this now in Joshua chapter 5 we see that Spirit revisits them the same way it did to Moses because just before the journey Moses had a circumcision in Joshua chapter 5 just after the death of Moses and the children of Israel are going to go into the new land but watch now they are carrying a reproach of the 40 years they've spilled in the wilderness the the Bible tells us that none of the children which had been born in that 40-year period had been circumcised amen and there was a reproach They Carried upon them amen because of the lack of the circumcision in their lives now they were Israelites and oh yeah they were born to cross that land but they were uncircumcised in their bodies in their flesh they were carried I reproach to it now listen if I ever seen a type in my life look at some of the generation that's been born since this messages here I remember back in the late ' 80s and early '90s when I was just a kid I remember hearing preachers man they were preaching against television and rock and roll dope smoking and cigarettes and it was almost a place of legalism how many remembers that you remember that amen amen was no Spirit got by man amen it was a stomping and a cutting and a hurting and amen it was almost a stage of legalism and we moved on from that and and we started and watch but all of the sudden we found out this one started fighting this direction and that one fighting this and this leader rose up among us and this leader this way and people got awful busy people got awful busy and we had a generation grow up Among Us that have never realized the power of the circumcision of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about something this morning that can cut the flesh away from a young man or a young woman the Bible tells us that they were born out in the wilderness were uncircumcised but before God would let them go into that land they had to take a knife and begin to circumcise their flesh now y'all know what that means it means they cut away the unnecessary things they cut away the unnecessary flesh and it separated them from the other people that were around them I tell you this morning I thank God that they still a baptism of the Holy Ghost it carries the sharp nth of the circumcision of the twoed sword of the word of God brother amen there's nothing worse amen than a flesh getting in the way of a promise amen y y'all y'all preach with me now I'm not after anybody I want you to watch something amen many people they'd really like to get something from God but the devil's sitting on their shoulder telling them but you watch certain sir last week and you done certain certain thing last month and this happened here and this happened there you know what it is it's flesh and it's keeping you out of the real Covenant Promises of God but by the grace of God is a word this morning that is sharper than any two-edged sword and it'll cut away the flesh that is keeping you out of the promises of God thank God this morning there's something amen listen I know in that day they had a high priest amen and he was a high priest that would circumcise him children on the eighth day but we have another high priest of our circumcision this morning it is the Lord Jesus Christ and he comes right to our heart and circumcises the way the things that are wrong and I could spend some time there and you all know I could amen but think of this it rolled the reproach away from the people of God that they didn't have to carry it with them anymore amen can you imagine when they got up from them Banks they were different than they were the day before I pray God bring back the banks of the Jordan amen bring back the sharp knives of the men of God Amen that could cut away the Flesh and give people an opportunity to go to the promises that have been made for this generation I believe there's a lot of generation lot of it now you say preacher amen how do you think things get in this shape well we might as well pre is it okay you visitors can I go ahead and preach y'all y'all with me you okay amen I I'm just going to go ahead and preach like I'm at home okay amen now what happens is is what takes place is that they're actually becomes workers of iniquity among among us as a people now watch amen now the Bible says amen that not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven now many will say to that day Lord have not we prophesied in thy name now there's a preacher and in thy name we cast out Devils workers of Miracles and they've done many wonderful things and I profess unto them depart from me I never knew you now watch this amen they done the things amen of the Gospel but they never knew God come on now why does it call them a worker of iniquity because they preach the gospel without the Holy Ghost they they prophesied but never received the Holy Ghost listen let me say something to you this morning amen that's the reason a lot of people are not preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost as an experience to the people because they've never had it themselves and how can you preach to somebody something that you've never experienced yourself listen I am not just reading to you something out of a book but I've been there in the presence of that Holy Fire amen it'll change your life it'll change who you are it'll change how you think it'll change how you think it's God and a man can walk in the presence of God you can walk in there and come back and any man that ever been there can never talk the same think the same walk the same act the same because God changes there's got to be a from that time moment in your life nobody ever met God and stayed the [Applause] same nobody ever met God and stayed the same even the devil was changed when he met God even death was changed when it met God even death itself was changed when God met it amen and Paul stood there in the face of death and said you can take off my head amen but death where is your Victory amen the victory has been taken away from you let me tell you death was left shameful in the presence of Jesus Christ now listen listen that's that's what happens is because men without the Holy Ghost are preaching the gospel and they can't preach the gospel with an experience so they're only preaching it from an intellectual level that's how that's how that psychology got a place in our pull pits that's how it come in don't give no place to the devil Paul says and grieve not the spirit of God in other words if you want to fix marriages let me tell you how you do it you get God in the room and he burns out the selfishness and the pride and The Unforgiven Spirits he burns out the lust and and the pornography and he burns out the adultery and the fornications until man can live with a woman and a woman can live with a man I really believe with all of my heart what we really need in the Church of the Living hour is God manifesting in the power of the Holy Ghost well I tell you it's the truth that's how that's how the devil got a place that's how psychology got in men without the Holy Ghost had no power to move Spirits so they try to talk people out of it come on men not called to preach the message wants to Pastor churches and wants to do many times their marriages are not right their lives are not right but they want they want a possession they want a position so the people themselves suffer because they cannot produce the manifestation of the word so they replace it with intellectualism they replace it with psychology they replace god with emotionalism and pep and high but God cannot be replaced and the new bear cannot be replaced amen there is a God and his name is Jesus and he comes in Your Heart by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't claim manifestation is the evidence of being Spirit born or spirit filled brother I cast out a devil I got the whole ghost you can't claim that no sir I I spoke in tongue sorry you can't claim that no evidence of the Holy Ghost brother Bram said I've seen Devils speak with tongues I've been overseas I've seen it myself I've seen Devils speaking tongues and manifesting that and deny the name of Jesus Christ amen we have seen people walk on the coals and fires and y'all seen the Hinduism and the there's young man sitting there probably saw it firsthand I preached to him in his village all the way over in India he knows what I'm saying is the truth listen some of this black magic and Witchcraft we have in America it's a joke he comes for where it's real where people really do these kind of things so manifestation does not mean God come on Amen now what watch brother B you say what does it mean it means God still does those things it means God still alive but it's not an Evidence of the individual that is spirit filled yeah now you said well then there's got to be an Evidence somewhere yes there is the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost is today is the same as it was back in the days of our Lord amen it is the receiving of the word of Truth for the day which you live hallelujah thank God he didn't put it on emotion thank God he didn't put it on manifestation he put it on the solid rock of the word of God Jesus said on this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell never Prevail against it when you have a Vindicated word you've got an answer from God and that answer from God can qualify you for the resurrection woo glory to God I'm so glad to know this morning that I am not put in that place save this sech lost that service save that service lost that service listen you ever get a hold of this message and know what it really means to you yes [Applause] saved eternally secure come on let the earthquakes come we're secure Let the Fire come we're secure let the bombs come we're secure amen before the bombs are ever get this we'll be up in heaven I'm talking about people full of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah many of them can say Lord Lord but it's an unbiblical answer we get results it's an unbiblical answer somebody said well our church is growing we must be serving the lord that's not a Biblical answer at all brother brandham actually answered that cuz somebody told him their denomination was growing he said well I heard prostitution was up by 60% in Phoenix so growth doesn't mean God Amen and little doesn't mean God y'all y'all know what I'm talking about big churches you know we got God little churches we got god well forget all of that if you got the word you got God it ain't a sunny day it ain't a cloudy day it ain't what I did or didn't do it's God that shows Mercy that comes into the church with the power of the Holy Ghost yes sir amen this amen what we find amen is that the prophet of God said see nothing's going to go unless you receive the Holy Ghost that's powerful isn't it amen that's God's qualifier the Holy Ghost the beautiful thing is he pours it out all over the world Amen the Holy Ghost Falls in India and in Africa and in South America and in Russia and America thank God it ain't just a something that falls in Louisiana it ain't something just Falls in Ohio it ain't just something Falls in New Mexico it's falling all over amen this is a thunder cloud and it's had a thundering message that the latter rain has come come upon every believer in the last days I don't care where you're from or what Hut you crawl out of hallelujah it's [Applause] raining now you say preacher now that's why see some say some think well I'll tell you what man after the seals the Holy Ghost ceased well that's not true it was in the second seal brother Bram said I command you in the name of the Lord Jesus that you kneel down here and stay till you're Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost now somebody said well do I have to really have to do that I really have to get the Holy Ghost did non really have to dip seven times no he didn't have to dip seven times but he could stay with Leprosy too no you don't have to receive the Holy Ghost but you can keep leprosy too but if you want the Holy Ghost you got to get it the same way they did in the book of Acts somebody said well Mary just believed and got it well she did when she received the word for the birth of Jesus but when it talks about her going to heaven the prophet of God said 120 went in the upper room and Mary got just as drunk as any of the others and if Mary had to get drunk in the Holy Ghost to get into heaven brother you will not get into heaven without the Holy Ghost either Hallelujah I believe it I believe there's a God this morning walking the aisles of this building and every man or woman or child that wants Holy Ghost it is available to you today thank God it ain't a certificate that I got to pass out you can receive it right now that's the thing I like about the message you don't have to hold the Pentecostals come to the altar come to the altar come to the altar come to the altar the Baptist just lift your hand just lift your hand but a Prophet come along and he said people got the Holy Ghost the first time in the Gentile age they were hearing the preaching of the word and they just begin to believe and the Holy Ghost fell on them I don't care if you get the Holy Ghost in your chair I don't care if you get it at the altar amen I just want to see you get the Holy Ghost God that can change your life the holy ghost that can give you an experience with god well somebody say hallelujah I believe the Holy Ghost is available this morning to every person well look if it was just a ritual if it's just a church going didn't Moab have that didn't Moab have seven alars and seven Rams if that's all it is Moab and balam is just as good as anybody else but God showed the difference he said down there in Israel there was a brass Serpent and a brozen and a and a smitten Rock and he said back there behind the veil was that Pillar of Fire that was the difference between Moab and Israel it wasn't their teaching brother it was the Dynamics of the power of God that came behind the [Applause] teaching I know where we are in this age everybody's about teaching and teaching and you know me I'm this is a teaching Church actually we love teaching here but you know what the prophet said he said Dynamics and mechanics come together and he said now the Dynamics is the fire and the mechanics is the word right is that right he said said but if you put the word he said if you put the Dynamics in on some mechanics he said that's a little water down like gasoline little water down he said it'll sputter out so I'm afraid that a lot of the teaching had been watered down so a lot of us been watered down can I say can I say from my heart we need to quit watering down this message well I'm afraid the people's going to shout it ain't going to hurt them amen if you preach this message with power yes people are going to shout if you preach this message with power yeah somebody's going to dance because somebody is going to get Victory but I'm tired of this watered down bunch of theology that's took the power of God out of the church I say God said we could have it I say I want it with everything that's in me give me the Holy Ghost with power and manifestation I don't want to water down church I don't want to water down gospel I want to see the the power of God strike the word brother Dallas I still want the fire of God in my heart if it's just ritual if that's all it is then Moab had it let me take you a step further than that brother Bram said Cain had it if that's all that matters cuz y'all you that know the you that know the you that know the outlay of the feast knows that Cain did offer one of the feast how many knows that he offered the first fruits he bought the first fruits of the field he brought a resurrection and he brought a resurrection altar but he bypassed the atonement to have it that's why the Bible said that Abel's sacrifice was more excellent didn't say can's wasn't excellent it said abeles were more excellent because he knew by Revelation it has to be the blood before it's a resurrection you got to have the Holy Ghost before there's a resurrection you can't bypass the Holy Ghost and have a resurrection if it's just fundamental then Cain had it then Moab had it if it's just look look if it's just C theology then what's your problem with the five foolish virgins come on now the Bible said they all were virgins and brother B said they all have was made out of the same material and lived holy and clean lives and they had good theology he said but the difference between the two was the fire of God and the reason they didn't have any fire is because they didn't have any oil how is it how is it they run out of oil the Bible said they all took off and had fire didn't it didn't it the Bible say they all went out 10 of them went out they all had lamps that was on fire you mean if you study the message brother Ram said them sanctified people had a tough or they had a dip in the Holy Ghost and they had the fire of sanctification but when the ages started changing it began to run out and they thought just the restoration of Pentecost would keep that fire burning but where is Pentecost now come on where's theza Street at now it's slumbering and sleeping with the others and they're all fall under the foolish virgin but there was five of them wise virgins that carried their vessels with them Hallelujah I thank God for the opening of the word I think we've been given a word that'll take us all the way to the Rapture I don't have time to preach on it but can I say it to you it's an unending Revival Amen in other words it's the same kind of vessel amen that the woman was given when she met Elijah and was about to run out of meal and he said give to me first and your mealb will never run dry neither your curse of oil I tell you this morning we've had an Elijah among us and we give him all of our Pentecostal traditions and when we did we received thus sayith the Lord your curse of old will never it will never somebody say it it will never it will never run dry it's an unending Revival it's an unting time when God pours the holy ghost out upon this word can I can I give yall a little cue here amen it was the re filling of the Holy Ghost the wise virgins got under the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost somebody said brother Wayne I tell you what I got the Holy Ghost when I come and first got in the message but this happened and this happened and this happened and I got grieved about this and I got grieved and it's funny some of the things people get grieved about they get offended about all kinds of things but it really don't matter the thing that you got grieved about the thing is is that it suffered you amen but listen grieve not the spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption you never lost your salvation you lost the joy of your salvation what you need is a refilling of the Holy Ghost and let the power of God come back in the church I say pour it out Lord pour it out [Applause] Lord I'm reading it y'all know I'm in the middle of it you know you know I'm in in Matthew 25 and that five wise virgins that had a refilling of the oil you won't get it any other way in this message you're not going to get any oil out of that Pentecostal system you're not going to get any oil out of the Bas Baptist system the day is finished can I just say it there's no mercy left under that message there's no light left under that message but if you walk in the light as he is in the light you can have Fellowship can you can have oil you can have oil for your lamp and you won't never run dry brother gersam thanks be to God that there's something that can keep the oil in a [Music] vessel amen I'm glad I'm glad about it you see Israel when they coming out of Egypt now the thing about scripture is scripture repeats itself y'all remember I've called my son out of Egypt how many Book of Matthew you remember that when Jesus went down and he went into Egypt for a time and he said I called my son out of Egypt but really that was also talking about when God called Jacob out of of Egypt so it was a double meaning on the same scripture that's why brother B said scripture has compound meaning right so it has a compound meaning so the scripture is not like a letter you write to someone like if you write me a letter okay and if Paul was just writing to theh Visions then that letter was good for one time for one reading for One's group of people but the word of God is compound and it is a Living Word and it's written to all people at all times for all good for inspiration for Doctrine and exhortation and correction right so it's not just like a letter so you see that the the prophecy repeats itself and so is it when Exodus when they're coming out under the token message m in Exodus 12 now I know you all Bible readers so I won't turn there but in Exodus 12 when God got ready to deliver them he had to do it through judgment and wrath amen the Bible says that he would pass through Egypt and he would pass over Israel I like that don't you he went through one over the other he went through Egypt passed through Egypt and the Bible said he executed judgment upon the gods of Egypt now I'm I'm not I need to do it someday cuz I keep telling people someday day I'm going to do it I guess someday I will amen but but someday I'm going to do it actually there's 10 plagues right Moses brings and there's 10 major deities of Egypt that's why God exercised power over every one of their deities can you imagine the the deities how they worshiped him and all of a sudden the God of this bunch of slaves the God of this bunch of mud this low class muddobbers these slaves down here their God is dominating our God God Amen he was executing judgment but before he executed judgment he gave Grace oh I'll tell you God gives Grace in the middle of judgment isn't that powerful only God can do that but how is it that God how is it really that God could send judgment and hit an entire nation and miss a certain group of people how is it that God could could put Darkness over a whole nation but one little city was going to have some light how is it that God could determine the difference between the cattle in the field how could he determine the difference in this house and this house there was a token involved and when God got ready to prepare the people for Exodus he sent a prophet and a pillar of fire and a message now you could have received him prophet and Pillar of Fire and believe he was from God and turned down his message and you still were in Egypt you could say you're a Pentecostal all you want to you're still in Egypt you see that you're either in the bride or you're not I don't mean that in seclusion I mean that in the token so watch what he's doing he had a message the message was to apply the blood now the Simplicity of that message could be understood by anybody is apply the blood now I I don't want to get into the deep processes of this so just for a sake let's just say it like this amen the blood of the Lamb was what God chose in his mind before the world began and when God said he slay the lamb before the foundation of the world he's actually talking about Jesus but he's not revealed it yet right it's only as a lamb to the slaughter the book of Isaiah Moses is revealing God has an atonement but hasn't yet expressed exactly to the Fulfillment of what that atonement would be but watch he takes the blood of a lamb which means death for death in the Garden of Eden there must be something die but since there is no man born of a woman without sex there's no blood of a man that can attone for the sex birth of the twins back there in that Garden there's nothing that could do away with the sin that had been done so what they did is they could only apply blood amen as an atonement which was only temporary until the time that God did something greater now he considered Israel his firstborn child so he was protecting his own son through the blood speaking of you and I being protected but the thing is is that the blood of a lamb had no soul now y'all know as long as it was a perfect lamb it really didn't matter what his name was right it didn't matter what family it was born out of it just had to be a perfect you and of so many days and had to be kept up 14 days and studied and when it was determined to be perfect then they could kill it had no soul right amen so not having a soul every lamb is of a lamb nature now the thing about a lamb nature is it's a beast and that nature of a beast could not come back upon man matter of fact God wouldn't permit it because it was a beast with a woman that brought the problem to begin with and God Is Now using the blood of a beast and he's only atoning something for God to look at he can't look at the at the natural person he's looking at that blood but he's not looking at the blood of a woolly lamb he's thinking of the blood of his son and that's why when he put that blood up here it was so important that the angel could see that blood now now you say brother Wayne why in the world would they put that old nasty stinky Blood on the door of their houses cuz the prophet said so now that'll solve a lot of problems in your life young mans one time they said to me brother Wayne why can't we wear shorts and I didn't give him the hundred reason answer I said the prophet said so you don't need more answers than that now watch what he did well I bounced around the room amen but you don't need more answers than that amen now now watch what happened that that blood was placed across the L the door and there's a lot of types I don't have time for them but look that they they brought that across that now it was visible to God because God had to see something had died now if you take the blood out of a lamb it speaks of the death of the Lamb right because when you see blood what died now the blood was required because it had to prove the death but the death of that lamb could not atone you in other words you couldn't put it on the person you had to put it on the door you couldn't put it now now what's it speaking of it's speaking that there was not an approach that God could take Sin from the individual but what he put the blood over the door that it was a visible sign but now Jacob what you do with that lamb itself he took that lamb and put it in the house and they eat that roasted lamb right and when they eat it with B with bitter weeds and watch what they done they roasted it with fire but they couldn't see it now you say preacher what are we talking about we're talking about an in time manifestation of God where you're going to see a display of the literal life of Jesus but you're not going to see his Corporal body it's going to be hid from you but the life is going to be visible to you amen the token is what is required listen to save this generation we wasn't looking for the Corporal body we were looking for the literal life Hallelujah come on Church look you can't take the literal body in you the Corporal body could not come into you but the life that was in that body the life that was in that blood was God himself Hallelujah Hallelujah I don't have time to preach on the Virgin birth but let me tell you this Mary didn't have nothing to do with it and Joseph didn't have nothing to do with it amen it was both male and female how many knows what I'm talking about both blood and the egg come from God just like in the beginning when God created both male and female and called their name Adam come on Amen and God took a name change when he created them and so did he when he created amen Jesus in the womb of of if Mary what did he do he put male and female and changed the name from Jehovah to Jesus because Jesus was Jehovah now salvation saving the people and the people he was going to save was in him can you imagine this I know it gets too deep to preach one morning but but but but but look at the power of this that that token was representing that the animal life could not come in now now look when this can you imagine brother Bram does a good job at drama I'm not much of a drama guy but I'll say this can you imagine that young boy coming to his father and seeing him put that blood on the door and just asking him why are you doing that Dad he said well cuz of Vindicated Prophet said to do it like this well what's that going to do Dad it's going to protect you when death comes it's going to protect you Dad how do you know it's going to work come on solid question folks solid question how do you know it's going to work cuz if it don't work it's going to be too late to worry about it how do you know it will work I could just see a father now brother Bram instructs it in the token but I could just see a father sitting down with his son saying now look son when we put this blood on this door Daddy was making our house different than the other houses and all the kids that laughing at you and saying y'all's different than us when that death comes you're going to be saying we different than [Applause] y'all it's the truth everybody seeing you different well thank God you're different amen thank God something has happened to you I can tell the difference between these sister and the ones on the street thank God y'all different you know well see son see we put this blood on this door now this this this blood is known to us as an atonement now that's a that's an English word made up by William tendale in the 1500s atonement it means to cover or to propitiate but you see that word atonement in the Hebrew is coford I think it's k o p h e r isn't it amen koford somebody help me it's it's something near that anyhow my Hebrews these folks you you visitors forgive me I speak Spanish and Greek all at the same time Hebrew with a Southern accent Hallelujah come to me later I'll get it to you out of the Hebrew it's beautiful but the word c man in other words th this son this this what we're doing is what God's way of sealing our home how do we know it work you you remember this deliver Moses you remember how we told you he come down the Jordan amen and the alligators didn't eat him yeah Daddy I remember that do you know what kept Him no dad what was it it was a special stuff that his mama under the instruction of the Angel put a tire around the basket and sealed it off and when she put that baby in it God seen that as his own seal and he put angels around that basket son and I'll tell you there wasn't an alligator that could touch it sure God didn't take all the Alligators out of the river no God didn't take all the Egyptians out of the country he put a seal on that Ark and he put his son in and he told the devil don't you touch this this is my seal this is my Ark this is my child come on Amen well Daddy these are more than crocodiles judgment angels are coming say son I tell you there was a time that when judgment struck the whole earth matter of fact in the days of Noah remember back Dad told you years ago about when the whole Earth was scattered and it was flooded how Noah our forefather got across that flood had to get across dadd he said yeah he got on the boat son don't you know there were other boats in that time don't you realize folks there were other messages and other preachers and other people amen the Bible tells us that there was nothing new Under the Sun amen there was there was other people but this one God was constructing and you know son God told Noah by vision of how to do it and he took a wood and the boat Builders looked said you building different than everybody else builds what are you building that gopher wood for but see there was a revelation behind it JP goer wood was a sponge amen and it was open the pores were open now look at the beauty of this because if you get a pore that can be opened it can be closed amen because it can be sealed and and he had that gopher wood now the beauty of it is is when the Bible says that Noah was to pitch the ark y'all know that word pitch p i t c he was to to pitch the ark inside and outside how many knows that word pitch is the same word as atonement he was to put an atonement on the ark that would protect the people on the inside from the Judgment that was on the outside amen that pitch that was on there y'all y'all y'all I know y'all know this but I got to say it to get where I'm going do you know where they got the pitch amen it it if you study it it come it's the resin out of a certain kind of pine tree we call it pine tree it was an evergreen tree It Never Dies you know it's an evergreen tree it's an everlasting tree now when they picked the tree for the pitch they didn't pick it for its beauty they picked it because of the kind of life that was in it and that's why Isaiah 53 said amen that he was not beautiful that we could look at him but he made a perfect offering because of the life that was in him and they took the life out of a living tree melted it down and put it on the ark to protect the people and that's exactly son what God is doing when we put the life out of this lamb and we put it up here we put it on the door that's exactly what we're doing we're applying the life of a lamb to protect our lives oh Church of the Living God what a beautiful type that in the days when judgment has striken leosia and judgment is everywhere upon every house upon every nation upon every city but there is a people of God this morning sitting in the house of God with a token over their lives God himself put that token on this church say preacher why do you say we need the Holy Ghost cuz God's word said [Applause] so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that seal right the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that token of Exodus 12 it is the seal it is the pitch that was on the Ark of Noah amen you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption let me say it to you the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost how long does this seal last I tell you what I know we don't have enough time to preach how powerful this is but let me say this it last a long time it last until the day of redemption I don't care how young you are poor brother poor Brother Ray I use him all the time but how long you had the Holy Ghost Brother Ray since 1969 now I was born 73 and I'm 51 so that's about 55 years that he's had the Holy Ghost and it has kept him 55 years amen the seal is good this is the kind of seal that'll last a lifetime this is a money back guarantee from almighty God Amen you can buy it anywhere and he'll stand behind it you can get it in any church and God will stand behind it is't that something I don't care you you buy some things that's got guarantees and you get them at Walmart they don't want to back it up oh you bought that at Lowe's and all we can't back it up let me tell you this you get the Holy Ghost I don't care if you get in the street if you get in the car if you get it in the Catholic Church you get it in the Baptist Church I don't care where you get it God will back up his Spirit yes sir there's a guarantee guaranteed secure to eternal life guaranteed assurance that you'll come out of the Grave amen how do you know you're coming up I got my papers now the powerful thing about this is when a seal comes upon something it actually tells you of an ownership now there's nothing greater about the Holy Ghost than this point right here it means you belong to God it means you are God's anointed it means you are God's Property when a man receives the Holy Ghost God sets a seal upon that person and the Bible said God told the devil touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm let me tell tell you the god of Abraham stands behind this seal this morning amen and if a devil comes near you do you know you got a right to hold up your token and say Satan I refuse you in the name of Jesus Christ when Satan comes to hand you some awful Spirit you can look right in his face and say not in this house Satan this is a house of God I've got a sealed product here God has sealed me to the day of redemption get off of my property get off of my property I say Satan get off of my property I'm a Son of God I've been bought and paid for by the blood of the Lamb sealed by the Holy Ghost oh you don't like that well then watch this Hallelujah I believe in the power of God I believe in a God that can deliver I believe in a God that can save I believe in a God that can fill you with the Holy Ghost why can't we praise him why can't we shout a why can't we tell the devil you can't touch this it's sealed by God oh judgments are falling but we're rejoicing judgments are falling but we're having the power of God death is striking everywhere but not where that seal is death is striking homes but but not where that seal is death is striking churches but not where that seal is God forbids the devil W brother now you may think the devil is an all powerful one well you ain't met my Jesus yet that devil may have claws and you may have him imagined as being the Great and Powerful one that he is but my Bible said Jesus spoiled him at Calvary and he ripped him of his Armen it amen he took everything and even all the way 2,000 years later when the seals were opened on the first seal the first night the prophet said there it is he's got a bow and no arrows amen 2,000 years later and he still doesn't have a weapon listen to me if you got the Seal of God God there is no weapon that is formed against you that shall prosper A thousand shall fall at one side and 10,000 the other but the plague shall not come n thy dwelling I say God give us the Holy Ghost pour it out with power upon the church seal it in Lord seal in every life seal in every heart I know I know you had tie-ins with the devil and I know you know how powerful he is and that's why I'm telling you get sealed in youve seen what he done to other lives but not the lives of a sealed in one he said preacher I tell you I think Satan can do anything he wants he can't he can only do what God allows him to do from the very beginning in Genesis the thir chapter Jesus told him there was a war between the woman seed in the serpent seed didn't he and he said You shall bruise his heel that speaks of the body but it's only the heel folks come on the devil can only bruise the heel you know what he's going to bruise the heel when you stepping on his head amen when you step oh he may he may bruise your heel but you're going to bruise his head he there may be a battle but it's just the heel that's all he can get the heel oh well I tell you he can do this and he can do that really look at the book of Jo before that devil could ever touch job couldn't touch him till he asked permission he said you got a you got a hedge build up around him do you see the secret of your life now even the devil knows you got a hedge and the devil would sift you with sand but he can't because Jesus prayed for you and he thank God for you in the Bible when the devil wanted to touch Joe Jo God fin said well go ahead and get after him if you want to but don't take his life amen even when he set the devil loose he still limited him the devil's on a chain brother he can only do what God lets him do before he ever touches a hair on your head he's got to get permission from God listen amen there's a Bible lay here there's a word laid here there's a seal Upon Our Lives we're not just open for the devil to do whatever he wants God sealed you with the Holy Ghost unto the day of redemption we might as well say it haven't we the devil would like to he would like to take everything you got he'd like to take all your joy he'd like to take all the grace out of your life amen but God has always remained true to his seal and his sign you are under the token it's just time to tell the devil I am under the token brother gersam it's time to sing Our Song The Blood applied amen and the blood ain't just laying here this morning we've not just come to talk about the message we've come to apply it we've come to apply that life on our life and say to Satan this life is sealed by the Holy Ghost and you are forbidden here Satan you are trespassing we are under a token now watch what brother brand says it's the holy ghost that identifies are you positive that you're sealed now watch the now watch the prophet are you positive he said because the token is a positive it is a positive seal let's just say how many I I probably shouldn't ask it but how many of y'all ever been to court been to court you know the worst feeling is when you're accused of something and it's a month to court cuz you got no clue how that crazy judge is going to rule you praying for his wife you praying for his dog you praying for his cook you praying for his mechanic if you knew where he lived you'd send him a a a care package cuz you want this guy in a good mood cuz his your life's in his hands and you're nervous because you you you get the best lawyer you can get and and he can he can assure you that lawyer can assure you look look I'm I'm good I'm Gonna Get You Out of This you sure well I'm G to do the best I can can you promise me well you know we got to wait to hear what the judge says made no promises but I'll represent you well so that's not really Assurance that's not really comforting it it takes the it takes the edge off of it a little but it don't fix it but the prophet of God said that's the way you and I were before God he said we're going to had to stand under the Judgment someday and we needed a great attorney to stand before him for us now look if you just got your church between you and God they can't make that promise to you if you just got you and your preacher and your preacher between you and God he can't promise you how it's going to go he can't make that promise I can't make that promise ain't nobody can make that promise but in this case in our case the judge became our lawyer the judge became our attorney and he said to you and I the case has been dismissed you're not going to have to go to judgment you're not going to have to show up in court there's no more case against you Hallelujah the save grace of God has took sin so far away you said preacher amen that person's a sinner the prophet of God said there's a bleach of blood between you and him that is our attorney the blood of the Lord Jesus and how could you be a sinner without blood in front of [Music] you how do I know how is I how am I assured receive the Holy Ghost and it assures you you don't even have to show up at Court he that heareth my word and believeth upon him that sent me ha passed from Death unto life and shall not and shall not show up at Court you're not going to a white Throne if you got the Holy Ghost you're not going to judgment if you got the Holy Ghost cuz the Judgment has come on the body of our Lord Jesus Christ and I receive the life of that blood stand to your feet with me this morning your case has been dismissed your case has been we're not going to judgment we're going to a wedding supper hallelujah we're going to skip court and go to supper my brother was in trouble one time of the law adri he showed up he showed up about 15 minutes late and judge said what what happened to you he said I got hung hungry stopped for breakfast he spent about 30 days in jail to think that one over but we're going to skip court and get supper Hallelujah and we're not going to jail for it matter of fact we're going to have a worship service for it matter of fact we're going to praise God for it Hallelujah I tell you if you got the Holy Ghost this morning you ought to be the happiest person on this planet if you don't have the Holy Ghost this morning you ought to lift up your hand say God give me that Holy Ghost give me that Holy Ghost if you Hey listen if you had it one time and it's been grieved and it's standing off in the corner somewhere won't you say Lord Jesus I'm sorry I grieved you come and refill me with your spirit this [Applause] morning somebody said well you can't G God like that brother brand said he lied one time to the to the lawyer remember tax case and he said I took a phone call next day he go pray for a sick baby and gun up heray and he said I started to put my hand he said the holy spirit said you hypocrite he said I'd so grieved God he said I stopped right there went back and found that lawyer that tax man and told him the whole story and asked him to forgive me he said Mr brandom I respected you he said but I have great respect for you now and brother Bram said when I corrected that a few days later he said I stand out there at Greens Mill and I was talking to the Lord about it and he said Lord your servant Moses stood one day and stood by a rock and said Lord let let you come pass by me let me see you and he said all of the sudden way in the distance I heard him he said all of a sudden that Whirlwind dropped down in the leaves and he said here he
