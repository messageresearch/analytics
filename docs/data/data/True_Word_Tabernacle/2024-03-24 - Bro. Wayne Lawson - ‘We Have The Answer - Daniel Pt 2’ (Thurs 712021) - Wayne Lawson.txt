of Daniel um we have just a little bit here for the Book of Daniel the 2 chapter um I've uh I think that I I I've done I I tried to pull out mainly what I was looking at in Daniel chapter 1 I just have a little bit tonight in Daniel chapter 2 uh I won't be able to get through this whole chapter of course but it's just something the Lord's kind of just been nudging me this way so I I just want to share some things that I'm that I'm seeing in here in Daniel the 2 chapter let's starting the first verse and if you could bring it up um brother Nathan could I get you to do some reading um you might want to bring your Bible if you want or you can read mine either uh Daniel chapter 2 and we're going to read here from Daniel chapter 2 to verse 30 is it is verse 2 1 to 30 is that okay with y'all if we read the Bible a little bit okay this is going be a verse and in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams wherewith his Spirit was troubled and his sleep break from him then the king commanded to call The Magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers and the Chaldeans for to show the king his dreams so they came and stood before the king and the King said unto them I have dreamed a dream and my spirit was troubled to know the dream then spake the Chans to the king and syak oh King live forever tell thy servants the dream and we will show the interpretation but the king answered and said to the Chans the thing is gone for me if you will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof you shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dung Hill but if you show the dream and the interpretation thereof you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof they answered again and said let the king tell his servants the dream and we we will show the interpretation of it the king answered and said I know of certainty that you would gain the time because you see the thing is gone for me but if you will not make known to me the dream there is but one decree for you for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and I shall know that you can show me the interpretation thereof the Chaldeans answered before the king and said there is not a man on the earth that can show the king's matter therefore there is no King Lord nor ruler that asks such things at any magician or astrologer or Chalan and is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none other that can show it before the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh for this cause the King was angry and very Furious and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon and the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to arok the captain of the King's Guard which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon he answered and said to arok the king's Captain why is the decree so Hasty from the King and then arok made the thing known to Daniel then Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time and that he would show the king the interpretation then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to an anah mishael and Azariah his companions that they would desire mercies of the god of Heaven con concerning this secret that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the wise men of Babylon then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision then Daniel blessed the god of Heaven Daniel answered and said be blessed be the name of God forever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth Kings and sth up Kings he he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him I thank thee and praise thee Oh thou God of my fathers who hath given me wisdom and might and has made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou Hast now made known unto us the king's matter therefore Daniel went in unto arok whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon he went and said thus unto him destroy not the wise men of Babylon bring me in before the King and I will show unto the king the interpretation then arok brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him I have found a man of the captives of Judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation the king answered and said unto Daniel whose name was belthazar Art Thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen and the interpretation thereof Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said the secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers The Magicians the soothsayers show unto the king but there is a God in heaven that reveal secrets and maketh known to the King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days thy dream and the visions of thy Head Upon thy bed are these as for thee Oh King thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed what should come to pass Hereafter and he that revealeth Secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass but as for me this secret is not revealed will to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart God bless his word as you could be seated tonight amen I know that was a little bit of a lengthy reading and and that's the reason we got brother Nathan to do it he does such a a good job amen and uh but but you uh but it's hard to break that up without you hearing the story it's kind of a it's a little bit hard to break it up and I just thought it was such good reading today I thought my it'd be good everybody to be able to just just hear that kind of that is the story of course if you if you continue reading later you'll find that it goes into the actual dream but we wanted to stop with just this portion of this and I want to talk to you a little bit tonight from Daniel chapter 2 I want to talk to you about the dream and and God's answer to these dreams and uh if you if you uh go back and read some things brother brandham had to say is in principles of Divine Healing brother Bram said how many ever dreamed a dream he said let's see your hand he said now most normal people is going to because that's your subconscious we'll call it and listen your subconscious he says now nor your conscience and he's your subconscious people didn't dream a dream at all there's this way back now I believe God deals in dreams that's right King Nebuchadnezzar and Joseph and many of them and so forth he dealt with dreams but a Seer isn't that way uh in Jesus Christ the same he said if you tell me what a dream was and then you can't tell me if you can't tell me what a dream was then you can't tell me what the interpretation is but if you'll tell me what I dream the thing's gone from me reveal it back to me then I know your interpretation is right now brother BR talks a little bit about dreams and shows that dreams is actually and I'll I'll paraphrase many of the things but he'll talk about dreams being a secondary way uh for God to reveal things he actually Compares it to the interpretation of tongues like if you someone would speak in tongues he said now you you know speaking in tongues he said but there there needs to be an interpretation of the tongue before it could become prophecy now uh you you you can all know this and you've been in meetings or in the services and you've heard somebody speak in tongues with no interpretations or something but but but you must realize that there are diverse kinds of tongues and some tongues are worship and praise and and even sometimes they tongues of prayer and uh you've even heard in a prayer line once in a while you've heard prayer when tongues break in there what it is it's a channel of prayer uh that sometimes is reached to break a spirit that's upon a person or something of that nature but it in no wise is meant to be a message to the church but when there is supposed to be brought a message to the church there should be an interpretation of the tongues that would be uh a message otherwise it's an unclear thing so brother mam Compares this exactly with uh tongues and interpretation with dreams and interpretations in other words you you don't you don't want to tell a dream to a church as just a symbol because without without an interpretation it actually causes more confusion than it does giving Clarity to something so if God's going to send something there's one huge things that we know about the Lord is he is not the author of confusion God does not author confusion so sometimes we're all dreamers and sometimes you can get too much to eat or you can you can you can have a rough night you can dream things and sometimes dreams can be symbolic and and they can they can have things you know Christians Can Dream certain things are going to fall or something's going to happen so and it's symbolic it tears their minds all up and they'll start making things out of it and and the devil will get into the thing y'all remember a woman come to brother Bram one time it was standing on White Sands and her whole family was having trouble and when brother BR began to discern her he said well sis he said you see all this trouble and this Darkness he said but but but in the dream you're standing on White Sands he said which means that everything is okay but because you don't know it's okay you're nervous and you're causing your whole family to be nervous so you're see so all of that was coming and in the dream it just it got worse but because she couldn't interpret it she thought it was something bad but when a prophet got a hold of it he said really there's nothing wrong you're standing in a good place but all these things is coming out so so dreams can be both good and bad and so when we when we start looking at dreams of course there's ways to handle dreams and I I can say this to you in in looking here at dreams is is that we we have gifted dreamers here in the church I know personally I dream once in a while and see it but if if there's not a prophet in the land to interpret dreams then then you you see if God gives you a dream that dream will be without symbol you you'll dream a dream in in other words you won't have to a question because the dream you have will be actually without a symbol in other words if you come up you have all these symbols and you tell me the dream said can you tell me what it means brother BR said unless I can tell you the dream I can't tell you what it means so if you give someone a dream and I I'll tell you this for your for your benefit amen that the spirit of cism has long abused dreams itself I I know people when you got ready to uh maybe the Lord was leading you to do something else or go to different church amen there's always that dreamer in the church it comes and say I dreamed your children's going to be struck by this and you're going to lose your ministry and this is going to happen and this is going to happen it's Amen because dreams are so easily used for control and that's why demonic spirits can move through gifts unless they're operated according to the scripture amen now what we're looking here at as we're looking at something scripturally that brother bam uses Nebuchadnezzar to establish something that if God's going to deal with you he deals with you in reality in other words if you're if he's going to show you something in a dream it'll be right out if it's not right out then just lay it on the shelf and don't worry about it because there's not a prophet in the land to tell you what it means and it will become confusion and a place to lose Faith or a place for someone to control you I I can say that without with by personal experience I can promise you that that dreams become a place of control because if you tell somebody what you dream they can take every little symbol in that dream and make it mean something whether it means that or not but they use it for their own good now I know none of you's ever had any kind of experiences to make you go through things like that but but I Brother David I have had a couple like that in my lifetime amen but but I'll say this to you amen but God uses dreams and when God uses a dream amen those dreams are precise and per perfect you know it don't even have to be someone amen who is exactly right to have a a right dream nor does it have to be somebody exactly right to have a right prophecy now here in the Bible King Nebuchadnezzar is having a dream and he is a Babylonian King but God is dealing with him in a dream and he's going to be telling the future not just the future of his kingdom but this man is going to tell the entire events throughout history from his day until the setting up of the Millennium of Jesus Christ can you imagine God would reveal that in a dream amen but when when Nebuchadnezzar has this dream amen it is a it is a very important dream it's a very powerful dream but there is a Vindicated Prophet on the scene to interpret that dream and give direction to the church now some people actually call us Pentecostal because we worship and because we have a good time and shout and praise God Glory well I I I I I I I found some of the same people that call us Pentecostals they have dreams and symbols and then they interpret those symbols and and try to bring direction to the church when really that's what Pentecostalism is is when amen when when you go into one another looking for an answer to spiritual matters amen knowing that that that unless it is a Vindicated profit every situation must be judged with two witnesses yeah I'm talking about some real things here Heen I'm talking about Direction amen because every kind of spirit in the world wants to set the direction of a church or the direction of a family or direction of the life amen but there is going to be a bride in the last day that will have a perfect Faith by A Perfect interpretation of the word of God Amen in other words there is coming in the last day of bride that will have a rapturing faith rapturing faith will be a perfect faith and Perfection of faith can only be established by a Vindicated word of almighty God anything else outside of a Vindicated Prophet there is a measure of error in their thinking or in their dreams or in their ideas so it's not a place that we can build our lives but where we can build amen now I'm bringing this to you for a reason because brother random said when a man comes into contact with God by the answer of the word he said you can't twist it out of that man you can't twist it away from that man because he's received an answer that is greater than he is now maybe maybe you could come and you could have a dream you come to me and you say well brother way I dream this and this and this amen and you could tell me the symbols and all that and I could say well that sounds pretty good and I could say well maybe it's like this and maybe it's like that and and you could put a little faith in it and that'll last a little while but let it get really hard let let the trial get really hard and when when the trial gets really hard amen you'll find out whether you're in cont with God or the intellect of a man and if it's just intellectual it'll break down when the trial starts coming but if you ever get in contact with God it don't matter what happens it don't matter what takes place you have an answer from God and you'll hold on to that answer no matter what it is and that answer will rule over your life because you know that that answer has come from God now now when when I say this I find that in the scripture here of course these These Dreams this dream that has come to Nebuchadnezzar of course it's about world events it's a it's a great big uh it's a great big dream amen and and of course he has Daniel and these three h Hebrew children in his in his uh in his kingdom and you got all these chadians and you got all these wise men you got all these people here now think of this because when this man has a dream what has happened now is the mystery has become a challenge upon who is just psychologically and intellectually wise or who is spiritually wisdom now spiritual wisdom and intellectual wisdom is a huge difference because you can school intellectualism you can school a way to speak you can school a way to understand but you cannot you cannot School the interpretation of something you don't know about from man you just can't school that amen because it takes a spiritual inspiration to bring that in you see what's beautiful is they had all these preachers they had all these denominations they had all these teachers and whenever Nebuchadnezzar has the dream he said come and give me the interpretation and they all show up with joy amen we're going to get to interpret another scripture we're going to get to break it down and tell the king what it means and and they get in there and the King says well I tell you what you do you tell me the dream and then I'll know you're telling me the interpretation and they said wait a minute ain't nobody can do that and he said that's right if I tell you the dream and I tell you he said you've got lme words and corrupt things to tell me in other words he knew that false interpretation come by them having wisdom of his dream but if they had no wisdom of the dream and they told the dream they surely would know the answer to the dream because the same wisdom that could tell it is the same wisdom that could interpret it amen isn't that beautiful that all the way back in the Book of Daniel God was already showing that he would put a mystery in the last day that would separate a prophet from from the schools and the susers and the psychologists and all of the wise who would have ever know that God would put a mystery in the Bible or he would put a mystery in the Kingdom of Babylon Amen to show who really was the prophet in that generation God was not only telling amen the world what was about to come he was telling them that you got a prophet among you that's different than ever suser he's different than ever chadan he's different than ever wise men this man is a different kind of preacher than any preacher that you've ever come in contact with oh I tell you tonight amen you you hear my suggestions and that's what exactly I mean that God would put a mystery in the last day I me of the scripture of the Bible but he put the mystery in there on purpose that he might deviate the difference between all of the schools and Elijah the prophet of God whom God would spiritually discern truth to in the last days can you imagine go back there amen and look at the scripture I I think it's an amazing parallel pull up Malachi CH 4 vers uh uh Verses 4 5 and six I believe it is amen Malachi chapter 4 pull it up now watch the watch the parallel in the scripture in Daniel chapter 2 when they couldn't tell the dream what did he do he told him that he was going to destroy them is that right amen now remember you the law of Moses my servant a commanded in horm with the statutes and judgments the fifth verse behold I send unto you Elijah before the coming of the the great and Dreadful day of the Lord what's the next verse and he should turn the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse unless there is a spiritual Ministry of a prophetic anointing in the last day the whole world is going to be destroyed in the Book of Daniel the 2 chapter the same challenge was being placed upon the church to come up with an interpretation which was completely impossible by their own by their own by their own admittance they said nobody's ever asked anybody to do this cuz nobody can do this who is it that can do this who can tell a man the dream and then tell him and finally the wise men even go as much as to say he said even nobody ever ask it because nobody can do it and the only person that could do it is God and he don't dwell in the flesh Now isn't it amazing that the Babylonians had separated God from Humanity they put God somewhere way out there on a up somewhere way out on the line they put him way out somewhere amen and and and in no way could God Be In the Flesh of man no there was no there was no connection with Humanity in the god that they serve amen but let me tell you this all the while they were talking God had a man right there in their Kingdom that was able to discern and able to tell what the secret of that great king was now it's a beautiful thing because of course they were facing a curse they were facing destruction and so is it in Malachi 4 that the Earth was going to come into a curse unless that God would send a prophet unless somebody could spiritually deserve do you see what we didn't need we didn't need another school we didn't need another person to draw a chart on the map and tell us the timeline of the Old Testament and how it fit with the New Testament and how the gospels come together and how the books was arranged and amen the schools has been doing that for 2,000 years but with every bit of that think of this with every bit of that the Bible said unless Elijah would come it'll be cursed it'll be destroyed and God was saying unless there's a gift that can spiritually discern the need of that hour amen the curse will come and no flesh will be saved but if it would come there would be a Rapture of a church there would be a restoration of faith if it would come there would be a group of people on the Earth who would be an invincible me that would be a group of people with a perfect Faith with a perfect understanding with a perfect Vindicated word of God can you imagine if he would come amen think about this a minute brother Ram tells us this amen he tells us of how that Nebuchadnezzar's dream was to be interpreted now it's amazing that brother Brandon will say that this dream was the thing amen that brought us to that point amen of how that the dream would tell the time a gentile time now isn't it amazing dreams and interpretations is now tied to Gentile kingdoms and the timing of the Gentiles now it's beautiful because brother Randon will tell us this in a message s is this the end time amen he actually what s what time is it he preaches it in 1962 I I would I would say that you should listen to it I I I compel you to go home and listen to this sermon but serves this the end time Amen in paragraph 48 brother Ron begins with six different dreams that has been given in the in the spring of 1961 throughout the fall of 1962 there's six different dreams and the one you know most about of course is Junior Jackson's dream how many remembers the dream brother BR goes high up on a no remember and he was preaching and the water started coming started washing back the the grass and he said while he was standing there there was a rock began to be exposed he said and brother Bram had all of them Gathering up and they were looking on that he said because there was a place there that that that was Unwritten word was being revealed on that rock and had them all gathered up there and brother man said he said to them look on this remember and then he stepped back and he said mysteriously there was a a bar coming to his hand brother B said a sharp tool and he took that and knocked the top of that mountain off and when he did there was word in there that the light had never Shone on before y'all remember that well when brother B tells that dream Amen in CES it's the time he said when he said look on this he said that's being fulfilled tonight cuz brother Brandon was asking the church what time is it and he was telling the dream of Junior Jackson and he said now watch he said what was that first the waters wash the dirt off and showed that White Rock he said what was that he said that was the mysteries of baptism of the Holy Ghost and predestination these things has been talked about down Through the Ages he said but when the top of that mountain was knocked off with that sharp tool he said in there were things that had never been revealed he said which was the opening of them Seven Seals because the whole Bible had been sealed up by Seven Seals and light had never shined upon that portion of the word before how many knows that brother bam taught us that when Elijah comes in Revelations 10 that the mystery of the Seven Seals will have been a total secret up to that time nobody has ever knew what them seals were they were completely shut up brother B said John wept about it because they had been shut up until the end time but jar Junior Jackson was dreaming about it but he didn't know what it was he just knew brother brand was catching a a tool in his hand now y'all know that was in February of 1961 how many realizes amen that in that same fall of 1962 Amen brother beer has a dream remember amen sister Stephy has a dream that's a popular one you all might remember it brother R was having a marriage going in the in the Tabernacle and they brought food remember and she was a little troubled they were eating in the sanctuary and they realized that they were serving a food and it was a perfect food but the bride wasn't perfect y'all remember that and brother R said see it was a perfect food he said it was spiritual food it was a spiritual marriage going on there was a spiritual food being served he said now remember that spiritual food greatest battle ever fought instead of going overseas we'll pack these barrels full of of of perfect word amen remember Christ The Mystery of God revealed he starts it by saying Lord let there be a tape Lo or Baro this morning what was it a prophet was packing the word into storage containers for the Church of the Living God to live on down through this time of this of this of this problems that we're going to have down Through the Ages because God was restoring the church to an answer of a Vindicated word but he was putting it on audio recording have y'all ever think about that that God so loved you that your answers aren't just in books but you heard the voice of a prophet of God give you the answer in a Kentucky English in a humble way amen there's some things brother brandham said had brother brandham himself not said it I wouldn't have believed it but because he said it he's a Vindicated prophet and I believed it every bit the way he said it amen I I I just want to share something with you have you ever thought about this Heen the seven seal tape the original one do y'all know that they stopped that tape amen just about a half hour before the end amen and the next morning on Monday morning brother Brown re-records an an end to the seven seal and puts it on and when that tape goes out for years people thinks that's the tape or the only that was the original tape that was made and on it he said tonight I'm omitting the revelation of the Seven Seals so around the world people were teaching the seven seal had been omitted he hadn't told it but brother brandham had pre-recorded that while he was in his own Tabernacle and he took it with him to his grave come on church but after brother Ram died they released that portion of the seven seal and the portion you have now is a portion he recorded in his own voice of saying I have received the revelation of the third pull which is the seven seal which is the ministry of Christ which was the opening of the and do you see what it was it was the word of God coming to the church and God was recorded to the church now I don't have time to go through all these visions and dreams but I'll tell you this God gives six different dreams here in the here in these few chapters brother beer and sister Stephanie and brother Collins and Junior Jackson and all these dreams were leading up to the opening of The Seven Seals or brother Ram going out to Sunset Mountain out in Tucson to receive the Revelation now brother Ram says watch here there is six different dreams and brother bam held the interpretation of every one of them dreams until he preaches the message serves as this the inside or what time is it serves but in this book he tells the dream dreams and then he tells the interpretations of those dreams and but he don't just do that he also gives a vision so there's six dreams and a vision leading up to brother bradam going out there at sunset Mountain now some people say well brother Wayne what's so important about that think about this a minute now right now we're reading a vision and a dream of Daniel and Nebuchadnezzar which foretold the future amen now some of the things that is in Daniel chapter 2 has not been completely fulfilled yet amen we're looking into the future some of the things that were said are not completely revealed amen but 90% of it probably has already been fulfilled in Nebuchadnezzar's dream and because of the Fulfillment of it we have seen that 90% of it was been already accurate to the very date of the changing of Kingdoms then why wouldn't we believe that the future events Amen in the Book of Daniel would also stand just as accurate as the past events because God was proving to them they wasn't just getting a dream there was a prophet there to interpret and give them an answer are you hearing me tonight Church you may dream the dream but it don't mean it's the answer but when you got a prophet's word concerning a situation that is the answer to the devil's question that is the answer to everything that's going on in a person's life amen Now by God's accuracy he tells these different things brother bam actually says it he dreamed a dream and interpreted the Gentile Kingdoms in verse 121 in paragraph 121 of influence he said everything the Bible has spoke of says here history it's happened the Bible said here his see it's happened now we're at the time of the Rapture it's going to happen see it's happened it's happened it's going to happen because you're watching perfect interpretation of the word have you ever wondered why when brother bam tells that the grizzly bear will be a certain height he'll shoot it a certain way why did he tell 42 inches to the to the Caribou horns why did he say we'll cross three strings and then we'll get a muddy one then we'll get a clear one then we'll fish three days you'll catch two fish won't catch another one why is he telling those things he didn't have to do that but God was using those things to prove to the people standing around him that he had an answer from God according to the traveling not just of the individuals that was walking with him are you hearing me it wasn't just for the men who was fishing with him if he could tell them how many fish they were going to catch tomorrow couldn't he tell the church what was coming down the road and what was going to be we have had a prophet Among Us Church we've had a perfect a Vindication of the word of God in our age and there should not be one question left in the Church of the Living God there has been a dissolver of Doubt among us to dissolve every question whether God is real whether God keeps his word what does God do in these certain situations there should be an answer there in the heart of every believer Amen to declare six dreams and a vision amen watch God gave it to us now in the in the in in the CES this the time we're actually paralleling that with Daniel chapter 2 because it was a it wasn't actually brother Bram having the dreams it was brother Bram doing the interpreting which brought which brought several people into connection to actually sanction amen what the prophet was saying at that time how many realizes when you're listening to a tape and you hear an amen that that actually means something to you now now you may not uh realize this I've actually got a quote here I don't know if I I can find it exactly right now amen but brother BR I'm going tell this he'll actually say to the Brethren while they're there he said now listen you say amen and he's taping this and he said now as you're saying amen he said this tape is going to go out into the world and people are going to hear your voice saying Amen on this he said which is sanctioning that I'm telling the truth I thought oh my amen I my voice ain't on that on that tape but let it be here now amen that I'm sanctioning what he said is the truth because the secrets that had been hid of course was what was going to be preached in the seven seal the ministry of William brandham was going to be unfolded in three different phases of his ministry that would be a first pool that would be a healing that would be a second pool which would be a prophesy but the third pool would be the opening of the word to bring an answer to the church for Vindication that would bring a rapturing anointing into the church see the third pole would be the Ministry of a prophet giving you the answer on the word my when you when you get this you've got an answer from God upon the word of God think about this a minute amen if if someone comes stumbling in here tonight and you're praying about something and they said well I feel it could be this way or I feel it could be this way but if God has used a prophet to tell you what it means there should not be anything to shake you from what a prophet said according to the scripture you said brother Wayne why are you driving this in so strong because I want you to realize something if you're going to get rapturing Faith it's got to come from absolute faith it has to be absolute Vindication it's got to be absolute truth if there is one hole in what you believe if there's one loose feather in where you are the devil's going to find it brother he's going to try you and test you on every fiber of the faith that you are but listen I I've got news for the devil tonight there is a di on the Earth today that is sold out to the word of God Amen what is it it's a word it was a word coming through a prophet that's what it is do you see there will be a message in the last day the opening of this Capstone with the voices of those Seven Seals that's not even WR to WR wrote in the word of God brother man said now watch it took me into that pyramid Junior seen it take him into that pyramid isn't that beautiful it took him into that pyramid amen now y'all know what I'm talking talking about out there on Sunset Mountain there was a picture taken of a seven angels forming the face of Jesus Amen brother R wasn't just meeting some angels something lifted him up something brought them into the Pyramid of themselves how many ever heard the vision of the third pole he said something lifted me up and I heard him say I'll meet you in there come on church this Prophet was not just going to Bible school to learn these symbols and to learn what this Bible was talking about about this was Supernatural instruction by almighty God to bring an answer back to the church my amen what's it going to do it's going to bring Vindication now Vindication is going to be the answer when God fulfills the scripture then the scripture is truly Vindicated if somebody says something's going to take place when it takes place is the Vindication of it doing it of it happening now the white wig of course that you seen out there that picture you see it all the time what's it actually mean now a lot of people says it means a lot of things but it actually means a perfect identification of the Vindication of the message of truth that it's true it's not a third person it's the only person it's the word see what happened out there on Mount Sunset it was the quickening power of God bringing the seals to the church he is the one that opens these seals see Daniel Daniel and the chadians and all the wise men said there is nobody O King who can tell you this matter because you won't tell us how can we tell you you ever noticed in the revelations the 8th chapter in the first verse the Bible said and when the seven seal was open there was silence in space of a half hour now in every other seal there's a horse that rides there's something under the seal but when it comes to the seventh there's total silence there's nothing there in Matthew 24 he's silent on the matter he's silent upon these things because he's waiting for an end time bride who's going to need an answer in the middle of Satan's Eden that can withstand every devil and every interpretation amen if the devil gets a hold of it he'll twist it up and turn it around and make it mean this and make it mean that but if God will leave it a secret until the last day bride and then he will interpreted that bride that hears the opening of the word will be lifted up they'll be lifted up of this Leia they'll be lifted up in a realm of faith and Truth my Lord with an answer from God they'll be lifted higher what is it it's not the intelligence of man it's the quickening power of God now of course brother bam would tie that dream under sunset Mountain you said brother Wayne what are you talking about I'm talking about 1 Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and that shout will be a message a Vindicated word and that word will be according to the prophet a living bread of life bringing forth the bread and we understand that the wise in the last days shall understand oh my there's five foolish and five wise virgins right and the five wise virgins wise virgins the wise shall understand according to the Bible when the bridegroom came the five foolish wasn't ready but the five wise was ready why was they ready brother B said because Malachi 4 makes them ready Malachi 4 brings the bride ready for the rapturing of the church the Bible said in Revelations 19 the wife hath made herself ready how do we get ready brother Wayne you got to put on the garments of the revelation of the message of the hour we have been robed in the revelation of the righteousness of God no wonder Paul said I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ we're by amen whereby is the power of God under salvation amen we've been robed in the righteousness of the word of God do you know that you're clothed in this age in this age of nakedness in this age of false interpretations but there's a bride who is literally clothed and she's not just clothed with anything she's been clothed with the immortality of the spoken word of God which is Incorruptible amen think about it you've been clothed with incorruption in an out of corruption but it's changing the direction of your life and moving you from doubt to Faith and from failure to rising up in the power of God I'm talking about lifting somebody above the crowd I'm talking about what Daniel did brought Daniel and the Hebrew children above the crowd they were lifted by the understanding of Daniel Amen and so is it in the last day that a bride has been lifted by the understanding of a prophet in their age you've been lifted from leard deia to being a bride you've been lifted from a foolish virgin to a wise virgin you've been lifted from just being a church to being the Bride of Jesus Christ a word prde a rapturing prde an invincible prde because you have an answer from God I hope you if you listen to my Sunday morning down them meetings you may be rehearing something I've actually preached a sermon called we have an answer now what what is going on is amen questions come but we have an answer troubles can come ever Which Way but we have an answer do you see what it is job didn't understand the trial but he had an answer my redeemer liveth though the skin worms could eat the body I've already got an answer from God I'm going to have a body change oh when you got the answer Church you don't have to walk in with your down you don't have to be in a lukew condition always worrying about what's coming or how it's going to be I don't know what's coming either but I know how it's going to come out I don't know what trial is going to come your way but it's only gold in your life to build you to a millennial Throne because we're Sons and Daughters of God Amen do you see God did to get you an answer see what happened in that day became the answer do you see what God did in this day to get you an answer if you're questioning the message you're questioning the answer God gave now look if you question it it can't rule over you is that right if you have an answer and you know the answer's right it'll rule over your life so an answer will become the king of your life isn't it amazing in Zachariah 9 it said that uh that Jesus the king would come riding upon the C the F of an asked he would come riding down in Jerusalem he actually said that he would do it how many questions was who's the messiah when's he coming what did that really mean what did Zechariah talk about questions was everywhere but on one specific morning Jesus come riding into Jerusalem and brother R said what was it he was the answer to zachariah's prophecy he was the answer to the whole thing my Lord and those that recognized that he was the answer they begin to worship Him and begin to sing hosana hosana cometh in the Name of the King I tell you some of them were shouting some of them was praising some of them was ripping Palm leaves off of the trees because they didn't have anything they were taking off their coats and throwing it down in front of those in front of that mule because they knew that that was the answer and let me say something tonight if you ever realize that this is the answer for the Rapture that this is the answer for the change of your body body you will worship this word and it will become the king of your home it'll become the king of your life it'll become the rulership of your life my he was the answer to the prophet prophecy they rejected the answer that day what the word manifested right now brother manam said but the same writer Zachariah who prophesied in that first coming he said he also prophesied that second coming and said in Zechariah he said it shall come a day that shall be night night or day but in the evening time it shall come light is that right scriptures are going to be fulfilled the word is going to become manifest a prophet is going to manifest the word and it's going to produce a bride amen that not only has the answer but will become the answer oh Church think about this tonight you have become what youve word you're just as real as the message of the hour amen it's not only a prophet that's Vindicated amen but brother Ram said it like this when he heard those he heard those screams and shouts Hosanna he said what has happened he said what is actually happening he said it is turned from the prophet to his prophecy it moved from the prophet to his prophecy and when the prophecy was being manifest it culminated in worship and praise and power because Faith had come into the Earth oh Church of the Living God Amen think about this Malachi has said behold I send you Elijah Revelation 10 said the seventh angel will sound and the Mystery of God will be finished but don't you ever forget that that book don't go back to Heaven amen that that Ram's Book of Life didn't go back to heaven in the hands of the lamb but the prophet said that the Revelation was handed unto the Bride of Jesus Christ and John was commanded to take the book oh not just take take it but you eat the book John and you become the book John and you prophesy the book John so there is a bride on the earth amen that has an answer for every devil they have an answer for every unbelief God is still alive come on Church you got the answer what you going to do with it you got the answer what you going to do are you going to let it set on the Shelf are we going to let it set in the tapes and on the books I got to be careful but it's the truth are we going to let the answer just are we going to let the answer just stay stal made on a tape or a book somewhere and we're going amen you know even now I don't know how they get this out of it but even now we're going to set her pastor down just play a tape well I am still waiting for him to bring that quote to me I'm still waiting for just one scripture just one script I'd like just one scripture so brother Wayne what about the top of Joseph what about it what about Joshua what about it you say you meditate day and night and put these things and you say what Moses had commanded in the scripture what did Paul say you say what I said what did William brandham say you say what I said because there is somebody in this generation that's got an answer and they can tell that devil back up off of God's Property you see what it is I've got an answer for the devil tonight you don't belong to this devil you don't belong to this generation I have got an Evidence Bible evidence to say you are the property of almighty God I've got a right to adure every devil to knock off every Spirit of unbelief and say Satan has no claim upon your life come on Church the devil's fought me all day to keep me from saying this but we have an answer from God and we're not going to sit down and shut up we're not going to give the platform up to a bunch of unbelievers that's going to run this message in the ground but we might as well amen pull the sword of God throw away the sheep and tell every devil Out of Hell there's a bride coming in the last day to manifest every promised word we are not here without resistance and we know that every devil out of hell has come against this bride amen but we will resist we can do it we'll fight because we can do it but we shall overcome I already read the end of the book I've already got the answer brother Wayne am I going to make it sure you're going to make it I don't feel like I am someday what does that got to do with it brother the word said she'll be a final voice to a final age she'll be that Invincible Army she will overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of her testimony i' tell if I was that devil I'd be putting pressure on you to shut up too if I was that devil I'd be saying don't you dare quote about that bride age don't you quote that bride coming hold off for that a little bit if I was the devil that's where I'd go but since I ain't the devil and I am a child of God I'm going to preach that bride coming because it's where the anointing is in this hour this is the interpretation they say where is he amen where is he born theing K of the Jews Behold The Bride of Jesus Christ that preacher what are you saying I'm saying brother B said everything that was in the mind of God has been poured into the Flesh of the Bride in the last day that's Theus sayith the [Applause] Lord you want to see the face of God turn around and look at somebody you see his face and the hinder part of God's mind this is the visible image of invisible God this is the Amor that God talked about I will not change but I will change my mask not saying that because I feel good I'm not saying good because it's a pepic word I'm saying because it's the word of God it's the truth it's an absolute answer amen there is a power that is above you and Beyond you and moving through you right now to fulfill every promise prise that God made to the Church of the Living God Can You Feel the percussion of it when it hits you can you feel the power of it when it's taken over your body amen this message has a power to claiming power when answer comes into a man he settles his life brother man said the thing I prayed about my whole life wonder what that was the mystery of his will what the mind was before who could tell you that who could tell you where you belonged in the body is in the mind of God before there was a world who who could reach into the mind of God and say you belong a certain age a certain place believe in a certain word who could do that who could tell you from when you came and to where you're going no wise man no school man no intellect man but a prophet of God who was lifted into the pyramid which was the mind of God come out with the answers from God and told us what books and schools couldn't tell us it was the seven Thunder mystery that was revealed to the bride to produce a Rapture Faith it's the answer from God you know I'm telling you the Bible truth after answer is going to come brother Bram said he'll predestinate somebody to meet God in that Ang who's going to who are you Lord who are you he said I the I am I am the present truth the word that is now what was Jesus he was the answer to the prophet's prophecy a true interpretation of word he was the answer Christ a mystery I'm talking about the headship of Christ headship of Christ watch the answer becoming the head isn't that something God gives you an answer but when it becomes the head remember that brother man said show me a church that'll only move by thus sayith the Lord I'll show you Messiah remember it show me a church I'll show you a messiah powerful thought isn't it a prophetic mirror you show me a church I show you I'll show you a messiah a church that'll get under this message is no longer just a church it's an anointed Messiah of the age of live in a walking a Authority with power can laugh at her call her a bunch of Eagle Pentecostals you can call her a bunch of knitwits you can call her whatever you want to call her but God called us the bride but God called us the spiritual church in the last day the believer brother Bram said it he said notice this by by being personally identified by the original headship we we have the answer to the devil's question we have the answer to the Devil's question watch this now in paragraph 583 that devil can't stand it that's the reason these econmical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're coming in to the way they're doing now it's the devil that's the reason they're howling the way they are he said his wickedness his scheme has been uncovered look at that his scheme has been uncovered how many knows what scheme that is in Isaiah 14 I shall Ascend above the stars of Heaven and the North and shall become God brother BR said he has achieved God of this evil age he has achieved this by explaining away the value of this of the word of this age marvelous success in becoming the God of this age by explaining away the value of the message of your hour because he's made it another idea when it's the headship he's made it a teaching it's the headship he's made it a a church or he's made it some idea or some theology it is the person of Jesus Christ coming in Dynamic power exploding in the church by the I am word my goodness what is it amen let the scripture uncover and go into God of this evil age you like to study paragraph 64 brother bam said Satan he said spoke of as the God not of any other age but of this age see and this is the age paragraph 62 when the Holy Spirit comes to reveal what he is the word of God the light will reveal what he is see the word word will reveal what he is when the word is interpreted it'll reveal what the devil is cuz he not that man with them big horns and that Pitchfork running that's not the devil that devil is that guy standing in the pull pit saying well the message ain't really what you thought it was and you can live any way you want and do anything you want but man said there he is crucifying Jesus Christ the second time not on Calvary not on a cross but behind the pull pit not Killing Jesus but he's killing in the effect of the word of God instead of it becoming the headship it is becoming the back pew and it's just another idea but Jesus desires more than just being in the church he wants to be the head of the body he wants to be the head of the race he wants to be the answer that's in your mind he wants to be the power that's in your resolve he wants to be the Holy Ghost that's in your life he wants to be it all brother Ram says it you think I'm beside myself but I'm not we've got the answer it's not him that liveth but it's Christ that liveth in me watch what he says not my idea his power not my idea his power then tell me an answer don't have a power tell me a true answer don't have a power if you really know something to be the truth nobody can back you off of it nobody can tear you down there is power and understanding that's why under the age we're living in it's not a man age age it's not an ox age it's an eagle age amen God sent the greatest power to the end time bride which is the prevailing power of Revelation and what the church needs Above All Things is a revelation of the Rapture people said brother Wayne what's the revelation of the Rapture glad you ask that's a good question it's a good question it's a good question let it set just a minute explain going of all the questions all the revelations what really is the revelation of rapture what is it what what what what really is it what what is that key Revelation you ready we got the answer he said when this bride knows who she is then the Rapture will go didn't you mean the understanding of who you really are is the revelation of rapture then you must be more than some leay all to see you must be more than just some church member that come in here come on chch you got to be something more than just another person living you must be an attribute of a most high God that when the last attribute comes in it'll be the answer to the raptures anointing that comes up upon the church what is it it's the headship the headship is here that's the answer the headship is here God is Vindicated the headship is here my the headship the answer is here Christ the Risen Savior is here where is he brother Wayne he's in you they run around for years he's here he's here he's here I kept saying where where he's here he's in you but the same people that said he's here don't believe in prayer lines they don't believe in altar calls they don't believe in manifestations of tongues and visions and gifts of God Amen if God is in you then all of God is in you all that was in God was poured into Christ and all that was in Christ was poured into the church God didn't put his powerless portion in The Bride come on church he didn't take a powerless portion and give you just a little tradition amen but if God give you a part of himself y'all know the quote he's omnipotent he's all power and if there is any God in you all of God is in you all the power of God is within the [Applause] church I'm in overtime but I feel good Hallelujah there an hour Church you're the bride of Christ so brother Wayne how in the world we're going to get Bible because he's already judged it now I'm in I'm in about three paragraphs of Christ the mystery he cannot pass judgment for he's already judged that body in which I'm a part of you say how am I a part of it here it is it's it's in me it's in me spoken word Original Seed y'all know it here's the secret the word is in the bride Vindicated word not just not just ideas his power could I say it like this the answer is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with that word y'all know it's the truth I hear guessing look what he says the Holy Spirit gave to the church in Christ of mystery if I could get the to see that there is the body of Christ Living standing redeemed sh my we are his victory the church is his victory look what he says in the bottom of that paragraph we are already potentially erased because we have raised from the dead of unbelief in his word from denominational Creeds to an eternal word of an eternal God which is he himself working through US manifesting himself he is the same yesterday today and forever what's he doing Satan is doing everything he can do to keep you from seeing that to see that you're already redeemed you're already aart he's trying to keep you from seeing you are the victory to keep you looking for victory when you are the victory to keep you looking for an answer when you are the answer can you imagine when it brother Christopher when it struck brother random that he was the seventh angel everybody's looking for him can you imagine the moment when it struck him I am the seventh angel what a morning can you imagine that ought to be the same it'll be the same Epiphany to you I didn't mean to slip over in the Greek but it's a good word to explain it is it Satan's doing everything he can keep you from seeing it try to keep you from saying the real meaning of this word doing it notice he's trying to keep you from seeing it because watch now the word moves down in the body from the head what he is the same word nothing could be added to taken from it and as the day comes down into the body down the body vindicating they are one see what's going on a record now of them being the same is the word being manifested now it's because in God of this evil age brother Ram said this has a direct answer it has a direct answer now we know that people will deny this answer as they did anointed ones the end time brother bam said they'll preach Pentecost from the Bible while denying the Vindicated word we see it all the time preach Pentecost from the Bible but deny present truth right but the Vindicated word in his body is his very Victory and the reason of his death now in case you're still looking for the Ezekiel 37 Army to stand brother bam says she's standing on her feet you hear me you're not a sleeping virgin you are a standing army you're not a sleeping Church you're a standing army an invincible Army so brother when that's coming someday know you're the answer Hallelujah my Lord that's when I I got to read this one to you now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride oh my goodness I like to done back flips I didn't even know that was in there do you know that was in there I didn't know that was in there his promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship coming in his bride what are we talking about we're talking about the bride coming of Christ in and through his bride listen to me tonight friend as our musicians will come Daniel the 2 chapter gives us a reality that God has a way to give a people a Vindicated answer to hide it as a total Secret and to make all men try it and fail and then raise up the one who can give the answer he gave them 2,000 years to come up with the answer and they couldn't do it and God took a little simple Kentucky Hill belly and lifted him up into the Pyramid of himself and revealed things to him that had been hidden for the ages shine light you got the answer tonight what you going to do with it you got your answer but what are you going to do with that answer I tell you what we are to do with that answer tonight we are to take it and drive the devil off every bit of our property that's right we should take the answer of God the authority of the word says amen amen and drive that devil off of every god-given promise we have won't you stand to your feet with us tonight we have by God's help a perfect interpretation to the perfect word so brother Wayne do you believe in dreams I do I've dreamed dreams so precise if anybody somebody maybe catch this tape someday they'll know they they can they could call you and tell you if they wanted to dream is so precise to to stand in front of a man in a dream one day and tell him that he had a situation in another town with a young lady and he had a rumor ined and told him the name of the town situations come up that so precise some of the deacons here know such situation sometime just a few years ago the Holy Spirit spoke directly so we believe in dreams but when dreams come in symbols then you need to ride them down and let them be and then see what the Lord does so we have some dreamers we have some tongue talkers we have some Vision I know this personally I've heard it and seen it so people say brother Wayne where's the gifts it's it's here we got to answer it's literally in the body just cuz you don't see it on the floor here don't mean it don't happen some well does it happen every service well that would be a bit Pentecostal wouldn't it so what do you mean by that well we'll just summon up the gift givers then and we'll tell them to operate so then we start operating the gifts instead of the gifts operating us and people will come along with pressure and they'll say well if you got the gifts let's produce it do you know that's the same voice that was on the cross with Jesus the same one well brother way if God was with y'all wouldn't there be more of the there's just as much as God wants in here because it's wide open to him sir whatever he wants to do we have a pasture wide open to the spirit of God if God wants to move this is a place he can move I just be honest I heard brother Brown is this little tape serves us what time is it he said he's talking to Jeffersonville he said you might he said I believe you're probably the most spiritual crowd I preached to and when he started saying that I I mean I got a lot of good friends preach a lot of good churches but Brother Ray I believe it's a spiritual church I preach to I believe people with understanding and spiritual understanding and the depths of the word it's never one thing I like about it you can't get too hard you can't get too simple you can't get too deep as long as the anointing is there it's exactly right is that true now it's just whenever maybe my personality gets involved when it gets in trouble by the way just toward the end of this service I want to say a little something here uh I have come to realize that my personality is a certain way and you can't help that you try to die out to it and brother B said to you on worst enemy and I I probably know more myself than anybody on my worst enemy but I I I found out today that there was somebody in a meeting some time ago come by and said something to me and I didn't respond exactly and they've been a little hurt at me for a couple years I didn't know anything about it I I'm quick to apologize very quick because I didn't I I would never do anything on purpose to hurt anybody so can can I say that by saying this if I have ever in unknowingly cuz if it's happened it's unknowingly if I've hurt somebody In This Crowd by something I say or certain direction or something like you you forgive me yeah would you do that yes would would you because it's not in my uh even the other day I was preaching I was come along and I hit those uh I hit that wine you know which I I ain't going to apologize for that that's true but then I I I moved from that and was talking about the oddness of people and I went over to that uh that oil I can't even remember the name of it now I'm shocked essential that's right and and somebody said to me later said brother why you really whack that good and I thought well I didn't really mean cuz I don't think essential oil is wrong now I had to say that cuz my wife uses that stuff so and I was praying it wouldn't [Music] work and she puts it on her leg you know cuz her legs hurt she said I think this stuff's going to work man it stinks you know and I was thinking Lord I hope it don't work cuz I got to slip in the other [Music] room so so in saying that don't think don't go away and think brother Wings against essential oil if it helps you it helps you I was really meaning that we're willing to SM smell bad because something works you know cuz it it does stink I mean I ain't no apology for that stuff you know it's right but she she tries to get me to wear it all the time she got a little headache stick you know and she I say a I can't do [Music] it we together so so in saying that if if I bump you in a way that hurts don't don't ever don't don't take it that I'm trying to H I really mean that light-hearted but even beyond that so it it it would make me lose sleep to think that I have said or done something to hurt one of God's people I I'm sincere in saying that I if I honestly knew that I had said or done something to hurt you I'd get up and come to your house in the middle of the night to fix that so please if if ever you need just be sure cuz it just it just shocked me to know that I could hurt somebody not even know it so I want to say God bless you all tonight bless and I want to say that we have an answer young people you have an answer tonight if something happens in this world and it looks a little confusing don't be confused by it we already have the answer amen we certainly love you tonight amen let's just sing that together if we can brother [Music] Ben Have Thine Own [Laughter] Way Lord have th Own Way th are
