========================================

[Music] I've tried so hard to see it. Took me so long to believe it. And you choose someone like me to carry your victory. Perfection could never earn it. You give what we don't deserve. Man, you take the broken things and raise them to [Music] gloryy. You are my champion. Giants fall when you stand undefeated. Every battle you won, I am who you say I am. You crown me with confidence. I am seated in a heavenly place undefeated with the one who has conquered it all. Now I can finally see it. You're teaching me how to receive it. So let all the striving cease. This is my victory. You are my champion. Giants fall when you stand undefeated. Every battle you won. I am who you say I am. You crown me with confidence. I am seated in a heavenly place undefeated with the one who has conquered it [Music] all. When I lift my voice and shout, every wall comes crashing down. I have the authority Jesus has given me. When I open up my mouth, mirales start breaking out. I have the authority Jesus has given me. When I voice and shout, every wall comes crashing down. I have the authority Jesus has given me. When I open up my mouth, mirales start breaking out. I have the [Music] authority Jesus has given me. You are my champion. Giants fall when you stand undefeated. Every battle you won. I am who you say I am. You crown me with confidence. I am seated in a heavenly place undefeated with the one who has conquered it all. I am who you say I am. You crown me with confidence. I am seated in a heavenly place undefeated with the one who has conquered it [Music] all. I am who you say I am. You crown me with confidence. I am seated in a heavenly place undefeated with the one who has conquered it all. With the one who has conquered it all. Amen. [Applause]
