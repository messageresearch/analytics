young people [Music] just want to thank god for the opportunity and confidence that our pastor would have to speak to us if you would like let's go ahead and open our bibles to we are not releasing vbs to our first scripture and we're going to be going to the book of exodus praise the lord how many are happy to be here tonight they had this opportunity to worship the lord [Music] we're going to read a little bit about the story tonight of moses and we're going to continue on our message to preach in the spirit amen are you ready for the subtitle was was kind of hard on me even that amen we're going to find out how that affects all of us whether we realize it or not let's start here with verse 4 and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses rose up early in the morning and went up onto the mount sinai as the lord had commanded him and took in his hands the two tables of stone museum and the lord descended in a cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed the lord the lord god merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped and he said if now i found grace and i say oh lord let me my lord i pray thee go amongst us for it is a stiffness people and and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for ghanaian health actually let's go back to verse 7. i mentioned it and then i skipped it and this is one of the key verses we're going to be hitting tonight verse 7. i read part of it but not all of it keeping mercy for thousands for giving iniquity and transgression of sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children and to the third and to the fourth generations amen now let's go to first peter chapter one and we're going to start with verse 18. how many i can hear those bibles turn i like that to speak god's word amen for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was before the foundation of the world now i want you to take this person it was way before the world began but it was manifest in these last times who by him do you believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god now but the message of the hour came to reveal the bible the message of the hour came to reveal the bible i like to turn it around too the bible reveals the message of the hour praise the lord seeing that ye have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit and to unfeel love of the brethren that word on thin there means pure without hypocrisy is i'm gonna get to this verse a little later on almost like you got to stay with us lord jesus thank you tonight as we report as we have surrendered our every part of our being to your service lord and we pray that your spirit will open up our understanding and you help us to realize the great things that you have already given us now bless your word to each heart for we ask it all in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ now this is my third message on the breach in the spirit the lord is bringing this out to me he brought it to me from a different angle a wholesome tongue is a tree of life that word wholesome there means is a palabra passively significant healthy is lovely it means a quality of words coming out of your mouth or off of this tongue are nothing but life so a wholesome tongue is a tree of life and how is it that we can have a wholesome time because the scripture tells them you might be must come out even jesus told the religious people of that time and we went through that in our other messages that that battery is something that has continued to happen to each one of us from the time that we were born on this planet amen the word bridge now you know i had wanted to preach this message a little sooner and i actually had the opportunity to do that and i i just didn't feel right about it yet and i'm gonna get personal with the young people is that okay establishing [Applause] how many remember what the holy spirit said to our pastor two sundays what is the enemy actor what does he want to take away from us what did he take away from samson what does he want from you anybody what i can't understand there's lots okay i'm sorry these masks don't help me that much okay the secret amen good job sister praise the lord that that secret that that part of the mystery my goodness do you know that you are a part of the mystery amen according to the message of the hour he says we are a we know the condensation down to our pastor the husbands and so forth but he says in christ the mystery releasing that we are a part you know the difference between samson and you and i is the difference at one point all of us we didn't know our part of the mystery no but to you young people that have not discovered what that secret and you will live this life how he would reveal himself in the last days isn't that always the question [Music] i'm now in this scripture here in first period it talks about the vain conversation of the conversation the tradition of our tradition he says our conversation in times past and why we acted the conversation is actually behavior why did we act and behave the way we did because of the main traditions that were brought down through our family tree familiarity if you're getting into some delicate stuff go ahead and play that first one gentlemen up there funeral ways maneras are connected with our ancestry amen they're connected feudal things not connected to valor all right that's why the word vein there in the scripture in first peter 1 it is my what a word worthless the word that really gets me out of all of these is this next word and i want you to take it in a one of the definitions we all know is prematurely born but watch this it also means imperfectly formed or developed to terminate a procedure prematurely oh that one gets me yes young people over this if we want to get to this part of the secret abort the process or stop it in its early stages that's the only chance the enemy has to keep you from finding out who you are in christ what your part of the plan of god is amen you're justified you repented and you were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen how many have been sanctified oh my now remember sanctification is a greek it's a compound greek word that means cleanse and set aside for services and the bible says we are washed ephesians 5 by the water of the world [Music] [Music] but the future home of the heavenly bridegroom with the earthly a hard time forgetting so many things we wish we could forget that first of all your memory each one lived at least 20 years we know our prophet never literally preached the message the trail of the surface he mentions it in six messages all preached in 1965 it one of those times how could that tell the serpent be where god's place of worship could be [Music] every day of your life los errores that we made puerto rico and and the feudal ways that we traveled we we didn't know any better no no not why is it that when we get so close to what we've been struggling for is when you get to a point and you realize you can't change yourself and some of the things you're doing you know they're wrong [Music] is let's go to the next clip gentlemen no more what really bothers me is to see people in and they don't want to change nokia in cambia and when you come to this message you must die to all of that my mind itself in your heart if you terminate the procedure you'll never know what it's like to have the nature of your soul control your spiritual justification sanctification baptism of the holy land the prophet says he's the prophet are completed you've repented and but until you receive that gentlemen how about you two more clicks and then we're going to go to a quote understanding go ahead next part the liberation la liberacion from ancestral bondage that the the escrow de los ancestres happens not with perishable things no a contest such as silver or gold dark the liberation la liberacion from ancestral bondage that the the escalator de los ancestres happens not with perishable things no a contest such as silver or gold tacoma liberation but i i need number five they're doing a good job and you people think hey well why do why do i do certain things that i do because you picked it up from your father you picked up all these things and and you and you and you walked in that way you stay camina play that one again that's a good one baby and you people think hey well why do why do i do certain things that i do because you picked it up from your father you picked up all these things and you and you and you walked in that way you stay camina how many of you thought why am i a but you don't understand what's amen now let's go to our first quote gentlemen the first one i gave you over here so as they put that up there okay exactly the next one we already already so what part of the journey what stage of the new birth would it be easiest to what's up and you know through the years we've seen this over and over and over people start they they come to the lord they're just so in love with the lord is [Music] to the third and fourth generations and i parents as your children grow become teenagers in your 13 14 15 16 17 18 years old and then all of a sudden one day you see them do something that you used to do before [Music] to be transmitted into us as a excuse the expression but with young adults with clean minds through a sexual birth is but how bad do you want the new birth who wants a new person worse than anything you want it you want it so bad that you can taste it with actually two of them that's like the virgin the word virgin means created where they aborted the process of the new version they stayed there so they could not be liberated from that ancestral don't tell me you've never seen something somebody got your always i'm not a preacher like somebody i'm not a picture like some others that's what you pretty good tremendous speeches but i like to make people think i like to make myself think i'm stupid doesn't it i like to make myself think because sometimes i know brothers tell me i'm kinda just don't get it [Music] how was he baptized next paragraph 368 please after he laid his hands upon them they were then after being saved and sanctified they were filled with the holy ghost brothers if i'm bringing water you got it i want to keep going now maybe i didn't give you the next burger the next no no the same message you put her back it's my fault guys i maybe didn't give you this this paragraph is incredible is that okay it's paragraph 369 guys i'm sorry i didn't give it to you up there maybe you can get it if not i'll go ahead and read it here okay i'll go ahead and beat it right now don't get it my bad for nothing here we go 369 water blood spirits arguable to speak to he's talking about the elements that came out of jesus when they pierced them in the sides [Music] that's a real crude word that was wrong [Music] that brings all these ancestral and give unto us a sanctified holy vessel that's when you can break the curse of the ancestral [Music] iniquity [Music] you begin to things that didn't used to bother you now bother you that's why i got here when i heard our thousand pastors said what bothers me god is trying before the great and terrible day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers notice the scripture doesn't say hearts there notice it says [Music] of god back to the apostolic in upon the children i haven't and those children are going to grow up to be fathers [Music] [Applause] i'm an apostolic you know i have a list the famous list of one thing things that said one time and you know the scripture says that every word be established not at the end of the world is [Music] and if you go look and see how the prophet uses that word you time's about right next book and it's through his holy blood that we [Applause] and we have the blood of jesus christ you have to if you're safe but they don't realize that that ancestral curse continues to follow them and about the time they think they're going to get somewhere the serpent comes right through that trail back to them here yeah can you give me that last vote so encourage this anymore encourage everybody anymore can you give me that last one enemies fight it's the next verb don't get it you gotta get your distance i didn't give it to you guys let me see oh i need to give this one two useful by that it'll be so encouraging to you [Music] [Music] i'll just tell you in brief what it says [Music] it's the next paragraph of the same message you get the power for the moment he says you know the eagle is visited upon the children [Music] your righteousness is also visited upon yourself what you do upon your children [Music] one of these days melissa diaz will all gather together the most often on the other side lord jesus christ we love you tonight forgive me lord if i cut this message all up
