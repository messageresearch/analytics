========================================

was really bad and i was just trembling trembling and shivering like as my body was shutting down and it was real bad and my my my mom was with me and she just prayed for me she was there she prayed for me and and then like instantly i was healed and i just want to thank the lord for that and i'm gonna be playing these two songs for you christ alone and ten thousand reasons god bless you [Music] hmm [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] he knew jesus knew his power walked beside him day and night saw the blind man brought from darkness saw the dead man brought to life but he somehow missed [Applause] [Music] hanging tree i wonder why he didn't know there was forgiveness but he chose silver over streets of gold still jesus loved him and would have saved his troubles all he had to do was ask for that what judas didn't know [Music] i know jesus walks beside me when i stumble it breaks his heart but still he loves me [Music] but the saddest thing i know [Music] [Applause] [Music] then [Music] [Applause] overstreet [Music] all he had [Music] [Music] so [Applause] book of proverbs chapter 22 verse 6. train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it psalm 27 1 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid uh when the wicked and even my foes come to eat my flesh they will stumble with their phone sounds some 50 63 when whenever i'm afraid i'm i will trust in you john 4 24 god is a spirit and they and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of [Music] yes and joshua the son of nun called the priest and said to them take up the art of the covenant and let seven priests or seven trumpets of ram's horns before the ark of the lord proverbs 1 8 my son hear the instructions of my father and do not forsake the law of your mother [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is we have come again tonight lord to attempt uh this meeting and to pray thee to open to us lord this a third seal of this book that it might be known to us that we would know what to do and how to live and how to be better christians now tonight we're going to read uh from this blessed old word again in the sixth chapter and we start tonight with the third seal and that is the fifth verse of fifth and sixth first now in the fifth verse and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come see and i'll be held in lower black horse and he that set on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts saying a major wheat farm a penny and three measures of barley for a penny but see thou hurt not the oil and wine and there was no man in heaven no man on earth no man beneath the earth or nobody was even worthy to look at the book see now just think of that then the lamb comes forward and he takes it for god john was asked not to weep anymore he said behold the lion of judah has prevailed and and he can take the book and open it so he turned to look for a line and he saw a lamb the elder called a lion has prevailed but when he come and looked it was a land coming out from the toilet or he was bleeding for the people intercessing for the people until the last that was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation world come in there's just going to be so many of them there and that's it that's all the others won't even want to come and have no desire to come again and so then when that last soul comes in then the time of redemption is finished then the lamb comes forth the plane his rights to what he has redeemed and that's all creation then he said he is worthy to take the book of redemption now it doesn't belong back to the judge anymore it belongs to the redeemer and he's done done the work of redemption now comes christ you see him in the 10th chapter of revelations this right let's discuss him if you'll notice the first rider who he was and we found out last night scripturally that the second rider was exactly the same man only he was on another horse what happened he changed his ministry right we found out he was an antichrist and it changed his position now watch where we have tonight that other church age now or come down to the third church agent just exactly on the third church age is just like like the third horse this rider is the same one but another stage of his ministry now john sees him on a black horse he changed something else he started riding him in the time of the dark ages that's what the dark horse represented the dark ages for it was a time of midnight to the true believers that was left his balances are his scales in his hand you see calling out measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see actually that is wheat and barley is natural staff of life that's what bran stops me from but you see he was charging for this what it means that he was charging his subjects for the kind of the hope of life that he was standing out to them by making it started in that very time of making them pay for prayer charging for praying they still do it no penis because what was he doing capturing the wealth of the world the scale of weighing out measure of wheat or if any three measures of barley for a penny the rider on a black horse see he was making stripping his subjects of their money when the bible predicts that it holds about the wealth of the world now notice you see where that old money taken in church comes from [Music] to build an organization a big something million dollars charging for prayer by the priest to pray people out of purgatory charging i'm taking this round of history charging for i guess it's novena i guess what everybody knows don't be here i guess that's something you have to do you know some penance somebody had to charge for that notice here's the good part now notice that thou hurt not this wild [Music] just a little bit of it left brother don't you touch that [Music] now oral is symbolizes the spirit the holy spirit amen i'll give you a few verses if you want yours two scriptures in leviticus 8 12 where aaron before he went ahead be anointed with the order you know and in psychiat 4 12 the oil coming pouring through the pipes and said this is my spirit or another thing if you want to see matthew 14 25 there was a foolish virgin 25 3 the foolish virgin had no oral no spirit and matthew 25 4 the wise virgin had all in her lane spirit-filled spouse oral tempify spirit and wine symbolizes stimulation of revelation oh i like to run over the place when they wake up the neighborhood the lord showed me that [Music] stimulation of revelation okay all in one in the bible is associated together always i got the concordance look the street of that lag is like that where wine and oil goes together all the time see because revelation has been given of a truth of god and the true believer filled with oil and the revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that he makes him behave himself a [Music] normal [Music] what does it say to this rider in black don't you hurt my wine and my oil don't you touch it my wine oil i've got just a little bit of it down there but he's still a little bit there that's up to you you're going to pay for it down there but when you come across that wine or you leave them [Music] i was here and i and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts what was it the lamb [Music] [Applause] that bar well now sir not the four beasts but the lamb was the one that said it oh my god the lamb not the four beasts that announced this the lamb said itself well to the best of my understanding and the best of that i know and with all that i believe in my heart that's the true meaning of those three seals i want to thank god for it i'll say this that it's a revelation that he give me he gave that to me the revelation and i do believe that we're living in the last days [Music] wonderful [Applause] [Music] god bless his word let us stand before we sing that song this morning we're going to open up

prayers you want to get right into the word if we can chapter and the eighth verse and we all know this by memory if you can we can can we can we repeat it together jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen matthew 21 verses 10 through 11. you have it you can say amen reads like this verse 10 and when he was coming into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this once again is jesus yes jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee may god add his blessings to the reading of his word and you may be seated what a thing we find here as we go to be like jesus number 17 a prophetic class does that resonate with anyone here today we have been so blessed to be able to have received the revelation of jesus christ one of the greatest privileges that i have had in my life is to be able to work with my with my uncle abraham on this book of revelation project for africa in africa i have learned so much i continue to learn continuous i have been blessed so much and the more we dig and that's why the book of revelations is my book liberty apocalypse okay i want to know is there anybody is it you guys this book no again stand up and say it like you mean it that's right correcto you believe that huh anybody hear any sisters over here is it you guys's book couple of people raise their hands i can't even go on with my message unless first of all you i know that it's your book somebody would try to take it from you what would you say again what would you say if somebody was trying to steal your purse that's my purse wow we're stuck brother henry we might as well close up shop let's go home let's come back next sunday okay i want you to stand up if it's your book there's no demon in hell that can we see that the book of revelations is our book my book and your book those that are part of the bride of jesus christ i came across a video this past week and it happened to be an atheist talking to a bunch of uh of college students and they were he was there answering questions anything that had to do with religion an atheist answering questions that had to do with religion the more i heard him i said my goodness he seemed to have a wealth of knowledge and i don't i don't go around listening to a bunch of videos on atheists the look of bewilderment in the young people's eyes and their face as the moment he would begin to answer the moment you could see them right away began to question what they claimed that they believed and i said that's where we live today it's so easy to get influenced by something you hear the said influence yeah somebody that speaks very eloquently very educated somebody who's read a lot of books somebody that has studied a lot of mucho i remember one student specifically asked him well what about all the prophecies of the bible because he said the bible and and jesus probably didn't exist he says uh uh uh what about the prophecy of the birth of jesus he went on rambling blah blah blah blah blah blah didn't make sense jesus fulfilled over 600 different prophecies of the old testament jesus and many of them were fulfilled in the last seven or eight hours of his life he said well jesus didn't tell the truth well jesus because he said that some that were present would see his second coming oh if i could have just had a few minutes with that with an open heart lorraine that is my wife and if somebody says she don't exist she's not there's not a real sister lorraine really because just because you've never met her somebody's never met her does these are the things that i want you young people especially to really get a hold of so in his captain you want prophecy the whole book of revelations is one continuous prophet what are the odds of a of an entire book coming to pass 100 with god goes on to say i don't believe anything that's spiritual or revelation or any of that kind of stuff you've just denied your very existence existencia for the real you and i are not the body we live in the real you and i it is the spirit and soul that dwells inside of that blind think about that for a moment as i as i continue to hear in a little bit i said my goodness that they're prepared when they hear something that is an uncertain sound so easy to be influenced nowadays and at the end of his this discourse i i i found out as i was listening to him that everything that he said he was quoting some other fallible man el esta and in the midst of it all i'm saying you do know that those are men you do know that scientists are men you do know that all that write those books they're men and you decided to take what they wrote and you came up with your own conclusion i would rather take my chances on 40 writers when i looked at that i said my goodness not one of them that he that he quoted could claim that their findings were a hundred percent correct or accurate inconclusively yet everything we believe is not just factual but it's relevant it's true and it continues to come to pass because there's a prophetic class of people when they they and they find out [Applause] only a prophetic class of people know that true because that is becoming this esso because that eso is becoming this and this yester is let's let's go on and let's as we as we get this foundation built in the message the revelation of jesus christ this meaning the book of revelations is you're not going to say nothing no it's not it is the most official book is my goodness this is the only book that christ put his seal upon it it starts off with a blessing and it ends with a curse and curse it is he that takes anything out of it it is the only book that christ wrote himself you say but he wrote the ten commandments he wrote it with his finger amen and the jews hold on to that but the bride holds on to this the book of revelation of the apocalypse your book is your book your book all right satan hates your book anything he despises most is genesis and revelations saying that it's not authentic and you know why he does it is the book of genesis the first and the last genesis has more symbols because it's a book of prophecy it's a prophetic book so brother sam your book is a prophetic book my that's my book therefore it has to be understood by a theologian any smart educated people here hinders even if you don't raise your hand there we have we have some very intelligent people but it's not understood because of your intellect it has to be understood by a professional [Applause] a prophetic hmm [Applause] people but to the ones who are the lovers of god's word i know many love to watch tv television they're lovers of so one division they don't even have to put the lines where that came from somebody was telling me the other day i'll give myself stuck somewhere tell you what it is but this can only be revealed to lovers of the word solos am i talking to anybody that's therefore when we see the manifold revelation of our lord who he is what he is if any person shall add something to that you've ruined it all come on you got to follow me this way if anyone adds anything to that then the this doesn't come out right because this is many have tried to say that something later than that that but that that's the book of revelation but that is the complete revelation of the lord jesus but we love it you will recall that i mentioned at the beginning of this message the actual revelation of jesus himself just take ordinary studying that means it will require the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse to verses how we need she's the only one but very few making it make it as simple as possible that's why as we have spoken in the time in times past what is the attraction there's an attraction a prophet comes on the scene there's an attraction amen there was an attraction in our day a true sign when those that are believers the attraction but only a prophetic class can connect the dots this is sunday school we want to see if we want to see about learning this morning and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me terry means to wait and we have a hard time waiting we struggle because we are too distracted a lot of things distract us what he had promised to that was going to come how many are really here this morning make sure you pinch yourself but you could say we work long hours and we give everything to our jobs when we come to church and we're just filming i'll send the holy ghost upon you it shall abide with you forever even the spirit of truth who the world cannot receive what will it be like when the holy ghost comes in the conversation of the father he told us to wait what is the what will it be how will we know just like jesus because in him was the fullness and if we are to receive a portion of it and it's his life yes how can we actually he that's what the holy ghost was given for it is this when i look in the mirror that was spoken and you're gonna find out that in our lives this either this it's the answer to those questions if you don't know what this is you'll never answer the question believe this thou this what is he doing he's bringing it to our time he didn't say believe is thou that no no he never he brought it to us and he says believe us thou this this that is right before your eyes when the prophecy is fulfilling that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet we have the prophets you have the that you but you're having a hard time with this that's okay for my brother or the pastor or my parents but it's not okay it was that which was spoken unto you by god that's where people we've never been able to get over it and we live today in the presence always looking at that and that event yes it's what ends up defining us defeating i listened to a man just one day i won't say names because it doesn't matter it doesn't help anymore but he was pointing at an event that had happened to him 20 some years ago and he kept saying and then this is when this happened yes this happened and i was like poor man he got stuck and he became same story you sit down with people and they'll tell you the same stories sometimes i say brother sister you you've told me that you're going 100 times and i see them they're stuck and that's all they you went through that it's fine but but you gotta grow from that you can't i'm not talking to the average church church member you're talking to the people now watch this now romans 4 18 romano squadron in english to save time who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be it was spoken over here so shall i see [Applause] don't you love it when you've been sick no i'm not being sick when you've been sick and god heals you and you look at your healing i've struggled for years and you look at your healing mira your healing is the this and the promise that ask anything in my name what has to happen my mind had to submit to the word come on now i'm going to say it again my mind has to submit to the word that's when this is one of our days one of these days our whole being will completely submit to the word only those whose names are written in the lamb's book of life will not be deceived this is so the church was contaminated this and right now the holy spirit is wanting to come into you wanting to reveal things [Music] working in my members or is this the holy spirit there's no other there's no other besides you know in my birth for my birthday i remember brother brother diego says he said i was praying for you the whole day didn't pray for nobody else but you no europe and he said i feel i feel led to tell you people his holiness a new birth lord [Music] baptize them over and over has been over again with your holy spirit so you know that was my that was that that was my request and i see him fulfilling do you believe that young people i said i see that being fulfilled because he promised that now watch this now are you still with me we got lots of time today comfortable just don't hit your neighbor oh man okay i want you feeling good but it's pretty hot up here do you think it's hotter now that's okay we'll still go forward just think this is in the message thirst just think father how perverted that he can make that's that spirit of antichrist that he can make the real true word how they can say oh we believe the bible come upon the siblings we don't believe this we believe this was for another age we believe this is because some denomination twisted our minds into that cesspool so we can't believe that this that it really is [Music] ain't nobody going to tell you anything different different word it's just there's so many things that are just so beautiful that are in the scripture peter said that on the day of pentecost this is that esto is why do you think they were doing it for for those 10 days in the upper room they were waiting yeah also i believe going through the scriptures i'll pour out my spirit how many are getting me this morning i'm making this as easy but watch this now acts chapter 2 verse 14. but peter standing up with the 11. lifted up his voice and said unto them is [Laughter] revelations but it that i will pour out my spirit upon all but the romanian people flesh i'll pour out my spirit and your sons and daughters shall prophesy why is this so significant significantly because the holy spirit had only in the body of jesus was a fullness when that body was taken up he rips the spirit out and he sends it back to the church now watch why that's so important because up to that point it was in him the fullness but on the day of pentecost he pours out his spirit there but it's not until the end time i hope that you get this especially this is that is the promise of the father this is what's happening but once his spirit is poured out into the church it but in the end from son of god to son of man it's a change it's coming around the corner now and when everyone is waiting over here they're saying this is that this is that even today this is [Applause] peter being filled with the holy ghost he understood there were parts of that joel's prophecy and that the only parts of that prophecy that was fulfilled was fulfilled at that moment was the first part that he said and he said this is that which was spoken but the rest of joel's prophecy was to be fulfilled at the end especially watch this now that's why when the holy ghost fell and we get that what what what did it do can you say they said this is that surely it was this was that is now the prophetic class that catches this they were okay with as long as the revelation of jesus being son of god as long as worshipping in the spirit i'm going to speak to you all we love the lord of the lord is good you're okay with this but when a prophet walks out on the scene you're not okay with this that was him getting his spirit and pouring it out you get it come the holy spirit fulfilled [Applause] i gotta i gotta just take i gotta get calm because this is this is i want you to get this here comes the prophetic class acts 2 17. i'm going to go 16 first it says this is that which was spoken of the prophet joel semicolon and then he turns and begins to speak of another day because what was going on there was not the last days peter knew that there was a manifold revolution now he stops and he says they're all stuck on i'll pour my spirit out here in the revelation for the last days [Music] why is this so significant significant is because the holy spirit had to that point as i said had only embodied himself in jesus christ and when that spirit began to be began to pour out they're stuck in feeling apostles jesus [Applause] don't say that i'm saying but if i claim to be something and i'm just repeating what another prophet okay he said that i said amen come on now there has to be scripture i'm going to say it again there has to be who lucha and those people that follow are the prophetic classes they are the heirs for without the ministry of the son of man the title deed book of redemption but jesus died he gave his life that's wonderful somebody had to claim it that's right and if there was no one worthy to take it then it would stay there in the a prophetic class a prophetic oh my god can i have like maybe like 15 minutes or so yeah all right let's go we were up late so you're not the only one that's up early late the morning who knows what time and the phone was going off and his brothers his brother's sick and his sister's sickness all this coming in i'm like praise god what else can i say about praise that's why i had to preach this morning i think mother abraham i said brother abraham i don't know how long we'll be with my dad but and he was raised you just tell me i'll be ready to go leah how this almost always points to something or someone present that you is many times something that has already been said or spoken that becomes what we fix our vision is that right brother jerry okay how did you say that brother jerry the one that's looking after that el camino is the only one that can say this is that you cannot he's the one that can point out that's right and that is used when describing something beforehand yes or something but this it comes to the present and he's the one that is pointing out that i was always intrigued as i said brother branham when he explains matthew 16. on this rock i'll build my church so what is that it always intrigued me you would say the catholic church said it was built upon peter you know sometimes nowadays we say why does that matter we just believe jesus don't matter to a prophetic class wasn't going to build it upon peter nor upon and i'm going to go down this chapter and i have like i said about 10 12 minutes that i that i'll try to try to keep my word the best i can when i look at this and i'm just going to read this because there's a lot of scriptures here i just want to read it just in english but he can interpret when i when i when i i bring something up and watch this now verse 14 then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth this is to make him he knew that they were trying to make him savia king but wait a minute those are some good grapes oh my god he knew that they were trying to make the this at that time the that was not to be fulfilled he said i would not allow myself to be taken by force he knew that they would be getting ahead of god's plan he was to be king and the people that believed him knew it but not at that time he was a redeemer going into a priesthood misinterpret now watch john 6 27 now and juan says so much and i and i feel bad when i skip things because it's so relevant labor not for the meat no which parishes but for that meat everlasting life this which the son of man prophet shall give unto you for him hath the hath god the father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them go ahead and interpret jesus said fairly barely i said to you moses gave you not says no that breath he gave you bread yeah but not that bread is you the true bread from heaven and then verse 34 unto him lord evermore give us this bread oh this is that is now they're asking him now he said lord senor give us present this breath this is that jesus said yes i am the brethren [Applause] it came he went from i am the bread of life watch this is a tremendous thing he now says this is the bread for a moment because once again here he goes he says i am the bread of life but he also knew the words he was speaking they are spirit so the spirit of their life he also knew that yeah this is the bread which come down from heaven if any man eat
