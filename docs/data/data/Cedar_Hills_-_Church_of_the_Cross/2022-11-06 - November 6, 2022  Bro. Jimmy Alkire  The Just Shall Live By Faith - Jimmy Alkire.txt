house of the Lord to be able to speak to God's children and asking for your prayers God will help us bring this little subject the judge shall live and really what we're after is the approach to the sanctification yes and we're going to see that without a true understanding or Revelations will never be able to approach sanctification I've been doing this almost 40 years now that doesn't necessarily mean anything of I haven't learned but through the years I was just mentioning to brother Ben up there if we had all the people here that have come through here silver and here in Las Cruces we would need a tabernacle that would hold at least 2 000. and what what happened is that many but they never get past sanctification foreign The Book of Romans chapter 1 Romano suno versus 17 and 18. versus amen how many brought their swords this morning how many soldiers about four minutes ago so I'm gonna do my best to not go over and out of course for me okay or therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith be part of it as it is written the just shall live by faith I wanted to stop there let's say it together for the just shall live by faith vivira have you ever wondered why it doesn't just say the judge live by faith right and it puts the sense in the future why does it say the just shall live by faith instead of just saying the justice you know the intellectual mind might ask that question but um God wants us to live in the future no no it's not we'll never get to the future without living today by faith today but it's showing you the characteristic of what this justification is it's always going to make them continue to live it's something that starts and it's something that goes foreign many people think that the process of the new birth to be justified to be Sanctified and then receive your I'm going to say it like this your first baptism of the Holy Ghost is not going to justify you anymore he's not going to sanctify you know it's not going to give you another baptism of the Holy ghosts you've got the total package you're already ready for the Rapture the sad thing is at his differences with the Pentecostal Church yes they thought when they got to that point to receive the baptism of the Holy ghosts and he goes no you're barely at the point where you can begin to grow and we have new people here us middle and older people as a matter of fact even though there's about 100 of us that are gone or more we still got a decent crab this morning there's much more of us middle and older folks than what we realize I never consider myself oh I never consider myself with that said and then then we're here because we want to continue the judge shall live by faith and and then it's right in the in the verse here why shall just person live by faith well the first part of the verse says for Darian is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith he's not going to reveal it to you all at once now let's take this word righteousness the Greek word is foreign consistent giving to everyone what is do them loving through the theaters exactly and then equity and that's just now talking about what God is doing is the important or consistent distribution of what Justice is amen now here's the key to all this it includes a lot of things and many times you don't see these things until you get in certain situations in your life when you begin to wonder why this and why that foreign and to visit the widows uh to keep yourself pure from the world is True Religion yes and then what is this producing us what is this righteousness produced in US Conformity of heart and life into the Divine Law uh Conformity of heart and life to the Divine Law Allah now we speak of the Divine Law we're speaking of the word of God the law of Grace we don't want to get into what the law was and what Grace is amen and I like this on Justice The Virtue which consists in giving to everyone what is then it goes to the word impartiality Equity is the impartial dispute distribution of Justice where did these attributes come from Psalms 98 verse 9. up there my dear brother amen before the Lord for he cometh to judge the Earth with righteousness shall he judge the world and the people with equity Isaiah 11 4. I say yes but with righteousness shall he judge the poor you know who with equity and and reprove with equity for the meat of the earth and he shall Smite the Earth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay though he couldn't respond that's what his Justice will do now before we go any further what does God base the Sun how is he to his Justice going to give each person it's all based on his foreign he knows the end from the beginning and sometimes I like to say he knows the end from before the beginning amen because he thought about it but there was no beginning until the word was spoken when he began to express the word in the beginning we're going slow this morning now on this I'd like to go to our first quote foreign amen [Music] I don't know why the the letters on this brother Eddie are our large journalists cutting off part of it so I know you you're doing the best and he's doing awesome job let me get it on my tablet I don't want to admit I don't want to leave out one word amen how many love the Lord this morning yes now you can maybe read it holy see how it cut part of it off on this side I just want to make sure I don't leave anything amen okay and we are the children of Abraham Hallelujah not as Isaac was but his Royal seat through Jesus Christ by the faith Abraham's seed coming forth in the last days to shine like the stars Abraham's children considered not his own body dead I don't want to read all that let's go to the next paragraph 2 30. he did Abraham didn't even consider his own body that was dead as far as producing a child by the way he was only a hundred years old but he didn't even take that into consideration oh you're an old man it's not based on that I don't even consider that is revealed to you when it really something you can't make it happen it's got to be revealed to you then you don't even consider anything else how impossible it is don't consider what the doctor said it doesn't say don't respect what the doctors don't confuse things here no no no no consider it in other words that's not going to dictate to you what your decision is going to be no no consideration about what your health is going to be your health is not determined on what the doctor says how much more Are Spiritual salvation spiritual Satan tries to tell us this and this and this about this all foreign [Music] it wasn't even brought into consideration oh my that shakes me body dead the deadness of Sarah's womb we're not even brought into consideration 232. no circumstances will be considered circumstances When Faith Finds Its betting grounds foreign or what you have been what I have said many times and the prophet says this is you must believe what God says about you yes more than what you know about your own self so if Abraham didn't consider even his lack of productivity as a man um how about us can we not consider everything that we've had in our life up to this point justification the the Justice the righteousness of God to be impartial is because he knew that you and I would accept this message he knew that you and I were going to receive the Lord Jesus Christ knew that we would go through this process that we would stick with the process let's continue now let's go back now to Rome I'll go to Romans 4. Romano verses three through six and as you would say we're going to get into the nitty-gritty we're going to enter into what makes you tick what motivates you yeah and this is where it gets a little sticky yeah and sometimes we don't like that because it makes us feel uncomfortable but how many want to feel right with that foreign amen amen verse 3 for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness it wasn't based on what how he felt yeah it was based on what God had told him and we could go into many details how he could have gone by what he felt but now let's continue in the scriptures now him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of death but to him that worketh not myself but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness now let's go back to the first part of that verse Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him as righteousness it's not something he had to work himself up to it was something that was revealed to him but watch the one that works now notice the eth as I've said many times those were to indicated something that starts and that it's continuing until it produces that's what this is but now it's going to talk about a person that wants to do work but Allah right but him that worketh not believeth on him that justified the ungodly let's go back to verse verse before that my brothers verse 4. um yes now to him that work worketh is the reward not wreck and the graceful of death first of all why does they use the word salary well when the person approaches it like this they think somebody owes them something yeah well at the roots of it what does this mean yes if you do what you do to begin to sanctify yourself because you feel like you owe him and many people ask them why they approach sanctification they start to dress right they start to grow their hair or cut their hair like you know all the requirements for men and women [Music] they're beautiful in the eyes of others they look like they're really holy want to be right how many you want to be right how many want to be holy how many want to show Christ through your your body there's not one of us here that wants to go out and be a devil knowing [Music] it's not a reward record of Grace when a person then takes the attitude that what they're doing is a work of Grace because they haven't understood even what Grace is it's the unmerited favor of God yes so they repent they get baptized I've seen this for many many years they continue a while continuing and then all of a sudden they're gone no matter how many times we call them on the phone try to show them brother we miss you I'm talking over a 30-year period look at that I'm talking about just right now you're going to misunderstand what I'm saying but they never approach sanctification correctly they did under justification the Lord Jesus to the best that they understood that sacrifice on calories died for them but they still don't live right and why don't forget your past sins are forgiven amen and I'm calling the prophet now but the desire to do those things that God forgave them for in the past so it's going to continue how many want to approach it correctly space that's not based on Grace but it's based on what he did for you at Calvary as our Pastor said last Sunday how many remembered that message what a tremendous message if you don't truly receive the Revelation that you are Justified how can you ever be born again I might have not said it verbatim just every little word that's as close as I can remember I would have to go but that's the gist of what he was saying um without that see Nestle that God has Justified you oh brother Jimmy quit beating around the bush tell us what to be just means what justification is yes but I'm making sure that you're following how many are following it doesn't make any difference that I'm saying it in one sense because I'm not the important one here neither are you individually but it's us together in Christ and Christo that's the goal islameter that's what we're after it is so without that correct Revelation yes you're gonna always do things for a wrong mode now what is the word Justified let's nail it uh justification is the act of justifying to be just trying to be right um Vindication indication defense defense oh is God defending you yes see what is the justification going to do then at the end of the court case but that Court was all done through Jesus Christ he took our place so that we can take his place was the judicial sentence the Declaration of Innocence he declared you innocence through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ the famous quote we read all the time as though we never did it to begin with through this declaration and always will be one of those Sons and Daughters of God that was rejoicing in your salvation through Jesus since before the foundation of the world in his great thinking so you're rejoicing in your salvation and to Salvation Caleb also managed in that quote yesterday last Sunday and I use that in Juarez so let's go to that quoting serpent seed brother up there serpent seeds paragraph number one amen how many love the Lord Jesus how do you how many would like to know why God would vindicate you've been uh but what is he going to vindicate what is he going to Defenders thank you no no he knows this as a perverse but he saw something Beyond this let's read the quote amen dear God the Great and Mighty God who formed All Things by the power of His Spirit has brought Jesus Christ his only begotten son who Philly died for we Sinners for the unjust foreign way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time the lamb was slain yes it was at the same time the same body of what we would call time is it but at this part here he was not working in time what he was working was in an event that he was going to make come to pass in the future remember time with God is and you're a part of God's events did he sell you in this event amen and and at the same time in his mind instrument he saw the lamb he slayed the land because he saw that you and I were going to fall and how is he going to leave us in that condition okay now let's continue reading yeah when God in his great thinking shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation to Jesus [Music] Christ this is what he's going to base his justification on this is what he's going to base his righteousness his just decision to to decision to elect us since before the foundation of the world when he saw us rejoices the foundation Jesus I want to let that soak in a little bit okay we've heard that so many times what does it means if he saw us rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus Jesus the lamb he's already slain foreign foreign yes Glory and wipe away the memories you know another statement our pastor made last week is that justification it's not just for The Sinner yeah it's for the Savior yes Salvador he went through the same thing but in order to manifest the justification the Declaration the Declaration that we never did it to begin with he had to go to Calvary but he couldn't stay in the grave foreign just means you understand as you approach sanctifications foreign [Music] and you are already Justified he justified and those he's Justified he has already glorified glorificado but it is it looks like he skipped sanctification didn't it he said if these people my children in Las Cruces can truly be justified by faith and they understand it's me vindicating what I've already thought yeah they'll go through hell or high water to make it y'all go to sanctification not go through the loss of friends Amigos don't go through anything sanctification ain't gonna stop them because I Justified they're glorified conditions I can see it every moment around my Throne I can see that Celestial body I can see that glorified State oh I know they're gonna stick with the process nobody discourage them they're not going to focus on what anybody does to them focus on the purpose of God has put down in your heart the problem is the problem is friction comes among people in the church no no your ability my glasses though no not here not here because we can see God doing that in ourselves but we don't see him doing it once in a while I hear somebody says oh brother this that in the oven oh I don't know and this and that so let's discuss this is all right let's listen to him for not very long because I don't like that brother sister hermano hermana did that person die for you yes did that person justify you yes that person raised from the dead for years oh and by the way uh is this where God Wants You is this where he's placed you in the body yes very spiritually in the body of Christ universally and then here locally is this what God wants many times in Silver City these things would arise people say brother if this you don't tell this is your place I'll help you if I'm not the man that God has ordained to see you through then he's got to be somewhere you better you better get down to business with God and find out where you're supposed to be because get rid of the people and I tell the people oh this is where God wants me uh they all answered me that way when I get down to the nitty gritty by the way I say oh there's not that many so don't get any ideas and I go then if this is where God wants you see no devil yeah no situation nothing take you away from what God has placed for you no they can now look at it because if you leave your place God has placed that church is going to suffer the whole thing like like how many believe that how many have read the adoption then I have no business looking at somebody else that I think is not doing their part doing what God called me to do I'm standing in the bridge I have that characteristics through that seeds pretty good little over half that'll increase the middle as you get the revelation if I can believe I'm a part of the Bride I think otherwise but goodies and don't just you know look at it that that way brother Tommy says one time I'm Not Gonna Leave Nobody behind you said more than one time I'm sure you've heard him saying our pastor now brother Caleb he's got the same I we are not gonna leave no one behind the woman because we know that God is working in his people my can you imagine what am I not in his thoughts and his thinking is already forgiven you yeah what you were going to do when you came to Earth salvation is isn't that what we're doing here this morning are you rejoicing in yourself exactly what his thinking was when he justified he's defending what he thought about yes what you think about yourself oh boy I started she stopped moving right there I don't know about you my my that makes me feel like Giant a giant well you're only five foot seven no I'm probably not even a five foot seven minutes as you get older you grow right Amen brother but I'm not talking about Brothers [Music] why when that bride she wakes up comfort and shine like never before yeah amen and we're doing good on time so far I've only been going 40 minutes [Music] oh my God so when he saw rejoice in our salvation it was the Vindication of the scriptures in job our Spirits rotated out of God remember this is not based on time as we know it but our Spirits rotate out of God out of this great light yes and man we start running around the church going around that logos and we're going around that logos foreign damn angels as Los Angeles and everything was so happy before the foundation of the world it strikes in me you know they will pay for it how is the devil Ever Gonna Keep Me in the dust of the earth he just can't do it that's right how is he gonna he's talking about if he dies how is the devil Gonna Keep Me in the dust of the earth if my spirit as the Son of God the Creator created in the form of a spirit and form of the spirit the one his plan is finished foreign about you bye we love the Lord Jesus now I would like to go to the scriptures as we tie this into sanctification sanctification which means let's say together sanctification sanctification cleanse and set aside before sir we've heard it future home of the Heavenly bridegroom with the Earthly bride uh you set your mind in order she's talking about this mine is no that's not the mind this is just the computer what do you think they got the idea of the computer from here he's talking about the mind of the spirit of the spirit that he went placed in the heart that will control this computer this mind this carnal mind the brain is no longer be able to dictate to you and me what we're doing there's something in the heart that is so Superior yes that from the inside out there comes a Divine Supreme control control like I tell all the ministers they're all younger than me now most of them you know and you get excited when you're going to preach and sometimes your nerves are just and you're getting a little frustrated because you don't want to defraud God's people okay I promised I would never stand up here and defraud God's people yeah I hope your picture don't go too fast and I say much little boys do you believe in God those that speak English and those that speak Spanish don't you think he wants everyone to understand so simple we make it so complicated oh by the way what is anointing yes I jump and run all over the place anointing is supreme control is control I'm not your control I don't know about you no no I don't you it's all done don't insult yourself because you're one of God's people you how many believe it with all your heart getting close here but let's go now to chapter 38 of Ezekiel because we're entering into sanctification we have the approach now we enter in to be cleansed we're already Justified God's already declared our innocence through the blood yeah just to feel better to to not feel guilty because we no longer feel guilty we're going to go through this process of sanctification because our Lord and savior Salvador won't do the same thing is people say what didn't Caleb say last Sunday justification wasn't just for the center yeah that's why to his resurrection foreign thus will I magnify myself and sanctify myself and I will be known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that I am not isn't that a mouthful leave that scripture up bro I mean I'm just sitting here I'm almost slobbering you know thus will I magnify myself foreign amen I'm no longer my own I am bought with a price I don't just know Jesus as my savior Jesus no man can call Jesus except by the Holy Spirit I can't say he's my the possessor of me you don't know me in control of me if the Holy Spirit John 17. Juan this is yet oh I see he's going to go through the same process everybody important how many have read this scripture is beautiful read the whole chapter it's wonderful John 17 7. sanctify them through thy truth from difficult Thy word is as thou has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world [Music] doesn't that make you feel good yeah he's he was sent into this world and now he's sending us in another place the same father that sent Jesus went in Jesus when he sent them and when he sends you and me I'll stay the same Jesus Mundo all right verse 19. the next verse and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth in other words if I don't sanctify myself [Music] if you don't sanctify yourself how is the rest of your family going to be Sanctified let's just bring it down scripture and then we'll have two quotes real quick and then we're done other times about God Hebrews 2 videos for it became him from whom all whom are all things and by whom are altered and bringing many sons unto Glory to visit up to make the captain of their salvation perfect through something like Gloria Perfection is next verse 11. for both he that sanctified and they who are Sanctified are all of One is piados set aside for service and then the Holy Ghost comes in and put you in the service he's going through the process for which cause he's not ashamed to call them bread aren't you happy that he's not ashamed to call us a Brethren said we're going through the process last few quotes amen get it up there for me please watch this and we're gonna probably jump through this just to not beat it off he is the bridegroom took away your shame he took away and put it in the sea of forgiveness [Music] and by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's right that's what the Bible says your first husband that you were married to to the world the people talking spiritually okay spiritual mental okay everybody understands it yeah [Music] which foreign just go down here it's almost like two paragraph 263. a lot of photos you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now this is this is in the month of November of 1965. I think 65.00 this is as though you never did it because now you've been Washed by the Water of the world when it says as though you never did it means as if you never did it but here in sanctification sanctification the complete manifestation of what you are still not known so there's part of you as a human that did do it but through the spirit of the word and the blood the Lord as though you never did it and you stand Justified you'll never see it and notice how his time justifications of the Water by the word without that foreign okay I don't want to read the rest of that just go to our last quote things that are to be reaching 65 also because uh things that are to be here we are the Bible said so Jesus said before be there for perfect perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect a perfect people come on and the carnal mind writer says not me no no no not this no Esto because you have you stand [Music] [Music] when you receive the Holy Spirit manifestation amen that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word Sangre amen the blood the word of God bleeding blood is not talking now about a physical blood but the holy spirit that the spirit the spirit that came out of the blood yes [Music] to the world the dripping bloody word the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride amen yes sir it's in your cheese stands perfecta virgin unadulterated how it changes this is manifested he doesn't say as though you never did it she never sinned in the first place he sees that manifestation he has to declare she never really did nothing it wasn't her yeah that's what it says she was trapped into it see there is the father's house that he's gone to prepare amen are you happy
