like to eat how many love to eat i love to eat too so today we're going to cook a very very special dish let me kiss my breath it's so special that the main ingredient is what i didn't tell you so that's good the main ingredient today is going to be patience something i have very little of in fact as i did this show i realized i had none but lord willing by the end of this show i'll have a little more patience so before we get started with our show it's going to be live but i got to take you back one week oh just thinking of this gets me alright so i had my first show ever on tv and i hired a new chef and i had all confidence in him he did a great interview i thought man this guy is the cat's meow turns out i couldn't trust the guy he ate all my inventory do you guys believe me or not yeah yeah well i don't think you do because i i want to show you a little video of this man that's how bad he is so you just sit back and enjoy [Music] hello hello hello hello hello hi hi is the camera on okay my name is chef linguini and welcome to my bakery today it's so nice to have you we are going to be cooking some hot delicious gooey chewy fabulous fantastical brownies and today we got a very special employee he just started here at the bakery so i'm very proud of this young man i have very high expectations for him so let's put our hands together for mr chef chubby cheek chicas hello how are you today very good so today we're going to be doing the brownie it's a very important cornerstone to the baking world so today we've got see brownie i just put them in and i'm just going to take them out you know it's just that fast on the cooking show and they're already ready to eat but chef it's very important to know that these brownies are for a wedding so we must let them cool off because they're going to serve as the bottom of the cake so if you eat the brown or if you touch the brownie too early they will crumble and melt i got to go take care of some visits in the back here i want you to watch the brownies garden with your life and just don't touch them okay they're very important this chocolate came from paris [Music] so [Music] i'm almost done [Music] what chef doesn't know won't hurt [Music] that's [Music] why [Music] don't come back [Music] okay okay so i shouldn't have been so hard on him right yeah but the little meatball did it i cannot believe this it makes me so upset just to see that again that's all i had for the week and he ate all of it so after thinking about it this last week i said well you know it's not very christian of me just to kick him out he has a family to feed so in front of you all i have invited him back to come see if maybe he's a changed man over the course of the week and i also want to apologize to him so with that said i'd like to introduce chef chubby cheek chicas [Applause] [Music] are you doing good all right i hope you don't eat me out of this place again i was hungry you know i was hungry you're always hungry stop it i'll give you the spoon [Music] okay so today are you okay okay so real quick do you know what patience is i mean you okay i don't know why don't you help your friend out um it's when you be quiet oh who taught you that is he right no it means that it means that you wait for something right that's the perfect answer did you hear that you wait for something you don't take it by force okay so why do you think it's so important to be patient can you tell me why is it important to be patient uh because you wanna patient yes yes i think we all can agree on that but yeah i know you can tell me okay so it's very important to be patient because you will burn the brownies or you take them out and they melt all over but in this case we want to talk a little bit more in depth so it's very important to be patient because god he has great plans for each and every one of us he has very great plans for all of us but we have to go through a season of testing in this case he did not pass the test i asked him to watch for five minutes that's all it was and he could not do it i come back and he's licking the pot so today we're going to make a little recipe here you want to help me chef chef all right so it's gonna call for two heaping cups of you guessed it patience so go ahead hold my mic hold it for me it's gonna call for two whooping heaping cups of patience let's see there's a cup there i think we can just i think that will do a heart full of love well this will be our heart and it's full of love that's pretty good a dash of laughter show me your laugh [Music] don't make me dump this flower on your head you show me your laughs oh my gosh and a sprinkle of kindness so what you do with these ingredients is you combine them all together patients love kindness and a little bit of understanding with a dash of laughter and you want to serve this to everybody you come in contact with for your entire life does that make sense so let's let this cook for a little bit again i have something very important in the bag that i have to go take care of okay can i trust you this time chef yes yes okay i'm going to be right back smells good [Music] [Music] raise your hand if you think i should do it [Music] no ready if you think i shouldn't do it oh he doesn't have no help i'm almost done no chef's coming back i think pink butcher better make him think he can trust he yes i trust well maybe maybe i'll pray dear lord may you give me the patience to not eat this delicious soup in jesus name amen well i'm a new man so see what we do just checking and do it be wrong i'm just watching you don't mind me i'm still busy back here shouldn't eat it do i think i should eat it do you think i should eat it or no i'm guessing uh um [Music] well i have a scripture i'm going to read so the recipe says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into temptations knowing that the trying of your faith works patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing okay let's see how's our soup coming along perfecto and you didn't eat it great well you don't think it's so mad my goodness i just asked you to watch it and ask me to eat it anyway all right well i approve of your honesty and you are welcome back at my kitchen anytime and i will be inviting you again to be on linguine live okay all right can we give him a hand so i'm very proud of him for two reasons first of all he didn't eat my soup segment second of all he came back and he was a good sport and he allowed me to trust him so what's so important about this is that sometimes we pray for patients right we want to be more patient in certain things maybe it's with our brother or sister but a lot of times god will continue to give you the same test over and over and over and maybe you're praying lord take this test away i want to have more patience well the way he's going to give you the patience is by giving you the same test until you can show that that is no longer a hard thing for you to get over so like my brother here his temptation or his test was the brownie he loves to eat and it's very hard for him to pass up food so when these brownies were sitting there the first time he fell and he wasn't able to resist it second time comes along and he did better and he was given a chance to prove that and so i want to just pass that along to you all today that we must be patient when we go through a certain test just know that it's going to work patience and patience will then help your faith to grow and you'll be a better christian in the long run so don't get all stood up when you have to go to these tests it's all to help you be a better christian how many want to be a better christian amen so who can now tell me what patience means you told me i think she can tell me when yes you wait on the lord amen let him be the one who opens the doors let him be the one who takes you to the next step of your life don't try to force it open just let the lord open the door for you and you can simply walk in and be a happy christian boy and girl so i thank you for coming to my show today we look forward to seeing you next time may the lord bless you and we'll see you next time okay can you play my team music just got to dance when it comes on until next time uh man everybody hear me yes okay [Laughter] it's crazy because like it smells good up here smells good so just how many kids enjoyed it if you really liked it if you really really liked it from your heart you're gonna say amen as loud as you can go ahead [Applause] okay that was good but there's one problem though i didn't hear you buddy okay how many older children liked it [Music] all right so let's go ahead and sing that song i will morning feeling fine [Music] i woke up with heaven on my mind i woke up with joy in my soul [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] i oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]
