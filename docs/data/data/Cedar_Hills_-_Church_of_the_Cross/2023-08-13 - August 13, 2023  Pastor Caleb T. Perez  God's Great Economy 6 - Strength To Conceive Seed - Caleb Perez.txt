but but uh but give me just a little bit of time those are on hooked up God bless you people from all over the United States different countries that are on right now and I hate it may you receive what you are looking for this morning amen as we approach this subject God's Great economy number six and uh we want to put a subtitle maybe sounds a little strange but if you know your Bible you know exactly what we're talking about we put a subtitle to to strength to conceive seed is amen let's if you can be so kindly as you're standing let's turn in our Bibles to the book of second Corinthians the 13th chapter and the fifth verse Cinco when you have it you can say Amen it starts off and it says examine your brothers yeah no no let me make sure my Bible reads right here examine your sisters hmm examine everyone else okay read it with me examine yourselves now tell your neighbor neighbor let's examine ourselves whether ye be in the faith well you gotta examine yourself to see if you're really in the faith and prove your own selves I have to prove nobody out prove your own self that ought to take our nose out of people's business and I get an amen this morning amen it ought to take our nose out of people's business no ye not your own selves foreign may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated what a scripture it is it tells us not to be critical of our brothers and sisters don't be critical of the pastor of the ministers be critical of yourself amen I could pray and we could dismiss and that would be enough words that would be enough word to for the rest of the day and the rest of the week just so that we can uh we would live this we know a lot but we don't but but it's hard to live things investigate yourself investigation system this is what the word is telling us investigate yourself inspect yourself inspection and when you do you'll find out you don't have time to investigate your neighbors I'm telling you the truth this morning you would examine yourself you would not have time to examine nobody else let's be honest with ourselves how many want to be honest with yourself you know it's kind of funny when you're talking to people and then they say now can I be honest with you and it's like well were you not honest with me before how far are we willing to walk with the Lord to look within yourself are we willing to go any further with our relationship with God estamos is let me see if is there any hands it's because it's easy to raise your hands just so everybody else is doing it I want to be left out are we willing to go further with our relationships let me see how many here are willing to um once again you got to be honest with yourself because there's times that we know okay this is like I just can't go on anymore anybody here I tell you I've been there before and and we say yes but there's always something that hinders us I want you to listen closely this morning there's always something that hinders us and that something is fear yes though we can act tough okay we're gonna do it many times it's fear that hinders us from going any further cause of the fear yeah is the more we we many times stay in the same place for years am I talking to anybody here five years ten years it's the same thing yes same routine raise your hands same thing over and over and over again and you wonder how can am I getting any further with the Lord what's this fear things what is this fear really I want you to ask yourself that question and you do that right now fear that hinders me I'm going to tell you what it is that will go no further with God till we're ready to pay a greater price are you with me once again we fear that what is it going to cost me what's the price I've gotta pay to get further with God as I said before if it's taken a sacrifice to get where we're at how much more a greater sacrifice because if we don't pay a greater price we're going to do what they say why because we don't want it to get harder oh come on now come on now you know even if you don't agree with me that's okay I've been around a little while you hear people say all the time seems like the harder I try the enemy hits what's the problem are we in a battle or or do we come to a parade what are we here foreign no no yeah we think that way I I'm a human being people then would ask my father how do I get where you're at um good question huh and his answer was easy walk where I walk that easy hello everybody hola todos as ministers we want to be powerful we want to pray for the sick and they recover we want to preach messages that'll shake the foundations of Hell fundamentally but even as ministers we're not willing to pay a greater price we don't know what it's like anymore to pray all night come on you want to have an effect you want to shake the foundations of Hell a greater price a sacrifice you've got to make Jesus Christ paid the price he has paid the price of redemption but there's also a price that we pay so that we can take Redemption to the world he would say walk where I've walked growing up I would see the sacrifices that our founding Pastor would make the price that he would pay in order to have a Ministry that produce something sacrifices necessary to be in a position we will see more Revelations how many of you want more revelation are you in a position to receive it is if you watch TV all day long then we go go to bed and our Lord show me a dream give me a vision give me something sacrificed you haven't prepared yourself what kind of vision you want right I saw the sacrifices that my mother and father made in order to raise children in the admonition of the Lord early on is when I I figured it out that there was no shortcuts have a life worthy of the Gospel I'm going to say it again there are no shortcuts are you with me say it again there are no shortcuts to having a life worthy of the Gospel when you try to raise your children right what do the children say wait till I grow up I ain't gonna make my children go to church that happened in here I ain't gonna I ain't gonna raise my children the way my parents raised me but the moment instead of stopping and seeing the product and saying I want that it is I want that for my children oh no we have a better way of doing things nowadays making them twofold Childs of Hell everybody you're going to do it your way that's God's way let's go on with this message he with me okay we're putting a foundation here fundamento they don't raise their children teaching them what it is to sacrifice and therefore nowadays this new generation doesn't know anything about sacrifice an airfryer ninja ninjas no I'm not here I'm not here to promote ninja good stuff though ninja yes there you go oh no this is now they don't know anything about sacrifice you know why because because the parents don't teach them anything about cells serious I got some I I gotta filter through these thoughts I really enjoyed brother brother warumo on Wednesday I'm talking about about Isaac and Abraham and here comes the sun and said well data here's the fire yeah where's the sacrifices you're the sacrifice we're not used to that are we we're not used to nowadays making sacrifices I mean I mean at four or five in the morning we were driving however long to get to Sunrise Service anybody yeah yeah the parents do you feel like going mijo if you felt like going down what we're doing they don't know what they want no you understand we wanted the easy route too but we had to go here middle of the night driving all night where do you find that anymore don't this thing I can't stay at the Marriott no I I just ain't gonna go what do we do we sacrifice we come to this place in our lives and we love the revivals the fires but we don't have the sacrifices come on church are you with me we don't have the sacrifice we're too busy with our jobs and our and our businesses and so forth it used to be that we would sell whatever we had to go on a missionary hello everybody I needed to go on a missionary trip I didn't have the money people will say today well I don't have the money so I ain't going you have to have a heart for that what would my wife do she would make enchilada dinners yes I would go trading my vehicle I didn't have to make the payments so I could use that money to go on a trip it was instilled in me that's my heart I'm willing to make a sacrifice to leave where I was at at home and to come here to Las Cruces we were born and we were showed what it was to make a sacrifice but we don't do that no more you know why I I don't have the money used it all to buy all kinds of things foreign we used to want to go to meetings and have fellowships now we want to stay in our little group sometimes just consists of our own little family stay here I don't want to go to meetings I don't want to go fine let's see how far that takes you we used to make sacrifices for everything but now I've done that for so long let somebody else do it yeah that's the best one in the church right now you don't say that when you got to go to work how you're going to pay your bills huh yeah yeah there's a responsibility then a responsibility it's a sacrifice comes with this is going to hear tapes and read books read the Bible to strengthen our Inner Man now all we care about is the outer man oh we're into ice baths I've been to some ice baths I'm not knocking that what I knock is that when that becomes more important than the spiritual there's a young man the other day are you going to say where I was at because I'll give him up in the mirror and he was just relaxing foreign I wonder how your spiritual man looks spiritual oh come on you know who I'm talking to he's having okay go to the gym do you put in your spirit most important of all come on why we don't have strength to conceive the seeds spiritual man has no strength says if your spiritual man came out that would be weaker than the broth of the shadow of a chicken that's half starved is that right amen come on how strong is your internet inspect yourself are you with me just still put in the foundation fundamental yeah there are no clock today so we don't care [Applause] I Dreamed a few nights back I was looking at a certain lady in the car Mirage in my dream I I knew that it was the church he was typing the church there was a man that was asking her to and I saw that that lady and I just I said don't you dare gold I don't know which which of you are struggling sometimes we don't know maybe we should go maybe we should leave maybe we should whatever I don't know but I looked at her and I and I I shook my head and I said don't you dare this this woman looked back at me and says you want to have some fun anybody here looking to have some fun don't take you nowhere it'll take you to death notice this now Romans 6 17 Romano says we begin to unfold let the Holy Spirit unfold this message to you when you have it you can say Amen but God be thanked huh I like that but God be thanked Emperor gracias that ye were the Servants of sins that form of Doctrine which was delivered to you which was the which was delivered to you I want you to take note to this the form of Doctrine every Doctrine watch how tremendous this is this form of Doctrine is what forms you into the stature of a perfect man our founding Pastor said this I suppose that the only way to preach this gospel is to give it the way it was given to us I like that one the only way to preach this gospel is to give it the way it was given to us the way it was delivered to us any alterations will hurt you and will hurt me this form of Doctrine is the only thing that can form you and I is into the stature of a perfect man this is the reason that people cannot follow today is it because of the form of doctrine that they've been given is praise the Lord when it comes to that form it becomes hard and instead of going full to abandon the faith we say all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church and all we think about is oh signs and wonders and miracles that's not all that was in Christ all that was in Christ the form of Doctrine he delivered to the church how many got the package UPS well Uncle once said right hello was it UPS that delivered DirectX FedEx or we'll see it was once delivered to the Saints notice this now we end up fighting against God I was telling a brother the other day so I can be honest with you I said as a younger as a young Minister coven one of my greatest fears was seen all that my father went through as a minister as a pastor I always carry that in the back part of my mind it was hard to see things and I would ask myself the question as I would see what he's what he would go through friends abandoning him Amigos not all friends I said some friends it cost him his wife Esposa it cost him his health it cost him so many things and I would ask the question am I willing to pay that kind of price is what a question that we we should ask ourselves and you see the Lord just working in in his ministries and I would say okay I got a walk where he walked this is a young Minister I would say I don't know I don't know I'm gonna stand up here and say oh yeah I'll pay it Jesus Jesus went to the father three times and said father if it is but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done he was willing to pay a greater price are we willing to pay that kind of price are we willing to give our life that somebody could live I say this again and I've said it many times and it just hits me so so tremendously when the Asus Revival I gotta say it again in the Azusa Revival they would they would send missionaries then to Africa Africa and they were dying by the dozens dying from malaria from yellow fever is the malaria as I said before the first thing we do with our with our with our minds I guess it wasn't the will of God died over there it wasn't the will of God you know how they thought when they said the brothers that were sent they died [Music] [Applause] I just don't feel like going oh no thank God if you put your hand to the plow and turn back you're not even words are you with me all right all right we're getting to the core of things right I like I like where we're at notices I don't know was my answer is Jesus can one of my sons sit on your right and the other one on the left Jesus and they drink of the same cup it's a bitter cup can they drink from the same cup they will drink of it he was sure about that they will drink from it like it or not you follow me you're gonna drink from that cup she says but to sit on my right and my left has always already been given what happens that that changes your mentality and I pray that you get this is fearful could I even pay that price I don't know but then something happens change my mentality towards this come on church because the problem is is we're always looking at all the negative things that can happen you know what happened I fell more in love with Jesus and I fell so much in love with him that my focus wasn't on what I have to go through my focus was now how can I please I don't want to do anything else in this world I want to please God I want to have the strength to produce if he would have known everything he was going to have to go I don't think so it's a little at a time a little a little next thing you know you've grown and you can handle more watches this unfold is this message something begins to pull on you that's what's called the third pool something is pulling on you people don't understand the pools the pool is like a contest that's what a pool is it's like a contest it's okay and many of them as long as Jesus was Healing The Sick the church was packed Miracles happening in the church but he barely got to the second pool and he says if you don't eat my flesh or drink my blood you have no part with me amen much less the third they didn't even get there it's pulling it's pulling there and the pulling is for one thing to pull you to a greater Revelation are you with me go he's trying to pull you to a greater Revelation is instead we're satisfied just staying down here Hebrews 6 4 says it is impossible it's impossible those who are once enlightened and tasted of the Heavenly gift on and on you can read that we've read this many times you but you can read it when you get home if they shall fall away verse six okay foreign that's a lot of people today I always came out of denominations and you're stuck at the border is why didn't they want to go any further because it was too much for them being a Christian is not for the weak and faint of Hearts if somebody tells you it's going to be a bed of roses mayor but we're stuck to say no praise the Lord of course he did and he I want to know everything I want to know the whole plan I don't know what he was thinking about me it's not about religions notice as this as this one and we're barely getting into our message the only thing that keeps us going to be a little growth huh I grew two inches we understand when we see more that's revealed it takes a sacrifice to birth children but you husband should love your wives speaking to a mother yesterday I go to church and I don't get nothing I wonder if I should just stay home no that he can know you get to church even if you don't get nothing out of it you've at least showed your children how to be in church yes all right amen teach them how to how to sacrifice how far are we willing to go 17 29 and 30. but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all Sonoma even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed when Jesus the son of man came did it rain fire in Brimstone no yeah no see or um what do you think okay once again when Jesus came did it rain fire in Brimstone but say like you mean oh okay okay sheesh about to pack it up here not until I finish though when the son of man is revealed he's pointing them to Something in the future we went over already the four offices of the sun right one of Abrahams son of David Son of God and they all pertain to Jesus Christ but we're going to focus on the son of man today for it to be son of man it has to be flesh and it has to be and he came in a man called Jesus Jesus and in him he was the son of man so when they crucified Jesus they did not crucify the Holy Ghost no crucified They Crucified the man because he claimed to be the Son of God the holy spirit is the Son of God in spirit forms official I want you to raise your hand if you know it I want to see how many know it now son of man is always Jesus Christ Son of God Jesus Christ son of Abraham son of David it's all Jesus Christ but there are offices and it's a different office for a different dispensation okay but once again anybody know from Ephesians Church age to the laodicean church age which of those four offices was he is right this is importante it is more important than your tablets and your phones this is trying to give life to you this morning which office was he in go ahead aloe I know you're holding back I'm going to say once again so you can understand it this way son of man has to be in flesh and has to be a prophet so was Jesus Christ in flesh and does it here through the church ages or was he in spirit you agree everybody agree then so for the church ages he was then son of Anton he was Son of God Son of God is Spirit can you give one to the youth they they worked it out all right so through the church ages he was Son of God Spirit but that's why Luke 17 30 says that there at the end he was going to reveal himself again God in flesh again oh okay but we got it now son of God through the church how many times you got to say son of God through the church but at the end of the ages I will rebuke the the last days they would come back in flesh again he promised to do that let's go on and see this now therefore the messenger of the laodice he was it was office of Son of God still is through the church ages that's right make sure we get that right all through the church but at the end of it was going to reveal himself again hold that now that's why the Pentecostals rejected the message they have to reject it because they're the ones that put Jesus outside the church but they didn't reject Jesus as son of Abraham they didn't reject him as son of David they didn't even reject Jesus as Son of God but what they rejected was Jesus in the office of son of man that's why they said we we don't need a man to teach us or to tell us anything we got the Holy Ghost we got the Son of God the holy spirit so when he changes his mask now throws himself in the office of Son of Man rejected the prophet rejected Jesus Christ right there put him outside the church okay is it making sense to you yeah make sure that we get this because all these points you gotta you gotta know these things so they rejected him as son of man because they couldn't stomach the ministry that a man from Kentucky I got degrees I've been taught under this one not an old Farmer Boy with Town Predator teach me it is foreign is coming the flesh is not past tense is coming the flesh is present tense always so these ones that do not confess that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist he's against the teachings showing us that he would return us scripture doesn't say that Jesus will return as Son of God it says that Jesus will return and be revealed as son of man First Corinthians 15 21. am I making sense to you we're gonna wrap it all up at the end is my man came also the resurrection of them who is this man that the resurrection of the Dead will come by foreign and you're gonna say Jesus and I'm gonna have to say Amen but now I'm going to ask you in what office is which of the four will bring the resurrection Revelations 3 17. write this down and read them when you get home because thou says I am rich with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art blind foreign ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do Holy Ghost tells me what to do this is a receiver in an antichristo yes the Holy Ghost teaches us same holy ghosts the church teachers how is he teaching through the teachers John 14 Juan katorsi going a little quick on this big but because I want to get to something and something to make sure that we get to it one through three says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions they were not so I would have told you I go Jesus is talking Jesus to prepare a place he's going away to prepare a place for a preparation Caleb he's going to prepare a place foreign boy and prepare a place for you I will come again he's telling you here I'm going to come back I go to prepare plays for Caleb and then I will come again and I'll receive Caleb unto myself that where I am there Caleb may be awesome what's your name all right maybe we also show me in the scriptures where he would come again in flesh as Son of God it doesn't go together it's impossible Son of God is Spirit he was going to come again as son of man that where I am where's he at you know why a lot of people don't like to come to church they don't like to be where he's at everybody's got so many excuses why I I didn't go to church because how do you think those excuses are gonna are going to help you on that day we have such some of the worst I mean if you're going to come up with an excuse come on do something better I mean you're looking at them and they're serious Brother The Amazing you must think I'm dumb okay Luke 17 37. this is and they answered and said unto him where Lord wheresoever the body is uh where is he don't understand that where I am you can be there also where Lord wherever the body is my mystical body on Earth where's where the Eagles will gather yeah you can go to any church you want they're all waiting for Jesus Methodist church this morning everybody is preaching about Jesus coming Jesus is coming because Jesus said I'll come again but what they're missing is the office they're all waiting where's Jesus reach office I like this I'll come again and when a man and a woman get the revelation of the son of man nothing will keep them nothing will keep them from where the body is Romans 8 38 says for I'm persuaded neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities more powers nor nor things present nor things to come nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord which is in the Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to say it again it doesn't say the love of God which is in the Lord Jesus Christ is it which is in the anointed one of Jesus which is in the anointed one of Jesus the Jesus our lord history of the son of man that is calling us as sons of God through the adoption oh come on I'm going to say this again the ministry of the son of man that is calling us unto the adoption the office of son of man was the ministry of Jesus Christ failed in human flesh the office of a prophet when he revealed himself in our days he did so in the same manner through a prophetic Ministry Once Again Luke 17 30. it was a son of man revealing this son of man it was dear derailed in human flesh like this Ezekiel was a son of man and he ate the scroll yeah in the New Testament it's also a prophet we know who that is the seventh angels He also had the little book is seven still little book is right it is deity again today in human flesh as he revealed himself as son of man again now young people I want you to get this how many remember now the church ages he was Son of God spirit but in the end time now he was going to be son of man again he sent a man unless it's in flesh and it's a prophet is who was that Prophet we don't just say just to say it we got to know what we believe okay Matthew 24 44. therefore be also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh can you put that that quote of the rapture how many are enjoying themselves this morning we're feeding our inner man right now when the son of man begins to reveal himself what is revealed make his revelation of what he is in this day when the son of man begins to reveal himself okay but but who is the son of man Jesus Christ no one else when he begins to reveal begins to reveal himself what is revealed make his revelation of what he is telling you in this day in this day reveal out to the people the word that's made known for the day revealed to the People by the manifestation of the Holy Spirit making that Jesus Jesus live amongst us huh that's brother Emilio that's the attitude and remember he was represented there yes now he's showing you something back there with Elohim and Abraham what he was represented there and she didn't believe that what was going to happen Could Happen how many of you today will say I just don't believe that what he says is going to happen is going to happen you know the problem isn't knowing that that he will have a bride the problem is is are you part of that right to a personal level are you one of the ones [Applause] we always just make it big all the bride the bride Grande Grande [Applause] that is him that is his feminine part no notice this now he can say he asked the question and she didn't believe he said now Abraham I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and Sarah and the tent left why did Sarah laugh in the tent how can these things be remember the intellectual Church got two preachers two angels Abraham and his group Abraham is the Grupo saw God manifested in a body of human flesh so God manifested in a body of human flesh that could discern the hearts the spirits and tell Sarah what she was thinking behind him how many times did brother Brandon say that he and he mentioned this is no I'm going to turn my back to the audience and you sister you brother what was he showing us same Lord Jesus foreign come on now he had some work to do on Sarah get into something he had some work to do on Sarah I don't want to get ahead of myself because this this is good stuff the Revelation has to con yes or yes COC the Revelation has to continue notice this now for it is the ministry of the son of man that unites the bride with the bridegroom okay in the day that the son of man will be revealed what okay to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together so it's son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real yeah unite the church in him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen now I'm coming to this part now and then and then we'll start to we'll start to shut down at least three hours to shut down three hours oh brother if you guys are mad get brother Jimmy afterwards he'll take it to better understand this let's turn to Genesis 18. you can read verse 8 and he's he's eating butter milk and all this it's on my legs Jehovah in flesh eating and drinking with Abraham and they said unto him where is Sarah thy why this is verse 9. behold in the tent we could go off on the tent right now the 10 Ministry but we'll just hold off for a second and he said I will certainly return unto thee Jose he's he's telling Abraham get this closely I mean listen close pinch yourself he's telling Abraham this is Abraham I will certainly return unto thee all right n brother Raj I will return unto thee unless you believe that still look great all right all right that's brother Raj okay he said I'm gonna I'll return unto you according to the time of life don't get scared Sister Laura yeah he's like whoa what I tell my wife all the time he said I'm too old for this night Sarah was 90. and then she says but my name's not Sarah anyways going back and forth therefore Sarah laughed within herself I'm waxed old and shall I have pleasure my Lord be known also it is and the Lord said I'm sorry go ahead and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh shall I have Surety bear a child which I'm old and the question arises is there any is there anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life [Music] he's not asking for feedback he's telling what's going to happen I will return unto thee Roger I'll return unto thee according to the time of life Sarah shall have a son he said he would return to Abraham my question is this did he returned to Abraham before the promised son was born what a question how many of you read your Bible what is okay you can all answer this anybody wants to answer did he return to Abraham again before the promiscence give me scripture that he was this is important piece of it all is importante did he come back to to Abraham hello this is yes see he came to Sarah this is the little piece that people are leaving out today that the prophet of the age came he was the son of man revealing the son of man yes it was him in flesh Jesus Christ but there's a peace here something that has to happen it's gonna happen did he come back or return to April to Abraham yes see to his feminine Parts oh come on I'm gonna say it again back to his feminine part he is Mrs Abraham he is part of Abraham you don't believe me let me let's read it so you can believe me you don't hear after that chapter 18 Till Genesis 21. and the Lord visited something good here at the end now and the Lord visited you know and the Lord did unto Sarah he had spoken if you ever want to see the seventh seal in Genesis this is the secret Church secret oh if you could that the impact of the Revelation right now this is the secret of the Seven Seals this is he will produce the promised son but nobody else knows the church world don't know and how does he give it the Lord foreign and Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him and a true sign overlooked is a prophet and we saw how that the son of man was revealed again but there was one last thing we say the last sign before the promised son comes but there's still one more thing Church get this there's still one more thing come on the Lord has to visit you this is where it's at right now please understand this is the grain of the message because for years we have heard the message of the hours it's good seeds went forth sowing seeds and we receive that seeds my question is through the whole time those are you you're adults so get it right was Abraham giving good seeds maybe at some point up maybe he ended up drying up but there was always trying to try her trying to get to get pregnant after that God promised them we have heard this message inside and out we have heard Apostles and Prophets and teachers and evangelists and pastors and what has come forth is and people say well I listen to messages and I pray and nothing changed I read the Bible nothing changes the Lord visited Sarah when you can receive that no and recognize we have received seeds but you need a visitation something Supernatural activate form your womb foreign you need the supernatural to happen I've been hearing and hearing Goods pray for a visitation visited that was the last visit before the promise can I go just a little bit more just a little bit more Sarah had to be restored in order to produce the Sun when I see these things in order for the final part of the story is God needs you and me ah he needs the female part to manifest neces to or to bring the promised son this will be the finality of the Seven Seals you say brother the seven seal is the coming of Christ amen amen but it's not just about the coming of Christ what good is the coming of Christ if we don't know if who he's coming foreign visitation well let me see it was supposed to come in 1989. in the 90s remember that one Mayan calendar he's already visited [Music] secret Church they're looking for Son of God foreign amen amen now how excited is he I'm coming for my bride we talk about excited that's why he spoke more about his second coming than his first foreign that's my best watch this it wasn't Abraham this time it was his wife Sarah she was the one that needed a visitation in order for the promised son to come she's the one that needed a visitation she kind of laughed I don't know Rio not me yes you did because sometimes we have that attitude be part of the Bride of Jesus Christ how can that be why not working now can you see the visitation to Sarah asada is the seventh Secret is he said he would write it in the hearts of the building what was he riding in that heart the Bible is full of types and shadows you want to find out one of these days there was always written there um I'll write it in the hearts what those seven Thunders uttered we don't know the conversation that he had with her until he has that conversation with you [Music] and when he visited Sarah conceivio hmm she went from laughing in her heart yes to having faith that would bring her change and the womb is that could hold the seeds yesterday she's the one that needed the visitation completion of the Gentile dispensation the completion of the Gentile dispensation is the completion of the promise as Lucas it is the perfecting of the word bride Perfection so let's let's do this out just give me about 10 minutes and then I'll let you go Hebrews 11 11. evidence to her faith being risen to a level that she had never knew before the Bible says Hebrews 11 11 that through faith also this is herself Sarah la mis Masada receive strength to conceive seed let's leave your food that is the subtitle of my message by faith for Faith she receives strength you know what strength is she received Dynamite she received power this is we're good church members but until the visitation happens that's when there will be a change a faith that'll Reigns she receives strength to conceive this is and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him who had promiseda we've been hearing this message for years but I know many of us need a visitation it's what gives you Faith to conceive the seeds the Liberty sins were blind because they did not recognize the hour of their visitation and the message God's provided the church will come through justification to Luther through sanctification through Wesley certification and we'll go right on into the Perfection of the son of man perfection into the Perfection of the son of man Allah perfection when does the Perfection of the son of man happen when husband and wife will be the self-same personas persona say it again I gotta say it again when will the Perfection of the son of man come this is in God's Own God's provided place of worship that when husband and wife be the self same Persona God will be so manifested in his bride in his church till they will both be the same they are one so no no now you see where we're at show is the father be with me so long you still say show us the father why is it the same if you've seen his bride you've seen him they're the self same Persona why was Adam given a bride foreign produce himself produce something else Galatians 4 19 my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you she must come into His very image in his likenessa she must reproduce the son of man again and we need the faith to conceive that is sure without the seventh angel we wouldn't know what it would be for the son of man to be revealed again all we would know is Jesus Christ of yesterday but Ephesians tells us and we can and I I don't want to read it to save time he descended and and above and then ascended up into Heavens that he might feel all things he gave his Apostles and all this for the Perfection of the Saints Souls that are in prison now three years Perfection the ministry come to its Perfection when it reproduced Christ again amongst human beings as we're predicted and donde brother you're out of your mind yeah I think so see it was through the form of Doctrine this bride under the seventh seal is will bring him to Earth again in what form in que Forma in bright forms okay I'm just going to show you I'm not that I'm not making things up continue in Spanish not today oh you know in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same Jesus the Same power same church same thing the same word now I have heard but now I see but but the wheat has come up through here and now it's begin to form in the bride forms Christ is the mystery of God revealed but all that Christ was he poured into the church then the Bride is a further revelation of himself just get this last part pinch yourself your neighborhood Ultimate Party she is a further revelation of himself and this is the end time revelation of himself and she's a further revelation of it watch what he says in the exposition the New Testament does not reveal another God it's a farther revelation of this one and same God continue Christ did not come down to make himself known he did not come to reveal the son he came to reveal and make known the father he never talked about two Gods he talks about one God and now in this last age we have come back to the Capstone Revelation Revelation the most important revelation of godhead in the whole Bible is Jesus Is God he and the father are one there is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ what did Abraham call him Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus showing that he himself Jesus will be manifested in his bride manifestation in the last days now I'm I'm going to close with this now watch the furtherance of the Revelation now Revelation the furtherance of the Revelation the son of man Jesus Christ we can see the son of man Jesus Christ rebuilding a prophet Jesus Christ in flesh Travis but it didn't stop there because the message is a prophetic message and the message and the messenger are one and the same are you with me say it again the message and the messenger are one and the same right who's the message oh come on who's the message that wasn't a profit only message and the prophet and his message are one and the same don't separate it out you have a job to do but you need strings now watch this improving his word and I'm gonna and I'm gonna stop now yeah proving his word when the word here unites with the person the word has come forward I'm finished the word has come forth and it unites with the person and they too become one then what does it do then word and the person become one of man again ha I gotta say that again it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word and the church does the same thing she has the saith the Lord people say only a prophet has thus saith the Lord well if you're the message you are the saith the Lord what the Lord has said and the Lord visited Sarah and the Lord visited and told her a secret when I need a visitation we need a visitation we have received the message but we lack the visitation now I say examine yourself examine yourself brother Brown says I give them to you Lord they are trophies of the message they are
