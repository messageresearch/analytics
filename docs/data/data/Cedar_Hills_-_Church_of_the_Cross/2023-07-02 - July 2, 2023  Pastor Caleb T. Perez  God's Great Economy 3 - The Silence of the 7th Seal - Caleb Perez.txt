sister Naomi and her family there in the back bless you familiar no brother Brian was here or not I don't see him but God bless you good to have you with us Elizabeth India bear with me I'm a little bit nervous first of all I have to give God thanks uh for his grace and his Mercy remember back in may we had found out that we were pregnant and in June when we went for our ultrasound we found out that there was going to be two so our hearts are overjoyed and we're just so grateful to the Lord for his grace and his mercy and as I look back through all these years all I can see is God's grace and mercy and he he is the one that has brought me to this point so all honor and Glory goes to God and I just I want to thank him and I tell him that I love him so much uh we were gonna actually wait um until after my oyster to let everyone knows but as many of you know last weekend I had to go to the ER a few times and on Monday when they had did the ultrasound they had found that there was I had had a hemorrhage which is just they said that there was bleeding outside of the sack of the babies uh but both babies at the time they both had heartbeats and they were both doing fine um but they always tell you the worst when you're there I guess just to make you get nervous and they had told me with my history of miscarriages uh that it didn't look very good so the thoughts always come but as I went home I I had laid down and I was listening to a message from Brother Branham and it's called he that is in you and I just want to read this last part that was that was on there when I had heard it and brother Branham had said and now in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God renounce your Affliction your your sickness and say to it you have to go because you have your faith plus my faith with the power of Jesus Christ whose omnipresence is here to vindicate it and prove that he is here we'll make you well at this time and at that moment I had claimed my healing and I had claimed the promise that God had given me and a prayer request had went out um asking for prayer that they would pray for us for the situation and on Tuesday I went to see my doctor and we had another ultrasound and I want to give all glory to God because they did not find that Hemorrhage anymore it was completely gone there was no evidence of it at all and I just want to give him all glory and I want to thank each and every one of you that has prayed with us over the years who has given us encouragement I want to thank our pastor and sister Lorena Lorena it seems to never fail even when our pastor is gone he always reaches out and he wants to make sure that we're okay and I want to thank our brother Tommy Jr has been there with us this last week and he's called and he's checked on us and I just want to tell him that I appreciate him so much and I just asked for your continued prayers throughout this journey that we're on thank you and God bless you amen amen is God still good man hey

have a home to come to you know we have people that love you and that we love amen God bless you would you shake your neighbor's hand and just tell them it's good to see you God bless each one of you I know that there's many people that are out join their families enjoying time time off amen and may God bless them wherever they are give them traveling mercies amen we we uh here had like I said a wonderful time a great trip got to rest this is the main thing but we're back in the saddle again you may be seated for a moment before we get going and uh we have uh you probably have seen him already brother Salvador his wife and daughter and uh or you maybe some of you that don't know brother brother Caleb that's that's his dad all right Caleb so we're gonna ask if they would come we just want to extend our hand of Fellowship to them they moved from from Juarez we live here now and yeah even handing services and Fellowship he's been he's been waiting a long time to get here 2003 is uh I think the first time that that our pastor uh told him come over but I want you to come over the right way right I want you I want you to come over the right way so he waited this this many years and since we we want to give a more hand to Fellowship welcome them invite them to your house amen amen so God bless you it's a pleasure to have you here it just down to your feet and and uh and that's kind of funny how we say extend to your feet what other ways there to stand I guess amen we have with us uh uh the next uh message on the God's Great economy and I want to put a subtitle The Silence of the seventh seal is I don't know how far I'll make uh go today but we'll go as far as he allows us to and uh we want to of course keep in prayer brother brother Danny brother Julian and brother Jimmy who are there in Colombia ministering Colombia amen God bless them and bring them safely something that's very hard to understand in so many ways but I believe that for the day that we live in I believe and as I've always said and we always stand here in this church is The Book of Revelations is our books it's for this time and so as the Lord leads and as he opens a little at a time we'll take it whatever he gives us whenever he gives it to him so Revelations the eighth chapter in the first verse what a scripture how many know in Revelations chapter 6 and you find the six seals right yes that's right and then and then you have this break in chapter seven and then and then you have one verse just one verse is all you get no symbols no living creatures there's like nothing going on this is what he says and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour amen may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated I wonder if they can put up that this the the quote there that we're going to start with the message the seven seal God bless brother Jerry and sister Faith that was sure a wonderful testimony God is doing testimonials amen it starts off like this there's no service tonight so we're going to be relaxed okay and I haven't spoken to you in a little while can I get your undivided attention for eign amen I believe God has something for us today it is the secret that no one knows about John was forbidding to write about it even write a symbol about it this is why there was no activity amen now it doesn't say there's no activity on Earth no this is it says there's no activity in heaven is what he says it might give away the secret do you see it now now here he is preaching the seventh seal and we've always been taught in by our founding Pastor knowing that the seal is the heart the heart of a man yes amen once again the seal is the heart of a man being opened okay so so here we go as we as we as we read this together now he says he's asking you and I the question do you see it now it had been here there's nothing written about it and now he's asking the question do you see it now my question to you is that how many of you can say I see it now you have to have studied the seals and know where we're going with this but here is seven straight Thunders right in a row I one two one two three four five six seven that perfect number is now we have to we have to notice all these things okay it doesn't say Earth it says once again Heavens couldn't write that because it had to do with the Earth well I want to make sure I get this Foundation right for you Heavens could not write that because the book that had been closed in Revelations is the same book that is now open in Revelations chapter 10. yes is that right amen maybe some of you need a vacation but once again same book in Revelations 5 and mismo Libra Revelation is the same book in Revelations 10. now it's open and we understand what the book is the book is the title deed book of redemption it's the title deed to the Earth the Earth was made for man that's why heaven couldn't write nothing it had to do with the Earth it had to do with you and I yeah man's inheritance okay Heavens can't know about it not only couldn't Heavens write about it Kevin's can't know about it nothing else because there's nothing to go on there was silence in heaven can somebody tell me where Satan was was he on Earth or was he in heaven where was Saiyan in heaven or on Earth well here we go akivamos there was silence in heaven because it would give away the secret if anything moves and Satan was looking at this is not cast down from heaven until Revelations chapter 12. keep that in mind watch now Satan is watching closely any movement anything that will give away a secret he's looking for something that he can because he wants to cause Havoc he wants to keep you and I from this great promise but we understand that he's not able to God is in control this is God's Great economy it was so great till it was Kept Secret from the Angels imagine this morning there are things that are and have been revealed to us but Angels know nothing about Los Angeles how do you feel about yourself today he might do great damage there's one thing that he don't know now he can interpret anything he wants to when interpretation and he can impersonate any kind of gifts but he can't know this it's not even written in the word it's a total secret is and the angels everything shut up they were playing their Harps yes everything brother Ram says shut up if they made one move it might give something away so they just shut up they quit harping everything stopped seven accept him God's perfect number seven just right down the road seven Thunders uttered straight together like they were spelling something out notice at that time John started to write it and he said don't write it that's what the voice from Heaven told him don't ride him no let's don't write it no let's give us those online God bless you guys when the seven Thunders it wasn't something foreign was something that he he understood and then I'll go he could understand what had been released because the Bible said he was about to write it you don't write something that you don't understand he was about to rise but what was released by those Thunders was something that John as a type of the Bride he understood he got it but the voice says don't ride it no no you gotta hold that seal it up now watch it was as if it was spelling out something and then when as we see this progress this this story or this this this picture he was a commanded to seal these things up till future time it's not future time no more hello everybody again it's not future time no more it's present it's present it has come to our time we are living in this time Jesus never spoke of it Jesus John Couldn't Write it Angels know nothing about it what is it yes it's the thing that Jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it he didn't know it himself he said only God would know it so the opening of the seventh seals the seven Founders they're tied together right that's easy to understand because those seven Thunders were the third part of the Seven Seals how many remember that that the seven seal opened up in a three-fold manner right something happened yesterday didn't happen today now notice this now because there was silence in heaven because the activity was going on here on Earth all the seven still does is show you the scenes but the action or the activity is not in heaven reaction the activity is going on here on Earth now notice this now but he told us when we begin seeing these signs coming up now you're getting somewhere start to see these signs coming up you know you're getting somewhere watch how the holy spirit is showing even though there is silence in heaven there's activity go all right there's there's a reason we've heard many messages on this and his message is calling and manifesting other redeemed Sons if you want something to happen and we continue on that same message watch as the seventh seal has been opened and it is that that most people don't catch it they'll read through the Seven Seals and they'll say oh wow I didn't get much out of it I didn't understand this or that or this but watch as as the heart of this messenger is a how many of you want something to happen if you are looking for something to happen in your life he said if you want something to happen now you have to take my word for this he's not saying you have to take God's word we've already seen that through six Hills we've seen the Plan of Redemption but if you want to see something happen you have to take my word for this that's the hardest thing for God to do yes you'll have to take my word for this notice this now now how many are with me if I'm planning on doing something I know better than to tell anybody about it anybody ever been burnt if this has broke many relations right well they were my friend but then I told them something you put a lock on their mouth gave them a key to it but don't tell nobody okay itching ears all the time all the time huh never mind let me get it let me not get off Focus stay focused I know better than to tell anybody about it not that that person would tell it but you will hear it see he can't get it but only those that will receive it but they're going to receive it a certain way this is what I'm trying what I'm getting at today there's a certain way we receive the message because the whole world that has ears they can hear the message but only the bride knows what's between the lines because it happens in silence The Silence of the seventh seals there's a purpose for it all right we're getting to that now notice this now as we continue reading here you can get it in my heart as long as God has it closed up with the Holy Spirit that's between me and God he don't know nothing about it until you speak it then he hears it here we go now he's gotta he lest we speak it then he hears it he said remember Sam will try to impersonate personification everything that the church will do I'm not say it again will try to impersonate everything that the church will do he's tried to do it we notice it through the Antichrist but this one thing he cannot impersonate there'll be no mimics of this because he don't know it and that makes him madder than anything else that even Satan is upset because you and I know something I don't know if that excites you with an excitement can you imagine Saiyans upset at you no wonder he fights us so much he's trying to get into the promised land where is that promised land point to yourself see the promised land is the holy ghost that dwells inside of you it's the Holy Ghost Inside of You now watch this now no mimics no way of him to know this it's the third pool he just knows nothing about it and that third pool we we went over it already there's three parts of it what part are we in what part has been revealed depends what part you're talking about he knows nothing about it he doesn't understand it but there's a secret that lays beneath and then that's why brother Branham says it'll take you and I is to do something for God under that third pool oh there's so much here that I'm that I gotta you gotta just kind of control yourself but watch this now watch I I just love this easy and because Sam knows nothing about it there's only one way that he can do something about it Satan his greatest weaponas connect to a lot of things but his greatest weapon for you and I or against you and I and Contra Nuestra is called distraction is distraction okay we're gonna get to something here so you make sure that you follow me closely he knows nothing about it so he'll try to distract us from the Revelation ah he tries to distract us from knowing what has been sealed in our hearts what part of the groom we are going to try to keep you from understanding these things he's good at distraction get into this watch has this how this unfolds we know that this book once again the title deed book of all creation and he's revealing the lamb is revealing the Mysteries through the ministry of that Angels he's revealing his Secrets he's revealing these Mysteries through that Ministry notice once again in the message seven the seventh seal and then this 8th chapter only reveals the scene this is where nothing else is revealed now nothing else is revealed now nothing he goes on to say this it's revealing it says this is the word that as I've said many times that our pastor would always use brother Tommy has has a has this the Thunder's been revealed the seven seal completely been revealed it's revealing because it's a continual process it's the revealing now here's the key of what I want to get to now it's revealing of the seventh seals is perfectly mute is how can you reveal something when it's perfectly mute this is the Silence of the Seven Seals revealing and it's perfectly mute is silencio how can it be revealed and mute at the same time answer me the question on this is going to be revealing and be mute behold I send you Elijah the prophets it's revealingo but to those that don't understand it's mute because that means nothing to them is but in that silence you this is what we're trying to get across all the way back remember brother Abraham preaching on this it's perfectly mute but all the way back from Genesis you know there's the Genesis this seven seal is spoke of is you sound like a like a group that is excited you cannot you can't talk when your mouth is full huh all right let me give you that one notice this now all the way back from Genesis there's the Genesis the seventh seal is spoken of is how do you think he did creation six days and stay see us come on it's very good esta muy bueno all right well he he he he he made man in during the six days is that right but in the seventh day he rested where was he resting come on now he was resting in his sons in other words God was silence so that his son could speak this is my beloved Son this is how many are with me now come on now this is the this is the seventh seal from Genesis and if you don't catch the type you'll never understand the antetite the people say ah we don't need the Old Testament get the symbols you're lost over here watch as we continue reading this all the way back from Genesis there's the Genesis from the very beginning there's a principle and that's the reason now this is the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and that's the reason there was silence in heaven base of half an hour and seven Thunders uttered their voice John was forbidden to write Ben what was he forbidden to write the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet and when he says that means at some point he's going to reveal it's okay he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing he doesn't know but but here's the key to that he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible so if you say we know nothing about it there was nothing else written but if you can go and see it through the whole scripture you'll find the type of it through the whole Bible amen how many are getting what I'm what I'm after today watch this figure things we continue on he showed it or rebuild it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ he says the entire Bible is an expression of one goal is that God has beginning that one purpose he wanted to to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's goal is I like that word in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and God's help we'll see it right here this morning and with God's help we'll see it here this morning why he doesn't leave it like it's that there's nothing left to it okay he got a message to preach in the days of the voice of the seventh Angels he would begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished he has declared to his servants but in order for him to reveal it to us we have to stop being so distracted we're gonna I'm turning a corner here most people say muchachente are not comfortable with silence The Silence of the seventh seals most people are not comfortable with science and yet you won't get the revelation of that any other way Spurgeon said this few men truly know themselves as they really are few men truly know themselves as they really are Solitude means being alone with yourself long enough to learn who you are wow I want to know how many of you know who you really are I believe that if we really knew who we are okay we wouldn't do a lot of the things that we do we wouldn't go to a lot of places that we go Plato said this an unexamined life is not worth living and that's why Satan fears one of the things he fears the most yes this one slapped me across the face once again Satan fear seeing us sit in silence because he don't know what's going on inside he doesn't know if God is revealing something islands is powerful Church silence is powerful ah you didn't tell your neighbor very well not your neighbor again like you mean it is powerful for you don't know what one is thinking two couples a couple fighting I know everything they're thinking do you know what really hurts when your spouse says something somebody tells you something then you just stay quiet you have no idea okay what's really going on it works in the other person and silencio the Silence of the seventh seal is what makes Satan crazy is silence is powerful Ecclesiastes 3 7 says a time to keep silence and the time to speak I'm gonna say it again time to keep silence and there's a time to speak we think that it's always a time to speak everybody knows everything we live in a day and age where everybody knows everything it's it that's the generation back when I was growing up in the 70s if you didn't know something you just didn't know it what do you think I don't know saying you would leave it at that yeah not today I Wanna Know all we know is that people fact check each other all the time watch they're saying is that's the day and age doesn't know what it's like to not know they don't like to not know that's there's a lot of good things but a lot of bad things amen I mean these young people can pick up an instrument and a couple days later they're playing it you're like here we are in the 70s like no no no no but now there's techniques and everybody learns from each other knowledge has increased I want to ask you this question because silence is very uncomfortable we did this I believe brother brother brother brother Diego brother Tommy did this in one of the uh couple seminars that we had um how many of you have you couples have sat there what does this and looked at each other for five straight men he said yeah how many of you have ever done it for four minutes two minutes two minutes one minute 30 seconds anybody alien geez no wonder we're in their condition women say hombre a man how many of you can actually look at each other for that long cartoons when you're looking into the windows of the souls and you look into that person and there's so many things that start to come up especially when we're mad we're not going to do that is counsel you to do that even for two three minutes don't say a word though silence is powerful the Bible says we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face what will we do if we can't even see our spouse face to face how will we ever see God some years back NBC they aired this project and they showed the powerful emotions that Rose to the surface simply because the space provided was silence a mother looking at her son and they did it for four minutes how many of you parents have ever looked at your children or four minutes foreign and silencio the son told of how grateful he felt thinking about how much his mother had sacrificed a father told how much potential he saw in his daughter's future truly silence is not comfortable but it's so powerful that it's so scarce all because Satan knows nothing of the seventh seals and all he can do is use his favorite weapon distractions if you can put it up there what's this now this all goes together and is it okay if I hit the two-hour Mark today relax the rest of the day no this is now proverbs 4 25. let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before D is here's another version keep your eyes straight ahead and ignore all the sideshow distractions that's hard to do is there are distractions like we have like there has never been in the history and all these sideshows keep us from hearing the Lord all these side shows and our minds are going a million miles an hour how many of you ever get exhausted by thinking too much got some deep deep the Lord had told me twice you think that I'd get that I understand what he was getting it what did that mean that was my question what do you mean by too fast was I going on too many trips was I giving too much attention to things that don't matter was I too distracted or maybe I was trying to get ahead of God's plan I needed to know what it meant the day that me and my wife left we were at the airport in El Paso I I we were waiting for the plane we entered into this little store I wasn't looking for nothing just waiting she was buying some snacks and I walked by this place where they had some books and now it jumps the word distress distraction and I picked it up distraction I don't know who he is people ask many times is it okay to read other books or this is no you have to have enough discernment yeah every time I read a book I always pass it through my filter the word of God the bible message of the hours and if it doesn't go line up with that I toss it but there are things many times that'll stand out such as brother Branham picking up that that package of of cigarettes but as I began to read this I felt the Lord speaking to me distractions once again keep your eyes straight ahead and ignore all the sideshow distractions how many can do that and there was silence in heaven yeah about the space of half an hour We're living at the end time there are more distractions than there has ever been yeah and they're for free you don't have to pay to go to the show anymore wow what is a woman that's a sideshow it's a sideshow right you got all this wherever you turn wherever you go buy Flags everywhere I mean we get into these things and we hear and we look you know what oh my goodness all this stuff is I don't think they like this this message well I'm gonna preach it anyways watch this now he can say we are called to be Overcomers in this time of Sideshow we're called to be Overcomers but when it's all said I'm not talking about the sideshows out there I'm talking about the drama that's in the church I'm talking about the drama inside me Hallelujah forget the unbeliever I'm worried about their side shows why is there drama all the time in US everything turn in your face that you do not walk in that line with him what's distractions distractions we're distracted by our feelings I don't feel like that right we're distracted by what we think we're distracted by what we want foreign [Music] to bring it closer to home what becomes the cost of our distractions I can stay a long time on this or a little bit of time distractions distractions cost has to be paid if I'm with my wife and I'm not paying attention to her there's a cost to pay sooner or later yes or yes we don't pay attention to the children there's a cost you're going to pay oh now you want me to go to church now you want me to do things right because we were distracted hello everybody and there was silence in Heaven Help Us this day what has it cost us by not paying attention to what God is trying to help foreign foreign and I go on yeah all right why will a man go with another woman or a woman go with another man that's not their spouse why will a man look at another man why will a woman look at another woman what's up with these distractions what would cause a human being to want to change their sex foreign they're everywhere they're on our phones on our tablets games and programs apps and pictures and movies and they're all there to stimulate you and shape your mind shape your desires into a bottomless pit where you can never get enough you look at one woman that's that's naked and you can't get enough a bottomless pit has been opened spirit that has come from the bottomless we become a pit ourselves bill of every filthy and foul bird that there is but I come to the realization because we can always say ah this is a distraction you got your phone on you the phone is a distraction the tablet when I really looked at that I come to understand the tablet in the phone are you just a conduit to get information from here to there the real distraction is not the phone or the tablets attraction is the sin inside your heart come on now it's not a problem with phones or tablets yes or yes COC why do we do that there's a sin problems I hope that hit good and keep it alive by these distractions foreign I just can't seem to get the new birth great message brother Henry thank you Sacramento Henry I can't get it no you're feeding that no nature this is I'm challenging everyone today every time we're distracted an opportunity is lost when I sit there in my study and I'm distracted by problems or whatever's going on foreign distract Ed comes from you break it down this is away from Latin so to distract is to draw away from oh get into something good here it literally means to draw away from where we talk about three pools how many of you know that Satan also has three people yeah we're going to get to that in a momentum then if distract means to draw away from some things then distraction means to lose momentum or to lose traction isn't that what happens many times we heard that we come to the to church we come to the altars and we got a little traction you got a little momentum we lose one because we're distracted distractions in our life to lose traction watch this now we've all I think been all been stuck before right you've been distracted distract means to disturb or trouble greatly in the mind it's to be said no wonder the Bible says in Hebrews 12. foreign in all actuality it's all the unbelief in us that's causing the distractions never deal with it we cover up the distractions by noise and there was Silence about the space of foreign we cover it up with noise conrito with musica who always has music playing in their car when they get in music not saying it's wrong to listen to music when that's all there is and there is no reflection something's wrong reflection we cover it up by movies and talking and laughing and noise everywhere because that's just the way we deal with there's a place in Minneapolis Minnesota Minneapolis Minnesota I ever go back to Minnesota I would like to go to this place called the orfield labs the orfield labs orphan lamps Laboratories it is the quietest room in the world it is an anechoic chamber the camera it is so quiet this room that the longest anyone has ever stayed in it is 45 minutes humans cannot handle that kind of silence and all you can hear in that room is your heart beating and your lungs breathing is all you hear is in only 45 minutes staying too long causes you to hallucinate there was silence in heaven about this I don't know you you that are spiritual get your stinking caps on those questions silence in heaven silencio but on Earth there was a heart beating why not could hear anything else but a heart was beating silence in heaven but on Earth your heart is beating and the Breath of Life is blowing nobody is in action there's work being done here on Earth oh my Lord I pray we can get this oh what is this now I just want I want to teach this more than just preach this what we have to do then is that real distraction is not what we see in here all those those things are just foreign silence is powerful and it forces you to look inside okay how many of you have looked for one minute at yourself in your eyes in the mirror and ask yourself who are you is where did you come from what are you doing look at yourself in the eyes you'll get uncomfortable with yourself after a while you ever talk to somebody they're like that's usually when you know somebody's been talking about you look in the eyes yeah you're good to go let me not get off preach about 100 messages after this it forces you look foreign and to most people and all the noise has stopped and they sit in silence they find themselves themselves alone with a strain translated they have no idea who they are why okay because we automatically turn up the noise gotta hear something turn the noise you got to deal with all the choices you've made and if you've never dealt with them the holy spirit will tell you deal with them do what's right and quit being distracted David David was a man after God's Own Heart how many of you talk to yourself I know that's weird you've heard the expression right it says not if you talk to yourself Reno okay how many of you want to start talking to yourself um loud it can be it can be within yourself but David gave us a key man after God's Own Heart that he would talk to himself in Psalms 42 5. he he was in a not a very good place down and depressed instead of sitting there bummed out you know what he did started talking to himself and he asked his own soul why art thou cast down on my soul oh why can't we do that we don't feel good we feel down I'm not asking your soul why are you you dead why are you cast down and feeling that way come on I challenge you to look at yourself in the mirror look through your eyes into your soul oh my soul and why are you disquieted in me why are you in a rage why are you mourning why are you troubled hope thou in God or I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance his first address was to his own soul and the condition it was in he questions his soul and now that he's made his soul aware that there is only hope that is in God now he turns to God do you see how backwards we are we always go to God I don't know why this is happening why this is to do something for us we're doing it backwards when you when you've got got the answer so why are you acting like why are you down in the dumps no that God is my help no service you know these things then he turns to God foreign more noise that there ever has been many voices muchas versus music music ideas Expressions entertainment so little self-reflection yeah we don't seem to catch the enemy in his tactics somebody know that Satan has three pools no not even Savvy Mr Naomi God bless you know anybody uh if you don't know your enemy how you know you gotta know your enemies you gotta know he's got three pools too let's go into that just for a moment minuto a pool is a stage of ministry and he's got three stages of his ministry and under each pool or stage he has something to do and his job is to distract but where he used to distract at the early churches so his ministry had to continue climbing he could distract you and I mean so his ministry keeps continues he continues to learn he knows exactly how we are who knows what turns us on and what turns us off notice this now under this is how God unfolds his great economy Satan's trying to distract us from this great plans and it's through these pools that God is manifesting himself and is drawing us to himself but Satan is also drawing to draw away from God is pulling you to himself say it is drawing you away from God all right we got that let's see then how he does this how many knows then as his ministry what his three his three pools are what is nobody his three pools brother random says he says he doesn't use the word pulls he used his ministry of hell is the Antichrist elante Cristo the false prophet is and it's all the self-same spirit you got it the Trinity of Hell watch how he distracts what is he trying to do discredit the Trinity of Heaven Father Son and Holy Spirit oh not three gods or three persons but the real Trinity is one God in three offices now watch what brother Ram says in the first seal please it's three stages three stages of the same devil power but one of these days saying is himself is kicked out and he calms down and takes over the place where the demon was and then the devil is Incarnate in a man just repeating him itself then brother Brown says in the fourth cell three stages of his ministry ministerio makes him one Persona he says it can't stay with three he is separation so now he knows got his plans and he's learned how to distracted and now not worried about the world we can get distracted in church when we try to take somebody else try to take an office that doesn't pertain unofficio it's a distraction he knows his stuff is the same tokenial God knows I'm coming around the corner now you're getting tired you want to stand up for a little bit or you feel okay stretch it out I still didn't say there you go I'm coming now I'm coming around the corner now is trying hard to distract him because he's trying to stop God's Great economy impossible impossibly for this is the full expression is the full expression of what God had in his mind still wraps it all up and only his bride can receive this Revelation this book is already open right just waiting for the seventh seal to be identified of the coming of Christ I'm going to say it again the seven just waiting for the seventh seals to be identified of the coming of Christ after the seals brother Brown preaches the message that are in prison now how many of you have heard that message wow that's amazing you know what that shows distractions no wonder sometimes I've heard people well we should just put on the tapes well if you don't listen to them at home we're gonna have you listen them somewhere and we're Malachi for believers and we've never heard the message Souls that are imprisoned what are you doing with your time man but I bet you you can say every movie that Disney has put out you can see every Disney song and we know everything about that is Eggman that breaks God's heart gives us the very message how will we ever be ready how will we even know when there's a Rapture we're distracted no wonder that the lord gave me this message people they're distracted there's too much out there that gets your attention you could stop preaching and just ask God for Mercy this morning exactly what brother Branham was feeling is when he preached Souls that are in prison he preached it after the seals and he was struggling listen to that message you'll hear the prophet of God struggling because in that message he knows the lamb has already opened the cells and what he's struggling with there's still Mercy or not he's preaching the message he's struggling I don't know but could it be could it be if he wanted to find out then he found out that there was Mercy but the only Mercy there was in Christ the word that had been revealed by the Lambs that was it that's the only Mercy that there is you'll find that Mercy nowhere else but in his bride if hearing the message is not the most important thing to you you're distracted well Rouse you're just not called maybe we're called to just be church members hello everybody hola todos I'm going to say it again maybe we're called just to be church members when the Rapture happens worshiping and praising yeah are you willing to place your Eternal destinations on your distractions a man that's got the spirit of God in him or a woman this is Souls that are in prison Live that word you've never even heard that message how are you going to live it this isn't easy to preacher but we know when the next movie's coming out on the calendario that word lives right out watch now here's the Silence of the seventh seal now that's the um you and I live in the word says that's the heart is how he gives his Revelation to his people Revelation from heart to heart Sangre en a hen that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people written Epistles is that right could the third pool be on Thursday here a heartbeat is only heard it's only heard unicamente in hearsay and silencio poodle and there was sight you will silencio and El Cielo nobody else could hear that heart but those that enter into their closets and those that seek Him from a willing I say this what if it is but I'm asking all these questions look at the scriptures piled in here could it be is the third pool to preach to the Eternal Dooms that's rejected the message of Salvation is that the third pool he's asking these questions but then he comes to this three is perfection and the ministry talking about Christ in in that Ministry of the seventh angels right in this ministry of the seventh angel the ministry come to its Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in natural Republic amongst human beings thus it was us son of man revealing peace wasn't a man that could tell them their name and where they come from and what their disease was he was revealing Jesus Christ in natural again but not in that body of 2000 years ago what a body today the son of man being revealed produced Christ again in natural products and I like what brother Branham says in the message Fellowship I will tell you as I as brother will comes yes what are you waiting foreign he says this God Is Back there's no one else I could say it like this oh the Holy Spirit had come upon the church but God is back like he was in the Garden of Eden he's not going to be he is back already [Applause] like he was in the Garden of Eden communing with our souls speaking to us not out there to our souls during Revelations transferring Revelations they know who they are look in the mirror say I am a son of daughter of God I am the one that was lost but now I'm alive go home and hear it this afternoon we
