Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus your cousin Elizabeth is also a child despite her old age with God nothing is impossible Mary tells Joseph everything the angel had told her Joseph decides he will put Mary away privately fear not to take Mary to be your wife for what is found within her is conceived to be of the holy [Music] ghost Elizabeth you'll never believe what just happened to me what has happened Mary the angel Gabriel appeared to me and told me I would bear a son conceived of the Holy Ghost and that I would call his name Jesus what's wrong Elizabeth as soon as you said the name Jesus I felt my baby moved for the first time years later Elizabeth's child would be known as John the Baptist who baptized Jesus and he would prepare the people to receive Jesus as a Son of God the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus ordered that a sensus be taken and decreed that everyone had to travel to their city of breath to be counted even though Mary was due to give birth soon Joseph and Mary began a trip to Bethlehem when they arrived in Bethlehem they faced another problem hello I'm looking for a room my wife needs a place to

not watching where I'm going wait a minute I'm following a star too this tells a prophecy being fulfilled that a child will be born soon the king of the Jews did I just hear you both say that you are following a star I have been following it too we should follow it together cuz six eyes are better than two we all we all B from King towards Castle maybe he went no King C we are looking for the king of the Jews we have been following a star and it led us somewhere nearby we believe we close wait there's the king of the Jews since when we have been studying the stars for so many years and all of a sudden and one appears it was it was like a messenger trying to tell us something a messenger that's a good one we do believe the Stars a son from God that your child would be born the king of the Jews not the not just the king of the Jews the King of Kings well continue to follow the star and when you find where the child is come and tell me where he is exactly so I may come and worship him too yes of course your majesty my king Do You Really Want To Worship the so-called King of the Jews what of course not I must get rid of this king of the Jews immediately list see have you have you seen the star haven't seen nothing have you seen the star please raise your hand if you've seen the star has anybody here seen a star that's brighter than all the others we've been looking for so long I guess we're going to have to find it by ourselves look there it is there it is there it is there it is Bethlehem but they walked out the gate and when they left that city of Darkness the light appeared before him again the star appeared in the Bible said they Rejoice with exceeding great joy they must have actually shouted a little they rejoiced with exceeding great joy they were overwhelmed the star had appeared to lead them to their final destination of their Journey they followed it now they know it hangs lower than it used to it's just a little closer now and finally as they went along rejoicing and praising God through the night Amen Let by the hand of the Lord the fire of the star come to a little state which was a little place in the side of the Hill a cave and there the star rested over the C Hallelujah and these Mighty mag eyes over a year and six months in their Journey on their road traveling watching following nothing nor other direction but the star and when it rested they went in and there they found the Babe Jo jph and Mary and they brought gifts from their Treasure Chest amen they offered unto him gold breaking sense and mirror if we just had the time let's stop a minute what did the goal represent he was a king he wasn't to be made King he was born King he was God the Eternal King as the wise men slept that night an angel appeared and warned them not to go back to King carara to tell them him where the Savior was I had the strangest dream last night so did I I never dreamed but last night I saw an angel that told me to go home and not talking heard anything about Jesus I had the exact same dream truly this is a dream from the Lord and King herro wants to kill Jesus we'll go home another way let me check my Google Google Maps for another way home guard guard yes yes have you found this so-called King of the Jews yet no there're just some so much children all right uh forget about him for one tiny little second um what about the wise men have our spice seen where they went I can't believe no one thought about putting an air tag on them before he left some people no so the wise men went to Nazareth and then they came back but they went home but don't worry anything good come out of of Nazareth no not really um but still I'm not taking any chances take the entire worldy guard and slay all the children in the Kingdom two years and under yes so King Herod decreed that all the children two years and under would be slain the lord gave Joseph A Dream in which he warned him to take Mary and Jesus to Egypt where Jesus would be saved Mary I had a dream from the Lord it is safe to return home now King Herod has died and nobody is searching for Jesus finally we can return to our homeland from Jesus we are going home so the King of Kings returned home and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man saving the Lost Healing The Sick and Performing Miracles and there are also many other things which Jesus did the which if they should be written in everyone I suppose that even the world itself cannot contain the books that should be written amen e [Music] Go Tell It on the Mountain Hill andwhere it on Jesus Christ [Music] isor for silence my behold throughout the heaven a sh of Holy Light tell it all the around over the hills and everywh go it on the that Jesus Christ is shephered and trembl all above the Earth bring out the angel chorus that held our savior's word Go Tell It on the Mountain over the hills and everywhere Tell It on the M that Jesus Christ is B down in our manger our humble Christ is born that brought us our Salvation that bless [Music] Christmas Go Tell it all the mountain over the hills and everywhere Tell It on the Mountain that Jesus Christ is born that Jesus Christ is B Merry Christmas mer Christmas Jehovah God man took on our stock crossed himself from God and become man there's the sign become was God and became man not rich man but poor man this is the super sign you've asked for a sign said God I'll give you one an everlasting sign he could have come otherwise as I said but a baby why did he become a baby when that first little toothless mouth opened in that manger on that first CH first Christmas morning in his little manger crib and the first little yell that went from his voice that was G crying Jehovah crying man man come from God and was man every wh man come to the world with nothing but still man what was he trying to do what was he purposing he cried like a baby in the manger he played like a boy on the street he T like a man but yet he was Emmanuel this is a super sign God dwelling in the creation that he created the super sign it shall be a sign unto you and another thing the word was made dust flesh and dwelt Among Us the Jehovah the word became human became dust and Tabernacle with us everlasting sign shall never end oh when we think of it an eternal sign the super signs of all signs God becoming one of us coming down to earth means that God gave his life so I could be BN again everything too it means Christ saving me and coming down to save me he bring me Redemption and he me he's going to me he fulfill the promise that he had made for me he CH me it means a lot to me knowing that someone loves and cares for me that deeply Christ is coming to Earth meant that when Satan tried to seal my life with an incurable illness and no hope his birth death burial and Resurrection meant that by his stripes I could be healed and have a hope for a future uh it means that he's coming down to redeem his bride I means that Christ came down to earth to redeem me and show his love to me what Christ coming down to earth means to me is that he came down as flesh to show his unconditional love even when I felt unlovable the coming of Christ means everything to me knowing that he is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is my compass to my way back home and when I got into the good way I am right now and found uh God or G Jesus Christ uh into my life and put me in better path um Christ coming down to earth for me made me feel like I wasn't forgotten and showed um unconditional love more like a light at the end of the dark tunnel like when things seem to get hard and you just got to keep on walking and pushing forward and he's he's something that you look forward to seeing someone that you look forward to seeing and um yeah he's everything what Christ coming down to earth means to me was that the Creator came down to become my savior and present friend what Christ coming down to earth means to me is he came down from glory to become nothing so that I could become something in him he means to me that he's going to save every single one of us like it truly means to me is that God predestinated and knew that I was going to choose him first before he came down and that's why he came down to save us as well well I want last but now I'm found uh he pulled me out of the myy clay redeemed Me by his specious blood and call me his own God Lov me so much that he came to Earth and through his life he paved the way to my Redemption um Christ coming down to earth is like a second chance um for him it was like no words can describe how it how it is cuz he you know he he he went on the cross and died for my sins and uh when the Lord took my mom it kind of made me want to love him more and more um every day and it just really inspired me open my eyes a little bit to become a better Christian have a better it means to me that he's coming back to bring Redemption and that he's coming back to get his ride and just take me home that he came down to die for me to that way all my sins would be washed away what Christ coming to Earth means to me is that I can overcome any trial in my life with him Christ coming to Earth meant NeverEnding love and grace Christ knew the sins I would commit and the mistakes I would make and he still came for me his never- ending love and grace Christ coming down for Earth meant my freedom and he gave me a chance at his word which meant a Christ it means like God like God gave His only begotten son to pay for a sin that's it what Christ coming down to earth meant to me is that he became me a broken spirit so that I could become him his holy spirit what Christ coming uh down to earth means to me it means uh gave me a shot at eternity give me a chance to live forever with them and also to form a relationship with him Christ coming down to earth to me means that he he put his pain put his own life to have pain that you can't even understand and that I can spend one day in eternity with him gave me a chance because without him I there would be no chance I can make it Christ coming down to earth means to me is he came to this earth called Reuben and he repaired restored and renew Jesus come down to earth has adjusted my soul to where it needs to be what it means to me is that God loved me so much that he left his throne in glory to become a man just like me me to be able to feel and know what I go through every day to better understand me he gave a nobody a chance to be friends with a somebody Christ coming to Earth means prophecy being fulfilled and my savior coming to redem me so to me it means it means everything the word became flesh and he purposed the ultimate sacrifice to come and bring forth life to me me and to you and to give us the Eternal purpose [Applause] [Music] oh the sound of heaven was still and the silence filled the Earth till the promise was [Music] fulfilled Son of God through
