as we have heard the word of god and and it is the answer for our day yes and we're grateful to all those that have come this morning we're grateful to to them to the lord for that in the book of saint john the eighth chapter of san juan ocho and we're we're going to be 32. and uh i'm going to say some things that you've already heard our pastor say many things that he's already said yeah but i think that they they would help us this morning as they had have always helped us the bible speaks to us in saint john 8. and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free i'd like to entitle the message this we're grateful to be in your house this morning happy that you have called us to this wonderful gospel gracias and we're grateful that you have have placed us here this morning and happy lord that our desire is still to come to serve you content we thank you lord we give you many thanks gracias we thank you for your mercy and your grace gracious and we thank you for your loving kindness david one time said thy loving kindness is better than life in the name of jesus christ we pray is is worthy to be loved and all our praise and all our honor go to the lord jesus christ this morning and uh as uh you are in your in your in sitting down in the book of revelations the 12th chapter and the seventh verse and to all that are in the fellowship hall god bless you this morning [Music] revelations chapter 12 and verse 7 says and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not and prevailed again they've already lost once they're they they they want to see if they can ever win but they've already lost that that means that we've already won the bible says and prevailed i hope you get that this morning prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven i want to say to you this morning and i have good news this morning [Applause] that old serpent called the devil he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him now you know why we have so much trouble he was cast out of heaven unto the earth and his angels were cast out with him now the prophet of god mentions to us and then it was thrown down from heaven lord it this is the reason why the apostle paul would tell us i see another law at work in my body warring against the law of my mind [Applause] and he says what a wretched and he keeps on telling us in the book of romans knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that we hence more serve should not serve sin if we live after the flesh we shall die but if we live through but but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body [Applause] that's that's why we're here [Music] [Applause] in vain would we be doing we die from amongst the rest of the people are either joining one side or joining the others but there is conflict between two people and at the same time between all this conflict but it's within the [Applause] the one that satisfies our souls the one that hears our cries the one that gives us liberation ah the one that gives us liberation and says this is he says again because that will that also includes death that includes every problem that you have in the great speech that abraham lincoln gave to us this is is by far would be the greatest presidential speech ever given is let me leave it there but this is the great this is the great abraham lincoln this is the grand abraham lincoln this is what brother branham loved so much about about abraham lincoln was his character a new national now he says we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated you know very few of us can can endure from one service to another very few people can endure from one day to another which is but this is worth the great abraham lincoln said can this nation endure and can we as a people endure and i we ourselves there are 1183 messages that have been recorded of brother branham that's not all the messages he preached those are just the ones that are recorded have we received have we uncovered enough of and that great revelation can we can we ask ourselves a question who's greater than cancer god is right that the the the the the commission of of of the angel the commission to brother branham was this if you can get the people to believe you just played [Music] not even cancer would stand you know the bible speaks to us in matthew 24 24 i believe and i got faith right here all of a sudden a false christ comes and and and and it arises and it arises in my members and then it rides in my mind but there is uh something that that garners my attention and the thing is that that that that a man that is born of the spirit of god he cannot commit sin because the seed remains in him so something something tries to raise up and that seed pushes it back down something wants to say i i can't do this why is it that we that we we say this is we describe god as um omnipresent and we can go into describe and and and all this but i'm telling just just on the basis we but then we are not omnipotent is foreign there was war in heaven and the omnipotent god through michael cast him out there's war on earth omnipotent god through was created for the devil nation survive can we survive and we endure the bible speaks to us that endureth to the end a house divided against itself cannot stand and this is i believe what our pastor spoke to us the other day speaking of abraham lincoln and he says a house divided against itself cannot stand he says this government government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free este i do not expect the union to be dissolved but i do expect it will cease to be divided but i do expect the hospital it will cease to be divided it will either become all of one thing or all the other toyo either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction shall become lawful in all states old as well as new this was the great the great divided a house divided against itself cannot stand speech is this it cost him his life did did it get did did did slavery get abolished right away no no did part of the of the south get free partelive but still in all the border states there was still plenty of slavery when did this happen what what happens right here this is your car you you can only go 65 miles an hour when you see that sign how many actually go 65 miles an hour god bless you brother how many others others you actually go 65 if you but if there's a law that says you have to treat each other well that does not diminish what you feel in your heart you can go and shake the man's hands by law you can live anywhere you want but inside of the heart and you found it in these last years a lot of people that live with that bitterness and the preacher or the pastor or the or the song leader will say shake your brother's hand might my father always said this whenever you would hear christians say if i wasn't a christian i would beat up that person no you're you're not a christian no no no no no no just by saying it you're not a christian because you have christianity as a law christianity is not a law they know not what what do i do i didn't have to give grace to somebody else i haven't actually been rescued this is the apostle paul i see that me and me two laws bill and me those ladies when i want to do good when the kiddos the devil is right there present right right right there right there trying to rise up in my membership if we would have had cnn or you don't want neil saying any the civil war probably would not have gotten to where it got to possible they said if we would have cnn in 1945 in the beaches of normandy what happened there's some bloodshed that was left and it left the heritage of grief and bitterness what is it now let's let's let's go and let's rename all the high schools but but let's not but let everybody do whatever they want to in the high school and take down all the statues that are not right all the confederate statues and how about the heart let's go and do all of these things that make us think bad what makes you think bad is not a statue lo que los pensar what makes the person act the way they answering to the to to the nature that is within ourselves battle with that am i a son of god am i a daughter of god there [Applause] when you know who lives inside of you and when you know what lives inside of you can be interested you know it's not the second or the third person of the trinity you know it's the person the omnipotence that dwells inside the heart of his people oh what a change that has been in my life oh what a change in my life make sure that tommy jr don't deceive the greatest enemy that i have not that man outside not anybody in here no it's not the greatest enemy that i have it's me myself i i nobody calls you on sunday morning and tells you don't come now for there shall arise false christos you know anything that is against the word of god anything you might you might hear our pastor say something you say no i don't think it's that way the spirit of antichrist just hits you you can't say it any plainer than that oh i don't know about that oh you know what is happening yes this is a civil war and an antichrist just stood up here but when will be the time that the sons of god can stand up someone said brother branham said when you was off those eight months understand this is what your message the time you almost that you are you almost to a breakdown he said he asked him the question question did you keep your religion brother branham greatly used of the lord and i said no sir a religion kept me merely you know i i have to say this i've heard the greatest messages that you'll ever hear i remember just a few weeks ago that a man stood behind this desk on wednesday and sunday and if god don't stand up for us that day we cease to exist because we did not know i did not know what god was doing in ourselves but when i saw god stand upon god never forgets his promises i gotta say that again god never forgets his promises you don't know how much i don't know jesus never forgets this scene it's not isn't whether i hang on brother says it isn't whether i hold out no no it's whether he holds out or not whether he held out you know i could stop right there let's not say one more word that was eternal stepped into so much that he was nailed to a cross and the reason he did that you won't have war in your membership that's the reason i'm safe tonight brother brown says not what i could do not by good works are we saved but by his mercy god saved us in christ unconditionally he saved us in christ unconditionally now skip to this but but i'm going to to to just do say this real quick you shall know the truth paragraph 217 of the seals the second seal you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free see the truth makes you free god marks his when they come in god marks his by vindicating his promised word through them that's exactly saint john 14 12. and another thing you want to put down i.e mark 16 jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe ukraine and this is this what got me so much yes now only brother branham only says these these two these two this this pair of words these these this combination of words i've only found it one other time if you find it other times god bless you i only found it another day now let's just take that a minute talking about mark 16. and then he asked the question was he joking establiando [Applause] and some people that got sick and other people like we that that are that i got sick in my mind or other people that were disturbed by spirits according to mark 16. they shall lay their hands on the sick they should now recover yes come on church you're healed you are here and you are healed by god's grace i'm here this morning because he he this morning because when there was a big war and a civil war going on in my and the congregation says no what's he joking church no no yeah no i gotta i gotta go here in second kings and you heard brother omar speak about this in second kings the seventh chapter sitting on the outside of the gate of the city of samaria it was so bad in samaria that they were boiling their children and eating them they had become cannibals they were selling a burrow's head how many would eat a burro much less the head which these four lepers this is sitting on the outside you know people people have a misconception of backsliding or all he does is he just spits back down on his hunches don't walk back all he does is just he comes in and the moment you sit down you sit i'll stay home and i'll hear the tapes that's great i'll go i'll sit home and hear the internet that's great stay in but that the operative word is i'll sit until one of them looks at the other and he says of the second kings because he couldn't see and and elisha tells them open your eyes and upon the heels where the fiery chariots now you got to remember this february 28th of 1963. seven angels came from eternity and they came to a man but the man was so what did the seven angels do off of my trousers i
