you have it you can say amen and Uncle Isaac too see now I'm going to get in trouble because I didn't mention Uncle Abe and all the other uncles and and uncle uncle AJ she now I'm really in trouble because I did not I'm not going to get everybody all the uncles too and yeah dear and the other Auntie over there see I'm in trouble now God bless you all amen it reads like this but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and we all say that together God is a spirit and they that worship Him should worship Him in spirit and in truth right and mess up somewhere they that worship Him that word must is the same word and you must be born again it is necessary it's necessary you ain't gonna get away from it is they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen last Sunday as those of you that were here Domingo pasado we spoke on the subject was and there was war in heaven everybody remember them hasn't been too long so I hope that you still remember it and there was war in heaven but today we're going to focus a little bit different here and we're going to follow this war you want to kill this war and see how this war came to Earth remember what kind of war was it somebody help me out this is Sunday school brother who wants to help out it was a war of words somebody was listening good job give him a high five he was listening that's awesome Amen it was a war of words it was a spiritual warfare but now it not only is a spiritual warfare spiritual but the enemy has made it into a physical Warfare it has become a war of Flesh and Blood also now we have a war going on in the in the physical and in the spiritual world the first battle we we understood was fought Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels and they were kicked out heaven and then that great Army of the devil watch what he called watch what brother Branham calls them the great Army of the devil and all his imps there you go that's right it was the devil and all his imps they fell upon the Earth and God knowed that there was going to be a battle oh my I'm grateful to God that he knew that there would be a battle tell your neighbor neighbor there was gonna be about they're gonna be a battle and nobody I don't care turn around and look at your neighbor there's not one of you that is exempt from this battle you can say well I didn't uh I didn't I I didn't uh want to or sign up for it everybody here says I was just born I didn't have nothing going on I was born into this world they automatically sign me up yeah watch this now once once again and all museums fell to the Earth God knew there was gonna be a battle can somebody tell me what started it all in heaven what was the root of all this this problem and that became this this Great War I mean sure you can answer a lot of different things but but give me something that brother Branham says what was that the root of this of this war somebody help me out very good I like that somebody's on the ballast now any of you ever been jealous before wow wow wow brother Jim wow okay let me see how many of you really are how many of you have ever been jealous ah look she thinks she's all hot and all that so so we go to the store and what are we looking for a dress that's just a little better than that one I don't care what color it is as long as it's better than hers foreign and he got jealous of who he said or the kin of Michael very good but then he brought it down the jealousy he brought it down to the Earth and now he transferred it into man hi buddy hola amigo gracias love you brother that's the way the devil does right very Sly and he just slides it in there the next thing you know you don't even know why you're jealous who cares nobody cares it's a little heavier nobody cares but he came down to earth and he transferred it into man then every war every battle every scuffle every Skirmish always has its roots in jealous think about it every war that's ever fought that was jealous every word that's fought there's a woman involved right think about that when I deal with people that are fighting in a in a family fighting in a church you always find that jealousy is at its core if it's in a family because they're on the wheel and I'm not on the wheel is and why is Mom and Dad leaving the car to them why are they leaving me the bank account it just goes on and on it's just after a while it's the same thing billions and billions of years later after they were created angels all of a sudden felt us a difference something different in Heaven Los Angeles jealousy had entered the Realms of heaven and now it was being transferred into man didn't always know how to handle this war hello and sometimes we don't know how to handle the war that we're in it seems like we're always reaching for something just trying to get a handle on this is hot and heavy you haven't noticed anybody here notice the war is hot and heavy but as the battle raged on God has always give always given his people those words and it doesn't matter how many times Satan changes things God doesn't have to change his word he gives us his word in order to fight the good fight of Faith trickery is that is that he he pulls you one way while doing something else right we know that smoke and mirrors we've talked about that but it's always that true he does that so that you don't recognize him and his imps and if he can get you to focus on the flesh you'll never know how to fight him in spirit and this is why we feel trapped come on now I want you to look around we're going to have a good time this morning I want you to look around and say is that your enemy amigo no okay but we say no this it was no and then we still fight with each other I'm trying to get I'm trying to get a handle on this neighbor again okay okay is that who you're fighting against personas but we know it in theory in theory but when it gets time and they boil your blood oh my God there's people that can get under our skin huh right [Music] have you gotten mad and you've lost it before we're gonna have to preach a message on anger but if they're honest that's good and through the word though he gives us the answer on on how what to focus on and how to deal with it Ephesians 6 11 and 12. we know all these things with doing something about it we can quote you this all day long but then when we're when we're during the week what happens oh man the devil's really beating me up in my head I can't I don't know what to do what is Ephesians 6 says put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against The Wiles of the Devils is the trickery for we wrestle not working that's not the way we were taught to read it right okay Reuben somebody help me out here you're going to tell us how to read this I want you to read this for everybody everybody knows how to read this scripture because we know it repeat it but then when it comes time to use we don't know where's it at where did I leave that thing go ahead um there's still for Reuben wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the principalities like all right hold on right there all right have you got that did you get that everybody got your name in there right so I have to say for Caleb wrestles not against flesh and blood so when Caleb wants to wrestle against flesh and blood Caleb's got to remember this scripture against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in the high places we want to learn this morning I'm going to help you like so so bad when our children do something wrong and I want you to get this because because we have these issues when our children do something wrong something we don't like we can become abusive in a hurry right foreign that's never happened to anybody no why are you all laughingness I'm not understanding what's going on here and the problem is sometimes we don't just do that we go through with it is your fight against you and your child watch why the problems in the home he said and we we make it as is as if our child is the problem when your child is your your your inheritance but we want to beat down on the inheritance all right come on now I'm gonna I'm bringing this thing to a balance too because then there are those on this side all right Johnny don't worry about it he didn't mean to do it and there's never a correction are you weird yeah if I were to I probably could divide you completely down the middle in church today you would have this side this side over here we don't believe in spanking our children this is a new generation excuse me and then there's the other side here the rot spoil the child yes and so you find that in the church and the problem is is that both can be right and both can be wrong as we've heard before there's there's these two little things in the back of us these two little bumps and that's used to be a attitude adjustment but but here's the thing why we can be wrong whether you would spare the rod or not the point is that the corrections we're trying to put it through as a as in Flesh and Blood we're trying to get that child to understand and we think the more that we bound on them the more that child's gonna come into obedience that's always the case often think about it if I'm bringing there's got to be uh there's something that I'm after and that correction is the correction I cannot bring that correction I think that it's about flesh and blood so I'm I'm naked about that we make it about that we look at them and then we we beat on them sometimes and then we take things away because we're mad but now how many of you you know you feel bad because you handled it wrong and we give it back what we took away because we're trying to make ourselves feel better how many families are following me there is no correction that was made there no no no correction the child is just more angry at you young people they'll Rebel more at you hello everybody hola you have little children enjoy them they got some problems wait till they get a little older get a mind on their own and like yeah I ain't gonna do that you think about it it's the world we live in right now now stop and think for a moment what have I done I've made them Rebel more I made the fight or the war between me and them I don't like what you're doing but why is it is that the way that we think of correcting it is not God's way because first of all for me to correct anything there is an enemy that has come in somewhere come on church I gotta know as a parent got these little imps they come in and they squeeze themselves you can come back with him you go to school and you come back with him you go to work I'm back with him those hitchhikers that's what we call them right we carry them with us and those imps have an anointing with us all we're trying to get at is but if I recognize when I see my child act up and I see the the powers that are anointing them the rulers of the Dark World spiritual wickedness I'm no longer attacking my child I'm attacking the spirit the powers that that have anointed them [Music] what's the balance here this is what we're trying to do hello then we many times because we've never dealt with those Spirits we've always just shoved things under the carpets but against fallen angels I put it in the other way he got a real fight against fallen angels and that's why Isaiah 14 says how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations brother Branham says on the questions and answers on Genesis two-thirds of the earth is in sin OS and more than that which two-thirds of the Angels which two-thirds of the Angels was kicked out and those demon spirits come into people and those Spirits those demons they come into people and they habitate their body see what I mean they're demons that once they was they once existed and they come into people and they give them a nature wow and then he says Jesus cast seven of them out of Mary Magdalene Jesus now did the question is this morning now did these visuals ever stop worshiping God that's a good question ah once again did these Fallen Angels ever stop worshiping God I don't believe that they ever stop because they were created for that very purpose but now their worship is perverted they continue worshiping God you're under a perverted worship and I can see what perverted their worship because they began to worship the creation along with the Creator they didn't stop worshiping the Creator but they started worshiping the creation along with it they began to worship Lucifer which is a creative so they began to create or worship the creation along with the Creator these angels have been worshiping God and we heard the other day billions and billions and Aeons of time foreign but God rejected them from the beginning this was all God's plan not only did Lucifer and his imps come to Earth but God knowing that the battle would be hot and heavy fortified man he fortified his children he didn't just leave him out there so that whatever could happen to them happened he never said I'll just figure it out on your own fortified by his word and no matter how much Saiyan changes his mask God don't have to change his words what a God we serve he's mindful of us he loves us Osama Ephesians 1 4. as he began to lay out the plan according okay okay brother Yandel I want you to read this for us according as he according as Yandel has chosen Us in him let's let's start that again according as he hath chosen who according as he has chosen right before the foundations of the world world that we shall be that that we that thank you brother Yandel what a tremendous thing brother Branham says in the believe it the seals and he says oh and what a plan he kept planting what a planet is according as he have chosen Caleb in him before the foundation of the world should be holy and Without Blame it's in Manchester before him in love watch brother Branham in questions and answers again God was created me William Branham now I gotta put my name again God created me Caleb Perez I was before the foundation of the world you put your name there already yeah I was before the foundation of the world being my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know but I was there we're not conscious because we bypass our theophany but we were not conscious but Caleb was there put your name there it makes it makes it so personal oh he says I don't believe you're getting it come on now church I don't believe you're getting it now just for a minute Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here that he chose us in him before the world began now there was some part of me and then he says there was some part of me and the rest of you all here in Christ Jesus Christ before the world ever began and here's to my analysis I think that the people today that are possessed with this Spirit or this Spirits a part of these Angelic beans here you go brother Jim apart a part of these Angelic beings that rotated off of God never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven you resisted the devil's lies in heaven how are you today you're gonna resist the devil's lies the same God of Glory the same God that's here today that you also can resist the devil's lies today okay let's stay a little calm here I'm sorry I get a little excited here I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know another but that's what the message came to do how many remember when brother Tommy spoke that message why did the message he said to remind us he said I was inconscious of this but when I opened up my conscience to the message Theory began to minister to me what did it do it showed me that I was there this is the message the rest of you we're all there you don't remember it but I'm reminding you right I'm reminding you where we were in this again there's a part of us our spirit connected to those Angelic beings that never fell in the beginning watching the message end time evangelism that you don't despise one of these little ones for their Angels hello oh they're angels you say oh those little ones are the children yeah tea that is when you did this unto one of these my little ones you did it unto me watch here they always behold my father's face remember and right away they the children they have an angel no he says if they have an angel when you're born it stays with you all through life not just when you're a little baby stays with you all through life I could I had time I would I'm going to get into that maybe in my next one maybe the next message but but but it's tremendous instrumental when a sister asked brother Brandon then well brother Brandon then if God gives us free more he gives us the will to choose is that the greatest thing on earth he says no he said no the greatest thing on earth God's Will and purpose but I'm not getting there not yet I don't know I see then God creating the spirit man in his own image and the spirit man was to have dominion over five categories and God says let us make oh I like that all right somebody's and God said yeah ah let us make Joe let us make Elijah yes who is making you alone and he gives them dominion over five things he says let Caleb have dominion we don't believe this huh where's we're afraid of a little chihuahua anybody do that you ever scare somebody at home that's the style open the door what do we say I wonder how expension looks like let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the cattle over all the Earth every creeping thing now you have a bean that is a son of God not just an angel a servant a Son of God and God forms then a body flesh so that this Spirit man has a place to live but after the Fallen Angels start to get into man and they began to cause chaos inside of man not just on the earth no more but now the war is coming into the Earth watch this now inside of a man by a corrupt and Fallen nature and man began doing exactly what the Fallen Angels did yeah worshiping the creature more than the Creator and the things that man was supposed to have dominion over he finds himself prostrating before dumb dead Idols Idols that aren't alive are Idols that aren't alive people cannot walk or talk [Music] glorify them not as God I'm gonna I'm gonna read just in English neither were thankful but they became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened how by fallen angels professing themselves to be wise they became they became full and they changed the glory of the uncorruptable god into an image made like corruptable man there's the Earth he was supposed to have dominion over here and to birds that's the fowl of the air he was to have dominion and four-footed beasts that's the cattle he's supposed to have and creeping things that creepeth upon the Earth there you go wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worship and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen do you see a church Fallen Angels coming into man it's not to get you to stop worshiping but it's to pervert your worship say that again it's he doesn't want he doesn't care if you worship God or not but he wants to pervert your worship that's what he's after they don't know anything else but to worship the Fallen Angels we are all Born To Worship not your neighbor that neighbor we're all born who worship or can I say we're all Born To Worship because if the same Holy Ghost foreign we're all Born To Worship You Will Worship I'll go I don't want nothing to do with God you're going to worship something hello this is what Michael is preaching Miguel hello you're going to worship something maybe it's your child oh my God that doesn't make sense to a lot of people huh maybe you'll worship your child this is the message show us the father and it's the face of this is maybe it's your car maybe you're home or your job maybe even your church Iglesia that will not work it isn't the church we worship it's God yes but there's something in the human heart that calls out foreign he came to his Altar and worshiped the Lord but one now listen closely because we're going to get to some good things here but one of the greatest mistakes that a person will make as a worshiper is when they start looking around and judging another worshipers watch the perversion come on now we're heading home I see the spirit start to change it changes the beat of the drum changes now we're gonna now we're getting in we're getting home now we're heading home when one worshiper starts looking around and judging in other words Fallen Angels at work it's hot and heavy what happens when one person starts looking around at other worshipers eyes off the one they should be worshiped no one they're supposed to be worshiping at the moment you take your eyes off of him jealousy this is all scriptural this is all the messages and then they begin to ask why did God accept their worship and not mine how did you know that unless you started looking around foreign right those Fallen Angels who have made their way into man become worshiper assassins [Music] oh church I don't know if you're getting this or not again they become worshiper assassins your War has come to Earth then what do you see on Earth tremendous is oh assassinations going on today yoy you see the assassination of many worships worship Killers people laughing at others making fun of me smearing name all in angels trying to kill the worship I was so blessed on Wednesday to be in the Bible study there with brother timings it was all so good tell you what I enjoyed myself so much me and my wife and there was a part of that Bible study is really got my attention and it was a question that was asked does Christ find you attractivo that one rocked my world oh where the Bride of Jesus Christ Our bridegroom's coming for us does he even find you attractive I could go so many ways in that it was hitting on nagging wives rasongan do you find a nagging wife attractive attractiva why is this so quiet what happened everybody I ain't even gonna go down that road but does he find you attractive the type of worship we give God shows how attractive or unattractive we are and we show our worship not just so much by our voices but our lives our life speaks so loud rounds out our voices I'm a Christian that's drowned out many times yeah yes there are those that come to church to criticize that but it's true there are those that get online just to watch the services and criticize but they know nothing of the planet all I can say is how art thou Fallen Lucifer brother Caleb you calling them Devils no my fight's not against flesh go to church get it my fight's not against flesh and blood me Plato noise somebody speaks about me and I react to that my fight is against flesh and blood and that's unattractive to Christ but when somebody speaks about me and I say I don't care I love you I'm making the war against them I'm gonna love that Spirit right out of them then the brother can be free from that come on now we make it so personal all the time they get into that in a moment you're gonna have you're gonna answer the question not me oh hello everybody remember when Jesus was talking to the disciples telling them he was going to suffer he was going to be rejected he was going to be killed and then he would rise again on the third day and the first thing Peter did is the Bible says Peter rebuked Jesus the Bible says Peter rebuked Jesus Jesus the word made he rebukes them no not on my watch no he said no no it's not going to happen Jesus stops and says come on what does he say you know you what does he say what does the Bible say hey get the behind me Satan I still love him imagine if brother Caleb would say that to anyone in the church I ain't going to church he said again call me Satan Gary behind me saying that is though that which is of the flesh understandeth as that of the flesh but Jesus was never calling him saying but what was anointing Peter and looking here what was anointing him here what was he trying to do what he did in the beginning you keep the atonement from happening but I'll raise again oh Jesus not on my wife I already dealt with this back in the heavens you will not stop what I can't do you will not stop the purpose why I came to this earth foreign hours rulers I love him he made a way for us who is Jesus talking to Jesus it was Fallen Angels my brother Caleb hermano Caleb who are talking about you news flash I don't care yeah some people are online they're just criticized I love you whoever you are I love you te amo that's it esta Lucas foreign that's for all of you that like to get on and care what everybody thinks foreign wow sons of God Daughters of God caring about garbage like that because Fallen Angels just anointing people to take your joy and your peace and everything hold on you don't recognize the angels have come to Earth for you you're after your soul oh Lord help us this day well they were saying this and my question is why did you stay long enough to hear the whole thing oh come on you act like you don't know what I'm talking about and they said this about you and they said and I'm like why did you stay the whole time to hear everything because you have itching ears and the anointing that was on them greater than the anointing that was on you like it is and your anointing that you claim you have is not strong why am I oh my God yes yes well brother I cannot be deceived because I have the words clear to you today if we don't become the words you will be deceived I don't care how much word you have it you will not be deceived in some point or another remember the message that brother Branham ever say it's okay to talk bad about someone again nothing good to say about anything then you keep your mouth and somebody comes to you I got some good stuff because that's when somebody comes to you with a heavy heart and says Mana when somebody tells you something there's two things one of two things you're going to do you're either gonna expose them you're going to get on your knees and intercede that was quote brother Tim on Wednesday either you're gonna expose them it'll intercede for them and if you're intercede you say nothing about it get on your knees and you cry out to God Lord take away these angels come on now what are we gonna do Church you want to come up higher than come up higher we've got to live better than what we have been living that after so many years people are still trash is I told somebody this week a couple of people not just one God told a couple of them did you know that listening to gossips you're just as guilty as the one telling it is yes or yes COC or if the one telling it had no one to tell it to nothing we wouldn't have a gossiping problem in the church think about this oh I'm gonna shut the mouth of the devil today you need to stop gossiping she's the person that I've ever heard in 30 years of ministry I've never said pray for me because I got a spirit of Gossip is excuse me nobody thinks they have a spirit of God important they're just passing along information yeah right but watch the account the counter attack here's the gossip I don't have to worry about the gossiper to worry about what I'm lending my ears put my hearing off from that foreign let me leave the gospel for a moment but I will tell you this I think it's time that we remove from our front yard hello everybody it's time to remove it now instead of just sitting there and being a landfill for every foul ugly filthy spirit that comes it produces more cold and in different people in the church than anything else and it always comes with a religious coverage [Music] get off it foreign [Applause] where were you now watch as the battle rages on that dirty little devil that scares me that little imp this is the war rages on every radio every radio every television every phone every website foreign every preacher every devil Diablo is after your soul come on Church they're all after your soul and my soul but also every Angel and every messenger and every preacher that was sent of God we're also after your soldiers hello everybody we're off all of this morning it's a fight yes come here brother come here yeah come on come on quickly don't touch the fight that is the fight this is the conflict between God this is the conflict what's the conflict God and saying what's the conflict between them conflict between God and saying is is who or what conflict is where the conflict between them one or the other you know is trying to get you you are at the front the main headline of the agenda is I read this from a from a Dr Joe dispenza yesterday I'm not by any chance not by any stretch of the imagination am I finish him but we're coming around the corner and I'll start to die down Dr Joseph he says this he said let's go now watch why there's so much stress in the world and why are you coming in you need to calm down right and here they have okay you need this and you need this is and yet many don't realize that we go through because we were not made to live under the stresses these bodies were not made to live under the stress watch what he says fix it okay they say stress is when your brain and body are knocked out of balance the stress response responde is what the body does to return itself back to order if it's an event that happens right away and it's over is this an event we've heard spider fly right if it happens right away and it's over you get back to normal right but when it's a constant struggle foreign how do we continue in maintain in this day and age we live in come on come on now our mind just never stops we go to sleep we wake up it's still going to sleep stressed out to the max struggling nature inside of us struggling nature yeah drive us to our deaths you're headed for disease no organisms can live in emergency mode or an extended period of time 95 of Who We Are by the time we're 35. is a memorized set of behaviors emotional reactions unconscious habits hardwired attitudes and perceptions function like a computer program when you start your day thinking of the past things that have already happened already living in the pastasado did you get that everyone if you start your day that way thinking of what I did wrong yes missing what he's doing right now The Familiar past they say this will be the predictable future becomes the problem I want you to keep pulling for another 10 minutes and the problem is people can't think greater than how they feel oh I like that I'm going to say that again people can't think greater than how they feel of course not they're stuck in the past their feelings have become the means of their thinking oh here we are now this is the last part of our message and then we'll and then we'll we'll call it but we're not going to have service this afternoon you just put up with me just for a moment when the plans were all drawed up Jesus was given Jesus before the foundation and the plans were all drawn up this is the way it's the unfolding of it is and right at that momentum I don't know about you but I like this right at that moment and that's the moment and it was all laid out the bride of Christ was given to him come on come on that didn't excite you okay somebody said say it again and the plan was folded was unfolded that moment and that's the momento the bride La Novia was given to Christo and every member there was a part of that Pride names were written in the books this is mine it's this meal I cannot and I will not lose her not one of them will be lost it was all drought up and died into the world he came and died so that he could redeem Caleb and Justified Caleb so that Caleb he never did it in the first place oh come on now here it is and this is the message I never did it in the first place when was the first place before the foundation of the world did not sin back there he didn't lose me back there and he ain't about to lose me today he ain't gonna lose you today because you never did it back then watch what he says now you never did it at the first place Caleb was trapped into it ah let me tell you again Caleb was trapped into this but we don't remember certain things but we never sinned in the first therefore we can't sin in the last place my mind just goes and goes watch this now you knew that was right quick when I saw that eagle that was in the cage that's when you realize that you were not a denominational you know there was something wrong there's something wrong with just sitting in church services and so you act like the chicken in
