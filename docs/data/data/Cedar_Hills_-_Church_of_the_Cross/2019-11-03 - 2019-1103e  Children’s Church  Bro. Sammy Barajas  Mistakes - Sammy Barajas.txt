here's our game there you guys are get in there alright I'm gonna need someone with a lot of courage come up here towards the water and read a scripture for me address so we're going to be reading Matthew 1425 and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea amen thank you thank you for your courage now that's you guys a real serious question okay I need to know you guys need to be honest how many of you guys make mistakes wow you guys are honest you guys don't make no mistakes not even little ones right so today we're gonna talk about a man that made many mistakes in the Bible but Brown says he's a man of many mistakes you know we're gonna talk about this man but I need all you guys has helped has helped me yeah so I need you guys to like this put it right over your head this is your imagination cap we're gonna put it on Kay I'm gonna tell a story and you guys gonna imagine it in your mind one two all right there you go it's on now in this story we have the disciples in a ship there on the sea we have Jesus on a mountain he's praying they just got done feeding multitudes of people and Jesus needed to gain his strength back so he went to the mountain to pray now he's on the mountain praying the disciples are here on the ship here's a little it's not much of a ship it's more of a boat John boat I called it the John 3:16 boat dock that was pretty cool so here they are on the boat they're going in Jesus on the mountain praying the disciples are on the ship the waves are rocking back and forth the Sun is going down and it's now the evening time the Bible says but all of a sudden the winds start to concur and the waves start to go high and high and the ship just starts maybe this does a back flip or a front flip or whatever whatever is doing the disciples on the ship and they're all they're all freaking out they're all scared maybe you have one of the guys with the bucket maybe the waters coming onto the ship and when the disciples has a bucket he's throwing all the water out of the ship as fast as you can maybe there's another one trying to pick up the anchor but it's too heavy and he can't get it out and then maybe there's a man Peter and Peter maybe he's trying to bring down the sail do you guys know what the sail is on the ship on the boat what is it the wind you know what it is it's this piece right here it's kind of broken but it's this piece right here it's what picks up the wind and it makes a ship to go forward right so Peters there he's trying to pull it down and I was pulling it down he looks up and he looks and there's someone walking on the water could you imagine there on the sea and a ship and it's rocking back and forth and it almost looks like it's gonna sink they're throwing the water out there trying to get the anchor Peter's trying to pull the sail down and then all of a sudden there's a man walking on the water that's got to be pretty scary huh would you be scared I know I would be scared so here they are and then someone cries out it's a spirit does anyone know what the man on the water says so the man on the water says be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and this man that's talking is Jesus he sees the disciples on the ship he sees a ship going crazy so he's walking towards them he wants to see what's going on maybe just be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and instantly Peter knew who was talking he knew that it was Jesus he said Lord Jesus if that's you on the water if that's you on the water can would you allow me to come to you does anyone know what Jesus says next Hey does anyone else know what he says he says come so Peter he's he's excited right he has all the faith in the world right now he's excited so he steps out of the boat and this is a small boat okay obviously I don't fit in this boat but he steps out of the boat he takes his first step on the water he's walking on the water now Peter now let's stop real quick Peter he's a human being everybody go like this feel that that's called skin that's awesome laughs now Peters a human being human beings are not supposed to walk on water right it's a little odd and maybe all right I got a question but this is only for the kids okay how many take baths okay you guys all take baths okay so when you take a bath you fill the tub up with water maybe you sit in the tub and are you are you sitting on the water no oh you're sitting in the tub right the water is covering you taking it back all right how many go swimming all right so when you go swimming and you step into the water you're not walking on the water are you know you're swimming you're in the pool the water is covering you you're a human being so here's Peter he steps out of the boat Jesus has come he steps out of the boat and he's walking on water but the crazy thing is Peter's not even worried about the water right now does anybody know why he's not worried about the water because he has faith because he knows God is with him because god's in front of him that's exactly right he has his eyes on Jesus so he's not even worried about walking on the water and I wasn't even thinking about it he just wants to get to where Jesus is that but now you guys remember I asked you know anyone's made mistakes right so here Peter is walking on the water going towards Jesus and for a split second he turns his head and he looks at the winds he looks at the waves maybe he sees the disciples on the ship and it's just going crazy so what begins to happen he loses his faith yeah he uses his faith doubt starts to come into his mind in his heart so immediately he steps in oh he starts to sink under the water is that funny here did my face jiggle a little bit yeah so he starts to sink in the water and immediately Jesus help me save me Lord right is that funny - I'm not a good actor I'm sorry so here he is they save me Lord and what does Jesus do does he stand there he says well you wanted to come onto the water what does he do he helps him right immediately he stretches out his hand and he helps him but now that's not all that happened see Peter he wasn't lit off so easy as soon as Jesus grabbed his hand does anybody know what he tells him No what was that what was that he says o thou of little faith and to Peter that was a spiritual spanking hey that probably didn't feel real good to him this was God Almighty telling him oh thou of little faith when he said that he's probably heard him so deep down inside his soul ouch so did he really just tell me that a little faith no when I was little I made a lot of mistakes a lot and man to the rain can testify to this I was always getting beat up and down in the aisle I was always getting beat but these beatings were good for me when I made a mistake I've got a whoopin and the whooping was good for me it helped me to grow it helped me to learn sometimes I mean I'd get beat and I get even worse and then I'd get beat again and I'll just get beat all night that's how it was but this story tells something a little different Peter he just got his spiritual spanking right he stepped out of the boat walked on the water fell he got a spiritual spanking his all his friends in the ship are about to sink instead of getting back on the ship when Jesus helped him instead of sitting there sad like this his hands crossed maybe do you do that when you get in trouble no you don't do that you jump up happy huh yeah so instead of doing instead of sitting there moping sad the Bible says that they began to worship Jesus saying over truth thou are the son of God how many can do that after you get a whoopin maybe you can worship God a little bit does that kind of seems a little odd I still get weapons to this day I still get weapons I get well we cause grown-ups a spiritual uppercut so let's right here in the chin my pastor gives them to me sometimes so here they are they begin to worship Jesus instead of moping around they begin to worship and a member of Peter he's still wet he didn't dry off instantly he's still wet from his mistake but he's not letting that bother him maybe the devil's they're trying to tell him he just made a mistake shouldn't be worshipping God right now remember the mistake you made yesterday maybe the devil tries to tell you guys that but remember Jesus is there to help you back up you make it right you don't have to worry about those things you can come to church the next service and worship Him with all your heart and that's my message to you guys this evening the little children and maybe the youth and maybe anyone else that it can help as a Christian we're gonna make mistakes I still make a lot of mistakes but if you make them right and you seek after the one who can fix the mistake or cover it with his blood you won't have to worry about those things anymore and I said that's my my message to you guys and I pray that he can help you guys I pray that it can be a blessing to you guys how many know my son Sammy all right how many hear him almost every service crying he's probably the loudest baby in here hmm now he makes those mistakes right he cries he acts he acts up and he wants to get up and scream he wants to run down the aisle he likes running to the drums he has something with the drums will see some down the years maybe he'll be the next drummer of the church he makes those mistakes but does that make him not my son anymore no he's still my son do I still love him yes I love him and I forgive him for those things and maybe he does get a little spanking when he gets home but I still love him and I'm always gonna love him he's always gonna be my son and I'm sure that your parents feel the same way about all of you guys if you guys make a mistake maybe you get a little spanking many years get home but your parents still love you and they do it because they care for you and the Lord feels the same way for us maybe we're gonna get a spiritual spanking but it's because he loves us and we gotta continue and we gotta press forward and worshipping Him and living for him every day you guys I'll get that yeah good I'm sorry was very short but that's all I have for you guys today I pray that it was a blessing to all of you guys and God bless you guys [Applause] I'm gonna enjoyed that can we give another one to the Lord now how many of you sometimes you feel like you were like Peter just sinking away but Peter had to cry out for Jesus you had to say master come on help me don't let me perish but deep down in Peter he loved the Lord with all his heart even if he messed up he would he would just love the Lord and let's sing that song I love you Lord and with with all of my heart if you can sing it to him just say Lord I I know I've made mistakes but but with all my heart I love you with all my heart Lord I love [Music] my [Music] you oh my soul read your take joy my king [Music] whoa Oh [Music] to [Music] [Applause]
