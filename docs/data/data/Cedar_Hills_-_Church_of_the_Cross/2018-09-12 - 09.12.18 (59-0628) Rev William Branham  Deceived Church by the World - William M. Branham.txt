grateful for this and pray that you'll give us faith to believe it with all that's in us now let us lay aside Lord every toil of the day every care of this life all the way from the janitor to the pastor that there would be nothing in our minds now but be waiting listening reverently for the Holy Spirit to speak to us that we might accomplish something good to know more of the bard gathering together for Lord truly that's why we come on this hot day speak to us to the Living Word and let the Living Word dwell in us and abide in us that we might be shaped and farmed not to the world but be transformed by the renewing of our spirit into the farm of the son of God Oh hearts tremble when we think in the joy floods our souls to know that we can be called sons and daughters of God we stand on the very brim of his second coming and all and kingdoms quivering under our feet all things of the world is vanishing but knowing that someday he shall come and shall take us to a kingdom where there shall never be an end or it'll never be moved and to think that we are now that the subjects of that kingdom Oh God circumcise our heart and ears today but by the Holy Spirit through the washing of the water of the word far we asked it in his name and for his glory amen [Music] I wish to approach the subject this morning far I was going to speak on something a little different if there was to be a healing service but we announced that the prayer cards to be get out at 8:00 so 8:30 or 9:00 o'clock and I just Billy come up the house a few minutes ago and he said there was hardly anyone here so he didn't get out prayer cards so we'll I thought of taking this text for a correction of the church now I want to speak on the subject of a deceived Church by the world I wish to read some now out of the book of Judges the sixteenth chapter beginning with the tenth verse I am Daliah said unto Samson behold thou has multi-and told me lies now tell me I pray thee Orion that might us be bound and he said unto her if I bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied then shall I be weak and be as another man Delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him there within said unto him the Philistines be upon thee Sampson and there was liars and wait abiding in the chamber and he braked them from off his arms like s threads and Daliah said unto Samson hitherto thou has multi-and told me lies tell me were thou mightest be bound and he said unto her if thou weaver seven locks of my head with a web and she fastened it to the pins and said unto him the philistines beyond the and he awakened out of his sleep and went away with the pins of the beans and with the web and she said unto him how canst thou say I love thee when in thy heart is not with me thou has multi these three times and has told me or in thy great strength lies and has not told me where in thy great strength live and it came to pass when she had pressed him daily with her words and urged him soul that his soul was vexed unto death and he told her all his heart and said it here there has not come or razor up on my head for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb if I be shaven then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like another man I'm when deliah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called the Lords of the Philistines saying come up this once for he has shown me all his heart and the Lords of the Philistines came up into her and sought money in her brought money into her hand and she made him sleep up on her knees and she called for a man and he calls to him to shave off the seven locks of his head and begin to afflict him and his strength went from him and she said the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said I will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he wished not that the Lord had departed from him now I wish to read for a text for this subject found over in the book of revelations the second chapter beginning with the 21st and the 23rd verses and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her in to a bed and them that commit adultery with her and to great tribulations except they repent all their deeds and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works may the Lord that is blessings to the reading of his word Sampson great deal like the church started off right he started off in the right direction he started off and was called a mighty man of Valor but he started out serving the Lord in keeping his words and doing his commandments and that was somewhat like the church it started off on as we would say as a world expression started on the right foot started to keep the commandments of the Lord and as long as Sampson followed the Lord the Lord used Sampson for God can keep anyone and use anyone that will follow after him for it's God's business but when we turn to a side away from the things of God then God cannot use any longer one will walk steadfastly after the commandments of God one will stay in the pages of the Bible and worship by the written word worship Him in the spirit and in the truth of the word then God can use any individual but when they take a notion to turn aside I after something else then God cannot use that person any longer so Samson makes a and a very outstanding representation of the Church of today when the church started God could use the church for the church walk diligently after the commandments of the Lord kept all of his judgments and his statutes and done all of his commandments and God was with the church but it seems to be that there is such a weakness amongst the church we remember we are not on a picnic but we're in a battlefield many people just think that when they become a Christian that that's all they need to do that settles it forever if they are a Christian then everything's going to come easy don't never get that in your head where I become a Christian to fight fight the good fight of faith I become a Christian to get into battle lines we are Christian soldiers and we've got to be trained and brought up and all the techniques of the enemy to know how to fortify to know how to to fight the fight and we can only do that as a Holy Spirit will reveal it to us we cannot take what some other nation tells us when we go to war some of their ideas but we got to take our own ideas the way the Holy Spirit would direct us and what ideas he would give us because he is a commander in chief of the army of the Christians Samson did good he was a great man until he began to begin to tell me we would call it scallywag around until he began to get off of his own territory and the church didn't run well and was alright until they begin to get off on their territory Samson begin to flirt and he was not flirting with Israel that is girls he begin to flirt with a Philistine girls and that's somewhat similar to what the church did it'd never begin to make love with its own it got off after unbelievers and begin to flirt with unbelievers that's where we made our great end one of the greatest mistakes s when the church begin to do things that wasn't right and begin to keep like Samson bad company Samson as long as he was in the company of the Lord's people he did all right but when he got to flirting with bad company then he got in trouble and that's the way it is with the church when the church fallen reverently and daily after the leading of the Holy Spirit God bless them and miracles and signs and wonders followed the church but when he begin to keep bad company with the world one of the worst things are done in the first things that done it begin to organize breaking up fellowship amongst other believers because it found out that nations were organized but this great gospel is not dedicated to one nation are one people it's dedicated to whosoever will let him come all nations Kindred's tongues and people God never didn't in for us to draw boundary lines but man wanted to be like they come there are two a copy after go like the the world say the things that they do make a success the way they were success we cannot never be a success doing anything the world does we can only be a success as we follow after God's statutes and his way of doing things we can never be by patterning after the world if the cigarette company has met their greatest success by television and the beer and the whiskey crowd has made their great success to the contribution of television that's no sign that the church shall make it success television the success of the church lies within the preaching of the gospel of the power of God and the demonstration of the Spirit we cannot say because that television done such and such further cigarette company in there and the other companies we do not have any scripture to character to compare with them people and as long as we do we may draw great numbers of people but that's not what God ordained us to do we think because it we're all colors by ha great organizations causing great colorful things to take place that it's a success we are dying daily on our feet spiritually speaking if we stood 10 million strong this morning and the only spirit wasn't witness we'd do well to stand 10 strong with the holy spirit with us we cannot compare with the world one of the first things does the church begin to organize themselves the first organization was a Catholic Church and then come the Luther church when they organize through the Catholic Church to make it an organization one day there was a crowd the Philistines is on the Sampson and Simpson both the parts of the balance of the Catholic Church and Martin Luther came forth with the organization's then they bound the church with another card as deliah did and they begin instead of having God call man man who were called by the Holy Spirit maybe didn't know their ABCs but they know Christ then the church got stylish in fashion after the political speakers and they had to give their preachers doctor's degree everybody had to be a Doctor of Divinity that was another card to buying the church man go often studied each seminary tries to produce the better scholar so that their churches can brag our pastor is a Doctor of Divinity what did they do one time to have more knowledge than the other well that doesn't mean anything in the sight of God and there's no need for any men to try to take his worldly knowledge and ever please God with it it's an abomination in the sight of God you never please God with the worthy ambitions and knowledge because it's enmity to God says the scripture he cannot do it and each one tries to have all the knowledge they know just what to do in the word to say and it becomes just a political speech instead of a power Li demonstrated Holy Spirit message that sinks to the heart of man and discovers the sin they're trained for political talks we don't need that Paul said the word come to us not only of the gospel in word only but to the power and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost that brought the gospel demonstrating the powers of the Holy Ghost but all these men go off to seminaries and they learn great education how they must stand before the people how they must present themselves how they must dress and how they must act they should never use the wrong grammar now that's all right for a political speech but we are not changing words of man Paul said the gospel and I preached didn't kind of like that when it come to the renewing of the Holy Ghost and the power of demonstration come by right form speech that's your wisdom of be or your trust would be in the wisdom of man but it come to the demonstrations of the power of the risen Christ that's the gospel to know him in the power of his resurrection each one tries to think he's a little smarter than the other man each denomination the Methodist to say we got the smartest man the Baptist will say and the Church of Christ and so forth they all we're the smartest we are people we don't let just the ordinary man go out and preach the gospel but they pick'em god have mercy hey pickin if they're in dhaka native but there are certain doctrine then they put him in the church God take touching him no way I want somebody to preach to me that's been hand-picked by the Holy Ghost God has raised them not picked by man-whore denominations all knowledge they say all we know all about it and some of them doesn't know the first alphabet of the Holy Spirit they denied it reminds me of a little book I read one day in California about ten years ago I picked it up in an old bookstore I forget who was the author just a little tin set book but it had some good sense to it though it seemed jokingly and cunningly but I found something in there that sounded like God to me I'm one of those stories started out like this one morning in a great chicken pen that was a second little rooster that thought he had all the knowledge that there was to be known so he thought up on a box and beat his little bill against the box four or five times threw back his little head a coat like you never heard a rooster crow and the others he attracted their attention and he said ladies and gentlemen of this chicken pen I would like to speak to you all this morning on some great educational program we have just designed said I have required a lot of knowledge in my studying as he pull little glasses over his bill and he said I have decided that we chickens can better ourselves by more knowledge therefore I can tell you that were if we will dig and work and a certain pin a hole will find a certain vitamin that'll make us crow better prettier feathers I know I can tell you how we can in better ourselves and many different ways and the little bullets with their little red combs they just Calculon said isn't here darling and they certainly admired him oh he is such a brilliant rooster reminds me of some of these shares seminary preachers such a brilliant man there's no need of us hanging around the rested chickens we all ought to go with him well before the little feller got his speech finish that was another little chicken that didn't have such bright feathers come running in from the rest of the chicken yard and said boys just a minute I just heard the latest bulletin on the radio chickens went up for cents on the panel we're all born to the slaughter tomorrow what good your knowledge gonna do brother all the knowledge that we can a killer ate what good does it do we're six foot of dirt we're all dying by inches and by minutes our knowledge means nothing we want to know him but they do that as I was remarking some time ago about a certain little canary and he thought he ignored all the knowledge that it need to be known and he knowed so much that he could tell all the rest of Canaries about the human beings he flies up on his cage and he begins to speak about the human being how he know it all about them and all of a sudden a professor from Purdue walked up and begin to speak some high polish words to him and the little fella batted his eyes and turned his head now he had eyes he could see the professor he had ears he could hear him but of course he didn't know what he was talking about why he's got a canary brain he's just a bird brain that's all he's got yes got a human brain so he can't think like human beings neither can a human being take my cloud you're human all the whirling knowledge is no more than a canary brain all you do you just hurt yourself with it you've got to have the mind of Christ the reason people go and join organizations and substitute a handshake instead of the new birth their time to bypass the new birth they don't want the new birth and they know we teach it in the Bible so they won't to substitute something for it and the Pentecostal people are just as bad trying to serve the Tucson they want it in class it's must be just so classy we'll shake hands and join the church and be sprinkled or baptized or something they're afraid of the new birth I sometimes believe the brand of tabernacles getting afraid of it now we all know that a birth i don't care where it is or abouts it's a mess if a baby's born on a shock pile on a hard floor or in a Pete decorated hospital room it's a mess anyhow a birth of a calf birth of anything else is a mess and the new birth is nothing less than a mess but people are so starchy we'll go over where they shake hands we'll go over where they don't bawling-crying beat on the older crowd you want to be too human what we a seed an old potato a seed potato you take that potato and put it in the ground until you can have new potatoes that all potato has to rot a corn cannot produce new live until it's rotten and a man or woman can have new birth and tough there are intellectuals and their own self is rotten dead down at the altar and scream get all messed up the place the sparks gets out of your color and you're a born again by the Spirit of God I don't care if you swallow speaking tongue jump up and down stop like a chicken with his head off you're bringing forth new life but we substituted something part we want the classical way sure the other day Friday wife and I was going to the store I don't mean to harp on this but as we went down the street I just kept turning head one way for the other naked women I promised God when I was a blind man if he'd heal my eyes look at the thing was right I keep a little cross hanging in my car when I see such as that I'll look at the cross and say Oh God that's my refuge as I looked at the cross I've seen those women meet he said we haven't seen one woman today this got on a skirt and she said bill look at that woman there but those little steps around the top of her body said you mean to tell me that woman don't know that's wrong said if she doesn't know it's wrong then she's out of her right mind I said just a minute honey she is an American she does as the Americans do I said I was in Finland not long ago sweetheart and I questioned there to a man that set me down dr. monument and we were going to the the health baths let's call the Sunda and they take you in and pour hot water water on hot rocks and it just sweats you then they make you jump in ice water and then back out then you take you into a room and there's nurses and they're women who scrubbed the man and them naked sent it back into the pool I wouldn't go in I said doctor money and then that's wrong he said all right then Reverend Brennan that's wrong that how about your American doctors that will strip a woman naked and lay on the table examined every sex organ she's got how about your nurses and the hospitals I said excuse me brother onion onion you're right what is it it's customs when I was in Paris I could hardly believe it that the urinals for both men and women were the saint's one I couldn't understand it that the restrooms was on the side of the street for both male and female I couldn't believe that when women went to the beach to go swimming a boy and his sweetheart they had no dressing rooms they just took all their clothes to the last garment then turned their backs and put a little strap when swimming but it's so they paid no attention to it it's a custom of France in Africa women and man young and old no clothes at all walking through the prairies never know what a restroom was or things I never went out of each other's sight but they don't know the difference they don't know the difference but it's customs of Nations but I said honey we are different we're from another nation we are pilgrims and strangers sure that's what makes these things look so wrong part of the Bible said they they professed such claim they show that they are pilgrims and strangers they are seeking a city to come a man or woman in Italy in France in Africa in any other nation that's ever born again while the Holy Ghost don't do those things they won't wear those clothes they won't act like that because they're of another nation whose ruler and maker is God we're from heaven the spirit that's within you motivates your life if you are American you'll do as Americans do if you are French you do as the French do and criticize the other but if you are about you'll do the way to do it heaven because your spirit comes from above and it controlled you a little something you might look at in the scripture those who sought this new city acted different they profess that they were pilgrims and strangers but on the side of cane they become fugitives and renegades but Christians were pilgrims and strangers a fugitive has no home well renegade is a horrible person but a pilgrim is something real and from a real hand in another nation trying to find his way home but fasting by his living then he has something that he's from another country there is the reason but yet those people who do so those people who wear those things let me tell you in South Africa when I saw thirty thousand raw heathens naked blanket natives 16 18 20 year old girls boys was not one stitch of clothes standing there with mud at their faces and paint it up bones to their the hose and blocks of wood hanging from their ears and cross human bones or some bones in their hair animals teeth hanging over them naked as they come into the world and didn't know it but when they received Christ and fell on their face receive the Holy Ghost they got up and founded their arms to hold shame to their bosom as he walked away and found clothes to put home why they become pilgrims and strangers to the sea they were away from them yes sir oh yes these people call themselves Christians they belong to churches they go and say we are Methodists we're Baptists we're Pentecostal we're seven day Adventists we're this that the other that doesn't have one thing to do with it your spirit the light that seen you motivates and tells what you are jesus said by their fruit you shall know them the church has become like Israel first they seen all the heathen nations having a king God was their key and they seen the heathen nations having King so they wanted to act like the either nations and they bought themself a king and as they did it they got in trouble gradually begin to come in razzed in the world begin to slip into them finally ended up in a Arab one King come in this little poster - a little closer to it and finally squeeze the life out of there they even when their real King come they didn't know him that's the same thing the church has done its adopted policy education it's adopted organizations Society big churches including preachers I when the real King comes they don't know him and they're crucifying the very we go Spencer King no but they laugh at even make fun of me as they Jews did their Messiah the church is doing their Messiah the same way not they haven't got the spiritual insight because they're so documented with their eyes and what they see great buildings trying to compare with the world we're never exalted exhorted to to compare with the world weird hearted to humble ourselves and what is a machardie in God and today in the healing advances out on the fields there's such a competitive competitors once as a blessed God I have so many thousand I got a bigger median you have what difference does that make we have 100 1 million what difference does it make are we true to God are we true to his word do we stand under test of the Holy Spirit is it true that's the meaning but we compromise upon the Bible lot of our Pentecostal people upon the fundamental doctrines of this Bible compromised first I don't want to hurt feelings on an all-in Church not feeling I could do just what in the church because I'm preaching the gospel but there's tens of thousands of Pentecostal preachers know that there's no such a thing in the Bible as a baptism in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost I challenge the archbishop for anybody to show me where anybody was ever baptized in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost but they compromised the cause these organizations has did so there's not one person in the New Testament and for 300 years Edwards but history of what was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what is an organization yes did it compromising and today they took all the street workers off the streets they've tucked the tambourine out of the church they've taken all the glory out of the church and God scenaries precinct little all rooster : preaching all polished in society and their women wearing shorts and dresses that they're skinned into and man smoking cigarettes and gambling and telling dirty jokes disgrace in the sight of God I know that's rough but it's time somebody said something [Music] compromising giving you an acting like the world I don't care if I have to stand alone with nobody but God alone I'll preach the truth of God's badness bad boy if I die I'm still staying for the truth truth nature up not according to the church but according to the Word of God I want to measure but Daliah did you notice she know that Samson had a power and she didn't know where that power laid she couldn't tell what that power was but there was some great power that Samson possessed and she wanted to find it and his Daliah she kept wooing samson after her beauty oh she dressed yourself real sexy and she walked before him in CT he'd like some of the little teenagers of the day and so forth they would just act like something other striptease trying to woo Samson to her that's the same thing the world's done to the church now worries your great power well if will organize that'll break the power the Catholic Church done it but the Philistines is only Samson and a Luther canal and they organized again if you buy me with another card it'll hold me so they did and the Flis teens on these Sampson what happened Wesley came out broke the card now you've just seen me all at home don't you know I love you Samson alright tell me the truth in your heart all right you buy me with another card all right how will do that what is that that's the denominational card you let me be free that I got no denomination then I'll tell you how many broke so how come the Pentecostals where's your power bliss thieves be upon thee and he broke the cards again but now what happened it's got the Pentecostals the big doctors of divinity for their pastors some great men they've got just as much school and ritual as the Methodists or Baptists rather essence God go into a church and you can't hear a man just as cold as a bunch of Eskimos out of the North Pole cold indifferent I now bless these is only Samson the Philistines is on the America where is that oneness of spirit where is the oneness of Pentecost the similes of God and then United in the Church of God in this that the other each one but the different is and this one with that and this one with that we're so broke up too you can go into a city the whole revival of one church sponsored the rest I won't leave attend [Music] the communist is up on the America where is our power where's our glory why is it because we want to have the wisdom of man instead of the power of God why do we got our preachers and things are so stiff and starchy till they've organized us to wears starch is stiff neck no people do you ever hear a shot in the church anymore you never hear anybody cry the mourners is put in the basement there's no more glory in the church all we do is set back this as stiff as we can be we're not three we're bound but devil with his modernistic demons has bound the Church of the Living God [Music] that's right there's no more power in the church there's no more freedom the people so starchy and stiff while the God can come into the midst of Pentecostal people and show that he's God and through these signs of his resurrection it don't even shake what this race a walk across the country God working performing signs and people sitting well I guess that's all right oh I know it can be done it doesn't move and why they're bound with the world not being guided to about them into a confederation the Philistines are only Samson what you gonna do about it oh we've got great denominations sure we have greater membership than we ever had but where's the spirit where's the Holy Ghost that's what the devil is done it's moved into the church it's kept fooling the church come to me I'll give you a great big tabernac over here if you'll just do this if you'll get rid of that fanatic preacher you got and get a man or a doctor to villages got some sense will be able to isolate classical Church it would be like the rest of them shame on you rather have a man that didn't know spit coffee from beans but was filled with the Holy Ghost that was unconference but the power of God but Scott oh so starchy the Sun poor Saint can break through in the meeting if speaking tongues or shout a little bit or do something and the rest of them all gather around and look what was that well wonder why that must be a fanatic dropped in somewhere you know that's the truth some poor Saint step in get a happy enough to raise their hands to cried praise the Lord somebody who already manager the preaching the gospel and the rest of them turn around to see what he said that's Pentecostals what's the matter you're a pattern a for the Methodists and the Baptists they pattern at the Catholic Catholic pattern here for hell then all together all after hell right the lion has wuji in the big churches find educated ministers take the better class well you know so and so now here's a millionaire if we could just get him to come into our congregation in Hong anh if he isn't born again then he doesn't deserve to be there I don't care if he's got a million dollars if he owns 40 Cadillacs whatever he's done he's got to be harmed again come right down to a new birth and be regenerated by the Holy Ghost and come out learn a new verse not squeeze me crying screaming and like the rest of them laughter worship Ruby's got it hey [Music] that's what's in here Samson the Philistines is upon thee the Communist is up only the world's upon thee the devil's upon lean they go back and they see the Spirit of God perform miracles and do things of his resurrection while jesus promised they say you know I think brother Bram's got a lot of mental telepathy my pastor said it was of the devil you poured hypocritical diluted infidel I don't polish stuff you wolf in sheep's clothing jesus said if you don't know me you don't know my name but you've got a bunch of souls to try to make you like the rest of the world we want a bunch of man of God who don't compromise on the work but preach the truth and stand on the baptism of the Holy Spirit but what is the world on is shaved all your power off you were born Nazarite Pentecost but the world certainly shades your power not just the starches the rest of them what are we going to do what's going to happen there's one glorious thing and I can think of the in this text while Samson was bound we can't have a revival listen our loyal brother Billy Grimm revived in our day listen Oral Roberts cream revival in our day listen to rest them reviving are they how can we have a revival when we're bound we bound the Holy Spirit with our organizations and traditions and we can't have a Holy Ghost revival I know that scorching hot with the weather but it's the truth how can we have a real Holy Ghost revival when you're so bad starchy farm of God and his survival said it had fire love godliness but would deny the power thereof the power of whopped the power of the organization the power of the world the power of the church the power of the Holy Ghost that's the secret place in the church and when the church adopts educated preachers and big buildings and finery in the stead of the old-fashioned Holy Ghost it'd better be a mission again how you gonna have revival for the Holy Ghost people questioned and bounded it afraid of it there's where the trouble on the Fliss teens is only but the one blessed hope we have while samson was in jail what's the first thing they've done when they caught him they bound him first they took his power away they found his secret they found your secret the world found your secret now you and me all Bob your hair's goes like the world you man all go to act like the world's all right tell jokes and dirty jokes and go out and smoke a few cigarettes and run out with the neighbors wives and everything else like that hello sociable great to hold your job I'd rather lay on my bedding eat soda crackers and drink branch water and stay clean and pure before God than to compromise or any kind of a job true stay true to God Samson the Philistines is on the Brandon Tabernacle Worley ISM is creeping in among you what about it have you exposed your secret have you exposed that secret to God give you when you were watering there in the sawdust a few years ago have you let it creep out the social faunal worship what's happened to you God can come down and perform a miracle go right down to the audience and tell people a secrets of their hearts and everything and he was sick and afflicted it Motors and preaches were as hard as it can buy the Holy Ghost and if people say well I guess that's alright we enjoy listening to it once in a while if we're not too tired that's Brandon tabernacle the Philistines is only one used to be when the preaching of the word and the old Saints with the tears and Rahab would rise to their feet and walk solvent maybe not saying a word is walking around three times and sat down so filled with the Holy Ghost a word family alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of them bliss teens is only Branham Tabernacle flesh teens is all-new Pentecostal of course the Felicity's got you rest of you a long time ago when you organize yourself so tight nothing can come unless you the Presbyterian Baptist Methodist Catholic or something you wouldn't have nothing to do with arrest them so revive in our today how can we have it when the regular Reviver giver is bound by the world God will come in where the world is you can just depend on their you've so shaped with the world and it's it's all of it when you let the world creeping you go to act in act the world then you are finished but when you cut loose ever offenders we worldly come to God God will use you until you go to flirt and again here's the only hope that I have this morning to wind up my message is this while Sampson was bound a new Chaka haired wrote out God send us another church just before the income that the power of the Holy Ghost can prevent or in the demonstrations of the spirit and mark sixteen can follow the church acts two and four acts 2:38 although it will be following right along with the church signs and wonders accompany the Apostles great signs of his resurrection accompanied while we're in prison surely God's growing a crop somewhere for the last great kill may it be you my Christian friend here thus more maybe you're straight let's begin the girl I pray that this message this morning and out into the land of where this will go I trust that this message will help bring the vitamin to your system that'll grow a spiritual power back into your life again let us bow our heads Oh Lord God creator of her the heavens in the earth the author of everlasting life and the giver of every good and spiritual gift take these words us morning and place em into the heart of the water and Lord may that people pray over these things seeing that the world has booed the church and has finally found its power found its secret place found word its secret lies and has shaved it off has taken the peoples that once shouted the victory once had the victory and it shaved them off to stay home always denied to watch a television program taking the joy out of their hearts and giving more love for the world than they have for God has given more world for worthy and more desire for worthy entertainment than they have the preaching of the gospel if there's not a great band and a lot of carrying on and whooping and carrying on then they don't want the old gospel anymore that brings tears of joy to the soul that brings divine healing bank that restores the apostolic gifts to the church that brings in the risen Christ the Messiah of disdain but as Israel was bound by by their kings that they could not follow the real king and the real king when he came they didn't recognize him so is it today Oh Lord the King of glory has appeared in the form of the Holy Ghost and Lord they don't know it they don't recognize it they're so organized so tight that they do not understand it because it's not in their organization Lord this is a work of the devil it's done this to the people may the Samson of God may the true in heart those who are longing and crying and pleading wholly-owned may they stay with the Lord until this new crop grows out until there comes forth a gator joins on on there comes forth a group that can recognize and understand that can see them a sign and the hidden powers it's hid from the world that they will not understand now grant Lord that they'll see this or we asked it in Jesus name Amen oh just now Oh Lord sand the power just now and bad time every they were in the upper chamber they were all with one Accord when the Holy Ghost descended that was promised by our Lord O Lord send your power just Oh Lord send your power just now oh how I love him just send his power they were in the upper chamber all with one Accord all the world had dreamed out him they were ended up and the Holy Ghost came today they say come join the church put your name on the book or bow down and say I confess Christ as the Son of God get up the devil does the same thing certainly the devil was baptized when Judas is baptized the devil won't preach the gospel when Judas won't preach the gospel but the devil didn't get the Holy Ghost that's it there's where the hidden powers that resurrection that no+ beyond a shadow that hey he's here that same Holy Ghost that Wang was only Messiah still on his church he never leaves I'll be with you always even in you to the end of the world I'll be there the works that I do shall you also more than this should you do for our going to my father but the world compromises it all those are days past just what the devil wants you to do they want you to glamorize God wants you baptized God want you you say oh I don't believe all that they're carrying on go ahead go ahead live in your sin live in your sins but until you rot do you rock to your own ideas do you rock to your own fashions and be regenerated again and barn again and that new life will be altogether different from the one that went down a greener car goes down yalla it comes up green goes down hard taste in it comes up flexible and blowing with the wind Oh Doris hallelujah [Music] when the winds begin to blow the grain takers of a move itself shift but the little little blade flexor rejoices grows it strengthens itself it can never become a blade until the card is dead and rotten not only dead but Robin can't come back no more but life comes out of it as I said a while ago of birth is a horrible thing filthy dirty the filth is not film but that's where life lays when you reckon yourself filthy reckon your Methodists Baptists and Pentecostal Creed's filthy out at the altar then new
