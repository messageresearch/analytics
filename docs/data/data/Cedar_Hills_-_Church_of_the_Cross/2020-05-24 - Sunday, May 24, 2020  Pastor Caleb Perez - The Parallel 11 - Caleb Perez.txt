[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you you [Music] you [Music] you [Music] [Music] word is the father the word is golf and the word made manifest is God himself taking his own work and manifesting among believers nothing can make it live but believers just believers it's not everyone you can take wheat and plant it in a different kind of a soil in liver drill but what it's got to have certain fertilize in the ground to raise wheat and if there is no if there is if the fertilize in the ground isn't isn't a wheat isn't Germa ties to that fertilized it'll never grow so no matter where the word falls if it doesn't fall in the right kind of a heart jesus said so son fell by the wayside on stony grounds and the fowls of the air come and fed on it and then you said son fell into thorns and thistles which raised up and choked out right away traditions denomination scares the world children but said some went over into good ground and brought forth a hundredfold so that's the kingdom of God it's the same thing some will not believe it all some will bleed for a little while like the disciples they followed him many of them the seventy followed him for years to find out about a year and a half or two years just to find out that they could find something any some like somebody had some power to do these things I like a rabbit foot a magician of some sort what he could do to produce these things I could know what was in the people's heart and what they were thinking and they finally found out that he said that he come down from heaven he was the word himself and when they did that that was too much farther than they said no man can understand this and they walked away from him that's those who fell among thorns it brings back to the same thing in every congregation you have make believers unbelievers and believers it's been in every congregation you find them all the time some of them make out like they're believers that's the worst of time and then they have those who are actually unbelievers he won't bother you just walk away and shake his head but those who make believe say they're believers that's the time that's the kind yet to watch as always make believers and then there's some genuine believers see them three there there was the unbelievers as soon as he said eat the flesh the son of man cold man that was it the others was make believers they stayed told it's like Judas did right up to the end but then the real believers they couldn't explain it but they believed it anything the veil tradition of unbelievers taken away you see God when the veil of traditions has been removed you can see that God is still God of his work he still keeps his word he's the is the God author of his word that is hid behind skin veils to others yes that's right to those who cannot go behind the veil he's still behind skin veils notice then we then we become part of him as you are the fail that fails him you are part of him as long as Christ is in you as Christ was of God because God was in him made him God and His Christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of Christ he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also you become part of Christ as long as Christ is hidden you that is fatal to the unbeliever but you know he is in you your Templin Christ that's behind the veil of skin then we become the hot because of this Veil the veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever as it is written see written you are written epistles of ival said and what is epistle is a written word and you are the written other words you read like this you say you are written epistles are you are the word that has been written made manifest nothing can be added to it you can't say I'm a written epistle and I'll leave you some other kind of something what this is already robocalls nothing to be added or taken away if dr. Raphael was right this famous book I want you to see it after while brother Bao's here selling the ground somewhere I see him outside I don't think you can get in but he's writing a book there it's very astounding of the Lady of seeing age now I want you to be off oppresses pretty soon so we're taking a last reading of it now and was writing who is discussing it in there see about everyone has always come to you said brother Ram them seven thunders that the voice stutter is he said write it not see but close it up said that'll be seven thunders that will be revealed in the last days seen seven thunders that'll tell us a tone that sounds real good see but watch what you're talking about what do you say that he said see that you're I did not see these seven thunders uttered their voices see and he said don't write that see but it's be sealed up in the book until the last days now someone has been he's been Semyon theologian said brother bear if the Lord God said if with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humbly seeing this said you'd be eligible to write up a Bible yourself your word if God is manifested I said that might be true see he's trying to catch me hey I said but you see I couldn't do that he said why couldn't you have all the qualifications I said but you look one word cannot be added or taken away any said well then then seven thunders you see said what them seven thunders blasting out will there be a revelation be given to something I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking some from it's all revealed in there and the seven seals opened up the revelation what that one there's still word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word and God's Spirit ever leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and open the eyes of others it'll always do that you are ripping epistles random old man or you are I translate that turn around this way see just turn it around you are a Pistols that has been written course you can't add nothing to it that's rid of all men manifested Word of God in other words that Peter John does short when they went up there they proceeded they were ignorant and I learned they had no education but they take a notice had been with Jesus see they were ignorant and unlearned but they were written epistles read that they had been with Jesus course Jesus was manifesting himself through them Christ veiled in their flesh manifested made alive like he was in Moses when the word was in Moses he was God in flesh when it was in Jesus it was God in flesh the only thing he done was changed his mess not his word not his nature he's the same yesterday today and forever he only changed his farm he changed from Noah to Moses he changed from Moses to David and David Joseph hold-downs they come into the fullness of the Godhead bodily he is still the same god I hope that gets through see it is the same God but he has takes on another veil see he puts on another veil he did their farmers take it on a veil take it on a bail until finally they come down through the Lutheran Age don't do the other age then finally comes out into the complete just before it comes a prophet arises again but it does it foreshadows the word short back Herod dealing what's been done what's been left off that the church would be without not without understanding then when this fades out man like John said I must decrease he must increase then all in all comes into him he's fully manifested to Luther Wesley and Pentecostal age know him down all that he's fully manifested is he come down just a manifestation God unfolding see non orders Paul foiled in his promises for this day as they had now Moses was the word that day because the word was given to him for that day Moses Joseph was the word in his days poetry in Christ exactly see each one I'm wants to work and what Jesus came he was the word and its fullness because the whole plan of redemption laid in him the whole planetary redemption in layin Moses dead laying Joseph didn't land well I just see they were only part of the work partner to it see I noticed keep your thought here it comes I say the whole plan wasn't in them they were pointing to it therefore after him the fullness we cannot part to something else it ports back to you the word this is a complete revelation nothing can be added or taken away from there's the complete revelation all that a shadow of him to cover when he come he was a perfect Hebrews 1 God in sundry times spoke to the fathers to the prophets God spoke to vales the prophets but in this last days through His Son Jesus Christ there you unveil out their own Calvary is son of God unbale notice made alive and today when the word is manifested in human vessels veils it's absolutely the word fulfilled in that day which comes back to God being baptized into him according to first Corinthians 12 we become identified with him hey I said hey barber can I have just a little bit longer look I just can't miss this right in here notice identified with him now notice how many American citizens is your raise up your hand all right you are an American citizen then you are identified with this nation whatever this nation is you must be is that right you're all of her glory in your Oliver shame you're identified with her you are an American so you take on America how are you I was a George Moore see when he crossed the Delaware I'm identified with him that's right I was an Abraham Lincoln F to get his brakes pick the dress I was standing in here I was with the soldiers on Guam your boys when you heisted that flag I was there I'm an American I'm dinner fight with it amen not to be an American whatever Shane isn't a revolutionary I'll bear it cause I'm an American now trying and as a Christian all the identify with him I was with or when he went in your houses Moses when he come out of Egypt hey I was a lodge or Mount Carmel yes sir glory to God I was with him when he did that I was Charlie with him identifying myself in his death on Calvary when I died to the things at all do myself and all the traditions I was identified with him I was identified with him oh nice turn morning when he rose from the dead I was identified with him on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost I was identified with him all that he was I am all that I am he was being dead in him we are identified with him why is I am what this nation is I am I'm proud to be there I'm ready to bury shame I'm getting there that's right I'm devil after Jesus Christ oh that he ever was I am I like to be identified with him then apostles when they come back they thought they'd made fun of it called everything else they thought it was a great art apparently reproach of his meaning I'm happy today to be one of them being identified width or which is Christ identified with him the Baptizer dream we become identified identified in his likeness identified with his word which is him if I am in Christ I am his word for he is the word what he is I am Hey you get it alright the word manifested are revealed in that revelation in there then what does that puts me if he is that Shekinah glory I'm part of it oh [Music] hey man that's right the word is self reveal reveals herself think the mysteries of God made known to us in this day by the same heavenly messenger that was made known to them in that day's notice the same pillar of fire that sent Moses the same pillar of fire that was on Moses that wrote the Bible the same pillar fire the pole men on his road down to Damascus and Paul wrote the New Testament remember Matthew Mark Luke and John they only wrote what they seen but Paul had there at all and roll what went on everyone wrote back in that day but when Moses came on the scene he had the revelation he met the pillar fire and it was revealed to Moses how Genesis he wrote the first four books of the Bible Moses did that right four he met God in the form of the pillar of fire bailed in the pillar of fire when Paul met him on the road the disciple jestro what they'd seen him do but Moses had the revelation went out in Egypt for three years of studying and seeing that God of the Old Testament for Jesus at the new the revelation I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision that's right right and thank God the same pillar of fire that come upon those man that wrote the Bible is the same pillar of fire here today interpreting the Bible [Applause] he-man how we thanking for that saying what a comfort what identification I'm so glad to be identified in that I don't know what to do I'd rather be identified that and all the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian all identified in that word were that's Shekinah glory in Revelation lays the pillar for appearing visible in among us identifying that the message is right like you did it mount sunny I remember before the true message come for Moses preached and he let him out of Egypt but there before the real commandment says lay down the seals was brought in God come down before the people and prove that Moses was sent from him that right a pillar of fire that Moses said he had seen in the bush and talked to him all in this last days let's see that same pillar of fire right on longer speaking the same word not only that but interpreting if I'm making it manifested proving it it's the truth so the people has not one way to disbelieve let's say just willfully want to and then he does since wilfully after having a knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for see notice saying pillar of fire sent to Moses and to Paul that wrote the Bible now sent to reveal it the grace of God the unchanging God fulfilling the promises of Matthew 28 lo I am with you always thoughtfully st. John 14:12 the work should I do you also hopefully st. Luke 17 28 29 your the last days the son of man will be reviewing Malachi for behold I send to you Elijah the Prophet that will restore the faith of the people back to their original [Applause] oh he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to others let us die to their traditions and things too revealing to other die - the denomination's - revealing to others notice the old temple had in it the Shekinah glory and the light of the Shekinah over the word the word is the seed it brought forth the shewbread to believers only the blood also was up on the covenant and the blood is the water the water that life ins the green the wheat the seed which is a word like jesus said as Moses that's up the brass serpent in it again he said God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son whosoever breeze I should not perish Moses smoked the rock in the wilderness to save a perishing people to bring water God smoked Jesus to bring forth the spirit out of him for a perishing people the blood came from him which is the water of the washing by the word which the water brings life to the seed and it brought forth the Shekinah glory shined up on the word which brought forth the shewbread and the shewbread was just for our chosen people all right now breaking into the veil through the veil into his presence where the word is not the Creed the word in their seeing the Shekinah glory the Shekinah the power the holy spirit shining upon the word bringing forth the promise show your behind the veil across the written veils where the glory never fails hallelujah hallelujah I'm living in the presence of the king I've cross the reading veils where the glory never fails I'm living in the presence of the king they will bad your skin denominations is tore down I've broke through that into the Shekinah glory and I see the word I see the pillar of fire moving I see the word make manifest what he said he would do in these nice days I see it growing I see the children eat that Shekinah bread coming from the ripening of that word which believes it hey man what a wonderful hour or living in tea the Shekinah was over the word and under there was the bread and there was the blood sprinkle which gives it water the spirit gives life to the word in the feminine heard the tape on the trial yes many of you had you see that it takes that word must grow the door to drawers got to be the right kind of ground think and God makes a promise that it hits that heart it cannot fail no all waited 120 years Abraham waited 25 years on the child God said someone that settled it sea water the word was there being watered by faith believing it it broke forth the results it brought forth the Sun it brought forth the rain did brought forth the flood-hit brought forth the virgin that was conceived a prophet said a virgin shall conceive no doubt whatever a little young girl when gutter baby clothes ready well this prophet Isaiah was identified prophet vindicated of God the Lord said a virgin shall conceive I'm going to give him a supernatural sign a great sign a virgin shall conceive there will have people and believers just like you only heard that prophets say that every little girl every man said that's gonna be my daughter yes sir everybody went both the booties and a bird on everything get ready cause they know is just going to have it that generation pastor thought that identified prophet vindicated of God how could he tell anything was wrong it must be so it was eight hundred years later but she brought forth the pass away but my words shall not pass away and shall come to pass in the last days if God here we are this is the light over the word as the light of the Sun changes the seed from glory to glory we also become more like him as we live in his presence I can't being conformed to his blessed image as we walk with Him watch what the Sun does you plant a seed what happens that seed runs inside the seed is alive the life comes forth the brakes for the stalk now that don't look like the first there's Luther it was a stall alright the stock went on the first thing you know it brought forth the tassel see that was a West End revival but like the other then along come the Pentecostal revival the brought forth the baptism the Holy Ghost alright what happened we get fungus on the ear if it gets to look wrong this thing that thing you don't look like the word is not like the rest of it it's not like the original green money but God is still there to make that's that we're just the same notice what does it do it finally returns back to the original seed again when he come in the form of Martin Luther when he come in the form of John Wesley when he come in the form of the Pentecost so he's supposed to reveal himself again like the same seed one in the Son of Man he revealed his self his son of gods through the stock age and so forth but in this last age he's really selfish son of man again get it [Music]

brother Branham had miscarriages a donor last year thing is unity how many want to go back with what those kids making it's not a conmigo for those of you that know my downstairs kid no sadness the third vision in letter service young a third vision it's not personal vision was in the realm of world politics it's not a rondelle political cause it showed me that there would be three great isms
