[Music] is [Music] hallelujah think like never before [Music] hey man can you give one to the lord [Music] amen you may be seated this time i'm going to ask our sister denise to come forth for testimony and special to the lord i actually have a couple of testimonies that i wrote down i'll read them really quickly i wrote them because i didn't want my nerves to take over and it didn't make sense [Music] so my first testimony is this past sunday i i wasn't feeling very well este and i had been like that for a few days before yeah but sunday was the worst el domingo and i thought something was wrong with me i had um burning in my chest and i'd also get some stomach cramping from time to time i felt very weak and at one point as i was getting ready for service i laid on the couch just praying that god would help me to make it to church and my husband came to me and and he said and he began to blow dry my hair for me hello and i decided to cry because i was determined to make it to church and obviously my family was also determined to get me here so when we came when we got to church i put a request to be prayed for you for me because i felt like i needed extra prayers [Music] he said that the requests would be taken care of during the second service on me i was there after service my siblings and i and our families the suede uh we had fellowship at my parents house at you're going to service right you're going to feel better you watch sorry i got all pumped because there's no other other place i'd rather be than here feeling the way that i was feeling out so during the second service right before brother diego called me up i began feeling some relief in the areas that i had pain i felt a calm and sweet presence with me the entire time that i was being prayed for for me and i knew that i had been thoroughly healed i'm very thankful to lord for healing me and for placing the ministry that came up to pray for me along with all the prayers from everybody and and i thank you all from the bottom of my heart so my second testimony isn't that long testimonial last friday i had a doctor appointment and during that appointment the doctor saw what he called a fibroid and so normally i would have gotten you know scared and cried all worried but i've been through this before around this time last year by and i wasn't going to let fear in knowing that something good is about to happen to me you know so the doctor set me up another appointment for monday this past monday morning to do the same thing that we had already done on friday and so i got my appointment card so i called my husband to share the news and of course he's real consoling so he told me that everything was gonna you know i already knew el es muy consoladori mediocre sorry i didn't make sense he told me that something that i already knew okay that everything was going to be okay and so sunday when i was when i came to the front to be prayed for me for me i also wanted prayer for that for my exam on monday my prayer was just that i would go and the doctor wouldn't see anything this time so i showed up on monday and began the exam we can move forward with your procedure and deep down inside i was like jumping for joy but of course i didn't want to scare him so i just looked at him and i said okay sounds good to me and i just want to sing the song to give thanks to god for everything that he does for me and i've asked brother seth to to help me with it for me god bless you okay [Music] amen do you love the lord this evening do you love the lord this evening praise the lord put your hands together you know the songs we're singing [Music] me [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh oh oh [Applause] god bless our our sister denise amen how many have come and come prepared this evening we've come to the most important part of the service we don't just got one preacher one's got two preachers we got three preachers amen i'm gonna ask that you would stand we're gonna be introducing our brother jonathan abaytha followed by brother abraham and wrap it up with brother ben ghetto amen [Music] a [Music] is [Music] is is [Music] is [Music] in the old rugged cross [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is is [Music] and [Applause] [Music] amen i really love that that him [Music] it reminds me of my mother i sang at him at her funeral i give sister denise a lot of credit for getting up here and she almost preached my message but what's funny is how we can go to a game or watch a nfl game on tv especially and then they look at us like this guy's crazy but you know who you are he's the reason we're here it better be 2020 i can tell you one thing for myself if you see me running around here and acting like a chicken with his head cut off just leave me alone because this 2020 year year that we should give the lord everything we have yes you see me jumping i'm usually in the back but the other day when we had all our services for that whole weekend jesus christ the same el mismo he's the same yesterday today right now and forever about 15 minutes ago the pastor calls and says you got to speak tonight not a problem no problem there shouldn't be a problem right no idea we can talk about a lot of other things to someone at the grocery store when it comes time to talk about his words why should be why should we not be ready hey man i don't have a whole lot of time but i'm going to give a i went and give you a little update on my aunt becky and she was a little groggy couldn't eat very much and i i saw her about a month ago she looks at me and i said do you know my name is minombre she stared at me with a deep deep like lost she goes i know you're my nephew but i don't know your name well at least you know i'm your nephew so on monday when i saw her she was pretty groggy with medication and when i right when i walked in the hall and she made eye contact with me and i walked in there and we were talking a little bit and i says auntie she looks at me i said do you know who i am wow i was i felt very privileged so just keep praying your prayers [Applause] the puzzle is not complete without you so i'm going to speak about just a little bit on jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we know that do you know that when lazarus was sick you think jesus did not know that he was dying think about that do you think he knew of course he knows everything right so third went back and prayed for him he knew but as he says i do nothing until my father which is in heaven to go do it so he says he says lazarus um i just another story is is the woman with the blood issue i i always thank the lord that i was born a male joseph she didn't even know who i was she i helped her to the restroom and thought she was fine and next thing you know wham she's on the floor and just things that that that women you know that mothers go through there's not a whole lot of youth you know here tonight but you youth care our queen you only have one solo look at him live you're sitting by your mother look at her just look at her right you only have one solo i had one but i also have another one i was at her house more than at my house she's like my mother just man becky is like my mother for let me just i just got a few more minutes but i want to speak on this woman with the bloody can you imagine the bible says brother branham says she had this for a long time so it brings me to the mothers and and you you ladies this blood issue she had for years and years but when she knew that jesus was coming yeah she said if i could only touch the hymn because if i could [Music] and people are shoving you and pushing you what are we going to do as humans almost comes out into a fight hey what are you doing you just shove me home you know god forbid what would happen after that as a good christian supposed to turn the other cheese or do like tommy junior this lady do we have jesus can we see jesus you guys see him can you bring him to my house we don't literally with our eyes see him nope jesus jesus is sitting right in front of me when when an altar call is called run up here [Applause] who touched [Applause] god bless you [Applause] god bless each and every one of you how many enjoyed that man i'm just here tonight just to let you know it is a great day it's been a while since i've been up here it's a great day that the day that god would use me for anything god is good yo says bueno god bless you i i'm sorry i'm sorry but i'm not sorry that's right i'm sorry but i'm not sorry that i would be able to speak to to all of my loved ones i want to thank my pastor for the confidence of letting me speak tonight you would please and when abram was ninety nine ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him god bless the reading of his word you may be seated i got this this little thought i hope it blesses you tonight i was uh just going through something in my life you know how many of us go through many things right yes we're always in a battle right now are am i by myself on that yes it's a battle out there i started listening to this message it was uh from that time and it was something that the lord just just blessed me with really quick i i don't know but i'm gonna i don't know what i'm gonna say tonight but i know this that the lord he's in control tonight and as i was going through different things this message just it just meant a lot to me because you see in that message there was there's two different times in in in life that goes through uh there's the trail of the serpent in this message brother branham's talk and he's talking about how that trail of the serpent goes through our lives marks us and when it marks us a memorial rises up monuments and we look back at that time and we say from that time i was this way because of that this happened to me and because this happened to me and that when that memorial rises up it's something that binds us it looks back well i this happened and this is why i'm this way and everybody has their story and everybody can tie into that and say well from this time [Applause] there was a time that the lord he started to ask me when did i meet you was that a point in time and i started to think and think and think about it [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] and i just remember being on this trip it was a trip that brother bernie it was his meetings we were invited i went with with uncle you know you i was treated like i really felt like the people treated me like royalties they would be like gosh he's so blessed he is i went out on the balcony and i began to promise the lord i began to tell him from this and that was when that that was the time that god gave me jesus and he's here tonight you see we have great examples you see abraham in the bible he was 99. [Applause] asking too much of god how do we know that that abraham didn't suffer with anxiety he didn't suffer of depression [Applause] [Applause] moses brother brother branham calls him he was a runaway prophet a runaway prophet established but one day but it was that [Applause] [Applause] i remember i made a statement one time i said i'm not a preacher well you know what i'm tired of complexes [Applause] everything every little thing that has met god that has met god it's been changed the same way that there's a mark of the beast that goes through and marks your your life and death came there and if you could grab a hold of anything tonight remember everything that meets god it holy so i can't wait till we have these week-long meetings again [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] and [Applause] [Applause] you know because as soon as i heard our pastor say he said this year he goes he said we're on the offense estamos en la fencilla that's the first word that came to my mind when you the first thing that many people do is going to the defense is isi i don't know about you but all i could do is tell you what god has done in my life but as soon as our pastor said we gotta be on the offense through our daily lives look at you scared in this daniel we're so afraid of the devil but it's time to take god's word but do something with his word this word wasn't [Applause] [Music] because you look at an ambush what is an ambush it's when they hide behind things they hide behind says but what is the human nature of that retreat right how many are used to retreating here come on ask yourself today how many are used to retreating every time saying throw something at you yeah what is god's word what is god's word we hear it every service from behind this pokemon god knows what he's doing sometimes his word cuts us but keep on fighting because what's happening it was given his word was given to strengthen us to nourish us you're fighting forward our prophet preached the message a conflict between god and satan but realize what this conflict is he's [Applause] is that's why the king when he was choosing this man he said i want that one that's all bloody and beaten i want him by myself because he's going to fight for mercury [Applause] that's why in chapter three of joshua he says look at he's a meeting he said you go this measurement on this measurement he says because you have not come this way before this is what i have you'll see i've gone that way before it's already been paid for us i know you feel beat up but the world sees you as a hero they see you as a pillar do you believe that church at your feet the word's been spoken that god has planted himself in your heart no matter you go the bible says what you want promises to you you know he says that's promising that proves that he's alive and that he is doing well that proves how god how highly god sees you come on come on is [Music] [Music] is [Music] granted [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] i oh [Music] [Music] foreign me oh foreign [Music] i [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] i [Music] i love you jesus [Music] but you gave us your sacrifices hallelujah [Music] yes it flows [Music] and all the blood that gives me strength oh yes it does [Applause] oh foreign [Applause] is [Applause] is [Music] well [Applause] [Music] my [Applause] that gives me strength oh and foreign [Applause] will never lose [Music] way back [Music] [Applause] mountains one day [Applause] [Music] to the highest mountain and it blows with valleys it will never [Music] [Music] amen praise the lord to the lord jesus surrounded by flies and his servants [Applause] [Music] and look what jesus did for me and look what jesus did for me oh he saved me and he gave me the victory oh look what jesus did for what me did for me oh look what jesus did for me he saved me and gave me the victory oh look what jesus did for me oh look what jesus did for me oh look what jesus

[Applause] if [Applause] we shall wear a crown yes is over [Music] and when the battle's over [Music] all the glory gloria gloria love you jesus [Applause] amen you may be seated so hard to give the
