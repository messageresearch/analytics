glorify your father which is in heaven you may be seated so first off I just want to give thanks to our pastor for encouraging me to go to Mexico allow to speak tonight Mex and I also want to thank brother Paco for taking us in at the youth camp and I want to thank three brothers that went with me to Mexico uh for making it a special trip and for those that know that don't know that was my first missionary Tri it's actually kind of funny how it happened because in the past couple weeks I've been struggling a little bit just dealing with personal thoughts in my head and my walk with God and so I ended up having a meeting with the pastor and telling him that I felt disconnected and that I wanted to reconnect and so he tells me you want to reconnect with God and at that moment you know I didn't hear the pastor I heard the Lord talking and he tells me how would you like to go to Mexico so at that that moment you know I decided why not we got to get this started anyways so then I got my passport got our tickets and we were off to Mexico and like the other brothers said it wasn't an easy time getting there you know brother Enzo lost his ring at the airport we ended up having a 4-Hour delay to get there he so that ended up making us miss the first night but we still made it so I'm just going to give a little report of the trip to Mexico you know I'd never been to Mexico so it was beautiful sight to see on the way over there and at the same time it was a very humbling experience you know before we got to the youth camp we stopped to get something to eat and it was a little taco shop got to have the tacos but as we ate there and finished up and as we were getting ready to pay and we TI the server um when we gave him a tip that wasn't so large to us but to him it was enormous and I remember us walking out the taco shop and me looking to my left and I just saw tears coming down his eyes so that was that was really nice to see so then we got to the youth camp and if the brothers can put up the first picture with the grass so that was out in the courtyard um it's very beautiful up there in the mountains um and it was just for me it was mind-blowing just to be so when we get there we got there late Friday night we had missed most the first day because of our DeLay So when we got there it was night time already um but when we got there the guys were tired we all wanted to go to bed but all the youth were having a specials night and so me and Ethan decided to go and and join them and that was really special because even though I didn't understand what they were singing you can just tell that they were singing with all their heart and so the next day we woke up and pretty much the whole second day we were doing activities with the youth you know if the brothers can put up the second picture with the youth the other one well it's one with us outside um and we were just having a bunch of games and activities going on and like I said even though we had a language barrier between each other because I don't understand Spanish um we literally felt like family next to each other going through all the activities yeah you know they were having us do the hair on Samson doing some weird volleyball with the blanket and we even did a relay with tic tac toe tac toe and apparently to Ethan and some of the youth I was an NFL allar football so that was that was very fun um and very personal to me because I didn't grow up in the message so that was pretty much like my first youth experience in total so it was nice to be out there um and then we got into the services at night Saturday night and that itself was an experience out of the world that night brother Seth and Enzo spoke to the youth uh and you know I felt like I was part of the youth there getting lectured as well but what really got me that night um if the brothers can put that last photo back up was when Enzo made an alter call and just to see the spirit of God moving those kids and everyone that was there at the service that was tremendous you know I think every single Youth and person there went up to the altar so that was just nice to be a part of that to see that we can take that to them in Mexico and so because of the delays um me Ethan and Ronnie got pushed to Sunday Ron uh and so pretty much the reason I went was to give my testimony to the youth there and for those that don't know I'll share a little bit of it you know I was explaining to the youth that I didn't grow up in the message you know I saw a very different lifestyle at my home and that's not something I wish any of you used to go through and so I was explaining to them that as I grew up that became my life now I didn't have any back ground in the message going to church or any of that and as events went on in my life I really my past from what I saw as a childhood really attached itself me you know I became addicted to drugs myself I became an alcohol I became abusive towards my my spouse and other things in that nature and you know I got to a point in my life where I thought I was done you know after I just went through a breakup I was struggling with depression really bad I didn't care about work anymore I didn't care about my family anymore anything and so one night I decided to commit suicide you know I I overdosed that night and I thought my life was going to end there but God had a different plan you know I just remember waking up and I've said this before I just remember hearing a voice telling me that it wasn't my time yet and you know in my mind not knowing anything about the supernatural or anything it somehow just clicked in my mind that that was a higher power that SP and from that day forward I mean two years and 7even months later I've been here at Cedar Hills Hills and continuing my walk with the Lord you know and I'm very grateful for all the things the Lord has done with me and even allowing me to experience this kind of trip and you know this this trip really impacted me a lot not only because it was my first time out of the states but because of what we did there you know as I was talking to some of the youth you know some of them went through some of the things that I went through as a child you know we were talking about it and we don't know what any of you youth are going through or the youth over there in Mexico so it really is nice just to see what the Lord can do for someone like me take take me from a sinner in the world and changing me to a child God and so I wanted to bring that back here to you you that we may not know what circumstances you're going through but just see my life take that and if you can see what God can do for me how much more can he do for you you know I always say it all the time you youth have such an opportunity the ministers the pastor all the help that you have here to help you in your walk and so with that it takes me to my second scripture in Matthew 6 31-34 and it reads like this therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith thou shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added onto you you know I really like that scripture especially For You Youth because I know there's a lot of Temptation in the world to be famous to see your friends in the world have all the things that they have for them thinking that they're cool for drinking and all that and just for you guys to realize that you don't need that you know me as a Living Testament that the world can offer you nothing that the Lord can give you you know I still struggle to this day with certain things you know my so-called friends that I had I haven't heard from them in three years sometimes my family has a hard time seeing what I'm doing but I tell them they just don't understand what the Lord has done for me you know I may have lost friends family and other things in the world but the Lord knew that was going to happen and he gave me a new family so in closing I just want to let you youth know just remember where you're part priorities are that if you just seek the kingdom of God first that he will give you all your needs provided thank you guys God [Applause] bless God bless you would you all please stand stand and uh to read the read the word of God Amen can stand for the naal anthem and stand for everything else but let's stand for the word amen you were to turn turn with me to Exodus 33 ver 22 and it shall come to pass while my Glory passeth by that I will put thee in the Cliff of The Rock and I will cover thee with my hand while I pass by man bless you may be seated thank our pastor for the opportunity to be able to to speak here and for I want to thank you for sending me to Mexico been I've been to Mexico several times over the last several years you know but for me I don't know what it was about this trip it it was different for me kind of almost feel like I it awoken something inside of me I was in Sal in July and it was a great trip but this trip was short but long and it it did something for me and know and I you know can't wait to go on the next one amen and uh as we heard from the the testimonies from Brother John guys tore it up yeah brother Enzo and brother Seth they did an awesome job I hadn't interpreted in a while and they tore me up brother Lorenzo he preached in Spanish and it was awesome told him he's got to do that again amen and uh so that was that's my short testimony for Mexico okay I so so normally we preach what we preached over there right but I can't do that this time especially not after the message on Wednesday Sunday Pastor thank you for that that was awesome and I'm not just saying that just to butter him [Applause] up that's those are awesome and I I I feel that that's part of the reason why this Mexico trip was such an impact for me that first message on what think you of Christ that that one really it hit me deep we hear that statement oh it hit different right we we've used that statement before right it hit different and that first one that hit different was for me you know and and we heard on Sunday that that whenever we read the scripture we must see Christ in every scripture right right do a little visual here with me brother we've seen this before but I'm I'm G to do it again this couple Waters would you call it full a cup of water full according to our founding Pastor he says no I'm G to make a little bit of mess here okay luckily it's water he said now when you read the message this is the definition of fool that's full David said my cup run over and all that God was he didn't pour into Christ because then that leaves God powerless all that God was he kosis he pours into Christ all that Christ was this is you he pours into the [Applause] church everything he pours what is he doing he is transferring himself it used to be that was God above us then it was God With Us now it's God in us amen amen God moved from his throne in glory to his son to the temple temp amen amen now now here here's the thing that gets me here now if we see Christ in every scripture and we must see Christ in every scripture he is the principal theme throughout the whole entire thing but if but if Christ is in you and if Christ is in me and we are in Christ then I must see myself in every scripture also you following me now now we can't read the Bible we can't read the message of the hour just like a history book just like a book of good morals now there's a lot of there there's a lot of uh people that say the the Bible it's it's good morals although there is history Within These Pages although you will learn good morals but if that is all you take from the word you have missed the message that it is trying to pay to you now now when I was going to barber school I I moved here to crues for two three months kind of sort of now when when I was here you there was no such thing as texting texting doesn't quite exist yet so so what I would do I would write to my girlfriend she's my wife now Sister Grace now when I would write these letters to her the content that was in the letter was between me and between her it was between two people now there might have been other people that read those letters there might have been friends that read the letters now there might have been family members that read the letters but the contents that was in those letters was between me and between her now this evening on a Wednesday Wednesday is very common for Christian churches to have church and they're all reading this right now at this very moment there are there are congregations and there are churches that are reading the same book that we are but although there are many that read the [Applause] letter although there are other people that read it the contents of this letter directed to one other person amen and that is to the bride of Christ again although there are others that read it this is only directed to one other person and this is a love letter it is a love letter between Christ and his church it is a love letter between between Christ and his bride now when we read this book now we have to get this book and we can't just skim over it and just read it again although there are others that read it there are things between the lines that only the person that it is addressed to will catch you following me now it doesn't only speak about him about Christ it also speaks about his beloved now now a few months ago I was listening to the church age uh series and and I've heard it before and I caught something that was in the in in between the lines this time now I I found out that that that before hee preaches the the church ages he preaches the revelation of Jesus Christ amen amen he is the principal theme of the entire gospel amen amen he is the groom now when I read when I heard these messages I began to hear how brother Brandon was talking about how there would be a people a bride and she was going to be from the first church age all the way to the last Church age it was speaking about a certain person amen amen now now it spoke of his deity no but I also I also read this and I'm going to read it to you here the one from the patmas vision gentlemen he says this morning this morning was more of a sermon type placing the foundation upon the deity of the revelation God being revealed in Christ how many believes it God was God was revealed in Christ Jehovah revealed in Christ now where is he got to be revealed that's a question that he asked there now where is God to be revealed in his church in his people in us he says he didn't say in me now he is inclusive in this one he said in US us now the a different Spirit different Works a different manifestation no sir The Same Spirit the same work the same manifestation the same love the same forgiveness the same long suffering gentleness patience peace Mery all that was in Christ is in the church I'm gonna say that one again all that was in Christ is in the church remember keep this in mind I just gave you the demonstration there he said it now want to tell you remember this keep this in mind all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church God above us God With Us God in us amen so we're going to leave that there for a minute now if you were to be so kind with me to turn to John chapter 13 now when you read the scripture we are we are very privileged people because we had a prophet that would give us types and symbols he was a typologist for the last several months I've been working on on a on a list I got a big old list of types and symbols representations when I get done with that they will will will'll give it to everybody else give to everybody so when you when you when you come across John now we we all know this most of us know it now when you come across the name John John is a type or a representation of the bride of Christ okay amen now John 1323 says now there was leaning on Jesus's bosom one of his disciples you know it says whom Jesus loved now we all know what leaning is right but I went to the dictionary to get a little bit better of an understanding of what this scripture was trying to tell me now the definition of Leaning it means to set to put to lay to play to rest oh we had a we heard a good one on on Sunday about rest amen so so the disciple that would lean on Jesus's bosom was John the the writer of the book we just we just uh we just read now brother Caleb's gonna be Jesus okay so what what so we can get a little bit of understanding of visual of what was going on here this is what John would do he would be on his bosom what is in the bosom behind the bosom is the heart where was the bride resting in the bosom of Jesus okay amen that's where she rested that's where Shew D she was in the bosom and he was whispering secrets to her listening to the heartbeat both hearts beating as one a pulsation beating beating it simultaneously at the same time as one because they were one okay I'm going to leave that one there I'm going to come back to that one started now let's go back to Exodus Exodus 33:22 this evening I'm not gonna not gonna take very long I have no idea what time I started at so and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in the Cliff of The Rock and I will cover thee with my hand while I pass by now there's two different words CLI and CLI there they're synonymous they mean the same thing that's why I had asked brother OED if he would sing that song for Meck [Music] ofes let me hide myself in thee let the water and the blood and you know the rest it say now Cliff comes for the the the Hebrew word for Clift is Nar is now Nar means to bore out pick out dig out put out Thrust out Pierce and Clift in English means a split in something an indention a divide a slash wound a vshape indention okay who was the rock we all know who the rock was right this rock ises Jesus yes he's the one and that rock was bruised for you or that rock was clefted for you and being clefted something came out something came out now the question is what what happened to that piece that came out it's an indention it's a slash it's an indention following me so far now to find out we need to now to find out what happened there we need to go to the Old Testament and we got to go to the first Adam now the first Adam we saw God saw him that he was alone we've all heard this before and God said it's not good for a man to be alone I'm going to make him a help me so the Lord causes a deep sleep to to come upon Adam and he opens the side and takes a rib out and from that rib he forms a woman and she was bone of his bone of his flesh Amen brother L it was splitting the atom brother L preach that message on that several years back the it's not the same in Spanish that in English now now so that so that's what happened to the first and being that is it's a type in a shadow of of of Christ so now then the antitype has to come all the characters all the situations that happened in the Bible all of it was pointing to Christ amen he was the antitype so now so now we we're going to have to fast forward through all of Jesus life and we're going to take him to when he's on the cross now it it used to be it was a a Roman custom it was it was a law you know there was uh they used to break the legs of those who were crucified to make sure that they were dead so I can see these two Roman soldiers that are walking to check to see if the three were were dead I can see one with a club a club like a bat he he comes to the first malactor gets it and and all of a sudden ah Agony in pain oh the first malactor he wasn't dead he was he was already going through hell now he had to go through more hell pain and I can see and I can see these two Roman soldiers as as they're walking now one of them had a spear and as they were walking I can see him maybe looking at that there the cross there in the middle and maybe thinking to himself that's strange those little birds look like they're trying to pull the nails out oh he was astonished wow look at their chest they're covered in blood stood out to him left an impression in and here they come to the second malactor gets the club and boom silence he was dead but yet he was imp Paradise here they come here he comes for the third one right when he's about to the Cog wheels of Prophecy are turning oh you you thought it was just religious people that were the cgws of Prophecy huh oh that scripture might be fulfilled that not one bone in his body would be broken and he says look at the birds he's dead can't you see he's dead look at him look he gets the spear and he punctures his side and what happens and we all we all know this we know it by heart water and blood came out amen that was the last Adam there this was the antitype of the first Adam the bride coming out out of his side just like the first Adam what was it it was the release it was the birth of the Bride she came forth water blood and spirit water to to cleanse her blood to protect her and spirit to give her his life amen give her life for what because she is going to she was going to be where he was going to speak from now she would speak as the Oracles of God Amy man are you following me so far now let's go back to the brother brandham here it is a rising of the Sun and as he being the groom I like this one here the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only oh look at this one here and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any other has spoken of the Bride can only manifest that's the only thing she's got to do is Manifest if it does something different from the groom it's not the bride if it does something different from the groom it's not the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power he is him as a man and a woman are one and a woman taken from his side she taken a spirit the feminine Spirit of him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics oh I like this one here brother J I know yeah yeah yeah until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics the spirit of God that moved him to do the same things he did if he hit on 16 cylinders if he hit on 16 cylinders will no bride amen for he said in John 1412 he that believeth on me the works that I do he do also I like that one oh yeah that way oh I can't do justice to that right there you should hear him how he says that I wish I had a voice to be able to put it forth the way he did but Jesus is going to have a Voice come on now he is going to have a voice Mark 3:17 oh yeah I like this one right here oh I like this one and James the son of zebede and John the brother of of James who was John who is John there you go I like that Aliyah good job believes that she's the bride of Christ oh yeah see that young little girl she rolls her hands immediately who was John who is John there you there you go brother I like that John was sure name bges ju the son of Thunder oh we're looking for something else we're looking for God or Jesus to speak from somewhere else we're looking for him to Thunder from somewhere else no no to his people to his bride she was given the name th of Thunder amen zeed means my gift the real word of that is means to be endowed endowment Terry in Jerusalem ended with power from on high so we saw Jesus we saw we we saw the bride leaning on his bosom we saw how she came out that was the Fulfillment of Daniel Daniel 2:45 when it says for as much as thou sawest the stone was cut out of the mountain without hand what was it that was birthed out of Jesus what was it that was heun out something came out amen amen Daniel said he saw Behold a stone was come out of the mountain I only know one mountain I only know one that's my Lord Jesus Christ oh how she was taken out of him how he was parted how he was slashed how he was pierced and all of a sudden The Birth come outu the very next day brother brandham says standing there a whirlwind came down and blasted the mountains out rocks cut the top of the trees off about three or four feet above my head made three blasts boom boom boom boom boom boom and the brothers come running there was about 15 men standing there preachers and everything what was it he said what was it I said judgment is striking the West Coast about two days after that the earthquake almost sunk Alaska what is this light up on Sunset mountain in the Coronado Forest everything he says has a meaning everything he says has a meaning don't take it lightly read in between the lines now if the stone was cut out of the mountain now and if Jesus is the Great Pyramid then was cut out had to be the exact same substance if it a circle was cut out then it's doing something different than what the groom was if he was a pyramid a mountain then what was cut out was also a pyramid that's where I've talked about this several times that's why we must reach that stature brother Elijah that's why I must reach that I reach that I have to reach that I'm not going to just say you I have to reach that amen and what is in the shape of we know that right on Sunset mountain in the Coronado Forest of Arizona what is that strange thing that happened up there that people has been driving east from West put that picture up there Brothers before we went to Tucson I had been studying on this right watch brother Daniel Evans has these in his church Danel Evans that people are has been driving east from West picking up the rocks that laid around there where it struck and every one of them every one rock has three corners on it that it tore off the three are one they're laying on desk on paper on paper we Across the Nation what is this strange thing upon sunset Mountain in the Coronado Forest what is that strange what is that strange thing brother Caleb now you preach now the bride is going to pour back remember that remember that on Sunday all that God was he poured he poured he poured now she's got to pour back why because eternity was a perfect circle right eternity was a perfect circle that's why we all married couples must wear a ring it was A Perfect Circle S said in and then what happened a hickey what is a hickey of b-shaped indention now what must happen to Eternity how is it that the bride's going to pour back we heard on Sunday where where Paul says to fulfill the word I like that one to complete the word to make eternity whole again and the only way that it can be the hi can be popped up the only way is if that stone that was cut out of the mountain has got to come back to its place and then the word is [Applause] complete so will the church have to be a matched to everything God has promised it must be the piece that's mitt off so if the original is the word so will the subject that's been taken off from the word be taken from it to be the word to what to match to push out that picky to make it complete to make itlu the flag you know what I see here I don't just see the six-pointed Star of David I don't just see the flag of Israel I see the bride being plucked out poured out she came out and I see it

moment not going to take a lot of time no way but before we leave I pray that you or ask that you would pray for us as we go to as we leave on our trip tomorrow but I want I wanted to to just go over something with you all uh we are living in perilous times and uh you know sometimes I don't I don't think we we understand how perilous the times are amen we we we know a god of of long suffering we know a god of mercy and a god of Grace but we don't want to know a god of judgment we don't want to know what it's like when there is no mer Mercy anymore when Grace has finished we don't want to we don't want to be here and you know sometimes we got to be reminded but I think just you you you turn on the news and and and you see what's going on in the Middle East my goodness it is it's quite a thing unfolding before us but I I want to to uh just to to make this couple of comments and and maybe we'll get into it when we when we return but I want you to to remember this and think about this while I'm while we're gone everyone knows that that the first son of Abraham was Ishmael right ishma of course was the son of the bonds woman and Isaac we know was the son of the free woman and in the message hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God he said whenever there is a Revival it always produces twins he said that's a rude remark true when there was a birth out came Isaac or from Isaac and Rebeca produced twins when the world was created to produced twins produced two trees Cain and Abel were born and produced that those were Twins and then brother Bram says this and and of course it kind of startles or or or makes you stop for a moment he when Ishmael and Isaac was was born and he says it produced two now we stop for a moment there because when you look at that in the in the natural we always say twins it was one mother and two children right and and uh and and so but but when you when you really see what the word twin means it means something containing or consisting of two matching or corresponding parts part s so one son of the natural and one of the spiritual why am I saying this because we know that through Isaac came Christ and through Christ came us that's the connection now now this you talk about prophecy being fulfilled open your eyes turn the television off what's going on put your phones and your things to one side and you you've got to be a spiritual church you got to be to you got to be spiritual to to to know the prophecy if you're not in in tune with this I'm going to tell you you're going to miss it everybody understand this is so important this is of utmost important right now importance talk about when somebody says oh brother brandham is not a prophet he missed it here and here don't tell me that it was the prophet of God that was sent to us Gentiles and to me I I want to read this this quote and if you ever seen a a a quote that that that is unfolding and and it is being unfolded today 1957 we would see Jesus Remember ishma and Isaac okay the he starts off the great ships are out in the Seas you can say brother brandom is seen some seen what was going on in the news 1957 and that's true but a prophet is also seeing the future we know that right we know that in our minds but we many times we don't we don't put it together he's seen the very events that are happening right now understand that a prophet can look forward he can look back the great ships that are out in the seas what SE look at the Mediterranean Sea right this is the natural and there's a spiritual with their missiles headed towards each other just striking for that or waiting for that strike off the Jews are congregating Yonder in is in Israel ishma and and Isaac is at one another's throat everything the scripture said to be fulfilled is now at hand the gospel has been preached oh yes Christ is Vindicated the Gentile days is finished what a word right there when this scene begins to happen the Gentile days is finished my question is how close are we really because once he turns to the Jews completely the dispensation of the Gentiles is done there is not one more Gentile that can be saved there's no more Mercy there's no more grace for the Gentiles Grace has now turned to the Jews now this is once again ishma and Isaac at each other's throat been like that since they were born but you couldn't script this if you wanted to do you know who the president of Israel is anybody know no Netanyahu is is the prime minister the the president of Israel is Isaac Herzog Isaac okay ishma and Isaac at each other's throat is the president once again of Israel is Isaac that's right the leader of Hamas Hamas in the Gaza stripaz from 2006 to 2017 and now he is a senior political leader of the Palestinian group Hamas ham his his name is ishel Isaac and ishma at each other's throats the prime minister's name is prime minister Netanyahu but what's his first name Benjamin ah let's see where we're at today Joseph is coming come on Church Joseph is coming he's getting ready to reveal himself to his brothers it's ready Benjamin's in place Isaac and ish's in in their place watch what brother bam says they had a little Benjamin down there his little brother you know who Benjamin represents this new bunch of real genuine Jews that's Gathering there now to make that 144,000 this race that's coming up not these Wall Street Crooks W Street no that's more Cannon F them ain't Jews the real Jews are these little Benjamins coming up from down here who have never heard the word of Jesus Christ now if if we can't see this whole thing unfolding nothing is by coincidence and yet we're so we're so into the things of the world EarthBound it's gonna pass Us by I say this church so you can shake yourself snap out of it where you're at we're like caught in the glare of that of that serpent wherever he turns us we turn we're like zombies at times snap out of it wake up Church wake up where are we on October 23rd of this year the leading Italian parliament said put out a statement this from Italy okay he said this and he's quoting Ezra the 5th chapter take these vessels and go carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem and let the house of God be built in its place and then he says we have in Rome the implements which are the tools and the utensils of the Jewish temple that was destroyed 2,000 years ago W and all along the Catholic Church been saying no we don't have any of them we don't have no vessels we don't have none of that but now it's coming to pass that when Rome remember the destruction of the temple they took many of the of the utensils and the bowls and all these things that was in the temple Rome took them and now they're confessing that they have them but that it's time to return them now now you all read the scriptures watch what happened in the time of Daniel right remember the writing on the wall were they doing all that they were having parties using the cups the chales having a good time Abomination but it's now time for all these vessels to return back we have them we took them 2,000 years ago and the Vatican is now admitting what they have denied for over a hundred years they said with these vessels you all brought light into the whole world they are with us and by keeping them perhaps we're preventing you from fulfilling your destiny the week before that one of the leading rabbis in Israel said this war will lead to the Third Temple and that third go goal this is their goal now whether it happens or not I can't tell you we will start making Sacrifice by the Passover in 2024 we are not in the last moments church we are in the last seconds now get in line I'm going to tell you again Church get in line Shake Yourself quit doing the things you're doing get real with God stand up for God live a life worthy of the Gospel we are right at the door already we I I I tell you as you stand to your feet I just wanted to share that with you and just just just think about that we are here we have a we are at that moment now it's that lap over now where he turns low I turn to now to the Jews we could almost say it's finished that's where it's that we could almost say it's finished this picture that brother brandham is seeing this prophecy we could almost say right now it's finished doing everything in our power to take Grace just one more mile may God help us everybody understand how serious it is we're here already you'll turned around one of these days and say and they told us and they told us and they told us and then we just I don't know I was having too much fun church just for a moment I I'm sorry but for a moment this is there's people's lives that are at stake right now brother will one moment if you say brother pray with me don't do it because you're you're you're afraid don't do it because you're scared do it because you realize you need him and that you ain't going to make it with watching your filthy shows ped about that over and over painting yourself up and living like the world what a horrible thing when there's no more grace and the people realize they missed it I'll just let it be between you and God
