Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. You musicians and Jared, thank you for doing the yard. And Amen. Also, just before we read our scripture, um just uh keep Ben Norrod in your prayers. He having surgery this morning. Uh his appendix uh took him. So, he was in the hospital and he's having emergency surgery this morning. So, uh, just praise God that it never happened. Last weekend he was in El Salvador and that would have been a bit tricky. We're on the airplane. Wow. Wow. God is good. Amen. Just a just a short really short testimony if anybody wanted to link. Brother Ben, I listened to three of his services there in El Salvador. It's where we've been the last two years. It's uh brother Jose Garcia's home country and brother Brand or brother Ben preached on humility and arrogancy on Sunday. The last of what we've been preached on for four weeks. I mean God God is just amazing. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to let's turn in our scripture. God bless you. Proverbs 16 uh 16:2 and then we're going to read another scripture in Matthew. Proverbs 16:2. Amen. And we want to look at something unique this morning that I believe God has something to show us. All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes, but the Lord weighth the spirits. That That's good for me, too. &gt;&gt; Everything I do, I think, is okay. &gt;&gt; But God &gt;&gt; judges me by his spirit. That's a that's a powerful powerful verse. Yes. &gt;&gt; And let's read Matthew 26 and start at verse 20. It's talking about Jesus here. And just before he goes to the cross, Matthew 26 and 20. And now when evening was come, Jesus sat down with the twel. And as they did eat, he said, "Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me." And this is the verse that really struck and made this message. Amen. And the 12 disciples were exceedingly sorrowful and began to ask everyone of them, saying unto Jesus, Lord, is it I? Lord God, I pray that you will &gt;&gt; help us this morning. &gt;&gt; And Lord, may you have complete and total control. Lord, I surrender myself completely and Lord, you just have your way completely with the hearer and the speaker both. Jesus, we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. I want to just let that sink into your heart. Those two scriptures that we read are powerful scriptures. And they began to say unto Jesus, Lord, is it I? &gt;&gt; Wow. All through the Bible, the scriptures clearly show they had no clue who it was that was going to sell Jesus out. &gt;&gt; Now, that blows me away because we know and we just take for granted. And of course, the person that sold Jesus out, it's very easy for me to attack him for selling Jesus out. But I want to bring it back to you again. The disciples, none of them. &gt;&gt; Each one of them thought it could have been them over Judas. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you, sis. That's a wower. Yeah. Wow. And then we look back. Let's just go back and look at our And we looked at all the ways that I think I am are clean in my eyes. But God weighs the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can justify everything we do. You I was telling the way in on the way here we've we've done this is this is not in my notes and I'm definitely not preaching about this, but I want I want to share something with you. This is just for me. This ain't for none of you. But over a long period of years, me and God's had a wrestling match over something. And it's amazing how God deals with me and you. And brother Ben said something when he preached on Saturday night in El Salvador. He preached on angels. And I mentioned that last Sunday, how the angels leave the presence of heaven and they come in our midst. And brother Brown mentioned things like this. He said, "If you go someplace that your dove, your guardian angel don't feel welcome, &gt;&gt; it'll wait outside &gt;&gt; cuz it don't go to certain places." &gt;&gt; That's exactly what Brother Bam said. And so if the if the dove of the Holy Spirit and the angel wants to come here, he has to be welcome. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's our complete desire bar none. If he ain't here, we might as well slam the door shut because we're okay. &gt;&gt; But that's equally for our house. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And no one knows how God can deal with the heart of a man. And so this is what God showed me. He said, you know, he said, we have a lot of old videos from World War II, even before World War II. before like really old videos before Satan was as manifested as he is today. But this was just like the Holy Spirit spoke to me. Just as plain as you would ever get it. There's nothing wrong with that TV screen. That's not evil at all. That's like saying this screen's evil. &gt;&gt; This is just That's like saying your computer's evil. But if you're watching something on that screen that you don't believe in or worse yet that I preach against like men kissing other women or nudity or something like that, that angel will never be in your house. &gt;&gt; So I tell you, don't get rid of your screen, but get rid of the things that you don't believe in. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you got videos there where a man's pitching kissing other women, would your wife be happy with that if that was you? But you'll sit there and giggle at it cuz it's made as a movie and humor &gt;&gt; or anything else of it. You see what I mean? &gt;&gt; It said we don't have to get rid of the the screen. We have to get rid of what we don't believe in. If I preach against nudity and kissing other women and just and dancing with other ladies and I'm watching a video like that with my grandkids, guess what my grandkids are going to do? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Donna. &gt;&gt; I'm teaching them very well. See, the grandkids read between the lines. &gt;&gt; But in our own eyes, we think, "Oh, I'm I'm these are old to they're 75 years old. These are and those things might even happen, but if you don't promote, if your wife wouldn't be happy with you doing it, &gt;&gt; what are you watching it for? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to see that, you know. And so, Brother Bram said, now we're just going to stop here and we we ain't got a long message, but just something that is very peculiar. How how Satan and God is very work very uniquely and how God can deal with our hearts, but how Satan can trick us. And I I'm going to show you some things that you're okay with, but I'm going to show you some things that you're not okay with, and they're the same. They're the same. And it'll it'll shock you. Brother Bam said, "I'm saying what God said. I'm responsible for preaching it." I should read this quote every time, "But God holds you responsible for the way you handle it. I'm just responsible for preaching God's word. If you don't like it or don't agree with it or it it's not your belief, that's okay with me. It don't matter. It won't change who I am or who God is." Well, definitely won't change who God is. &gt;&gt; It might change me, but it won't change God. You see, a man, our next quote there, if a man is born of the spirit of God, he becomes a son of God and his nature is exactly like God's. Now, we're going to watch this. The nature, I love that. The nature is like God. What God is, you are. &gt;&gt; God's holy, you're holy. God's just, you're just, God's long-suffering. Oh, I know, brother D. You're longsuffering. &gt;&gt; If God gives grace where you would give judgment, your nature, oh, you got to kirk that part. &gt;&gt; Watch this. I'm going to shock you all. We're living in a world and a time of grace. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace is on the earth right now. That's why God hasn't come back in the second coming yet. It's amazing grace because God has some stuff yet to take care of. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. The nature of God. See, God's nature. Oh, they say, "Oh, would you have the nature of God and you're a sheep? You don't have to be asked to bear wool. You don't have to manufacture wool. You don't have to say, you know, I better get busy bearing wool because my master's going to want some wool. And if you're a child of God, you don't have to think about being a child of God. You just are a child of God. You just you just you just you just are what you are. You know, I wanted to show you something. Those are the greatest people to be around because they're not fake. They're not two-faced. They won't stab you. They are exactly how you are when you surprise them in front of you, behind you, and when you're not there. &gt;&gt; They're real, genuine, just people. I'm I'm just I'm I'm just having a bad day today and I'm a bad day in front of you and I'm a bad day when you go home and I'm still a bad day. Yeah, &gt;&gt; those people everybody loves &gt;&gt; because we would say it in modern terminology, they're genuine. &gt;&gt; They're real. &gt;&gt; They're not phonies. &gt;&gt; They're not hypocrites. &gt;&gt; A hypocrite is when you would do something in your house that you wouldn't do in the house of God. like watch a movie of people in bikinis or something. &gt;&gt; That's not entertainment. That's a sin if you're a child of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing how this is. So watch here. He said with the ne our next quote he said, "And you can't make a man see the word of God until his nature is changed." I can preach on something that's directly out of the Bible just like a hundred million times, but there's lots of churches that don't see different parts of the Bible. You know what I mean? Like, and and I know it has to dovetail in that, but you know, you know what I mean? like different se they'll dwell on you know you you shouldn't borrow money or this one will dwell on you should do this and and that's those are all the word of God but like they can be manufactured segments of God's word but we want to take all of God's word and just be it. &gt;&gt; So you can never get a man to see it unless he is it. That's why the Bible says that you must there's one thing that you must. That's you must be born again. &gt;&gt; You don't must come here to church. You don't must there's a lot of must you don't have to do but you must be born again. &gt;&gt; And that is a different nature. And when that nature changes, you won't think about well, you know, like most men would think, well, I'm going to or people would think, well, I'm going to wake up and go to work. It's just nature. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when his nature's changed from what he is to a son of God, the Holy Spirit comes in and the Holy Spirit wrote the word of God. So see, when we would show you any part of the word of God in continuity. So the reason I say that is because part of the Old Testament was wrote under law. We're not under law. We're not under Moses. So, you know, we're under the grace dispensation, but we do use the word the Old Testament. Some people throw it away. I was reading a church's uh uh it don't matter. I was reading a church's uh you know, creed thing. They were they were actually promoting for members and they don't believe in the Old Testament at all. Zero. They don't carry it. They don't read it. There's nothing. But our prophet taught us that the Old Testament is types and shadows to the reality. &gt;&gt; See, God will always bring it different ways because different personalities connect and different ones don't connect. And so God will bring it because God knows that when you get to the judgment or the end, you're never going to say, "Well, God, I never knew or I didn't realize." Because God will say, "Well, I did it here. here here. You know, like the prophet said, from Genesis to Revelation. Well, I showed you in Genesis, this type, and I showed you over here in Leviticus, this type. Then I showed you over here in Isaiah because Isaiah wrote the whole Bible in the 66 books. And then then I showed you over here, and I showed you over here, and then I showed you reality was Christ's life. You said you didn't know. And then on top of that, then he said, I showed you a a bride that was in in flesh. The you're written epistles read of all men. So you could be illiterate and both. And he said, then I showed you the writ the the Bible and flesh and how that nature and flesh operated. &gt;&gt; So God's dependent on you &gt;&gt; because there's people like me that failed grade one, couldn't read &gt;&gt; or there's people that don't never read their Bible. But they still see you in the grocery store. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, so now they still have a Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. You know, you know, in our next one here, he said, you know, if a buzzard was trying to put in dove feathers to make himself a dove, he said, see, it's nature is still a buzzard. He might take a picture if he pulled out all his buzzer feathers. That would really hurt, I think. And stuck in all the dove feathers. That would he would need crazy glue and I think that would be really far out. But he would still be the nature. You know, that's like brother Brown talked about a pig. You can wash the pig, but you just give them some mud. Amen. You know, in the Philippines, it's very hot and most of their pigs, they wash it and you normally they'll sm little trenches out from the p. They literally wash all the waste away just down, you know, wherever they have a spot or whatever. And it's hot and dry and it dries up. But the pigs are spotless, &gt;&gt; but they're not they don't have mud to their excess &gt;&gt; or they wouldn't be spotless. But he said, you take a peacock, he don't have to worry about having peacock feathers. See, if you take the nature of God, &gt;&gt; you don't have to worry about it being a god. &gt;&gt; A peacock will always have peacock feathers. And a dove, you don't have to worry about the feathers of a dove &gt;&gt; because a dove will have dove feathers as long as the nature is a dove. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So we look at this scripture and we see here Judas's scariot walked with Jesus was his disciple. He carried the money bag. Now watch this. Judas's scariot was given power to cast out demons. &gt;&gt; Now that just about loses me right there. He was given power to heal the sick. But he and himself, wow, Judas was such a good church member that not one single person in the church and everyone, I believe that was everyone. And every one of them said unto him said, 'Lord, it's Judas. That's what I do. I said, 'Well, Lord, it's that one. But they didn't. He was such a good believer. They said, "Lord, it's me. I'm the one that's going to sell you out. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you something. &gt;&gt; Judas was above fault. That's impressive. &gt;&gt; Judas was above fault. Brother Bram says here in paragraph 67 Vicki he said you know Jesus said in one case he asked the question and I'd like to ask the question to the church tonight and I'd like us to make this personal not we'll all have a different uh we'll all hear something different in this message today. But he said, "Jesus, why why do you call me Lord and do not the things that I command you to do? Why do we call him Lord?" You know, he said, "Why could you call me Lord and keep not my word?" Watch this. Even in your own personal life or your home, your story is different than mine. But I shared my story and anything that stands between you and God is an idol and it takes the place of God. And I want to I want to show you something. I want to call another fellow here and see about him. And he said it was Judas. And he says it's very easy to remember Judas because we remember Judas today is selling out his birthright. We remember Judas as a loser. We remember Judas as selling out our Lord and Savior for personal gain. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. Oh, and we ridicu Judas. But how many of us, and I would say at some point in time, we all have sold out our Lord for some kind of a personal gain. And we say he was a filthy bad guy and not fit for no place in society. Not fit for heaven. Why? He sold out our Lord and after he had opportunity even to be the disciple. The apostle remember last Sunday I think some of you looked at me funny. Brother Bram said in multiple and he said it more than this. An apostle the highest calling in the Bible &gt;&gt; above a prophet. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that more than once. Judas the Scariot had the opportunity to be an apostle. The highest calling in the Bible. Wow. Higher than a prophet. And he had the opportunity to be that apostle. And he sold out his right for personal gain. &gt;&gt; And now he's remembered for that. And how he's remembered is he's sold out Jesus for personal gain. Watch our next paragraph. And I wonder how many of us of them tonight yet stand here in the pulpit selling out Jesus for personal gain. Yet wear a robe and a fancy yellow tie. Or sing in the choir. or sit as a deacon or take the place of a treasure trustee or whatever it might be, his position in the church or the minister at the pulpit. He repeats that. That sounds dangerous. When brother Brown or the Bible repeats something, it gets me nervous. It was talking about pulpits and is still selling out your opportunity for personal praise. Doctor, bishop, so and so for personal praise and personal gain. &gt;&gt; Wow. Now, I I believe that the prophet hit a nerve here because at some point, you know, and I mean, I know we're on a journey and and some of us are past that and some of us are right in the middle of it. But I believe it's the truth. And here here a man came to him and he said I I would preach that but if I was preaching that I would be a beggar on the street. And he said he said watch this. He said, "Do you remember the rich man Lazarus and their last eternal stage that they stood at and the beggar and the rich man, their pitcher one day and he said, "So tonight about Judas, he sold out for personal gain." And so many of us do the same thing. He's talking about the rich young ruler. And here there was the beggar. But when they went to heaven, their positions completely changed. And the rich young ruler got in hell and he came back and he asked Jesus if he could send somebody to save his family and to just bring a drip of water to cool his tongue. He said, "Watch here." He said, "The priest and them, they sold out their chance." the priestess when they killed Jesus. They sold out their chance to become his servant. Many preachers could be the servant of God and just surrender to the Holy Spirit and get completely out of the way. They'll never do that because they're looking at personal gain. &gt;&gt; They're looking at they want their kingdom or their church or their bank account. or their own revelation so they can bring the people to them that we are the only ones that got it. Nobody else got what we got. Their chance to become his servant, become a disciple, become converted to him. They sold it out. This is what he talked about the priest. He said they sold it out for green poison. Green poison jealousy. They sold out because of the jealousy of Jesus doctrine. They sold out because the flocks followed Jesus and never followed them. He was just 12 years old when Jesus was in the tabernacle and he stumped the priest and they stood in amazement at his revelation. They weren't happy he had that revelation. They were jealous. &gt;&gt; How did he get it? I've studied for years. He didn't get it. He was it. They had it so wrong. They had it so wrong. Years. They stumped them. And they were just as guilty. The priests were just as guilty of selling out Jesus. They actually were the ones that sold him out as Herod was. And I want to look in the scriptures and I want to show you three or four people that sold out Jesus. And we know Judas was one. We already we already did him, but and and how Judas totally sold him out for personal gain. We're going to actually go where Judas realized his his loss and tried to give back the money. But there's times in Judas life, his decision was non-repentable. Here we look at Luke 23. Luke 23. And we'll go through some scriptures here. Now, I want to show you something here. Jesus was at Pilate's uh judgment hall. And he realized that Jesus was a Calaldian. And he asked whether Jesus was a Calaldian. He realized that. And as soon as he knew it. See, Pilate could tell, and the scriptures say this. Pilate says, "This man is an innocent man. Is I find no fault with him. For sure no fault worthy of death." But Pilate was looking for an easy scapegoat to give it on to somebody else. The man made me do it. And as soon as verse seven, and as soon as he knew that he belonged into Herod's justific jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod who himself also was at Jerusalem at the time. And I want to I'm going to jump ahead and we're going to read this, but I want to show you something. Pilate and Herod were enemies. But if it was to their gain to sell out Jesus, they became friends. Jesus, &gt;&gt; you'll see that in Satan's kingdom. &gt;&gt; If somebody comes against what God's doing, and you'll watch people that will come together as friends, and you say, "But they were never friends before." &gt;&gt; But they both have this same anointing to kill what God's doing in a situation so they'll become friends. Watch this. This this scripture says this about Herod and Pilate. &gt;&gt; Verse eight. And so when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad. Now, why would he be exceedingly glad? Was it because he was going to worship him? Herod was a good Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; He wanted to see a show. You know, you know, I want to I want to just stop here and show you something. This this scripture, you know, we want in this church, God's the boss. &gt;&gt; And if he ain't the boss, we're we're in terrible trouble. &gt;&gt; He's the boss. And anything God wants to do, he can do in this church. &gt;&gt; Anything that's scriptural will be in order. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. you. Nobody's a matter of fact, even if it was slightly if it's scriptural and you even think it was done in the wrong order, &gt;&gt; it's okay. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Listen, go watch this. But if you want to see something happen in the church, don't ask the pastor &gt;&gt; cuz he's not the church. &gt;&gt; Don't ask the building &gt;&gt; cuz it's going to burn. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you want to see something drastic, if you want to see tongues and prophecy in the church, ask yourself. &gt;&gt; If you want to see miracles in the church, &gt;&gt; ask yourself. &gt;&gt; If you're going to ask the pastor, well, then I'm God. &gt;&gt; You should all fall down. Worship me. But don't do that, though. By the way, I'm a very poor God. You see what I mean? &gt;&gt; You see what I mean? If you want something in your midst, help yourself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Bible. Just take your Bible and just take it right out of the Bible. You're not I tell you what, there's nobody going to be thrown into the church because they're following anything in the Bible. You can sing specials, testify, edify God, edify the body, you know, have the nine spiritual gifts in your midst. They have to be in every bibleelving church. But brother Bam said, "The church is the people." &gt;&gt; Herod was exceeding glad. Verse eight, for he had desired to see Jesus for a long time. He had desired to get to church for a long time because he had heard about all the good things that had happened around Jesus. And there at the end of the verse, and he hoped he had seen some of the miracles that Jesus had done. Now, there's a key part here that her the Bible says about Herod. He did not say he hoped that he would be a miracle. He did not say that he hoped he would be involved and part of the miracle. He said he hoped he would just sit back and watch the miracle. That's the wrong approach. &gt;&gt; He just wanted entertainment. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said this. He said, "If you want to see a miracle, become one. &gt;&gt; Become a miracle." &gt;&gt; Herod had hoped that he had seen. Herod hadn't hoped for salvation. Herod hadn't hoped to worship Jesus. Herod hadn't hoped to have a new birth. Herod hadn't hoped to get healed. He had hoped to be entertained. I want to just drop something here this morning. Because of that spirit is the reason that the world is in the state it's in. I want I want to show you something. I in studying last night, I had something come up just randomly online. Now, do you realize in the state, now this is just information, do you realize in the states last year over 15,000 churches closed? That's about 11. It's not quite, but it's almost 11,000 churches a month. Now, that's a lot per day. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "Well, the states is really big." Yeah, it's really big. But they project that next year or in the very soon distant future, are you listening? That another 100,000 will close. I have the total reason why. Because they want to see something, but they don't want to become something. They want to see some kind of something that makes them stimulated, but they don't want to be stimulated themselves. They want to see a new birth, but they don't want to become a new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to see a miracle, become a miracle. &gt;&gt; If you want revival, become a revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse nine. And when he questioned, here's Herod. When he questioned him, many of these words he answered, Jesus answered him never. And the chief chief priests and scribes stood there accusing Jesus. In verse 11, and Herod and his men of war, set him to knot and mock Jesus. What? Watch this. Literally two verses before Herod's wanting to see a see some show and 1 second later, 5 seconds later, 10 seconds later, Herod's mocking Jesus. That's a fast turnaround. He mocked Jesus and arrayed him in a in in a gorgeous robe and set him out again to Pilate. Do you know? See, he was he had no desire for benefit or change from Christ. He only wanted entertainment and show. And it's immediately when Jesus held his peace, he immediately turned on him and attacked them like a like a lion. And the same day that Pilate, watch this verse 12. Now I mentioned this to you. You need to see this. And the same day that Pilate and Herod made friends together, for before they were enemies between themselves, you see what I mean? If somebody on the other side wants to attack God's kingdom, see, spirits attract. You know, our prophet said this. He said when he was calling heaven having a prayer line and there was people not in the prayer line and he would see a demon on somebody and he said, "I'm going to call you up." And that demon would scream out for help for all the other demons recognizing that they they knew the power of God was in the midst, but they were screaming out for help for all the other like spirits. &gt;&gt; Yeah. in the midst. Brother Brown could see the connection to the other devils in the church because they had the same desire to destroy the kingdom of God. And so even though those demons hated each other, they would become friends. Support me. &gt;&gt; He's attacking me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. Let's just jump to the end of verse 14 there, partway through verse 14. and having examined him before you, I found no fault with this man, touching these things where you accuse him." So here the king had was saying to the priests and the scribes, "We find no fault in Jesus, nor did yet Herod," Pilate was saying, nor me nor Herod found no fault. And why you sent him to me? Nothing worthy of death that he has done. Wow. Pilate was willing to release Jesus, but he sold him out because of the people. Watch, let's just move down to Matthew 27. So, we see here that the priest sold out Jesus because of green envy and jealousy. We see that Pilate sold him out because he never did miracles. He didn't get to see a show. He sent them back to Pilate and starting at verse 17. And therefore they had gathered together. And Pilate said unto them, whom will ye that I release unto you, Barabbus or Jesus called the Christ? And watch this. For he knew that he envied they envied Jesus that they had delivered onto him. Here, here's a pagan king knowing that the Christians had the wrong anointing on him, that the priests had brought Jesus out of envy. I mean, that's that's a that's amazing in itself. That's discernment in itself. And when he sat at the judgment seat, now this is Pilate in his wife sent unto him, saying, "Have nothing to do with this just man. For I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him." But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude and said, "Give us Barabbus and destroy Jesus." Why? Why did Pilate sell out Jesus when his wife warned him &gt;&gt; when he knew that the priests and the and the the leaders of the church had brought him from spite and envy. The Bible says that and he himself in judging him found nothing wrong with him. Verse 24. And Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing. He never had a backbone. He was the wimpiest king you ever seen. But rather the uproar of the people, he took water and he washed his hands before the multitude and he said what our scripture in Proverbs said. For everything in a man's eyes is clean unto himself, but the spirit judges all things. And he washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this person. See ye do it. Amen. Wow. Everything, you know, and I just mentioned this and I want to get into some personal. So we see that Pilate sold them out, Herod sold them out, and the priest sold them out, and Judas the Scariot sold them all out. And they all sold them out for personal gain, money, popularity or lack of entertainment. And you know, I want to show you something in our life. Everything you do, you can. We're just made like this. You're a free moral agent. So, every one of us, you are guilty. Every consideration that the word of God brings to you, you judge if it's worth the price. everything you look at and consider the price. If I will or if I will not, the price is too great. But if you have a new birth, you lose that consideration because you're not your own anymore. You're dead and you're somebody else. So you don't consider it a price to be that person. &gt;&gt; So watch this. I want to just go into some things that this is this is not this is not necessarily in this church or these people or or any individual. I want to just name some things that we deal with in our own personal life. And I want to show you maybe another quote or something that Brother Bram had a few quotes and a and the the comparison of things that we're okay with. See, Brother Bam said this about the the you know, I mentioned about the movies. Brother Bam said it used to be wrong to go to the movie theater, the drive-in. It used to be the drive-in theaters and that they were baked when I was a kid. They were actually just going out when I was a kid. You go in the theater, eat greasy popcorn. And he said, "Satan pulled the wool over your eyes and brought it right in your home &gt;&gt; under your token. Now the angel had to leave your home. &gt;&gt; Not because of the screen in itself, but because of the stuff that you put on the screen. &gt;&gt; Every one of you sitting here in your house know that you're supposed to do family or daily devotions. And every time that comes to you, you say, "Well, I'm in a hurry today. I have an appointment. It'll take too long. This is my busy time of year &gt;&gt; or it's a holiday season. &gt;&gt; But brother Bam said it like this. He said, "If you need to eat and drink to stay alive physically, don't you need to eat and drink spiritually to stay alive?" Amen. &gt;&gt; And you just put a price on your spiritual life because of these four things I said. But it's the holiday season. Our house is in an uproar. It'll take too long. The school bus is coming. You know, my dad and and he's dead, so he don't know I'm saying this. I never checked it with him, but he was a peculiar person. Because I never I never I was grow raised in that. I never even came close to holding a candle to how my dad did family devotions daily. And I can remember businessmen stepping in our back door and knocking on the kitchen door and we were saying the Lord's Prayer. It didn't matter if the house was on fire, we would sit as a family and say the Lord's Prayer. And on the 99% of the time, every kid prayed and then dad led us in the Lord's prayer. You say he didn't have time. He died a multi-millionaire. You don't make money because you work. He made money because he surrendered &gt;&gt; to God. The price was too great. when they built the when they left the free Methodist church because the women cut their hair, wear pierced their ears and started wearing pants. You could buy a car then brand new, the Lincoln of the day for five grand cash. And my dad gave the first 30 or 40,000 to the church before I was born. because he wanted to stay with the word of God. &gt;&gt; And his very worst farm we sold after he died, the dead worst farm. Not one of us kids wanted it. And on that farm, God gave them the next two years after he did it. Those I would have been one year old then. He gave them exactly what he'd give to the church times two that year and the next year. And my dad told me, he said, "If I would have knew there was that much money in that field, I would have lost my mind." &gt;&gt; I seen one of his tractors sell this week. If I would have had the money, I would have bought it. It was a Little C. It's about 10 horsepower. Little C International. And he would cut that farm with a 10 horsepower tractor, C gas engine, and an 8-ft blade straight mower on a 100 acre field, no power steering. And God give him 30 grand every time because he passed up seven or eight new cars because he gave the money to the church. Some of the old pillars the cost was not too great. &gt;&gt; But today we look at the cost different. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can look at this. That's just devotions. That's one thing. You can't live without them. Coming to church or not to come to church. It's too far. And and listen, I I don't want anybody blood on my hands that if it's snowy out, it's not wise to be on the road to icy. You have to be able to see. But you know what I'm saying? Eh, gas prices are too high. Come too early. I was telling the kids when Ben was in El Salvador, we went to Nicaragua and my wife had second choices on it. But we drove through Honduras and Nicaragua was communist. We'd never been in a communist country before. Took us about 2 and 1/2 hours to get through customs because I was a preacher. The government hates preachers because the Catholic Church tried to overthrow the government. They got voted in about after the 2000s and they never left office. And the church that I went to, you would need a stack of money like that to make $1 bars. That pastor drove five hours, went through three customs, had to get like these customs, you had to get out of the car, sometimes be fingerprinted. We had to get our temperature taken. They actually when you leave Nicaragua, they spray the vehicle with poison so you don't bring in CO. They're very afraid. They sprayed us going in, sprayed us coming out. Okay. The vehicle. Yeah. And they did all that just coming to hear Brother Ben preach one day. That'd be like you driving to Florida for one day and coming back. &gt;&gt; But you wouldn't do it. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't either &gt;&gt; because I would look at the costs. &gt;&gt; But if you are that, those people never had the money to come. Just shake your head. They never had the money to come. Their money's worthless. If if you dropped a $10 bill, you wouldn't bend over to pick it up. It'd be like picking up a penny. &gt;&gt; But they came. It was the cost. See, Judas's scariot wasn't a bad person. He was one of us. Remember? Remember, not one of the disciples thought it was him. &gt;&gt; Not one of the disciples thought it was him. But he's seen the money. &gt;&gt; He went to the priest and said, "What will you give me for me to sell him to you?" It's exactly what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. See, if that's why, see, it's the church is the people. And the reason that 115,000 churches have and will close in the states is because of the nature of the church which is the people. Amen. So we can see we can always justify. See because in our own eyes it's understandable. It's understandable that I'm not going to go to Florida for a one-day meeting no matter who's preaching. What if God asked you to go? &gt;&gt; Do you desire to go? &gt;&gt; Love your enemies. Love the people that would kill you if it was legal. &gt;&gt; The only reason they don't kill you is cuz it's not legal and they serve time. &gt;&gt; But that's a hard thing to do. But the Bible says in Matthew 5:44, "But if I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, and do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you." Now, I want I want to get into something just for a second, and we're I promise I didn't think we were going to be long. I just got another a couple scriptures and one more example and an example of Brother Brown. But uh we see here the Bible says that without holiness no man shall see the God. In Hebrews 12 14 and verse 15 it says look diligently lest that any man shall fall from the grace of God. Now, this is Paul, we believe, that wrote Hebrews. He's telling us that if you're not if you're not careful, you could fall outside of God's grace. &gt;&gt; And I want to show you in God's scripture, you know, holiness talked about our dress, and we can read that in Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy 22:5 says, "If a woman wears that that pertainth unto a man, neither shall a man wear that pertainth unto a woman. For all that do it is an abomination unto God." I want to show you something. When you consider that, it's is the price worth it? Well, you'd have to consider your eternal life. That person would have to consider the eternal destination. But I want to show you in a different way to show you that you could be okay with that. But you wouldn't be okay with something else. And God says they're exactly the same. Now watch this. I want I want to clarify something. And we've done this before, but this this is going to be off my chest cuz I'm not getting there and being holding anybody's blood on my hands. I don't believe that there's nothing that a a girl or a woman or a sister in the message can't do. You want to go snowmoiling, you can go snowmoiling. Wear a snowsuit. You want to go in a bungee jumping, go bungee jumping. Wear a pair of pants, go bungee jumping. But you can always wear a small coat, long coat, a skirt over that, even a mini skirt over that. And you will be telling the world, I am different than a man. Now watch this. Watch this. Different. I don't care how you say. You can you can you can wrestle cattle and ride horseback and have a pair of overhauls on in the west, but you can have a short skirt on that when you leave that horse, you tell the whole world that this is somebody different. Now, I want to show you something. In every country I've been in, which I've landed in a few countries that I never stayed in, the bathroom's deadification, is a skirt on a person and pants in another one. Now, most of you sitting here would think if a man walked in a woman's bathroom with a skirt on, you'd have a problem with that. &gt;&gt; And he's obeying the sign. some and some might not think if a woman walked in a man's bathroom with pants on. You might have a problem with that, but they're actually obeying the sign. Every country, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Japan, honey, where have we been? every country we've landed in or drove through, the sign was the same. But watch how God shows it. And I want to read a quote the prophet said. Do you realize in Leviticus 2013, most of you might or some might think, well, I have to do this because we live in a cold climate. I ain't telling nobody to freeze to death. Put leggings, put on pants, put on insulated, whatever, but put a dress over top of it. put a dress over top of it. Do you know that when you come up in the judgment that God will judge you exactly the same as you have a big problem with this? In Leviticus 20:13, it says, "If a man lays with a man as if he would lay with a woman, he committh abomination." And if you're wearing man's clothing without a skirt over it, as far as God's concerned, you're gay or lesbian. There is absolutely not one spec different. He said, "If a man lays with a man as if he would lay with a woman, he committh abomination. But if a woman wears pant without a skirt over it, it's an abomination." In God's age, you're a lesbian. Watch what the prophet said here. It all comes down to the price. &gt;&gt; It all comes down to the price because there ain't nothing you can't do without still keeping your nature. There's nothing at all you can't do. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "I was going to the bus stop and I was a game warning and I was going up here and I was sitting there and there was a man talking like that and he had a welder's cap on and I was talking like this. Now listen, I I I said there ain't nothing a woman can't do. My girls help me doctor cattle and and do everything. Well, many of them better than the men. I would pick my girls over most men. I don't I don't believe because you're a message person, you can't go horseback riding or toboggoning or skiing or or uh you know, you can't ride a snowmobile. I don't believe that. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that at all. You can do anything you want, but you can still keep your dignity as a woman. &gt;&gt; Watch this. And this man was smoking a cigarette. Brother B had a welding glasses on and pushed up like that and and he names the place where they were. And he said, "I was sitting there and I was talking to this old fellow and he said something there and it got we got to laughing and he said I was laughing so hard." He said, "I hit him on the leg and said, "Oh boy, that really takes the cake, don't it?" It was Brother Brown. And he said, sitting directly across from me was a woman and said, 'Hey Ruth, are you going to go do this tomorrow? Brother Brandham almost passed out. He said she had on overhauls, big burly, just like a man sitting there smoking a cigarette, blowing it out her nose. And he said, "I thought it was a man." And he said something just about what's that word? &gt;&gt; Touch doing something and it hit somebody's head and knocked what you call off. And we started laughing and I laughed so hard that I slapped her on the leg thinking it was a man. And I didn't know any different because I couldn't tell it wasn't a man. The Bible says that a woman that puts on a garment pertaining to a man, it's an abomination. But the Bible also says the man with lay with men and women with women is an abomination. You might be okay with one, but are you okay with both? Because I can prove to you, and I mentioned this before, but I can prove to you in my small life generation, and I think I can name three families that their grandparents left the women wearing skirts and their grandkids are gay and lesbians. Most of that was connected in the free Methodist church and they left that when I was born. So, it took the history of my life to go from cutting your hair and looking butchie like a man and wearing pants to your kids will be gay lesbians. And you know why? It's your fault. Because they don't know who you are. They slap your leg because they think you're a man. It's a different nature. You want to vomit when you see those kind of people together in the town, but if you're doing the other, it's the exact same demon. Matthew 27 and3 said and Judas prescariat which betrayed him when he saw the condemnation that rented repented himself and brought the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders and saying I have sinned and betrayed innocent blood and you know what the devil will tell you and they said what is that to us see thou how to that. And he cast the silver. See, he desperately was wanting repentance. And he cast the silver in the temple and departed and went out and hung himself. And the chief priests took the silver. And they said it was not lawful to put it in the treasury because it had paid the price of blood. And they took it and counseledled. And they bought potter's field to bury strangers. And that field is potter's field, the field of blood to this day. See, everything you do in your life, you put a price to it. Is it worth it? But if you have a nature change, you won't do that. And you're going to have a harder time proving it when it was just something simple that you could just put. You can just make your garment. So when you stand up, you're warm. You don't have to freeze to death. You don't have to stay in the kitchen and not do anything fun. You can have as much fun as anybody. But when you stand up, the world will know that it's a man. Do you know you think this is far out? Do you know I have pictures on my phone in the states where they arrested women for nudity and they had far more clothes on than what they would wear today. It was all it was just slow progression justification. James 1 and we're going to close here just a couple scriptures. James 1, he said, "Therefore, laying apart all filthiness, super fluidity, and naughtiness, receive with meekness the grafted word, which is able to save your souls. But be doers of the word and not just hearers, receiving deceiving your own self. For it would be, for if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man holding the natural face in a glass, and he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way straightway, forgetting what manner of man he is. Matthew 10, one of our last scriptures here, Matthew 10 37. And he said, here's Jesus giving us the price that is if it's worth it or not. He said, "He that loveth father and mother more than me is not not is a key word here. Not worthy of me." If you love yourself and your own ideas more than Christ, you're not even worthy. And he that loveth his son or his daughter more than me is not not is a key word here worthy of me. And he that taketh not up his cross and follows me, follow after me, is not worthy of me. Everything we judge because we're humans by a price. Well, I only wanted to. But if you have a nature change, you don't judge a price because you're a different person. &gt;&gt; You're just a different person. Amen. Let's just read that scripture again as we close. Proverbs 16 and2. All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes, but the Lord weighth the spirits. You know, I I just close with this with the on the same thing as our dress. I've seen pictures of the Brigden Fair around the 1930s and 40s and it looked like every person that went to the fair had just left the wedding. If you think I'm far off this I like you any of you maybe it's out there but you know when they people get married I've never now it's probably about to come out or maybe it already is. I didn't look for it, but I've never heard them advertise that they got their wedding pants on. It was always a wedding dress because normally most men want to marry a woman. And amazingly enough, when they do their vows, I imagine it's probably it's probably coming up that it'll come out. But I've never ever seen a picture, new or old, of a man and a woman getting married and the woman having wedding pants. Amen. I also showed you years maybe a year ago or something pictures I had from the high school in the 60s and it would put most churches to shame of what the women look like in public schools because in the 60s watch this watch this sat knows exactly it was cool to be a feminine. But Satan has changed the roles and now it's cool to be butchy and mouthy and take the spirit of a man. &gt;&gt; That's not nature. &gt;&gt; Forget you could just set Christianity aside. It's not even natural. God help us. &gt;&gt; You know, I I seen this when it came up probably a month ago. I seen the first thing that God was pulling me to this message and and I want to show you how I got this. I seen a random post on the internet from Darren Jones and he said, "I'm going to side with Judas's Scariot because we all do the same thing he does. sell Jesus out and I just blew it off. And two or three weeks ago, I was studying on humility and I was going through the message hub and I found this quote where brother Bram said, "The church is the same as Judas's Scariot." I said, "Oh, God, you're sending something this way." &gt;&gt; And every one of us, if we ain't had a nature change or before we had a nature change, has been guilty of putting the price on. Is it worth it? Let's stand. Amen. God help us. Thank you Lord Jesus. He is Lord F. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Amen. Amen. We just have an announcement to make. We're going to sing All is Well, Vicki, um we have an announcement to make. This is as much for the people online as it is for us here present. But your government in Canada has passed a law to make religious beliefs and the Bible hate speech. It is not fully passed yet because they dickered it beyond the time that they could make it law until they come back in January the House. So all that would watch our video online, this is a blowout to you. When that becomes law, we will not have a public video. We may look into getting a password to some people, but you can see the signs. &gt;&gt; You can play all you want, &gt;&gt; but it's your eternal soul. We are at the end. &gt;&gt; If you got democracy countries like Canada making the Bible, reading the Bible prison, two years minimum. &gt;&gt; You need to really value and appraise where you're at. Is Christ worth it to you? &gt;&gt; Because the government's going to find out for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. We need a rapture. &gt;&gt; We need a rapture. And we need a rapture really bad. It might not be safe for me, but if they take me, they'll take you next. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need a rapture. This world is insane. Amen. Let's sing this song. But God will take care of us. I'm not afraid of jail. The food's free. They probably don't have to fix the fire either. I imagine they'll have Well, they can't use natural gas because that hurts the environment. So, I don't know what they'll heat the place with cuz we're tree lovers, but or environment lovers, but they'll probably have something. Oh, solar panels. That's what they'll heat it with. There's a story. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
