I wash spirit and I try to be very observant where I go not all preachers are pastors right pastoring is a gift the Bible speaks of five they are not positions they are gifts you know there were different anointings the Lord commanded the Ravens to feed Elijah but he commanded the widow woman to sustain him so there's a big difference in feeding and sustaining and the spirit of sustainance is on brother Dale not just a feeding the Ravens fed and left that's the woman sustained some of us preachers we feed and leave but the pastor sustains and I appreciate that about him and get to know

just steer my spirit Lord I want to jump I want to shout I want to scream Lord oh Hallelujah leaving is on my mind Lord leaving is on our minds glory to God Lord I Thank you for the Holy Spirit anointing as you lead us today in service in Jesus name amen I bless God let's turn our Bibles to the Book of Proverbs chapter 23 I want to read two verses you take your seats and we just take this little word tonight and I really glad to be here with you I'll be here by the by the grace of the Lord leading we'll be here Wednesday night amen just you know I'm not I'm not going to I'm not taking back anything that I brought I got to leave everything here that I came with is that right it's not fair you know if I come here to Canada for the first time I got to leave everything that I came with so you make sure you you you're here Wednesday night we just have a good time and I I really love all the Holy Spirit just bringing us from Friday you know the current is good and pulling us you know so if we go back and pick some things from Friday last night amen we just just just leave ourselves open you get what you come for you know what you expect but it's all about the mind let's just read you know the writer said in Proverbs 23:8 eat thou not the bread of him that had and Heil High neither desire thou is D toates for as he thinketh in his heart so is he heat and drink said he to the but his heart is not with the God bless you be seated I I actually read that because I read some quotes of the prophet of God he said concerning this but he just state from it what a man thinketh in his heart so is he you know so you say you becoming what you're thinking certainly you're becoming what you're thinking you know and and and so what jumped out of this thought in me is that you know the the the is that what are you thinking now people say I'm thinking about God even a man in a rum bar thinking about God you know that the whole world seems to be so religious every you know they think about God and try not to call the name Jesus though but they're thinking about God you know everybody love God but they hate the name of Jesus that's interesting a religious world that we're living into and you know but when you think about it and you know the proverb says that as you think in your heart so you are is that right so we could talk today and you know know you remember in the Book of Genesis chapter 2:5 if you notice how I preach I like to give a lot of scriptures because what we preach are like to prove it from this is that right SS of God the prophet brought you he said go back to this go back to the word this is absolute amen praise be to God Amen and so you know here in uh in in Genesis chapter 65 amen we saw where the right amen Moses said the imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was evil continually evil in his mind in his thinking was constantly evil and so man becomes evil every day is that right but then let us look at a foundation here and you know in Hades four think and brother Paul the Apostle Paul was in prison when he wrote the letter to the Saints in Ephesus it was one letter with six pages but we call it six chapters but six pages all right but then when you understand that you know think about this as he while he wrote this letter but when you reach a uh history shows that he sailed to militus when he called the Elders of the church in Ephesus because he wasn't able to go back they were trying to persuade him not to go to Jerusalem because the the the the Saints knew that there was a threat on his life in Jerusalem especially from the Jews and so he knew but he really wanted to be at the pass over because Paul was a Jew from The Tribe of Benjamin is that right yet he had dual citizenship with Rome and so he was really uh Bening going to Jerusalem because he want to be at the Passover but they were trying to persuade him not to go but anyway he went he he he s to Milius and you know really wanted to to to speak to the Saints in Ephesus because if you notice how he addressed the Saints in Ephesus Saints in Christ unto the Saints in Christ and or we or we talk to them was a little different how we spoke to those in Corinth and even Rome because the Saints in Ephesus they were more mature when it comes to the word of God you understand that different country different Spirits different regions different spirits and so you know when he called them and he called the elders and you know he told them uh amen I will not see you face to face anymore you know and oh he spoke to them Bible said they were crying and they they kissed him on the neck and embrac him because he told them this is the last I'm going to sing you because he knew that his time was close glory to God hallelujah he knew he upon you knew that he fought a good fight he knew that he kept the faith he said I know I'm going to leave you and I will not see you again but bring this letter home and read it to the regions glory to God and so in page four of the letter we realize oh we all outline the five gifts oh God Amen that God sent to perfect the Saints which was a fivefold Ministry on this is for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ until we all come into the unity of the faith and now am just laying the foundation here Saints then in the next page P page five he would show them how now when he admonished them and the in the verses 15 and 16 when he said walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil the days are evil glory to God not as fools but as wise then he went down f as he chares the husbands how to treat their wives Hallelujah and he spoke about amen the connection that brought a man to his wife he leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife it reminded me when the word says Brothers your prayers can be endered the way you treat your wives we having church we having service is that right your prayers can be endered the way you treat your wife we saw about a Paul late out right there when he said Brothers amen you cannot hate your wife because if you hate your wife you are hating your own flesh oh he made it out there amen upon the verge of his departure but not theless he went brought it further he said I'm showing you a mystery I'm showing you a mystery it's your husband and wife but I'm actually showing you a mystery between Christ and the church Hallelujah the church is his wife is that right amen what a mystery oh when the page was read to the church in Ephesus it was told that when the letters reach Ephesus it would have gone on to galatia leysia sardes and all tesalonica amen that everybody want to hear amen that letter right from the Apostle Paul when the part about the husband and wife was read and oh Paul showed you that Christ is going to wash his bride with the washing of the Water by the word oh Christ loved the church and he gave himself for her all the hearts of the people Rejoice like you're rejoicing today to remember that Christ loves you he cares for you he knows what you're going through oh oh my and there is no power in hell that can stop you from going [Applause] home you came from God and there is no doubt you're going back where you came from oh when that page was read it brought to rejoicing it brought a great shout among the Believers Hallelujah that's page five but then God of a way of doing things to shift our minds because he want us to be thinking otherwise Hallelujah the one that turned the next page Paul shift from a marriage because when that was read what came in the mind of the church is that we are happily married we are expecting to go home in the marriage supper can't wait to come back for the honeymoon but the next page was read oh my what is it as they turn the page over he changed the scenario he said Church you are on a Warfare woo God how he jump from a marriage the Beauty and the essence of a love life to a Warfare he said church we are in a Warfare but you are not wrestling against flesh and blood you are wrestling against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of the church you are wrestling against spiritual wickedness in high places oh then he know what he did he told him how to prepare thems Lo loin guard your loins with truth oh breastplate put on the breastplate of righteousness oh shout your feet with the preparation of the go gospel of peace hold the shield of Faith make sure your head is covered with the helmet of salvation don't forget your sword don't forget your sword oh what a change what a change in the scenario you wonder why did he jump to to that because he was preparing their minds it's time to leave you are the wife of Christ you are married to Christ but it's time to leave what's on your minds what are you thinking about glory to God what are we thinking about Hallelujah notice in Exodus chapter 11 well from verse one to a few verses there I will pick out we're on the verge of leaving here we're on the eve of leaving brothers and sisters no doubt in my mind EXA oh God we got a few things to say today don't rush me my two friends will be in my corner don't rush me I know he's listening I love him I I'm going to pray I'm going to bless him before I left here especially oh God we want young men like those again around the place we want them again oh he's sweet he's sweet you that goes to tell you is on good Tage he's watching his daddy close I didn't know that you know until I see them sit there and say where he come from and I realized glory to God Amen a fruit wonderful fruit bearing so notice here Saints and just keep her thoughts in line what's on the Mind Seasons come and Seasons go amen is that right Seasons come and Seasons go we ought to be careful not to misunderstand the season sometimes you're here worshiping under the atmosphere of another season and then you may not be able to manipulate what is required of you for this season Oh Glory to God is that right Saints and and I know I'm right I'm that and so God have a way of allowing things to happen or to say some words even to your pastor to shift your mind because what you're thinking that's what you're becoming glory to God so you remember the first night was change of the Dynamics sir so what they keep looking at there coming so when we put those sticks in the water pastor we are putting them for the Believers to keep looking at that thinking about that and they are becoming that glory to God is all right pastors oh bless God and so we see the children of Israel under this first Exodus glory to God oh the amen and the Lord said unto Moses yet will I bring one plague more upon pharaoh and upon Egypt afterwards he will let you go end when he shall let you go we shall surely thrust you out H all together listen this speak now in the hears of the people and let every man borrow of his neighbor that were slav for 400 years they being oppressed glory to God but let every man borrow of his neighbor let every woman of her neighbor jewels of silver jewels of gold woo God and the Lord God gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians that wasn't a normal anointing that hit the task Masters that's no normal anointing that each glory to God the the slave masters you notice it they start of Amen you want more gold how much you want Hallelujah glory to God is that right that's not a normal anointing when your [Music] boss when your boss turning around and blessing you he that right that's not ordinary anointing that was a powerful anointing that e the Egyptians oh how much gold you want you want more you sure you got enough W hallelujah oh bags were being filled with gold and silver they they were stacking up oh they have never even seen this coming they never experienced this before hallelujah oh when God gets ready you got to move you remember with that song Oh God and as they were piling Golds and silver can I imagine you all the Israelite sisters were just looking at what they had and oh they were just talking about the golds and the silver oh much brother you see how much I got and they offering me more and come and take more oh God hallelujah come and take more you sure you got enough oh come on pil it up pil up they didn't know what hit them they never know what hit them giving their slaves gold giving their slaves riches that's not ordinary so the mind of Israel was rejoicing Israel was rejoicing they were happy that those Oh Glory to God but that was not Freedom that was not freedom but they were happy woo God but then the message came from Moses tonight glory to God God shifted their minds from that being happy you're about you're happy you're rejoicing God just shift their minds shift their minds now oh glory to God on the 10th day every family take out the lamb and the 14 they kill it the very same night oh God says tell them they're going to kill the lamb put the blood on the lynchell oh on the door post oh my the minds were changing tell them when they're eating it it's not dining as usual but they ought to eat in haste eat in haste with their shoes on their feet their staff in their hands their loins G about what is on your mind leaving Hallelujah woo hallelujah what is on your mind leaving God changed the thoughts of their mind this is not about gold and silver it's about leaving don't get complacent don't get complacent it's about leaving woo God Amen are you still there as the Apostle Paul brought the church to that Revelation you are wife of Christ Christ will present you to himself through the washing of the word that immediately shith the scenery so that the minds can be shifted shift the scenery so that the minds can shift because what's on the mind is who you are becoming whatever a man thinketh so is he you remember the prophet says how you know that you are saved he said keep thinking about it he said keep confessing it is that right how you know you're healed because you got to keep confessing it the Mind think it but out of the mouth confession comes Satan don't understand that woo Hallelujah you remember the message count down the prophet preacher the message count down and he talk about hor and B from some automobile to herlan and you glory to God and you know one the astronaut age and you know what the devil didn't even see message coming this was not just an Evangelical message it was a me he was dealing with time he was dealing with time is that right Saints you know to show the world now is now engulf with time faster machines faster Vehicles oh come on Church go don't just sleep there something is happening Hallelujah Glory faster net works huh faster computers everything is about speed oh Hallelujah Oh Glory the prophet says he says science prove that if two objects are traveling towards each other he said speed can let them pass you without disturbance how did Jesus go through the wall [Applause] speed and he preached up more than 57 years ago he preached speed what about today oh glory to God he said how will you get to heaven when you come out of this body he said by speed we're going to travel by speed we're going to move faster than light we're going to travel faster than the thought Hallelujah every time I see that come up with something faster my mind go back on my [Applause] translation woo God I just don't preach it because I like itall but say I Don't Preach because I love to preach I don't preach it because it sounds good I preach it because I believe it I preach it because I expect it to happen oh God the Lord be me weakness today I expect it to happen I preach about Resurrection every day I'm expecting it Hallelujah I preach about changing my body every day I'm on under expectation for that oh Hallelujah glory to God so we talk about so when brother Paul draw them watch on your mind when he shift them from just husband and wife on Church Christ and his church he shift the scenario to war war bride of Christ it's no coincidence on the eve of the war the Prime Minister stood up and draw a line of his intention for peace in the Middle East me Pastor he was talking about a peace line or some agreement for Israel and then B War another country War over here Civil War over here another War over here another one get involved in the war because the atmosphere is filled with war what's on your mind War you think I'm not talking Israel or Ukraine war we're coming back as Warriors what is he talking about watch on your mind we're on the eve of the Resurrection we're on the eve of our translation but why so when we look at that why would you say brother barley that war is supposed to be on your minds Revelation Chapter 19 Verse seven we recite that we dancer around it oh God I I can I can close this oh she great I can close that we dance around let us rejoice look at the atmosphere and give honor to him you talk about rejoicing I'm not talking about let us rejoice oh you know how people look when they Rejoice you know people look when they Rejoice oh Hallelujah glory to God let us rejoice and Hallelujah and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife made yourself ready glory to God hallelujah is that right oh unto her verse eight unto her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the what righteousness of the Saints verse n now oh blessed are those that are called to the marriage sheer of the Lamb
