sister Ruth and brother Bernard have gone to Ohio I believe but uh just that have time together this weekend amen and also brother Matt and Sister Abigail rejoicing with her little family her little boy uh Wesley and he's perfect he's he's very perfect just a beautiful family he's just about two weeks old or something just very young yet probably a little hard for them to travel and chain them into a car seat amen so we send our greetings to all those people and our brothers and our sisters with us you know sister and Mom your son's going to be here when you go see him you tell him that brother Dale wants to see him I seen him at brother Carson's retirement singing amen God don't make no mistakes yeah amen you tell him he's very welcome very more than welcome we'd love to be his friend amen just a awesome amen well we welcome you all and let's just go right into the scriptures we're going to turn to first Thessalonians 521 to 23 and oh sorry thank you Amy amen just uh again just send our greetings to those at camp and and and wherever the Believers are different congregations God bless them and and uh you know I I believe in Camp I I I'm I'm a different personally because of Camp my dad took us to Camp more camps and Carter has vitamins I mean I'm met my wife at Camp everywhere we went to Camp where we didn't know people when I met my wife the only person I knew there was one family we drove seven hours to Muny Indiana Camp I believe in Camp and I tell you what is if God leaves us on this Earth it's Camp's powerful for for fellowship and and Believers and kids and my grandkids there brother Jeff's kids there you know it it changes lives literally changes lives amen 1 Thessalonians 5:2 1-23 prove all things hold fast to that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ Lord God you know what you've laid on my heart and you pray that you will share it your thoughts with the people Lord God and may you be pleased with everything that's done and said in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats this morning I want to preach on or talk or God wants to preach on I should say something that we're all going to see differently and even if it would be all right to say disagree now that would make most ministers nervous uh but I I'm not here to change your conviction not here to change your conviction I'm here to show you what the word of God says what our Prophet says said and tell you to be really careful because you know the Bible says that Satan is going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and that means he's going around the elect CU he already has the other people and I know we believe in election and predestination and praise God it's the greatest peace you'll ever have but the Bible also o says that if he never shortened the days that even the elect that's if it were possible it's not but if he didn't shorten the days that means the days are evil very evil very very evil and this is what I want to preach on I want to preach on the web and you know our Prophet was a typologist and he typed everything natural to spiritual a spiderweb has three purposes to catch to kill and to destroy it is no mistake that the worldwide web is catching trapping killing and destroying Believers Believers because the other people are already dead see they're already dead amen and I also want you to know I studied this huge in Google and different thoughts and natural a spider web is made out of silk and it's shiny it's an attraction and you can't get away from it you can't stay away from the web but you know for us older people how did we survive there was actually a Time see Satan knows his his time is short yes and he's trying to get as many of least of our kids but as many openly as he can and you know we have uh you know the prophet said this that the things that our kids are fighting now was nothing that he fought then just times that by about a 100 million today you know our Prophet preached about television and magazines and the magazines he was talking about look like the Holy Bible compared to the web now if you question me on that I can show you some privately some pretty amen and there is no you know I I got a question for the parents and and the ones that aren't here are going to be online and the ones that can't listen at this moment will listen later are you going to trust a man-made device with your kids's Eternal destination what I mean by that is you can say oh bless God I got a password you're going to trust your password to Satan really you're going to trust fath recognition to Satan see how we compromise and I'm let me rephrase this I'm not trying to change your opinion on the web I use it to study I use it for the message up you know a brother was showing me just yesterday somebody had face recognition on their up-to-date phone brand new phone and they were in the desert and they turned their face to a camel and it opened their phone oh bless God I'm protecting my kids I think the Bible says that you're no match for Satan that's what our Prophet said you know even the angels weren't a match for Satan CU who was it that prayed in the Bible and and they the Gabriel came down and he was withheld 21 Daniel withheld withheld 21 days and it was until he called out until our king of kings and he said I he this I love this testimony Daniel said he said from the moment you prayed I left heaven but I was was withheld by Satan wow bless God I'm going to put her face recognition on my phone that's ridiculous I'm going to put a fingerprint on my phone that might help but I think we need to look at our motive and objective closely and I'm I God's dealt with me that on Facebook because I tell you what I'm very thorough on Facebook very very thorough before I would and I'm going to well God's just dealing with me on it but you know before I would accept somebody on Facebook number one it has to be their own picture number one it has to be their own picture and then I look through any of their profiles and see if there's any skin even just in proper skin of any kind under their page and if there's anything like that and you know there's been multiple Believers that I've sent private messages that they had pornography on their page they didn't even know it some of them never even answered me never even know but they they they would send me a friend request they had per and I would send them a private message and I said I won't friend request you until you get rid of your pornography they has never even got back to me yet what kind of a testimony is that we say we're serving God we're we we are but our actions are serving the devil because everybody that sees that a stumbling but do we know what the Bible says it'd be better that you weren't born to to stumble one of the little ones of these that look at my Facebook and so and Satan I know I know Satan can I've even put up things in my page I said if there's something improper I didn't put it there people can put it there I understand that but then now now this is for me this this sentence is for me but then do we need it now I'll show you things that you need you know we just had a pastor Pastor uh uh Nestor came from menel I've preached from him twice uh has you know was a good friend like I've known him very well and he was coming to Ontario we met with him and had a good time met different Fellowship around next year he said when he comes he's coming he's going to have time for us to preach and that and he couldn't get a hold of me on Whatsapp and he don't have Facebook and so he contacted a pastor in the Philippines that knows me and sent me a private message now see if I get rid of Facebook then I couldn't have got that message so see you know you know your Prophet said that he didn't have a problem with television he said that if the right stuff's on it God can use it for good I have the but then he said God told me not to have one and he said it'll take you to hell now that's quite a bit of different topic it's quite a bit different topic but so you and so I know I'm scattered and I'm just I'm just I'm just bringing stuff to your notification but you know uh uh you know we all most of us if not directly you know we got young families if we don't have our own kids we're going to have our grandkids and I'm not just picking on kids but man well I'm not old enough to handle this stuff that's on Facebook so like how's my 13-year-old grandson you know what the prophet said about the TV and stuff that's on TV he said forget about having Revival if you're showing them not on the TV you're wasting your time wow you know I showed some Believers and and I'm I'm laying a foundation and I'm going to take my time and if I don't finish we got till God takes us home I showed some Believers and I have it on my phone and it's if for mature people I could show it to but I was a member of evening light uh forget what it was it's evening late you know the message I was in a message group now people add me all the time I'm in like four pastors message groups and people I've left them too because I mean it gets overwhelming you know I I still have to pray and study and stuff you know you know I had a brother messaged me yesterday this is this is just as fresh as it can get and he said I'm it was yesterday Saturday and and this is just I'm just putting this out here but you know uh and by the way we thank God for the amazing cool temperature man you want to see a miracle the last two Sundays the Saturday before it was 32 de and the Sunday before it was so low the furnaces were on when I opened the doors this morning that's unbelievable God give us air condition every Sunday so you can enjoy the word free of charge he's amazing amen you know this brother called to me and he said I'm just on my way back from church we've been at morning prayer this on Saturday morning now he's a pastor you say oh you push that off he said well that's what he's supposed to do he said but we're going to go back at 4:30 have another prayer service and he said I got a meeting with the young kids in the church because Satan's after our kids and if you don't think he is you you're already deceived tremendously Satan is after our kids amen and so back I was in this member of this evening light Tabernacle and there's people on there that's preached for me there's pastors there from South Africa that I've met in Ottawa and preached for people I know and like amazing people there's people that were on there that you know locally like Believers flat out Believers hundreds of them and I took pictures to prove it that and it shows the pictures I took it showed who were the three Believers in charge of the group dedicated message believers and then the next picture I took was was picture of brother brandham with the background of an eagle and maybe the you know I'm not sure if the pillar of fire the clouds there and right underneath of it there two of the worst pornography pictures you have ever seen in your life and I left the group you know if it gets to the point that technology we can't keep it clean then we can't use it you know there was actually five-fold Ministry before there was the web you know like you know you actually can preach without the web like I'm not led by the web to preach I'm actually led by the Holy Spirit to preach amen I can actually go back to paper you know I I don't I don't mind turning paper paper is a thing where you you know you lick your finger and it sticks and then you oh that that's technology that's pretty amazing and you know there is nobody outside that technology that if they don't have this book can touch that page go when I turn that page my eyes won't burn but when I touch the page on my iPad MH so you can tell me all you want that you're just doing message stuff on on there Satan knows how to get in there too and I have those pictures on my snap thing on my phone as proof it has the pictures of all the people on the group names amen so Satan's still Satan amen and so let let's just move on Ephesians 6 you know finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the wild of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers and darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take onto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand in what day the evil day having done all to stand Ephesians 610 that start at 10 you know I got I got to speed up my my pace we're going to be here for eternity but you know this is something we have to deal with this is something you're going to have to you're going to answer at the Judgment God bless you you're going to answer at the Judgment for for how you handle this now the web it for spreading you you know you can say you can spread the gospel with the web it has can be one of the well one of the greatest things for me as a minister is a message Hub it it's just been amazing but we're crossing bridges that we've never went before let me say it like that we're crossing Bridges and you can say well bless God you know I've got the Holy Ghost and none of this stuff will even hurt me it hurt the prophet I'm going to read you some things he said about it it would have hurt him he recognized it he said remember this in in a deceived Church by the world he said remember we're not on a niic but we're in a battlefield and many people just think that they become a Christian and that all they need to do is sit there forever and the Christians and everything is going to come easy don't you never get that in your head for becoming a Christian is to fight and fight the good fight of Faith he said I become a Christian to get into the battle lines he said I'm a Christian Soldier and we got to train and be brought up and know now watch this this I'm reading and these are all available to know all the tactics uhoh of the enemy that's called the web and to know how to fortify and to know how to fight the fight and we can only do what the Holy Spirit has revealed to us and we cannot take what some other you know Nation or person tells us to go to war and their ideas but we got to take what the Holy Spirit would direct us and what his idea that would give us because he the holy spirit is our commanding Chief priest of this Army amen wow I want to read the one where brother Brown said in I had a a sister I was looking for it and you know these quotes you look from wrong I knew what I wanted but a sister help me beauti yesterday he said I'm so tired he said look I look this way and I look this way now this is brother brandham now if anybody had a Vindicated life and everything's Immortal immoral sorry and I had to put a little crucifix across hanging on the front of my car mirror cuz some person riding by me the the other day now if it was so evil that he had to look through the cross I'm going to have to start laying a cross on my iPad and I said I see so much evil on the street now just to refresh your mem he died in 65 that was a pretty tame age I see so much Eve on the street Street and when I see the evil I look by the cross and think oh God how you how I love you for saving me from such corruption that's right let him always be before your face if you're on the web for the wrong reason he's not before your face so if now I don't mean this wrong I'm not a talking anybody and I want to lay some foundations and read some quotes and that but like why do you have the web if you're you know what I'm saying and I'm not trying to justify sin or that but if you're you know you want to search into the message and every time you go but if you just want to be connected to Satan in another country watch this the web came out in January 1st 1983 and it never became public and worldwide until ' 889 I would have been 20 years old before it was public you know in 1990 there was 3 million people on the web by 93 it moved up to 16 million by 2000 70% of adults in the world were on the web and there's there was around 361 million on the internet in 2000 would anybody like to guess how many is on the internet today billions 2 and A5 billion how many of them are professing Believers I'll let you decide do you know we have a brother that preached here and a fantastic brother James a wonderful brother and you know he went into computer technology and all this and he was telling me this he's preached for us many times and and a beautiful brother and he said when he finished his college degree in Toronto his Professor told him now he has a big job some big company and making good money he said every one of you in this classroom can decide today whether you're going to go legal or illegal and make a living doing it so the 50% of the class that went illegal could be making more of the people that went to actually got a job to tap into your web you cannot control your web you are no match to the devil your password your face recognition your fingerprint are a joke they're laughing at every one of them a brother was showing me today or just yesterday that you know they broke into the web of all the car dealerships and the parts departments and and in the world and and you couldn't unless you were like two dealerships you couldn't get parts or buy or sell or finance a car in the world and I'm thinking you know paper a pencil wow it's pretty common thing you know you know when our bank and the computers go down it's only the oldest people in the bank that know actually how to go two plus two I mean they can actually do it in my head it'll help you stop get alltimers and the other go oh I money what's the money I just hit the screen uhhuh I wonder if we try to serve God like that you know I want to go through and I I got to speed up but there's three messages that brother Brown talked about the web and the first one was the world's falling part in ' 63 but before we jump into there let me look at this he said you know I was parking my car the other day and he said a man said unto me he said preacher he said what are we going to do about all these kids juvenile delinquency and he said I said cut out all the voger on the t television and all the other kind of stuff like that and it'll take care of the problem I tell you what the buger on the television is like a tame lamb compared to the alligator tiger that's on the web here's another one where just and I have multiple ones on my phone and different ones that we'll never get to today but he said the greatest disgrace and it talks about it was the the downfall of America and he said it's exactly being censored and all here this stuff they put in front of our young kids I don't care how you block your kids if you have the web in your house it's in front of your kids he said if all this stuff they put in front of our young kids and things like that and now the devil has put it in every home by television and he carries on he said now television is right is fine if it has the right stuff on it amen here's another one he said ' all your dirty filthy dress and things and and cropped home and has has creeped into your home story and he said it's come through the he says the television but I going to say the web and everything else and it's a disgrace he said all the Revival in the world won't help one bit till we get back to the good old Foundation of no television no web wow and the world is falling apart in Deuteronomy I want to read the scriptures that are Prophet read and there's three messages he mentions it the the uh the web on and it was just amazing how he he he talks about it even before his time by uh by Revelation by Vision in Deuteronomy 410 to 11 Amy maybe you can pull this up he said especially the day that thou stood us before the Lord Lord thy the god of Horeb even the Lord saith unto me gather the people together and I will make them hear my words and they may learn to fear me all the days of they that they shall live upon the Earth that they may teach their children and they may come near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire in the midst of heaven with darkness and the clouds and the thickness of darkness and if you continue on reading another few verses which we not just for time it actually talks how God spoke out of the fire by the mountain amen and and and I would encourage you if you if you could go on to read this but I want I I want to read exactly the scriptures that our Prophet read and these messages in Hebrews 12 in Hebrews 12:25 and I actually put down to 29 but we're going to read 25 and see that ye do not refuse him that speaketh for if they escape not who refuse him that spake on the earth much more shall you not Escape if you have turned away from him that speaketh from Heaven amen I don't have brother Dale has nothing against the web brother Dale has the web but God's dealt with me and you know I've had Parents tell me you know well I got the web and you know you leave the computer in a popular room and then their teenage kids they wake up in the middle of the night and their kids are on the web or or they the parents go outside to plant the garden they come back in and the kids are on the phone you you're playing with something that you don't even you're you're you're you might as well leave loaded guns around the place You' it'd be safer because it could only kill their flesh amen here brother Brown he said he said it shoved one way and another he said and oh God he said they see the councel of Believers he says churches as they so call it he said they see they're moving right into the Trap Lord like a spider web weaving a web this was the prophet and the world is falling apart in 63 and he mentioned it after this quote after he read those scriptures that the church where was moving right into the spiderweb of the deceit of Satan he said oh and he uses the Pentecost he said oh May the Pentecost I say message Believers wake up and wake up quickly Lord while there's still time for them to wake up wake up in this little city before it's too late amen and Shalom here Isaiah 601 and2 me Isaiah 61 and2 arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has raised upon thee for behold Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness cover the people that includes message Believers even Holy Ghost filled people but the Lord shall rise unto thee and His glory shall be seen unto thee amen Psalm 62 I'm reading still reading the same scriptures of our Prophet truly my soul waiteth upon the Lord from him cometh my salvation he alone is my rock and my salvation he is my defense and I shall not be greatly moved how long will ye imagine Mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowling wall shall ye be and as a torting tottering fence they only counsel to cast him down from his Excellency and they delighted in lies bless they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly Sheila my soul waiteth upon thee Oh God for my expectation is from him and he alone is my rock and my salvation and he is my defense and I shall not be moved and God is my salvation and my glory The Rock and strength of my refuge is in God and I trust in him at all times and ye people pour out your heart before him for God is our refuge now here let me just go right into what brother Brown said in this Shalom message exactly here paragraph 42 and this is a 64 message amen before a prophet went home the difference is just like it was in the beginning when there was a gross Darkness upon the Earth the spirit of God is moving upon the faces of the water and said let there be light and God separated the light from the darkness and I believe that we are now living in the hour again when God is separating the light from the darkness and he's pressing it on the other side of the world that the light will be made manifested as we are now it's the decisions you'll make now just watch we're going to get to our our climax here and he's and they're just like they want to be but there's something wrong let the same message here let them do it it seems like there's a heaviness do you know with Facebook there's more people that commit suicide on Facebook than there was before that because if somebody don't put 300 likes on it or 400 comments or they go into depression have to go to the doctor and get a bottle of pills heaviness and now you tell someone that they should not do such and such a thing and the people look upon that and believes that they want to believe it but there's something that presses them the other way see the poor thing I feel so sorry for them they're so caught now this is a prophet and 64 I pray you'll hear me he said they're so caught in such a web of Hollywood now this Social Web that we have is we'll just name it hell forget the Hollywood part it's lower than that if that's even possible our Prophet actually mentioned the web in three messages and the advertisements on television and radio and newspaper and on the street and in the store windows with modern with moral dress and so forth and that way and the other people meet them and they've seen to be that there's something that they just that they just can't pull away from and our young people and our old people and our middleaged people the web of Hollywood is like a Cilan magnet you know you've seen pictures on Facebook or or on the web you've seen pictures ridiculous it would make you laugh but it's disgusting where people walk right out in front of cars semis trains walk into light posts on the phone fall downstairs walk into swimming pools seriously I'm not I don't make this up by the thousands because they're that's more than a disease that's a spirit no matter of fact that's a demon and it that demon has got your shoulders and it's just and the the Bible only says there's one person that's supposed to have your shoulders says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and somebody on that kind of a device is not ordered of the Lord no way and what's this cause it causes a gross same message causes a gross Darkness on the people it's something that presses into them like the Jews was in the days that Jesus was on Earth Isaiah prophesied of it and said there would be that they would be they would have eyes and they couldn't see and there will be years I'm going tell you something I'm I can I make a prophecy this morning there will be people listen to this message on the web maybe even present here and they'll just go away and those that was just brother Dale okay but when I get over there and I stand before the Judgment I'm going to have this year thing all clean cuz I I preach what the Holy Spirit told me to preach amen he said they have eyes but they can't see and they have ears because they can't hear and the reason is Jesus prayed their forgiveness because it had made them fulfill the scriptures and it's returned again to us today and the D Bible spoke of it in this day that we live in and that these things would come a gross Darkness on the people and we see it and there's something that's just simply the people but they can't they can't shake it it's called the web it's made out of silk and it's shiny and it's three purposes is to catch you to kill and hold you so you can be eaten desty to destroy you amen now here our Prophet preached in 6512 just literally a few days before he died in the leadership message amen and he reads the scripture in Mark and we're I'm not going to read I I just feel to pass it and I I hit it Mark to pass it but he reads the scripture of the Rich Young Ruler and how he came and said you know how must I be saved and Jesus told him what he must do and he had great possessions and then let's just go to Hebrews 12:25 so this is a leadership one right literally about the fourth last message before he preaches and he mess is the Hub again Hebrews 12:25 he said see that ye refused on him that speaketh now we read a scripture really close to that before in Thessalonians I believe it was say you refus on him to speak us for they escape not who refuse him that speak on Earth much more shall they not ye Escape if ye return away from him oh maybe I did already read that I'm sorry him from Heaven sorry Matthew 2 4 and 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and we know the scripture by heart and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that it would if it were possible it would deceive the great elect now in that scripture brother Brown compares the great signs and wonders to even the states and shooting atomic bombs and the Wonders they would do with money and and and and you know and like their education and all this thing like he he Compares this to the W the false Christ but they would be deceived by magnificent things people will be deceived by the web and they will justify it all day long and their kids are being fed to Lions amen if you play with fire you're going to get burnt I don't give my kids matches in the hay bur why would I give them my cell phone in the hay barn amen might just have a purpose you know I read a scripture just a secular men and he said at what point would it be okay to give your kid an iPhone or an Apple phone he said as soon as you want to lose their innocency uh do you know that most people's marriages are destroyed by pornography I now I know brother Dale I just got a grade two education but I don't understand how you can be sleeping with a bride a beautiful wonderful girl that you marry and you get so possessed of the devil that you would destroy your marriage for a screen of a picture you can't educate out of that that's a devil that is a devil unbelievable amen we know God is the word and and Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever you know the prophet said this and preaching this message in leadership he said for you to be able to accept this message this morning you have to accept eternal life he said for you to be able to he said Moses for him to be able to accept his calling he had to accept eternal life and turn down the web of Egypt well that hurt you don't think he was walking on gold palaces and silk lace curtains and had girls popping grapes in his mouth be eged girls popping grapes in his mouth and he left that for the desert to run for his life and the Bible says that he he never even considered that web for the riches of Glory wow that's in Hebrews 11 and our Prophet mentioned the scripture Hebrews 11:23 let's just move on to our last one of our last later quotes here this is a prayer that brother Brown says in his leadership message he said oh great leader of eternal life he said we accept your promise tonight father and I plead for this people here now this is four messages before our Prophet died he said I plead for this every one of them in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord and I pray Christ the son of God will come in the hearts of each one of us Lord and mold us and make us a new creature in Christ Jesus Grant it Lord and he said we love you you and we want we want you to change us and we and we want to be your children and we want to feel your spirit moving in our heart and Tenderly with us and bring us to the recognition that this insane age I wasn't even born then the hippie age this insane age that we're living in granted God when we see young people so caught up in the web of the devil that's in the leadership message and that's in paragraph 332 in the web of the the devil young men perverted Minds children dop btics cigarette smoking drinking in maral Satan's Eden leadership message 1965 you know that sounds a lot like Paul Harvey's news broadcast where he said If I Were the Devil I would keep doing exactly what I'm doing if you want to know what that I don't have it in front of me right now but it's basically that one line that our Prophet read bring drugs in the school make sniff M dogs make marriage cheap swinging better you know break up the family bring out the web bring out pornography the hippie AG just keep doing what we're doing and you know it I like talking to the Believers in the other side of the world but I I you know there's something I've realized and and and like I said the web like brother Brown said there's if the right thing on television it's okay but there's something different about television you know brother Brown used to preach about if you watched the movie he said was the problem with the movie if the movie was clean it was the ads that come on in the entertainment of the movie that paid the money to be on the television but the web it's worse than that because you can't stop the webs coming see you know why God's dealt with me on Facebook is and I've showed some of these things to my wife you know and the last and this week I blocked two numbers on my Facebook where I opened my thing and it was something improper they're not my friends I don't follow them I'm not connected to them I've never seen them never heard of them that and they're not how are they on my page and I blocked them so I won't see those two again this ain't working amen I I've had it before where I was buying uh tractor tires looking at tractor tires with my thing and on this side of the screen there was little tiny pictures there was bare naked women going up and down they just wanted you to push on one of them then of course it would come up now I'm buying tractor tires is that the only place you can buy tractor tires you know when we preached before and I even preaching a said the dove will only go where you must go now if there's another place to buy tires you're not going to get to heaven say well God I had to buy tires on the internet because I couldn't just walk in the shoing you're not going to lie to God Amen you're definitely not going to tell God that I had to listen to the word of God on a mechanical device because a prophet said repeatedly that God would never use a mechanical device to preach the word of God you know repeatedly you know when I looked up television I think the prophet mentioned television about 539 times and you know at least half of them were I don't have a television program so I don't have to beg you for money so the prophet clearly could clearly could have went on television but we think we can't have a Ministry unless we're on television and God's up there like that's hilarious if God didn't choose to put one of the Seven Stars on the TV that were laying the foundation for the revelation of the Mysteries he don't need a puppy like you don't need a puppy like brother Dale cuz I'm I'm sharing the Mysteries but I ain't laying the foundations of the Mysteries they're revealed amen would it be okay if I read that again this this was this is in the this is in the the leadership message I just trying to find the end of it I'm not to the end yeah leadership 1265 paragraph 332 the people are caught up in the web of the devil young people people perverted Minds children dope addicts cigarettes smoking drinking Immortal Satan's Eden and God has taken you 6,000 years including to the according to the Bible to build Eden and you put your sons and your wives in there his bride to rule over it and sat so he's talking about his bride now and Satan has come in and perverted it and it's took him 6,000 years to he's talking about back in Eden you know when he had Adam and Eve and and Satan took 6,000 to pervert it now God's taking 6,000 years to build his own well he's talking here Satan's eating sorry it's hard to follow him Satan has come around and perverted it and he took 6,000 years to build his own watch this web that's basically what he's saying intelligent Eden through Science Education and so-called intelligence and he's build it into a mess of death 333 paragraph oh God take us back to the Eden Lord where there was no death where there was no sorrow Grant it Lord that we stand humbly and wait for the second Adam who has come for his bride and make us part of Him Father we pray in Jesus name there's the prayer of our prophet four messages at the end of the message praying for the web he back then was praying for my grandkids that I hope will'll never see the web and you know even if you protect all your kids like how would my kids go with any other human person they could just walk by the grocery store and see the web on their phone or Satan's everywhere and I mean like when so the Bible says this he said when you've done all you can do stand God will do the rest but some of us aren't doing very much God's getting really tired covering up for us amen God help us here's a Queen of Sheba he said more of our children can tell you more about David Crockett and Gunsmoke and some of them than they can tell you about Jesus Christ it's because of what they're taught in the homes and then talk about ju juvant delinquency he said it's the parent delinquency and now this could hurt Church delinquency and that's exactly right and it's preacher delinquency of preaching the word and God working through the church so see I'm just clearing out of that part I'm pre what you do with it in your home that's up to you he said ananas and safaris were living in the church and he said on the side of the church and never called out by the preacher and told them of their sins because they were the heaviest payers there was in the church so the people wouldn't preach against them because they give the most in the plate John 66 John 6 and 66 brother Jose preached on this the second message at camp and it really blessed my heart and I I want to close with this and I want to read a just a few uh quotes on my phone if uh if that's all right we're still in good time you know brother Jose was mentioned this if you look at the numbers uh 6 6 this number in the Bible you know nothing happens for a mistake you see that number uhhuh that's the number of men it goes perfectly with the number of the scripture and from that time many of his disciples went back and never listened to what he preached about the web anymore 666 it ain't the number of the Beast it's a number of men it is the number of the beast but it's the number of men it's like we're not listening to you God uh that's kind of what it says here the disciples said we're not listening to you no more we have our own church doctrine by the way we're under Moses bless God we have the law uh 2 Thessalonians 2 10 and 12 it's my last scripture and I'm just going to close with some quotes and with all deceivious deceive help me out here H deceivableness and unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not thee and you know brother Jose was saying this so beautifully you can have the truth and go to hell truth the hell hell will be filled with message M Believers a matter of fact Satan himself is a message believer he don't he can't he can't live it he can't have faith he can't confess Jesus but he knows it's the truth he knows this is the truth but they had not the love they had the truth but they didn't have the love for the truth that they might be saved because they didn't love the truth see the truth can only set you free if you love it but because they didn't love the truth because they receive not the love of the truth and for this cause God sent them a strong delusion you know what that delusion is oh bless God you know my web in my home it'll never see another pornography picture ever you're a liar there's not no there's not one person alive breathing could make that prediction and hold to it by Satan in the web I don't care how many holy ghosts you have he give them a strong delusion that they may believe a lie that they might be damned who believe not the truth but have pleasure in onri God help us you know we want to close with it like this I just want to get my phone for one second the web in itself is not evil but Satan has taken it and used it for evil and this is the part I want to drive home to you what you do with this message is entirely up to you but I want you to not be deceived that you cannot hide from Satan in the web and if you think you can you are deceived there is no locking no blocking no nothing that will hide from anything if you can get in an evening light Tabernacle message ministers group and post pornography under our prophets picture you can go anywhere I could probably show you a dozen to two dozen people that sent me friend requests that are believers around the world and they don't even know it and they have pornography on their Facebook and I open my Facebook and there ain't nothing that's supposed to be on there and it's called ads and they're never about church and serving the Holy Ghost because it's controlled by Satan it's controlled by Satan amen he said we don't have a television and there won't be one in my home never but there that's up to you what you do but God told me not to have one and then we moved into this house down West and we rented a sweet old sister's house up here and she had a television and they have it to rent in her house I want to read I'm just reading some invisible Union here he said here here's just short quote she said she was deceived by television by magazines and by all those people that had them you just compare that to the worldwide web you've seen so much on television and so much of the things of the world that it's so easy for the old Adam nature to drift right back into that like all the rest of the people amen like you know if we're supposed to shun the very appearance of evil I wonder it's not hard for me to believe why God's dealing with me on my Facebook amen he said you want those ones that you pour into and that's because of these the Suzie on television and radio and all in these magazines and it's the devil put all that stuff watch this it's now he's talking about really cool stuff like to what we're in today he said it's the devil putting all that stuff around your young kids drinking beer all these Hollywood stars and the devil fills that in and de the devil's filling the insane institution and The Prostitute houses to catch kill and eat the world worldwide web here he's praying he said come out of him Satan and deliver him from the television from all the kinds of the world that's in it he said quit looking at television and quit looking at the things of the world and look to Calvary he said I got nothing against television if it's used in God's program it's all right America oh no he said said you've got a television to look at he said you got those old vulgar programs not censored on the television or radio and all this is right if they had the right thing it could mean it couldn't be the means of spreading the gospel but here he's complaining because you can't censor it and more so than ever before you can't censor the web anything that I'm connected to on the web anybody can hack and they never hack it to spread the gospel amen wow he's talking about cracking jokes and all dirty things on the radio and television even even censored and nothing else and and it's perverting Pere preventing something the gospel is it's preventing the gospel to spread in the world he said but if the devil through television and everything else can push this into our kids heads in America what ought the church ought to be able to do Under the power of the Holy Spirit without the television in their minds American people through television and through the picture shows and they've seen so much to put on till they become put on themselves he said that's too bad he said the trouble is he's landed up here the devil has landed up here in Hollywood and come through the television and he stripped off our women and done everything there was ungodly to be done and the people call it and the people call it all right well it's all right if I'm on the web and I'm careful brother if you're born again and the spirit of God will bear witness and bear record with them things that are wrong oh what a disgrace that they've just turned to the television on and watch all the dirty rotten dorog and there in the world on and that's right and he said they ain't got nothing he what no this is balance he said ' I ain't got nothing against a movie and he said' I ain't got nothing against the television it's the rotten stuff that's on it he said that's what it is if you have to keep it moral you have to stay moral amen wow but we've never in our day had something more inmoral and it ain't been around forever you know when we talk to our kids I'm I'm just I'm closing just got a couple more quotes you know you know when we talk you know when you talk to kids today they think cell phones were around forever they think Blackberry was like they were born with a Blackberry or an iPhone they don't they don't know what it is to not be able to walk further than the court will let you reach on the phone I remember you know you remember the officers with like a you know thousand foot cord because the the boss had to walk all over the office and the things you know in the Dow one where you went you know if you you had to go 9 you and then [Music] you and if you were down what's like memory and resetting and that's how the kids are growing up they think well I can't live with o web it's more important than running water bathrooms it's a spirit it's a devil that's why they walk in front of semis and walk out in front of cars and that's why you can't drive on your phone and amen CU people it's not just an addiction it's a demon when you're willing to die for Satan you're caught in a spider webon amen what do we see TV he said you can't pick up a newspaper but anything that you see is is spread with females he said pretty women in whiskey and packages and magazines and s in more clothes on TV and everything and the some of the sexy women dress pretty women and we find out that it's on cigarette packages also I wonder what do you think if he seen the internet pornography now die would probably be an example yes clean out the cupboard and clean out this house oh we have to have a good oldfashioned house cleaning let's have the blood applied and then the token will come back in and clean it out and sanctify it amen God help us God help us in this age that Satan has come in like a flood God's raising up a standard against him and if we can use the web you know you you have your own Holy Spirit you'll work out your own salvation with fear and troubling if we can use the web for the glory of God but you know the Bible says that Idle Hands are the work tool of the devil so I got nothing to do it's a rainy day I think I'll go on I think I'll go on uhhuh and the devil says well Hallelujah I sent the rain and now I'm going to show them I don't care if it's uh-huh never before we need to be careful and we need to be careful that we're not justifying our addiction let's amen if you want to study a message and you're a preacher and you need the message The Hub amen I'm sure it'll bring glory to God but if you just want entertainment and you're flirting with Devils amen God help us not to justify what God don't ever intend for us to be a part of amen God help us let's stand when would it be safe to give your kids or your grandkids an iPhone whenever you want them to lose they innocency that's that's worldly people know that because see sometimes worldly people they just are not deceived they're not trying to live something that you are and so you see Christians they say wow you know we got it under control as if you can barter with the devil but worldly people just say well we know we're losing that's the truth amen God help us and let's let's be like the brother amen Let's Help us think of the brother that was going to church twice on the Saturday because Satan was attacking the young kids we have this very church has multiple young kids I can't mean 13 12 9 they need God they need the power of God and what they don't need is a message on the web they don't even need that kind of a message from the web of God you know when I ministered in Ottawa and I I closing with this it's just I I you know I didn't choose to preach this and I have the web but you know you can live without the web you know there's people that attend this church that don't have the web or their internet in their house or on a single phone that him or his wife had and they they actually look quite normal they're not like mentally disfigured or physically mentally handicapped they actually walk like upright and everything amen there's things that we can't survive without amen but our our all of us we need a refilling but our kids need the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh sorry I started to say when I preached down there you know brother Brown said multiple times you know you know when Stephen was stoned it wasn't his and and Stephen was an amazing preacher but it wasn't his preaching that saved Saul it was him being stoned and when Jesus came before Pilate it wasn't his amazing preaching in the countryside that one pilate and his wife and his wife said don't have nothing to do with this man because the Bible says they were astonished and it wasn't by how much they went on the web and knew they were astonished by his silence you know it took more power for him to be silent than to speak the Bible says that he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the world and said them free it's like and you know I I I took my references from the church and its condition and let your light shine and brother Braham said in those two messages multiple times he said God don't need you to defend him and God don't need your preaching to save the world he needs your life and I I use this example and and there was many different ones came to me after I said this message has been come like Peter defending Jesus we got a message sword and we're cutting off everybody's ear look out we're going to the message Church we're going to lose an ear and Jesus Took the very year of the man that came to kill him and put it up and went but Jesus was or but Peter was helping Jesus and you know how Jesus told Peter to help him put away your sword put away your web put away your tool of the devil I don't I don't he said and let let your light so shine he said 'I don't need advertisements we say we're on the web because we're spreading the message that's a lie our Prophet said he would never use mechanical device and he said he's not use he don't need advertisement he said he don't need your salesmanship it's the exact quote of the Prophet let you say he said he don't need my good preaching to convert you and he said about 15 times he said I'd rather you shut up and live the life instead of preach it so we can never justify the web okay oh I'm preaching on the web praise God I'm showing them the truth on the web praise God he don't even need people behind the pulpit to preach unless they got the life to back it up amen see God dealt with more people in silence than he did with noise amen you think of it silence Stone silence Stephen being Stone Jesus silence multiple people like that silence and it was a power and the people that were affected by that stone silence they couldn't get away from there was the loudest s silence you've ever heard I pray that all that'll hear it will consider just consider amen at least consider at least recognize that Satan is no competition for you amen amen God help us God help us God bless you it's good to good to be together and and pray for the our loved ones that are out they're they're they're being blessed too and and we love them and they'll we'll come back together soon amen what are you singing honey right turn your eyes [Music] [Music] his glory and praise [Music] GL [Music] [Music] glor am he viewed me in garments as white as a sun for the Lamb of God is worthy and he wash me this I know oh when he sees me he sees the blood of the land he sees me and is worthy and not as I am he VI me G as white as the snow for the Lamb of God is worthy and he was me this I know Hallelujah I want to just leave you a a a quote before we sing Our Last Song song yes I know I can make it f brother Bram said that if all the Christians I'm going to say message Believers alive professed to be message Believers had the Life of Christ the world would be converted in 24 hours I sold that to Ottawa I said it's quite clear that we're failing oh yeah it's quite clear we're failing oh yeah and it ain't because we got a Bak mouth and it ain't because we're not using the web to witness to the world we ain't got the Life of Christ amen and that's impossible if you came from him because the only way to have eternal life is you always had it ouch ouch amen yes I know that I can make it Jesus put it in my way to reach that New Jerusalem each step is a thrill and the the devil Wars against me and tries to hinder my clim I See the Light there in the distance it's just a matter of time oh yes I know that I can make it Jesus put it in my will to reach that new Jerusalem he through through the devil was against me and tries to hinder my clim I see the lights there in the distance it's just a matter of God bless you
