name amen it's so good to be here in Fellowship this morning and amen without delay we we just want to get into the word of the Lord and just bring your greetings from from my heart and the the mission here has been accomplished you know and this just this trip is just different I've been in a lot of mission trips before but this is different I you know as brother Dale was saying he and sister Luen was saying why isn't he not coming we spoke on the phone and I just couldn't come until the Lord says go amen hallelujah and so I'm here the right time for the right season I'm the fellowship with the different brothers and sisters in their homes was just overwhelming you know you know we share the word we we we had church last night amen at at the believer's home that was uh brother Bernard right good and sister rot home and you know brother Joseph and his wife came in and oh we had we sung We sung we had and it was wonderful you know we were at the all the Believers home and boy they can you can certainly cook you know I can tell you that I never I never miss a thing you know since I'm here but you know I asked the sisters I think we were at sister Sher oh brother brother Carson's house and I was saying you know was it mandatory for for you people here to learn to cook cuz every home I go I tell you great ESS is place there you know and so it's wonderful though when you can go and there is no barriers you know I never felt any form of uh wrong Spirit everybody just welcome us and we met different persons go to their homes and I trust the Lord if the Lord permits that I will come back and I'll be able to go to more people it all it is always good with us sometime we just meet a church and we just have service but when you meet people in their homes and the spirit you know be around them more brother Braham says sometime you just need to be in a person's presence for five minutes and you know who they are you know and that's wonderful wonderful you know the the the brother John that was here in the service all I just had great fellowship with him and many of you know you for the first time on Earth but there our DNA is the same our DNA is the same brother James reminded Us in James 1:18 we'll be begotten by the word of Truth and so I love God I I I deliver the word because I love God I Don't Preach because I'm a preacher I love God I believe it I really believe it hallelujah amen I love the Lord I believe it and I love God's people that's why I'm here we so we're going to go into the word in a simple thought if the Lord permits us amen and just trust God you know for for his leading Saints and you know quite a few I'm glad that you made it the service available for the Saints back home and I'm glad you didn't send some of them links this morning people have a tendency because they can stain their pajamas and stretch out in the sofa press the button and watch the service it's so convenient so last week a few of them back home because brother Junior sent them hurle the link and so I learned that quite a few said to me some of them said to me in the afternoon oh Pastor the service was so wonderful I was like how did you get time to watch that you're supposed to be in church but they said some couldn't make it at a home church but they were here here online you know and so I love when people be in service the online is available yes but I love when people come to it's just a different atmosphere that's right praise be to God and so let's just pray father we thank you God for this great day wonderful day of the feast Lord I pray God as we come Lord not just to see each other you know not just to Lord uh just come because we have nothing else to do but a great time today Lord that we come to Feast upon Thy word and Lord we're hungry all the times we're always hungry for more more of you father more of you Lord and whenever we come with such hunger and thirst we know there is always a blessing and father we're under expectation the prophet reminded us he said whatever we expect that's what we get and father we're under expectation for more of you Lord even one word god from this uh from today Lord will resonate in our heart to make us be better persons better Christians to walk straight in the word of God Lord that our faith will be stronger our confidence will increase Lord father I thank you today Lord and even this vessel Lord oh God that you have chosen to work through to manifest lord it's not me it's not my own ideas Lord I pray that my own ideas will just go straight through the doors but may your word may your thoughts God come forth Lord and reach the hearts and The Souls of your people in the name of Jesus Lord thank you for a pastor Lord and the ministers here in his family and oh God may you continue to bless them Lord Jesus continue Lord to lead them in the right path uh you promise Lord that you will order the footsteps of the righteous we're standing upon your promise and you never f fail you're not a man that you should lie Lord God you are our Lord you are the Savior the king you're everything to us Lord oh God and the few minutes that we can come together it's not even enough Lord to give you praise it's not enough time to praise you but I know Lord you appreciate and you accept the few minutes that we can spend together in Fellowship thank you Lord in Jesus name amen let's look at First Kings chapter 17 and it's not a Bible story and you know we thank God that we have reached the dimension in which we don't look up the word of God as Bible stories but it's the word of God Amen and so forth and you know it's great and praise i' I've learned a lot since I'm here and never too hold to learn man I went to the H I went to the Haw Friday all at first I'm seeing it the auction and the oh it was it was awesome good good experience mean they I I rais goats and I was at I I was brought to the goat farm and when I sent back pictures to the brothers and goat business I say oh we don't start yet you know I mean I'm excited to go home to apply some of the things that I learned First Kings chapter 17 and I I'm going to read one uh one verse and you know CU you'll be sitting all the time and I'll be doing all the standing so you can just bear with me right you're all right I like I like the spirit brother B said when I look on your faces I see Christ that tells me to know that you're feeding on the word glory to God and verse 12 cuz we all know what happened before but I'll be taking a few verses from there verse 12 and she said and as the Lord God thy as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a Cru and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and Elijah said unto her fear not but go and do as thou has said but make me therefore a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son that's a great challenge isn't it oh God but he didn't stop for thus sayi the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fail until the day that the Lord send that rain upon the Earth may the Lord bless the word you be seated really appreciate though the Holy Spirit has brought us from Friday night you know in in the line and the songs and the special were so in line in harmony with the Holy Spirit you know and the we we we we love of God just manifested himself over the weekend Wednesday night was wonderful you know and it's not just about as I it's not just about preaching but to see the direction in which the holy spirit is pushing us and or directing Us in his word and uh you know as preachers or ministers you know we we we we have come to the level and understanding that it's not about just putting a few notes together and as long as I have enough time I got to lay it out whether the people are feeding or not but you know your hunger determines on how well you're fed and so we never know everything you know I used to have persons come around and I'm preaching in my church and at the end of it one would come over say you know they know so much and oh Pastor you didn't finish preach I said no man can finish preach you know I I don't want to know a preacher that always finish preach cuz you know because maybe the very minute you leave amen the church something more comes that's how God is something more comes and you said Lord you know why didn't I why didn't you tell me that while I was on the pulpit well I didn't want you to say it at that time sir and so we never finish preaching you know I used to a person say well why didn't you go in that direction and go in that direction and I would have said well because I never came to a seminary you know I was staying there and studying the Holy Spirit you what to say so if I didn't say a few words that you thought that I should have said praise be to God we're still in harmony because God spoke to you too amen the right s and I'm sure as I stand up here that I'm not going to say one thing that you never know because it's always in the word of God Amen you heard it you know it your pastor preach it amen some of the people sing it it's all in the word of God so there is nothing new Under The Sun It's just that this season the Lord says a pastor from Jamaica is coming and he's is going to see a few words amen and he'll be standing here before you so it's not you it's me that God is going to use in this little season amen praise be to God and so amen uh we can look at a thought from me here but just to re backtrack a little bit this is God's Divine Prophet Elijah and just to know and understand that season changes and need to understand that when the season change we need to recognize amen what season amen that we him that's right Hallelujah because if you don't know you remember the word of God told the people haia 46 When God says my people are destroyed because of lack of knowledge we need to know one time the prophet said amen it make no sense amen plunging at long into something that you don't even know where you're going amen faith is good a leap of faith but you ought to have knowledge of where you are and what you're about we are on a journey amen we are on a journey and when I left from Brother Dale's place and he said we're going to Wyoming I am watching every signs I'm reading the signs and the the directions sometime he take this root and then I'm confused and I reach home then another time he take this back road but I reach home and I was that where is he going and I'm at the house he knows the place is that right I don't know it but I'm watching the signs and reading the signs because I'm going in a direction amen so we understand something here that you know just before Elijah came to zerat where this wiow was God commanded him to go to Brick Sheriff because I have commanded amen the Ravens to feed you there glory to God I have commanded amen notice something we ought to be careful now amen that sometimes we are waiting for God to tell us the end of the road come on now before we can move there is no deep of faith when Elijah said to Ahab no rain or due shall fall until I said so amen he never knew where he was going before he said that Hallelujah is that right but then God shall you need to get up and go to Sher I have commanded the Wither I have commanded the Ravens to feed you after a period of time uh amen God Shifting the season Hallelujah God Shifting the season shifting amen the location Hallelujah when God said now amen leave Brook sh yes that's right now how could God send him at Brook sherid and allow the brook to dry up come on God was shifting Hallelujah the season woo Hallelujah glory to God God was Shifting the season now the command to the widow woman was different God said I command The Raven to feed feed no connection Hallelujah no relation glory to God is that right but I have commanded the widow woman to sustain you so the seeds are shifted from feeding tenant can I get some amen hallelujah glory to God now Elijah if Elijah had remained at book shered amen he would have he would have stared to death because the light moves where the word is that's where the light is shining can I preach this man where the word is that's where the light is shining so God says the light amen the sustainance is at Brook is at zarapa you need to go so the word is light and the light is the word hallelujah Christ is the light the light is the spirit and the spirit is the light and the word is the light so the purpose of the light is to illuminate to show you where you're going to show you who you are Hallelujah glory to God now remember the light is the Lord St John tells you that the Lord is that light and the word says in 2 Corinthians 3:17 the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is glory to God where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen Liberty what is liberty liberty is the state of being free from oppressive restrictions it may oh Hallelujah imposed by Authority or one's way of life it's the power to do as you please we are liberated we are a people of Liberty we are free oh Hallelujah glory to God where the spirit of the Lord is where is it it makes me free free at last thank God Almighty I've got the spirit and free the thought today is thus say the Lord let's look in the thought thus say the Lord glory to God it's an expression used in the Bible over 400 times it means an expression of oath a solemn promise given from a Divine witness thus say the Lord thus that's a powerful expression it doesn't mean that but then listen this can I read a quote brother Brandon said in 1962 the message spoken word The Original Seed he said here is the secret he never said here is a secret two words you have a and you have the if I said there is a white car at the back in the parking lot you go look for any car it could have been anyone but when I said there is a oh when I said there is the white core with the license plates XYZ you go looking for a direct vehicle it's direct so the prophet says here is the secret you ready for it I want to hear the secret I'm excited about hearing what I have Hallelujah the word the secret is the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she has the mind of Christ she has the word of Christ amen and she knows what he wants done with the word so the word is not just about having a appear but it's about putting the word in action what he once done with the word let me go further but she done she does it in his name his name she has thus seek the Lord woo God hallelujah can I say this she has what Elijah had oh god oh bless God she has thus say the Lord oh Hallelujah then it is gerti so glory to God so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and serve its purpose I don't believe he meant that we walk around the church and we see a flowers thus shap the Lord flowers bloom thus shap the Lord do that practicing this thing no she has the word now this is where maturity comes in this is where a adoption comes in Hallelujah glory to God oh hallelujah amen brother did you wouldn't trust your baby grand son with your car keys he's still your son he's your bloodline but he's not yet mature but you throw it to Jared and you said go drive on the road do that that why because he's mature and he has the credentials to drive she has the holy spirit that will Jour TI that word amen that is on her inside and Patiently by faith she waits until the RO that that word is grown and the more it grows it's coming out to fulfill the purpose of God oh Hallelujah glory to God what a secret she has that secret now notice here saints of God that in verse in the same chapter in verse 13 but just back up a little bit at verse 12 very interesting I love all my God works you cannot program my God God like to do things sometime to shift some of our minds and God said to him let's go down and we got a little bit more time he said and the verse eight and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise and get you to zerat is the word zerat mean refining it means in refining glory to God just be it in mind hold it one part of your mind now according to geography zapat was about uh between 85 to 95 miles north way up so he didn't just jump from one door to the next he had to travel and according to the Eastern traveling they would have traveled on foot 19 miles per day that's a Day's Journey you know they measur day Journey or a Sabbath Day's Journey which was quarter of 3/4 of a mile a day Journey 19 miles on foot and then they rest but they would travel by the moons you know that glory to God but if they were traveling on horses or camel they do 21 miles and then they rest so think about you do the match the miles the miles and so amen it was a challenge woo Hallelujah it was a challenge come on Believers we're the bride of Christ we're not supposed to go to challenge challenges yes we are predestinated to be Amen to be the children of adoption but we will encounter challenges I have commanded a widow woman to sustain the and think about it hallelujah amen sh and you wonder a widow woman who had nothing she had nothing God don't make mistakes they were you know can I say this and I feel so good now this was not just about Elijah this was this was about the wiow woman oh Hallelujah this was about the the village that they were living into when God is working Amen in your season in your environment brothers and sisters it's not just about you it's about the widow woman down the road it's about the man that cannot walk it's about the community you are the light of of the world not just in your church but let your light so shine for who all men you're a light on the hill cannot be hid Shifting the Seas is not about your own business it's God's purpose has to manifest amen hallelujah glory to God amen woo glory and you know think about it when he said you know met her and she received the anointing long time it's not that God Amen spoke to her lip to hear but she receive an anointing Amen in the season anointing amen that when the anointing hits you cannot but fall in line with the word of God hallelujah you want what hits you it's God's commanding the force from Heaven amen released from the Throne of Heaven Hallelujah one day when the voice of God Amen was sweeping uh I never knew nothing about a prophet or no Elijah knew the Bible but when the time of season came when my sh Jesus came and that anointing released from the Throne of Heaven I could not resist this [Applause] message Oh Glory woo Hallelujah you're a wonder why just come and pick you up you have 50 people in your family and you just walking out where you going I believe a message why you leaving it oh grandpa of believe it and just you alone coming out believ in the message there was a command released from the Throne of Heaven hit you bam so why wo Hallelujah if and then you know what the beauty about the the command is that if the whole world leaves you are still there is that right when the whole word stop believing it if the whole world fing Falls OH the prophet Li the prophet was here he wasn't here but you are you're still going on something hits you oh hallelujah oh my if the whole world Stop Believing the word you are still believing [Applause] it here he said fetch me a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was leaving he said bring me a piece of bread in your hand God knew she never had the bread is that right but God sent him there anyway and I appreciate her honesty she said sir let me be honest with you I only have one meal left probably it's not enough but it's me and my son and you know the the faming in the region was so great all right poor because she was a widow so we know that after this we're going to die so this is what we have oh hallelujah it's over but the beauty about verse 13 I like what he said and Elijah said unto her verse 13 fear not fear not he shifted her mind to Amen to a more amen her mind to open to a wider capacity you remember what the brothers and amen at G beautiful did Peter and John the word of God said they were going up at what the 9th hour which was like 3 to 3 to 6:00 p.m. that was the last hour for prayor they never said to the man stretch out your arm they never said bow your head let's pray Oh Glory to God they never said try to kneel down L's lay hands on you they shifted his mind look at us Shifting the mind and Elijah shifted her mind glory to God because in there she was looking at the Hopeless case a a hopeless case it's over sir I'm being honest we know what this is just what we had oh Hallelujah we don't if have drinks but this is it we're going to die hopeless it's over she was looking that debt at the end of the road and Elijah shifted mind fear not this is interesting now fear not stop being afraid relax oh hallelujah oh glory to God relax fear not what did he do when he when he opened his mouth he bring he brought the power Amen to Earth understanding when he shifted her mind he said thus said the Lord God you never stopped there but we know he's a god of the universe we know it but he shifted her mind to her own language what he said thus say the Lord God of Israel Glory she never heard Elijah before she never met Elijah before but she knew of the god of Israel she knew Abram's God she knew the god of her fathers oh Hallelujah she knew the writings of the prophets here oh Israel the Lord your God is one Lord is that right she knew that she was able that was her language the God of Israel oh within the language she could understand she was able to be connected with that language he's speaking my language hallelujah amen I'm able to understand now praise be to God when he said the god of Israel thus save the Lord H amen your Barrow will never be empty your cruise oil will never fail and it happened glory to God it happened as it was said wo God brought me back brothers and sisters and when I understand how a language is important in worshiping communicating oh Hallelujah we have many dialects is that right oh God is that right amen many dialects millions of dialects but they prove that 6,500 languages in the whole world scientist says but we have many dialects but the language in which we speak in the spirit there is a Heavenly [Applause] language Oh Glory to God when Jesus said to those Church religious people I'm speaking to you now when you don't understand if I speak the Heavenly language how will you understand it you see what I'm preaching now you're saying amen don't it because you're able to understand me is that right I may go to another church and I'm preaching this you're wonder where in the world is he come from what is he saying about the sh the Lord and you know why is he saying prophet and you know the it's a language Hallelujah glory to God I'm preaching and one over here may wiping tears because the holy spirit is taking that word and go and and placing that word in the spiritual womb while a n over here is laughing why they can't help it why because they're not able to communicate from that level here's a language barrier there Lord God when I speak the revelated word you can say Amen because you understand my language Oh Glory to God it brought me back and the worship around the throne and this is important for us you remember I said to us that worship is more than just singing a few songs more than just sing it because we like it and it sounds good worship is about Revelation true worship comes through Revelation Hallelujah worship the father in spirit and in truth that's who he wants to worship him oh the true worshippers Oh Glory but around the throne when John was caught up in another dimension come up here re gation 4 9-11 John said I saw four beasts around the throne and he described the Beast that he saw and I saw 24 Elders around the throne too and oh the the atmosphere was so awesome beyond my own comprehension my my my tongue cannot express the glory that was around the throne is that right but the words were important to me as they said the holy holy holy Lord God Almighty amen he that was and is to come amen he that was and he that is to come so notice Hallelujah John amen he was just still there silent even though he saw in the vision what was go what was taking place he heard the words but he was silent why I say that do we know that even from the Wilderness when God had Israel in the wilderness he was training them to be one as a nation Israel worshiping a what you call a collaborative effort and it would produce a collaborative energy that will bring down the glory of God Amen that was wondess why God would said to Moses put the hark in the middle is it right in the center oh four tribes here four tribes there and all the tribes are right around amen the Tabernacle and a certain hour of the day the priest would blow the trumpet and all the host of Israel had to turn their Direction turn their gaze Amen in One Direction and all the house of Israel would bow down at the same time and they would say the same words hallelujah what is that that's Oneness has a Nation Oh My but whenever Lord Jesus came amen he had to show them what true Oneness was they have the writings of Moses they have the scriptures that Jesus said in John 5:39 search the scriptures for in it you find you think you have eternal life if you had believed Moses you would not believe me amen but he showed them true Oneness Glory when he said in John 14 when you see me you said the father Hallelujah they had the writings of the prophets amen but they were not one with God that's right there were Million Miles Away From God we can have the writings and we are far from God hello you heard me change we can be down here practicing a group of principles we have pile of books and we are a million miles from Jehovah God we can have a relationship with this building and no relationship with [Applause] God I have seen the bigger the building is more Pride fill the people yes sir they have so much pride in the big buildings our Orchestra is so laid out our music is so together and there is no God there is no relationship with God and yet there's a big label at the front message Church on nothing but a label Jesus showed him when you see me you said the father I am in the father I'm the father in me in that room together with elect when he lift up his eyes to the father I at John 17 now verse 22- 23 Jesus said father the glory that you gave me I have given them may be what one as we are oh Hallelujah one as we are he's that right what a relationship still what the god remember the prophet says the harmony with Christ Jesus and his father was so perfect when you see him you see the father and then Jesus says further on he said in that same John 17:23 he said I am in you father and you are in me and I am in them so that they may be perfected in one that's where a Perfection comes in Oneness with God hallelujah so when you see me you stop seeing brother Bartley but you are seen a Son of God walking on the heart glory to God and if you ask me my blood type uh I can quickly say it my blood type is the word of God hallelujah glory to God you ask me where I come from what nationality are you I should look further and if you stay long enough in my presence I will pray for you and to God open his eyes oh Hallelujah that he may see oh God elishah had to do that one time to his servants he said Lord open his eyes may let he may see you can be in the presence of a prophet and you cannot see a thing that's right oh yeah W God am I preaching s he was a servant of Elisha when the armies of the Assyrians surround the camp you remember that and he went out and look he said oh Elisha we're dead now we're dead meet it's over Elisha just quiet you go up Elisha said Lord open his eyes Hallelujah woo Hallelujah think about iten you are carrying the amen you are carrying the star from the water container with a prophit but there is another dimension that you never enter and when his eyes were open he said wow God I see this amen the host of Heaven glory to God the Chariots of Fire the whole of Heaven oh he that is with us is more than them all he needed was a high hoping glory to God hallelujah woo God I like that my God Amen yes thus said the Lord glory to God as I said to about Revelation amen going down here oh and John couldn't join in the worship amen the thing about worship you're able to be identified with what you say you're able to be identified to what you what you understand amen glory cuz some of us sometime there are some songs that the WR to sng a 100 years ago and it was their experience they sung about and here you are you don't have no clue of that experience and you're trying to sing the same song Maybe twisting it and putting into the way but why under that anointing the writer wrote that and you are in a different anointing oh hallelujah oh glory to God and brother John was not able to join in that worship amen being a Jew he wasn't able to join in amen re but when Revelation 5 amen open before him amen and the one sitting on the throne the book still closed no man was able to open oh John amen start to weep hallelujah oh God it showed up the way to the Tree of Life uh was guarded uh amen by a cherubim is that right that's what the word says with a flaming sword but further on Amen the scene would change the Seas would change as one held to touch John weep not John look further the llelujah the lamb came and took the book out at the right hand of him that sat upon the throne Hallelujah the way maker came and manifest the great mystery of almighty God he came and manifested Redemption he came by his own blood H woo Hallelujah Revelation 5 ver9 to 12 amen the amen the worship changed John's reaction changed Hallelujah and they s a new song they sng a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book th are worthy H for you have redeem us out of what every Kindred by thy own blood out of every Kindred uh and tongue and Nations and people oh hallelujah oh God what what a Redemption Song what a what a great moment has they shung the new song Oh Brother John being an hurtling he was caught up in that Dimension but he was still a hurtling Hallelujah verse 13 John joined the worship because he was able to be identified Hallelujah with the dimension he was able to identify I with the language of redemption oh he worshiped all in heaven heard me and all un H hurt me all under the all the dimensions John said they heard me woo glory to God hallelujah amen when the anointing of redemption becomes real to us when you scream and shout they may say shut up but no one knows what you're experien it because Redemption is not written it's not written for us to recite it you'll find that in Revelation 14 Hallelujah only the 144,000 were able to learn that song because it's not written it's an experience Hallelujah if I could read or read my deliverance from a page Satan can read the same thing too Hallelujah glory is that right Saints how are you saved because the prophet said so have you received the Holy Ghost yes the prophet said so after 400 years you have not yet F the power of God in your life because you're trying to read your Redemption oh hallelujah it's not written woo God is personal brother John was able to keep the word that Jesus said to him when Jesus said to them he said continue in my word and you shall be my disciples indeed John chapter 8:31 and and you shall know the truth and the truth will make you free such Freedom was expressed on the day of Pentecost hallelujah how important it is for us to understand the word and to know what the prophet says you have the secret of God you have the word of almighty God you have the mind of almighty God Hallelujah but it has to come amen with understanding it have to come that's why the words said John go and take that book and eat it eat the book doesn't mean physical it mean to receive and consume with understanding glory to God thank God Hallelujah we can hear the word of God because we understand it we are at Zera fo the place of refining The Trials Come pushing us further the testings come pushing us further this is called the refining process amen we being brought not on M Carmel anymore amen woo hallelujah we're not even on mountman because M Mount Transfiguration took place on Mount irman Hallelujah but we're on Mount Rapture show down oh glory to God when you got that said the Lord there's a confidence that comes in there and closing there's a confidence that comes in there when he got done said the Lord is that right you remember when Jesus said to the disciples in John chapter 8:51 when he said he that keepeth my word shall not see death a strong statement there a strong statement he that keep my word you keep my word shall never see that that's what he said I believe Jesus is that right that's a strong word very strong word wow that's strong is that right look up that word keep it's a powerful word Jesus used that to had them God used that to hadam the Garden keep Jesus said to you you need to keep my word now there because there was a big difference when Jesus came between the scriptures and the his word you remember he shift the dimension you said to them in John chapter 5:39 you said search the scriptures he always Point them to the scriptures then he say if you keep my word the word word there in the Greek is Rema r h e m a which mean that which utters from a living being amen glory to God that's what he says keep my word my command a new commandment I give you but they could not they could not shift from that dimension of the letter and received the Living Word the word that was coming from a living being glory to God hallelujah so Jesus said if you keep my word now know the Sint of God he said you will never see that you got to understand the understanding and the meaning of the word of God that's important what we have today the revelated word of God yet the disciples according to the history everyone were they were all murdered except one brother John he died a natural death amen glory to God but what we have today what we have we have thus said the Lord y'all believe that we have we have th said the Lord we have the mind of Christ we have all of God the prophet W us he said it's not in a measure he said we have all the fullness of [Applause] God Jesus had a public Ministry yes from St John chapter one after John explained who he was then he went into his ministry and his public Ministry stopped at St John 12:50 and he started John Chapter 13 told you he was in the room with his Those whom he loved and he loved them unto the end it's a different level now he went intimate so you remember in that room Jesus said a few things that were a little confused a little while you will not see me but a little while you will see me a little while you won't see me but a little while you will see me you remember when you said to them I go to prepare a place for you and I'm coming back to receive you unto myself you shall know the way I am the way Hallelujah do you know the prophet said he said I don't believe that there is a building out there that you're going to go when Christ prepared that place that he prepared was a a body a [Applause] body Oh Glory to God in John 16 Jesus said the Bible said they were a little confused because he said something to them he said I've got much to say to you but you can't handle it now but when he the comforter come is going to bring all things back to you that I taught you but further on the Bible says when he keep saying that a little while I will not see you and then a little while you're going to see me again and they were like among themselves but Jesus knew their thoughts and one of them they were free to ask him you know M then Jesus said I know what's on your mind you're wonder why I'm saying a li while and he didn't explain it he said look here this is like about a woman above about to give birth she Sorrows now but when the amen the life comes forth in my words you don't mind but when the life comes forth that joy that joy that comes with that life no man can take it away he said you sorrow now Hallelujah but when uh that when you receive that Joy when you see me again that Joy woo Hallelujah no man can take it away from you glory to God what was that Joy when they were in that room and the resurrected Christ uh stepped through that wall amen when he reveal himself to them in that resurrected glorified man the Bible said they Rejoice Hallelujah they Rejoice brothers and sisters as this word uh burst into your spiritual womb uh transform you from death to life uh you know you have the mind of Christ you sing that you are Resurrection you are the life hallelujah hallelujah oh God when that Joy bursts in your soul and you can dance and Shout nothing can separate you from that love amen no Heights nor lows uh no debts no principalities uh no powers no hen can separate you from that love that brought about that Joy when you enter that resurrected realm you do like Andrew did is shows that while you remember when Andrew's mother went to Jesus and said can you promise me something that when you go to your father make sure two tones one on the left one on the right for my two boys any good mother would want that I think I preached it on one Mother's Day I said come on she says okay to be a little selfish because you want the best place in heaven for your two boys Jesus say hey actually there a strong Quest but I hope they can drink from the same cup that I'll be drinking from Hallelujah and Thomas resonated in his heart and history shows that they made a cross for Thomas CU he was hanging the cross and the shows that as he was going to it it says that Thomas saluted the cross because he knew that that was just the beginning of his transition they said Andrew sorry andw they said Andrew saluted the cross he said have waited for this long time oh Hallelujah glory to God because he knew as he drink that cup he'll be right in the presence of almighty God woo glory to God what shall separate you from that joy I love to see Christ Christians walk with that Joy the prophet say you know he says if you worry and not fear your testimony is false so here I am preaching today about Fai of God and this week of fa of God something just Dro in my mind that it's not a Doctrine and hear I'm preaching and jumping and
