eels yeah it was real blessing it's good to be home though let's go to the scripture shall we I mean it's good to have brother Andy back god bless you we go to the Book of Luke chapter 12 we're gonna read one verse Luke 12 and verse 43 is blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing and the question is doing what oh let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer if you want to be remembered a priest want to raise your hands to the Lord gracious father Lord we just so thankful we can gather one more time in your presence dear God to worship you and we want to reverently and and sincerely come before you this night Lord asking that you would meet every need Lord you speak to every heart father Lord that you would mold us and shape us to be more like you and

to commit the service into your hands Lord be with all those as well who couldn't make it and Father touch those who are sick Lord and father make us well feel glory in Jesus Christ's name thought I Lord we ask these things amen they may God bless your friends you may have your seats tonight and yes I want to I heard quite a few months ago heard by the Aaron McGarry preached a a youth camp and he went into the development of the brain and this is probably kind of bit strange but you know we don't understand ourselves growing up our own bodies are a mystery we go through great changes of life and you know we don't understand yeah we go but crazy it seems but there's a reason for it and because but your thing is if we can understand what's going on in us because we're born into chaos this world is chaotic human life is chaotic you know but we're not meant to stay in chaos yeah we're not meant to just flow with the tide and the devil does what he wants we're not called to be that way so the Lord your the wonderful thing about the word is that brings clarity and so as I as I posed the question just from that verse you know Lester does that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing and I asked the question while doing what you know because everyone is is busy doing something but what are we doing you know and it's very easy to say well we're following the Lord we're raising our families and it can sound a bit vague in a bit kind of broad but we want to go more than just broad you know we want to come down to really where the rubber hits the road and we want to really say well what does it mean to be raised as a Christian what does it mean to raise children in the message you know what does that mean because it sounds very easy to say while I'm raising my children they're going to serve the Lord and raise up a child in the way it shall go and when it's older shall not depart and that is true but the thing is if you you know and I'll come to it later but this whole society is engineered to break relationships the first world is made to break relationships and we're not in the midst of it happening it's happened you know we are you know it's not all the world yars listening to brother Aaron preached the world is falling apart and I could say the world has fallen apart you know we're not living in a day like in his day where the world was an order to a degree then it fell apart we're living in the time which is broken so it sees in Ephesians if you want to turn with me to Ephesians chapter 4 and we're gonna read from from from verse 6 I'm just going to just just follow me this is this is for everyone I believe because not just children turning into adults is a great change it's when adults had about 40 and there's a big change in life as well and you know there's challenges that come you know there's always we're gonna be happy when these bodies are changed we're gonna be relieved praise the Lord owner to put up with that guy one more day we have overcoming power but we have to overcome so Ephesians 4 and verse 6 it says here one God and Father of all who is above all and through all in a new all but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now now that he ascended what is it but he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that has seen it as the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ now we know that word perfecting is a maturing it's a completion it doesn't mean perfection a sinless profession because the blood of Jesus Christ prefix us but speaks about a maturity coming to a completion it's something that is growing I mean till we all come to the unity of the faith in the end of the knowledge of the Son of God and to a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children so we're going to spiritually go from being children to adults right tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ for whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself and love this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that he hits forth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind so we're not called the war for coin to our mind okay the vanity of our mouth a vain thing is empty it has no substance there's nothing real to it it's just just you know something that's not real but the word is real right so we're called to walk not as other Gentiles not as other people because they walk according to the vanity of their mind this world is full of vanity vain things that are empty men have these break great pursuits they try and become these great big things but when you come down to the bottom of it there's nothing to it right it's just like you know this world and and you know I'll just say it now this world that we perceive on the internet is not a real world it is through a filter it's through Photoshop there's things called deep fakes where people take faces of people and put it on others and videos trying to make people be doing things that they're not who's aware of those things yes it's not just Photoshop with photos but now it's video and they can make people say things and do things that they never did but it can look so real what's happening it's it's the world as putting a fake reality in front of us and that fake reality is never like reality so therefore the thing that you behold you want to come but you can't become it so what happens people become depressed because they can never obtain what they see Alou you I mean but with the Lord it's not that way it's the opposite I mean because what God calls great man calls foolish what man calls foolish God calls great amen so we want to we don't want to live in a false reality we want to live in reality in the Word of God amen that's why we have to have a sane sensible walk built on faith Amen we are not going to go on a rapture and a great feeling of euphoria it's faith and faith is a revelation and what that means is it's not a hope so it's like I find you that awaited me in my house was a know a billion trillion dollars and it was told me that it was going to be there I wouldn't hope I knew it was there right even though I haven't seen it but I know it's there and faithless things been revealed to you like if you if the Lord told you that you're healed you don't need to worry anymore you know it's going to happen right you're not striving maybe one day and I've got to work out how it's going to happen you know it's going to happen and you're resting in there it's faith I mean just like if you're if it's revealed to you your children are yours they're going in the rapture you can just rejoice a thank you Lord because you're not hoping Lord save them you know they're saved even though you may not ever may not at that current time see it manifested you have a rest knowing that they will come to salvation and you can be strong and confident saying thank you Lord it is going to happen I mean just like Abraham he knew Isaac was coming he wasn't hoping he knew why it was faith amen no having the understanding darkened being alienated a lien ated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being who being past feeling having given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness greediness now we read there that a child that we're to grow from a child to an adult I was going to speak about the mark of a mature Christian or maybe I'll start on that vein maybe this will be a foundation I don't know but you know we're called that we're no longer tossed to and fro and you see a and I want to take the natural development of a person and parallel with the spiritual because you know I can take my own upbringing I wanted to be a cricketer then I wanted to be in America's Cup then I wanted to make computer games they don't want it to you know I want to do all different kinds of things was being tossed to and fro something was put in front of me all I want it now this is fun for me now I want to be this and oh and I read something I want to do this why I'm being tossed to and fro I mean and and and that's what it's like being a child in the Lord you can be tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine why because there's part of you that's not fully developed now the brain maybe I'll say this so the definition of maturity it's a quality or state of being mature especially a full development and that's that's that's one of the definitions now I want to speak about how the brain develops because you know then take it into the spiritual because because you know we know wisdom doesn't come with age even though it should Jobe speaks about it people can be old but they can be unwise right but what happens really is that this world is engineered that especially men do not become men the same thing with women too but but this whole society is engineered that men physically become men but and their maturity and their emotional state and their thinking they're not men they're still boys the whole world has engineered this way and so that and the reason is because the devil knows how we work he knows how we develop he knows he studied you he studied mankind for a long time so he wants to stop you becoming what God has ordained you to be a meant and if he can't get you on some wild fanaticism or some false religion he'll get you by trying to stop you developing in your emotional realm because therefore you can't handle decisions you can't handle the challenges of life and you just run like a child instead of becoming the person you meant to become now brother Bram says this this is just in the spiritual sighs he's in the seal of the Antichrist fifty five man usually when he's born in the kingdom of God his face sits right straight towards Calvary now if he's just a little bit emotional he will go off on fanaticism if he's just a little if he's just a little bit his shrewd education he will get so starchy till he sits over on this side that's right but the true Church of the Living God goes right down to the center of the highway preaching his Saints old gospel calling from both sides amen that's what we need today a church that he wouldn't be ashamed for anyone to come into it's perfectly governed by the holy spirit no fanaticism no starchy just a good warm church filled with the holy go holy spirit watch that the good solid gospel teaching passes us what we need amen god help us to have it God wants us to have it so he's saying that the devil will use our nature against us so we're a bit emotional we try and get us off into fanaticism amen and then if we are shrewd and educational then he'll get a starchy but if we keep it under prayer we'll go down the middle of the road Amen so I just put that in there because the devil knows how to use our nature's against us now brother Ram says this and divine healing I hope you just don't mind a bit of reading BCS now we must contend it is the new birth if a if a birth is born from the arts I mean from the inside out the child that it grows if it lives if it doesn't it remains is that right well when a birth is on the inside shouldn't it grow Christ is in your heart ought to be growing daily getting better more powerful understanding things better forgiving walking as God would till Christ be formed in you the hope of glory he says we must contend with the weak until they're fully mature in Christ Jesus then the good soldiers then they've got on the full armor talk about them don't hurt them laugh at them make fun of them don't pay don't they don't pay no attention to it they've got one thing they're just so big my just so full of glory the only thing you have to do is drop this old robe of flesh and just go right on to glory see somebody say you know now this is the contending part somebody said well you know somebody said you was a hypocrite mrs. Jones and the answer did well god bless them do you know a certain certain thing is going on at that church you want to be going well I'll pray for it see that's big oh my your little then you say oh is it let me get in which side must I join see that's where you get in trouble that's where that's where you can't mature but when you get big enough large enough you see swelled out not only swelled up but grow it out Christ growing in you growing out melis taking it out if you push it out as God comes in it just pushes out you say oh how little how juvenile it is how much kid it is to argue and fuss but the first thing you know that just grows over the top of it ain't got no more room for it oh I used to hate to see this and hate that but you know I just got so I just got so I just don't pay any more attention to it no more see you growing yes sir hallelujah amen I'm done done groped now from your heart your your love you had for him till you can brighter your tongue brother that's a great thing amen see we're going to grow we're on our Road I mean we're we're we're basking in the presence of the you know your brother Graham said that the the church has just got to sit in the presence of the Sun until it bakes out all the greenness I mean that's why it's so important to be in the presence of the Lord he'll break out the greenness he'll bring the maturity hallelujah now there's two parts to the brain that are developing well in a teenager now we all went through this track I trust if you got two adult brain you adults now so it seems that experiments have shown that most teens often think with their feelings now I'm just going to show you you know kids seem to go so well then they go crazy it seems they had an age and what's happened to them one part of their brain is become fully developed and the other part is still developing and one is the and and and the but that develops first as as the part where they don't think before they act they just do their do crazy things there that's the fully emotional side it just goes wild and then the check of that is to actually sit back and actually examine things before you do that takes a while to grow I want you to on we need to understand our children and children you need to understand yourself I mean so I trust this help somebody right so experiments show this is just off the antenna I did some research looked at a few sites these experiments I have been done to show that teens often think with their feelings if you feel happy you're happy if you're down you're down in your you can't you know who's been there or might just talking about my past you know they often think with their feelings they can't control their emotion why because their brain is developing it's normal it's normal to go you're feeling like you're about to walk into heaven then your brother punches you and you're so angry and you do and you can't control it what's that it's normal or vice versa but you have to you have to know yourself because many times we don't understand how we're built and the devil will use that void against us okay so so scans of the brain have been done to show that different parts light up when they're being used now with adults and teens look at faces showing different emotions the part of their brain that lights up a different now who seen those kind of things you know they they they they scan the brain when when people look at different things that lights up certain because it's not just one part of your brain being used it's multiple parts and we need different things different parts are activated okay so in adults and teens look at faces showing emotions the part different parts of brain light up adults use their prefrontal cortex to look at faces and try and decide what emotion is happening now that part is still developing in the teenage brain teenagers use their no please Amy go okay my G da la there we go that thing rather than their prefrontal cortex most of the time so in other words they use their emotions to try and understand emotion yes pennies drop to understand how this feels imagine you've lost your keys and you're already late for work think about how many times you look for the keys in the same place 10 5 maybe 20 you panic you're no longer using your cortex you'll use your thinking with your emotions you're not thinking straight who's been in the panic what's happening you're now being governed by your emotion now you take that and then you basically apply it to 98% of all teenagers most of the time that's how they are their what their feelings are up the door the world's gonna end it's just here it's fine you know I can't I did this as it's gone all wrong what's happened their emotions are driving them listen you can't you gotta wait for your brain to develop and then it'll come into balance but it's in those crucial years where the devil comes in this whole world is governed against because he doesn't want us to become adults he wants us to stay children and adult bodies who's heard the term man boy or boy man either one what's happened there's a generation of men they're still boys but they're men physically what's happened the devil's garden and he's wired them because our our brains are being wired when we're growing up there's connection neurons connecting and what happens is the devil takes us and why's our brain based on what we're stimulated by and it produces addiction okay as you've won following me so far now often teens can misinterpret emotions and they see anger when it's really just you feeling anxious why our children misunderstand us this can often lead to many moments of miscommunication so when you're talking to teenagers be careful to check what emotion they are seeing in you and make sure you always acknowledge your emotions first and then help them and then help them to be able to think about what they are feeling see many times we don't understand what we're feeling even as adults but that doesn't mean we should just shut ourselves down because there's two you know it's two ends of the spectrum people become emotionally dead being a hard man you don't feel things this is why this valley the this world that's part of where we live is in such a chaos because man has just sealed themselves away and they can't deal with their emotions and then when it becomes too much they lash out very violently become very aggressive because it's either nothing or super aggression this is why this is why where we are here in stocks values like that because society's injured need men that they can't actually express how they feel and deal with how they're feeling you know probably one of the worst things that you know maybe me but when I was growing up how are you feeling you know it can be one of the worst things you could be asked I don't want to deal with it but you know most of the time if you don't want to deal with it it's actually the best thing to deal with they meant now adults so now you have to so this is adults so so what can help in brain development because everything that we we're come in contact with why is this everything okay so our relationship in our family why is this our friends why are this what we behold why is this okay I'm coming down I'm going real slow because oh you know it's not always that jumpy shouting times God's a God of variety and I press yeah I just trust that this help somebody okay adults who talk to children as they're growing up really help is the first thing this website listed adults talking to children as they're growing up really help what's that a relationship and not a relationship just out of well I'm mum or I'm dad your kids therefore I've got to do this now from their heart you know I was going to preach a sermon but I'll do it next time as that the Lord dealt with me a couple of weeks ago saying you're just going through the motions and that's why you're getting annoyed at your girls because you're going through the motions you've shut yourself away and you're not emotionally there for them you're not connected emotionally with them and that's why you're annoyed with them you can't be shut away this is what the Lord was dealing with me so you can be you can be in a family everyone's in a family here even if the families on the other side of the world you can be in a family you can be living in a house with your family and be an individual you can be hidden away you can be all there how you doing good house thanks good you know the Minear lunch good are you listening good now you're not listening to me you know what's happening you become a you're isolated but you're living with your family the devil that's what the devil wants to achieve because if he isolates then he can deal with and his dealing is destruction now a safe environment where they have consistent loving support is vital for brain development to me for the brain to develop well a consistent loving support amen communication consistent loving support if we want who wants your children to be deformed who wants them to be the best they can be love and communication consistent loving support this is what the devil's destroyed family in this hour they need clear consistent boundaries teenagers respond better to rewards the to punishment I whose teenagers here you should have said preach it brother Ben preach with me I won't reward and set a punishment amen come on you can't say Amen - maybe just pitchfork anyway any clear consistent boundaries and very importantly their growing capacity and ability to do things independently needs to be respected as their brain grows it gets connected function functionally they need to learn that they don't have to be dependent on their parents but can become interdependent with other adults as they mature basically they will become functioning adults adulting they call it or we add all thing today have you heard that phrase adult you never heard that well it's hard to do adulting that's what my work colleagues you said my old work they're in their 20s no a dull thing it's no you're an adult but you got to be a fully mature emotional adult now so another principals I'll just read so so the brain is developed in a way that produces a lot of connections that are then removed if they are not used so take care to encourage lots of connections to be you so in other words if you have no relationship with your children then that part of their brain that's connected where they communicate effectively is shut down it's use it or you use it or lose it even when they're growing another principle and other principles that win with when the brain connects they fire see so those that fire together they wire together the different pathways in your brain so so for example if you do a lot of physical activity then the part of your brain is wired together where you're used to it you enjoy it but if you never do any physical activity playing a game can be a chore and you don't enjoy it why cuz that part your brains not wired or if you have no discipline to study if you are you know if you're disciplined in you and you can study what's happen as a part of your pathway is wired you can actually put in the time and effort but if you're lazy you never do anything that part is not connected like it should be or if you never help around the house eventually you're gonna have to help around your own house member occupy blessed are those servants that have found doing when he comes doing what it comes down to everyday life you know this world has engineered that we're always looking for tomorrow I member even at school a big Monday morning kids in class will be talking about next weekend what are we gonna do next weekend what are we gonna do next weekend instead of what about today it's we're gonna live in the today but the devil doesn't want us to live in the today he wants us to wait for our holiday or wait for Christmas or wait for some summertime or some season that we enjoy and you missed now that's why I think you know we know time does fly but you know we don't want to come to a place with life so for example me if the Lord should tarry I don't want to come to a place where there yeah big and I'm shocked how did you get that big that means I've missed all the age where they develop emotionally and physically from here to there you know oh when they grow up then they'll be good know it starts now if you want them good when they're adults you need to start now if you want to be their friend when you're when they're adults you need to start now amen now now teenage teenage brains are not fully developed so some areas aren't completely online the most important of these areas are the prefrontal cortex which controls reasoning and teen emotion and self-regulation as a result teens can be very impulsive and moody yes now it's not when you hit 13 this happens you can be earlier than 13 yeah and because brain development and decision-making are closely related adolescents aren't as good as planning ahead making careful decisions you know I often think why didn't I think like this when I was a teenager I couldn't because I had a teenage brain that's why brother am said think there say fourteen-year-old think thought fourteen-year-old thoughts think what you like when you're that age they'll probably one like the same thing because they are made in your image see so your personality they'll have a men things you like they like now the brain so the brain develops and a back to front pattern hits fourth prefrontal cortex development as the last part of the brain maturation process as a result teen brain development is not yet complete so the lack of the frontal lobe maturity catalyzes as a variety of teen behaviors so these so that's because the prefrontal cortex now I'm coming to something there's a reason I'm reading this okay there's a reason I'm reading this so so just bear with me basically teenagers half your brain is working the other half is catching up and they're catching up part is what you need but that part is the part the devil wants to destroy before it becomes online now that's because the prefrontal cortex is involved with a wide range of functions known as executive functions these include the following complex decision-making planning skills impulse control emotional reactions focusing attention prioritizing competing information received all at once the ability to ignore external distractions these things have to develop in the brain now therefore children and teenagers are unable to to access certain skills and abilities until later and the frontal lobe development process consequently lack of executive functions can result in teen risky behavior and lack of emotional self-regulation skills can affect teens mental health moreover teens are also dealing with hormones as a result of puberty now the devil knows this and that's why he's engineered society that it's a pleasure driven world because I said those parts of the brain that fire together they are wired together and that's where diction comes in so that's why now why is Facebook so big because people use it why is YouTube so big because people use it why why do people use it because it's addictive it's that simple why you know any great consumable why is it so such a big brand why is coca-cola such a big big brand cuz people buy it why do people buy it because it tastes good if it tasted like dirt no one's gonna buy it if Facebook was useless no one would be using it it's really quite simple the reason that if one use it is because it's addictive and it's the addictive bit that catches people and now this is not just teenagers this is adults because this world is the most addicted world there is there has never been a generation of people on the earth that us that are addicts as much as today this world society has been engineered to break the family relationship so that children do not become adults but they stay children so when they physically become adults they are not emotionally or mentally adults now you shouldn't be surprised when I say that the world is is addicted now I remember now it was a key week who's the key we could hear my age okay who remembers the life education trust Harold the giraffe okay now I remember in those lessons there's the bus and Harold was the puppet and you know stay away from drugs kids and it's bad and you know so we were told don't hit don't do drugs and a destroys your brain don't do this but did it stop us doing it education this world are so educated about drug use and misuse and what it does but doesn't stop people taking them why is that because man has a fall of nature that we're born with and will always go to the lowest denominator of our society and so what that means is that there will knows that even if you may know mentally something is not right if your heart has not been turned you'll go that way so so Harold told us that drugs will destroy your brain and many of the neurons in your brain are still forming connections well into your 20s so and the more you take drugs the more that your you know your your brain won't form like it should and that would begin to manifest in a person's behavior and ability to remember things and so on so I said the strange thing is the more education we get on the harm of drinking drugs and so on it doesn't stop people doing them it's because a man's fallen nature but this is not just a result of taking physical substance by any cuz any addiction will do the same now as I said this world is the most addictive it's ever been consumable technology is designed to be addictive that's why YouTube is so popular Facebook social media Instagram because what it does is now who knows about the chemical dopamine now this is a different kind of service but I trust you're listening now dopamine is a chemical it's the main chemical of pleasure so when you're enjoying something your brain produces a chemical called dopamine and you feel good it's a chemical because it's chemical reactions going on in your body though always so when you do something you like your brain produces dopamine and your brain is now making memory saying you enjoyed this you're enjoying this and so what happens is so dopamine is produced it's the main chemical of pleasure and what it does then as as that actually tell makes you it motivates you to do the same behavior again and so what it does so in other words dopamine the more dopamine your brain produces when you do something more you'll do it okay so this social mean this is why Facebook is addictive it produces dopamine in your brain I'm holding up a phone because there's normally you know why do people live on their phones as I see it member the devil's designed this world that people don't want to be in the real world they want to escape that's why this world is full of fantasy TV programs or movies or fan stuff and people dress up as their favorite characters and you know because they wanted to escape this world why is that because they're addicted why do people live on their phones because they're unhappy with their current state because their brain has become why that they're addicted to this social Internet addiction social media addiction gaming addiction is a real thing and there's a spirit all you know it's very easy I'll just say this I'll be honest drinking alcohol there's a spirit behind it as spirit comes in you and feeds off the alcohol you're drinking it's an addiction there's a thirst in your body that's not from your originally that's hungry for it and you got to feed that desire you can be addicted to your phone exactly the same way because you know people people that are drunks are drinking to cope with life and there's such a thing as a as a what he called a basically a drunk who can basically live their life normally but they're drunk ok the term just escapes me just now and so now so what is it someone can be drunk but go to the job raise their children live on essentially a normal kind of life but they're drunk what's they're addicted there's a spirit of them they need to feed that spirit in order to cope with life and it's the same thing why do people live on their cell phones because they can't cope with everyday life they're addicted you know pick yo this been studies proven that Internet addiction and depression are linked it's a proven fact that social media addiction I say Internet addiction I'm just going to put it in one big blanket because it's all of us it leads to depression because people see this world and they want this fantasy world that they can never actually obtain that fantasy world and they become depressed same thing with gaming social media the internet it's there's a reason why it's called the world wide web brother who speaks about a web of fashion that that women can't get out of this stuck I say these it's not just that now but there is a web that people are stuck in and they can't get out they can the Lord can get them out but you got to want to get out but the problem is because your brain has become wide that you're addicted to the thing it's very hard unless and this you really want it you will still be an addict you know there's a there's actually a symptom of people who are dry drunks where they don't drink but they still show the symptoms of those who drink not in terms of impairment staggering around but impulse decisions rash behavior you know breaking your relationships with those of the thing you know your others and so on what's that they're actually dried drugs they're still the spirit of them but they've somehow in their own human ability have stopped drinking but there's still that spirit in them crying out so they still have behaviors that are as if they were still drinking medically proven this is the world we live in and it's not just that now and the reason I say that is because many times you know we say well get the shotgun breathe b-brother boom boom and blow out the TV right brother I said get the shotgun blow out the TV you know brother boom-boom - two shots and it's gone and many times we'll apply the same thing get it out the house get rid of it but if it's still in here it's not going to do any good cuz it'll come back it'll come back greater then then when it left I remember it was taken out of here hallelujah then you can live in no lemmings and you won't be addicted to it it's like I could literally live in a brewery now I'll never be I never drink a drop because it's not in here to have it I mean so somes now so you've got to look into it and and that's why people you'll see people will be on their phone and they'll send messengers around the start what's happening everyone and and texting everyone because they're waiting for a response and when they get a response with heaven dopamine is ignited in their brain they're upset now okay there's nothing wrong with texting people you understand but who's even been in a place where you feel down and then you start messaging people for no real reason posting things on Facebook how many likes might get Instagram whatever and you're trying to get a response back what's that you're feeding an addiction there's been studies done I'm not just making things up but the thing is now if someone you know you know if someone came in here with needle holes in their arm you think man that person's in trouble they're addicted to a heroin or whatever they've got a spirit on them but then what about people who are depressed and they're addicted to this that may sound extreme but I want you to think about it why do we need to live the devil's real subtle he just wants to rob you of the life of God he wants to break your channel break your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ where it's no longer you no longer walking with him in victory because if you walk with him in victory then your family will come I mean because remember remember 99% of our Christian Walker's not in these four walls Church starts at home revival starts at home I mean and the thing is 99% of our Christian walk that our children see is not when we read this to them it's the life we live in front of them that shows what kind of Christian we are amen so we gotta you know it's not just you push a button now I'm in message mode and Here I am I've got my tie and praise the Lord and you know doing some stretches before I shout and you know do some vocal trait I believe in shouting but you know it's not they do some stretches and come into church and anything you walk out you Misha's yeah yo yo message mode off live any kind of life no 24/7 we're believers 24/7 so you got to see yo what is actually allow what is making me cope in life what's your coping mechanism is that the Lord or is that your phone is that YouTube you know what is it what makes you happy what gives you peace is it watching a football star or is it watching something on than thing or what you know what makes you happier because you know I mean you know we have to come to a conclusion that if we are I'm gonna wrap this up real quick but when it come to a conclusion what makes us happy in life what's our source of comfort because whatever our source of comfort is when the going gets hard that's what will retreat to we will hurt that is our hiding place to the other Bible says in Psalms thirty-two 7 thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt come pass me about with the songs of deliverance so what is your hiding place as at this or is it him Amen because we can we can have a bit of the Lord but is he your hiding place as a year or all and all because you can be you can be hidden away in the mountains or in suburbia but you can just be hidden away in something it's not just geographical location now we know that the Bible says in Psalms 1921 there are many devices in the man's heart nevertheless the counselor Lord shall stand and the different translation the word English Bible says there are many plans in a man heart but pardon me but Yahweh's counsel will prevail so there's many plans in our heart now many times the devil will trick us saying well because you have another desire in your heart other than serving the Lord therefore you're not really a Christian amen you know because we have a lot of plant you know this flesh has a lot of ideas that's why it's got to die that's why you've got to come to a death that's why I said you know you can kick out all the technology you want and say I'll never look at Facebook again or you know the internet again but if is the desire and here then it's still you're basically a dry drunk but if you die to that first you die to that spirit I mean it will be taken from you that's why you've got to die to the thing because you you you're gonna kill your enemy or your your enemy will kill you amen so there's many plans in a man's heart and we know when we go from children to to being a teenager that's when the world opens up to us amen if you're a boy you find out that girls are not ugly yucky things they become nice things amen and vice versa they're not so yucky after all so this you know so there's many things that are going on in your life as if one following me so that so therefore you've got different desires that you never had you now find yourself having there is big chaos going on but the thing is it doesn't matter I'll say this the Lord has given us something to overcome with right and many times we think well that's the Holy Ghost and it is but if you don't have the Holy Ghost God the Lord still gives you something to overcome with he still gives you something that you can overcome because you know if we say well you just need the Holy Ghost then you'll overcome be say well I don't have the Holy Ghost so how can I overcome you following me but he gives us something that causes us that we can get the victory and it's real simple that victory is athirst their victory is a hunger that victory is a desire for God amen it can be the smallest hunger in your heart but as long as you've got it hello yeah then you just focus on that one I mean that's all you need to do I trust this kind of wraps it up a little bit for you I mean but even the smallest desire to serve God I would focus on that desire I wouldn't worry but the other ones will take care of themselves focus on that desire to serve God amen and say Lord kill all the rest of them out hallelujah because that's the biggest thing that people face and they and they wrestle what they say well but God's pulling me that's where the world's pulling me that way I know what that was like I was there for years I was stuck in this rock and a hard place yeah but God's calling me he's dealing with me but I don't want to lose my friends I want to keep my old life I mean it was to thirst going on but one had to die hallelujah and it's your head it's your own choice I mean which will dictate which one will die or not I mean if you want the world to live in you then your choice will be that way but if you want God to live in you and you say Lord take me I want to serve you I mean not because I haven't gotten by my emotion or I feel it but because I believe you would I thank you in your word holy I believe you died free I believe what your Holy Ghost is for me amen and you focus on that desire I mean then God will take that desire he'll take you hallelujah I want to take this as I want to I just want to read this quote and then I might leave it there because we're gonna go into another part of this another time but he says here this isn't to whom shall we go 1916 he says and it is tonight if you're if you're the least desire in your heart to serve God who's got the least Azhar in their heart to serve God I mean to receive the Holy Ghost who's got the least desire in their heart this is the interactive part of the service I put my hand up revised you know not honestly be real be real don't worry about who's around you as there's having a new stake saying I want to be a Christian I want to serve God I want to be a Christian I want to be identified with them if you've got the least desire in your heart to receive God to receive the Holy Ghost let get in the right atmosphere the right mood before God and life will come and you just assure and you'll start rising to translation how the Luisi says now if you've got the least desire in your heart to serve God to receive the Holy Ghost get in the right atmosphere I believe we're in the right atmosphere I believe we're in the presence of the Lord hallelujah the right mood before God what is the right mood before God god I want to serve you you know the struggles I have in my mind in my heart you know the pulls that are pulling me in the different things I want but lord I want to serve you I want to be a Christian hallelujah I mean and then so so if you come in the right mood before God life will come into you just as sure you'll start rising to translation what is translation the body change I mean if you focus on the lease of the desire to serve God and say Lord I want you want to serve you I mean life will come unto you and you start rising to the body change hallelujah amen that's what we have to focus on hallelujah the least desire because you don't want to let the devil why are you the wrong way I know I covered a lot of things tonight but if you have in your in your heart to say Lord I want to I want to serve you you focus on that desire with the with the right mood before God and your life will count I just want to repeat it cuz it's so powerful to me life will come right and you'll start rising to translation who wants to start rising to translation amen you say well yeah bless it as a server that's found when the Lord comes doing doing what building relationships with each other and family amen I I trust you got genuine love and concern for your children amen you know not just we have to come to a point now maybe I'll just I'll just paraphrase it brother Graham's asked a question in the and the and the certain the seals before the seventh seal message and an Deniz asked brother Branham when the seals come open or when the books taking does that mean grace is finished he says no grace isn't over he says you just go right on planting your potatoes be a sweet humble Christian keep going to church he says well maybe I should just rebut but he says otherwise if you lose the he says he says no it's not over don't get it on your mind just go right on dig the potatoes go to church and right on if it takes place in the morning you'd be found doing just exactly what you're supposed to be doing he says don't start see when you do you twist the very thing away from the purpose that's intended for amen so he's saying no so you saying build your church I mean your go to church thinking potatoes do your job you know go to church otherwise you'll be twisted away the very purpose of digging your potatoes I've gone to church it'll take you away from the very purpose of it because at the end of the day if you do not and I'll just leave you with this if you do not know your purpose in everyday life you will quit living and you just start existing and the devil wants us just to exist but if we have a vision because where there's no vision as the people perish but you have to have your own vision you've got to be motivated yourself this does not make us motivated to live this makes us motivated to exist okay the thing is if you actually understand the purpose you know I learned a ton of stuff at university I never use what was the purpose of it it was to mold something into me it's not the head dollars necessarily but it's your character being molded when you're doing the task you following me amen yeah because many times the only thing what's the point of learning this at school well the purpose is right there the reason is for that class is that you actually learn a bit of character and discipline do too you know figure things out might not be well who's going to use you know trigonometry again or calculus integration okay not sure of it okay anyway we'll leave that hey you know people think what's the purpose and then it's like same as why do we why do we vacuum the carpet it's just gonna get dirty again what's the purpose of it if you see there's no if you do not see the purpose of keeping your house clean amen you will stop you'll miss the whole moment of what you're actually doing in terms of living in the now it's the small things God is in the small things God is in God is in washing dishes dropping kids off at school raising children eating your lunch making lunch you know and the small things God is in the small things but if you miss the purpose of those things in your motivation goes you won't be found doing when he comes you just be found existing so you can't don't quit you know because that's the problem with this we see a filter filtered photoshopped you know rendered picture of somewhere like we're we were driving around power to new Inlet and one of us in the car head was taking photos with filters on it doesn't look like that in real life it looks cool but if someone showed me a photo of that and said go look at this place is beautiful and then Here I am I go to the place and say is there something wrong with my eyes it doesn't look like this at all and you get disappointed but if you're actually there and you're enjoying the moment enjoying the atmosphere enjoying maybe the wind on your face and the sunshine on you and you know that's why it's so nice just to enjoy a moment and not have a phone you know why I live through this lens when you can live through this lens because you're gonna think you know my heart's desire is that if the Lord should tarry all you young people who are the Church of the Church of today should we all die we'll just step into our place that's that's my heart's desire right but in order for that to happen then you have to grow and mature and the Lord that you have the same character christ-like character that is I pray as in us and so we can have this idea of people coming to their position but it starts with simple things you go read David in the Bible he's anointed by Samuel he goes back to his father's sheep what was the purpose but he's anointed to be king what's the purpose of looking after sheep he said he's under training and then his dad says take the food go see your brothers who were there at the battle with the Philistines he's just serving his dad he's just doing everyday things amen Jesus was subject to Joseph and Mary as a child and he obeyed them and God used that to Malta's character so me times you that well what's the point there is a point in everything but if we if we if we say well what's the you know who's ever felt I'll just I know times gone but who's ever felt like what's the point of living this life I'm living you know what's the point of going to school what's the point of learning this why am I here what's this all about the devil wants us to focus on that because then what he does is he gets us to focus because you're us why are we here and God put you here God put you here that in the everyday God will meet you amen it's in the everyday I've had them you're the most wonderful experience that I've ever had with the Lord is washing dishes and vacuuming some of that well some of the biggest blessings I've ever got from his word I've been at work tipping human urine into tubes in a lab coat in a lab working or I've been vacuuming or being cleaning or have been you know just doing things doing everyday things you know because many times you think well we've got to be shut along with God somewhere in the secret place that's all fine but God God doesn't just meet us in full wall somewhere he's with us everywhere but it depends what your mind is caught up in it depends what you're caught up if you're caught up and and and and your phone and what's going on out in the world you know the world is gonna continue on you know the world is not going to fall apart because you don't check your facebook for the tenth time in the in 15 minutes you know or you're on YouTube or whatever it is the world will continue on I'm gonna quit I'm gonna stop but the thing is you know you got to be shadowed with God wherever you are he's with you everywhere okay can we just stand I'll just leave cuz otherwise I'll continue on and had the musicians come please can you come forward we'll go into it a bit more in depth later what's wiring your brain I want the Lord to wire my brain I want my family you know the biggest way to fix a family problem is to actually spend time with the family brother Bram walked into his house his wife's upset the children are fighting let's me see you know she cuz she's all stressed out Australian this people visiting whatever more she's about to break down you know what he does to fix it he doesn't say now come on woman line up or I'm the prophet of God or he doesn't go off into his den and pray he puts on an apron he starts talking about dresses and different things about here for his wife and thing and he's praying in his heart Lord send your Holy Ghost into her heart quiet her down next thing you know she's okay you know cuz he you know the kids are playing the whole atmosphere in the house has changed why because he's doing everyday things God gives us grace he enables us to live I mean this just um they should sing that song fill my day every way fool my way through my day every yeah with love this thing that I want my life to be filled with his love every day he loved him today said lord help me let me walk less and
