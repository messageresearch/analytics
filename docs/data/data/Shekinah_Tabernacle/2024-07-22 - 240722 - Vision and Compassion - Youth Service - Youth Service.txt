service yes and we actually requested another one so i believe we're in for a continued good time thank you for the songs so far brother josh you're doing really good and for the item it was really good um the bible says in first timothy 4 12 let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers and word and conversation and charity and spirit and faith and purity and because we're all believers that are taking all of the land we take that land too so none of us despise any of the youth here we think you're all great and and it's always a blessing to us when we hear whether it's a young person or an old person whoever whatever age we get blessed there's a blessing in it also you're in good company all the youth here it feels weird because i feel like kind of a bit of a sir youth um 21 at heart amen um there was a i heard a story a seven-year-old six or seven they asked a month to preach and he got up and preached and it was really anointed you know this the crowd were amending everything was going and he just thought this is the greatest thing so he's preaching his little heart out i think this is a true story pretty sure it is and then um then it was so good that maybe the neighbouring church down the road said oh can we have that little sign so to come preach for us so that was it he was you know starting his preaching sort of journey so he went down to the next place and it didn't quite work as well as the first one you know so it was a bit dry and he sort of just tried to plow his way through but you know came to the end and sort of sat back down then he that night he prayed said lord that's me i'm finished with the ministry but hopefully that's not what we're going to do here [Laughter] um so the first we're going to have brother dave minister to us then um i'll come and we'll sing another song then we'll have brother ben so i believe we're in for a good time i think they have prepared as much as they can you know when you're ministering for the lord it's our duty to prepare as good as we can and then we give the rest of the lord and if we do that hey it's all in the lord's hands you know if we do our part it's not up to man but we can make an effort to say lord this is i want to give you my best and then you do what you want with it if you want to do nothing with it that's fine you want to do something with it it's up to you but and i believe these two brothers have given their best they were in the room praying before they take it seriously so um let's sing the chorus of i'm amazed give me a c as um i'll call up brother dave [Music] amazed that you love me we'll stand this afternoon [Music] they're all [Music] [Applause] is through your precious [Music] all my sins [Music] amy what a beautiful song i'm amazed i mean i'm amazed that you love me how are you hey man i mean i'll just um say i will say i would have prayed always stand um dear lord jesus lord i thank you for this wonderful time dear god lord that i can just give little god lord that we can come in your name dear jesus and lord just have a blessed time in your in your presence dear god and lord just be just get to delight ourselves new day jesus lord just be our portion dear god lord be with us dear jesus lord as we we give glory to you i pray to you jesus lord just may everyone just be blessed dear god ma'am i just anoint me to god lord that i might just be a blessing to you jesus lord under those dear jesus so i just thank you lord jesus christ i'm free amen you guys can all have your seats this afternoon mean i want to talk i want to talk today about um about visions i mean because i you know i've i've been going through some stuff and i thought you know why don't i start sharing a little bit a little bit about visions sorry i find a little bit nervous that kind of doesn't hasn't left um but i looked i looked up on the internet and it's the biblical like the vision a vision means it's just an it's it's imagination you know you have a vision of something you want to do something and you go and you you then do it yeah the biblical meaning at this rate and it says it says visions are scripted efforts to affect change amen so god god will give us a vision and he'll heal them reveal to us you know what we must do but we've already got the god's already given given us the the imagination of what we must go and do and then we must go and do it you know and it's quite it's quite um it's quite powerful so i've i've then gone i've gone to the scriptures if we could turn to acts nine and versus um ten and we'll be reading verses ten through eighteen i mean so acts nine and then 10. um and it says here and there was a certain disciple at the damascus named ananias and to him said the lord in a vision ananias and he said behold i am here lord and the lord said unto him arise and go unto the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of judas for one called saul of tarshish for behold he prays so the lord's giving ananias um a vision and to do something right so he's given he's given him a scripted effort to to go and hit and keep reading and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he may receive his sight then ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this men how much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on my name on thy name but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake and ananiah sent his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brothers saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee and the way as thou came camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received his sight forth and arose and was baptized amen so so ananias got a scripted effort and he went and did it and affected change and this this man's and saul who's later taught um name change to paul was filled with the holy ghost so through in a nice um you know god allowed someone to be filled the holy ghost you know i was like man how you know how amazing and then if we can turn to ezekiel eight and four ezekiel eight and four so ezekiel 8 and 4 says and behold the glory of god of israel was there according to the vision that i saw in the plane amen so he was he was there and he'd seen previously in a vision of what had happened so again it's it's basically the same as same as axes gods you know god show him something and he's then seeing it in in the later date um and then i have a quote here from from brother branham it's called the manifestation of the spirit and it says and now after a bit when i got converted it got more than ever it predicted the 1937 flood when hundreds of men stood there and laughed and turned their heads and i predicted 22 feet of water over the streets why i stood there and seen it in a vision i mean so rather than seeing a vision of something happening amen seen a vision of what i've why i stood there and seen in a vision they said the boy's gone crazy i mean so i would have gone to tell some people you know i've seen this vision about this flood and people going you know you're crazy you know same as they did with with brother branham and russia you know they're like you know at the start people are you know it's impossible you know it's not gonna happen and russia's at war you know it's all it's all it's all happening and just a few weeks after that 22 feet of water went over the spring street in jeffersonville indiana see so it actually happened amen so it's how powerful you know amen and then so i want to touch on now outside i was so i'm in my study of visions i was thinking you know who who gets to see visions you know and then um if we if we can all turn to daniel 1 and verses 17 so daniel 1 verses 17 and it says as for these four children god gave them knowledge and skill and all learning of and wisdom and daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams i mean so god's given daniel a gift so god doesn't give everybody this gift he but he's he's saying here he gave he gave this man a gift and and um and understanding in all visions and dreams i mean so daniel daniel alone he's he's now gifted and then if we could go to um if we could go to acts 26 and then um acts 26 16. so acts 26 16. and it says here um but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things in which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom i now now i send thee to open the eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of their sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me were upon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision i mean so in our thing of visions there's a heavenly vision amen and then if we could turn to joel 2 28 so joel chapter 2 verse 28. that one so joel chapter 2 verse 28 it says and it shall come to pass afterwards that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and you your young men shall see visions amen so i thought i was quite powerful you know stating that you know your old men children dreams and young men shall see visions but i was like you know i'm you know what about the sisters you know they've got no dreams or visions so then i went and i found the um the heavenly vision i'm like actually everyone can see a vision you know we can all see the heavenly vision amen but i was then thinking i was thinking you know every person that that was on earth ever on earth has been a part of this heavenly vision because if if the heavenly vision you know is as god's as as the thought you know of christ his vision of what he wants to accomplish with all of this you know everybody can play a part in it everybody has played a part in it but in order to you know you must live according to the heavenly vision amen which is living you're living your life in truth you know being filled the holy ghost you then have the key to receive the holy ghost but amen but you know don't get disgruntled when it says you know men and young men shall see visions you know because sisters you know you can also see the heavenly vision i mean you can see the vision literally taking part before your eyes amen you don't have to be disgruntled i mean um and then i have i i've have another quote by um by brother branham says i will i was not uh this is the i was not the uh disobedient to the heavenly vision it says here if he's talking about a prayer line if you had to pass through a a line just passing by you'll be healed there just the same as anywhere that is true if your faith is strong enough to throw you throw yourself into the vision it can be for you if not it isn't amen so if you believe you're producing and are going to be and you really want to be filled the holy ghost i mean you will be filled the holy ghost and get saved amen because if you're gives god's given you that faith that can allow you to you know step into being part of the heavenly vision amen and then you can you know you'll be filled the holy ghost i thought man how powerful you know because i often think you know what happens if people get angry at me because you know i've been felt the holy ghost and saved what if they're not you know but i was thinking you know all you have to do is have faith and belief and this will happen to you also so why are you getting frustrated at me for you know you can it's so easy you know god god loves you more than anything you know and all you must always believe and have faith amen and then okay and then and then i was thinking you know what um and then brother brother branham says says here about about a vision um and it shall be even as it was told to me it says now quickly to a vision i told you i would tell you tonight i'll just take about 15 minutes long if possible it happened two years ago i was in my room right after a big meeting and i and i seen a rocky hilly country just as natural i mean so he's having i'm sorry um it's not what you had at now not a dream friend a dream is a dream i mean and i looked on the internet dreams are actually drifts of imagination a vision is as something you see before you it says a vision is something you're looking at like i'm looking right now to you or you're looking at me sometimes i'd be standing right like this i'd sit in my room been sitting in my room talking to my family and move completely away be gone for an hour and half half or two hours and i'd sit perfectly still without a speck of breath that's what medical science can't understand where it done not even a speck of breath you could put a as fine a thing as any you want to around my nose and not a and not a bit of breath they'll tell me but my respirations heartbeats just the same but they don't understand aiming because it wasn't revealed to them however when god reveals us something no we believe the truth amen powerful and then um if we could turn to job 7 14. i mean job 7 14. so job 714 says then they'll scare us me with dreams and terrifies me through visions amen so not every vision is going to be you know wonderful and you know this they they are often you know they might be scary as job stays you know yeah so we don't have scary visions but you know some people might have a scary vision so just warning you no if you start praying dear god give me visions you know you might get a little bit terrified um okay um if then we'll go to job 20 and verse 8 okay so job 20 and verse 8 he shall fly away as a dream and shall not be found ye he shall be chased away as a vision of the night and when i read this i was like you know a vision of the night you know i need to look into this one and see what it means and then if we go to job 33 and 15 so job 33 and 15. it says here in a dream in a vision of the night again he's stating vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men and slumberings upon the bed amen so he says sailing again and then if we go to isaiah 29 isaiah 29 verse 7. so isaiah 29 i've 29.7 says and the multitude of all the nations that fight against ariel even all that fight against her and her munition and that distress her shall be as a dream of a night vision again so he's stating night night vision and i actually um i was like i looked it up on the internet as well because i couldn't i couldn't really find it anywhere else and but it says a night vision is a vision you have half asleep or half awake i mean and brother branham also had um i got a quote from brother branham because i just to try to try to back myself here because the internet you know you can't believe everything it tells you it's full of lies it says and while walking and a few moments ago with brother wood and his arms and his and his uh with his arms around me i was thinking of dear by the wood when i was in uh shrevey port louisiana the lord woke me up one night i mean so the lord's waking him up so i would have been quite tired you know half awake one night and showed me a vision said tell brother would be careful he is going to get hurt amen so quite possibly a night vision but yes so as it's not yeah it's not quite 100 to me yet but i might still have to a little bit of study but that's that's what i got for that one and then if we could go amen um if we could go to x eleven and five so x eleven and five so acts 11 and 5 it says i was in this is um this is peter i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision i mean so peter's now he's not having a night vision he's not you know he's not half asleep or half awake he's in a trance you know so it's i don't quite know what time it was but he's just he's in some sort of a trance um but i suppose when you have a night vision you'll kind of be no sitting down or he may have been standing up you know like yeah so um i saw a vision a certain vessel descended as it had been a great sheet letting down let down from heaven by four corners and it came even to me amen and then if we could go to x 10 so we turn back to x 10 and then we will read from nine and it says here on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh unto the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance i mean so he's having another another trance amen and then um it was 11 and saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending upon unto him as it had been a great sheep knit at the four corners and let down to the earth amen and then if we go to verses quick to verse 17 now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from cornelius had made inquiry for for simon's house and stood before the gate amen so was like i was thinking about that i was like man so peter peter and you know his his own being you know being just like one of us you know is doubting i mean says you know if we you know if we see a vision or something you know we it you know it's all right you know some we do doubt i mean i mean we are human we do make make mistakes i mean we do we do doubt but then it says and the men which were sent from cornelius had made inquiry for simon's house and stood before the gate amen so if peter didn't doubt if if god didn't place that down on peter he might have left and he might have you know miss cornelius i remember unfortunately because you know peter's a human god used that amen and now and now you know god's god's making making another plan amen i just i found that quite powerful but then i was also thinking i was like man you know what what happens what happens if we if we start doubting you know in our vision and then if we could turn to isaiah 40 so isaiah 40 and go verse 30. what's this so sorry isaiah 40. so i'm gonna have to sing that um the children's song that shows has all the um the books of the bible sister brown actually taught it to me but because i was but um i forgot so i have to re-learn that one um and then if we go verse 30 it says even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall i mean so and what i was thinking i was like even though you shall faint and be weary and the young men childly force i mean that's a little bit like um you know peter peter in their place you know kind of he he got a little bit faint start doubting amen but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint i mean so all we have to do we start downing is just wait upon the lord and he will reveal his word amen because that you know is a great great god almighty amen but i i hope you guys were i'm going to wrap it up i hope you guys were truly truly blessed but yes i was i was quite blessed at it because i was like you know i got to got to study study visions and hopefully when you know when someone has a vision you know they'll know a little bit more about it i suppose it's awesome cool god bless everybody [Applause] which of you are young men or young women hands up if you are okay well we we talked about claiming land so i believe one of the plots of dirt as your young men and young women shall see visions okay so there you go there's there's one you can claim you claim it lord show me your vision like and whatever that might be lord reveal it to me i you know i i really enjoyed that and and then know the heavenly vision what is god's vision for me and as brother dave said walk in that lord show me what your heavenly vision is for my life show me what it is lord and that's and i want to walk in that direction that's where the blessing is that's where the that's where god's favor is that's where the power is lord i don't want to just have my get my own idea and then wander this way i want to walk in your heavenly vision amen praise the lord let's um before we get brother ben up um let's let's sing come now is the time to worship um one more time give me a um give me a d amen come now is the time to [Music] just as you are before [Music] one day [Music] [Music] one day everybody one of the greatest treasure remains for those [Music] who mean that's such a nice can you bring it up by these it's such a nice eating to the song still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now like the greatest tragedy you can ever imagine is when we get to heaven and and we're married to god we're getting married now but the greatest truth will be to serve him for eternity where there is no pain or death you know these trials are nothing for what's coming thank you musicians you may be seated really appreciate the angry musicians it's a real it's real special to see the life we have in our church we're so each and every one of us are real privileged to see to see it all happening and see the lord work through people and see people overcome and receive eternal life that this is the lord's work and uh i don't think i don't think dave will ever get used to the feeling when you first get behind the pulpit neither will i know it's like you're speaking to someone very special special like this is god's special people it's like um you can just say i'm just gonna say a prayer lord jesus lord just want to thank you lord for the opportunity to minister my god just as the word comes out i pray just i'm a vessel to you lord you can just use me and speak through me lord we're so thankful lord to be in your house on the sunday lord with our brothers and sisters who are also happy to be here god lord we just pray you just teach us how to use your sword lord and reveal your word to us my god and just become so personal to us lord jesus amen so i've got a little thought today and my thought is about compassion um can the compassion has the human know it and compassion as god no i think a little bit different um it was doing a little journey but i want to start with matthew chapter 11 28 amen the scripture says come unto me all ye that are all that labor and are heavy laden i will give you rest and i think this scripture has a you if you read it it has a lot of it has compassion in it what the words are compassion that's that's what i read come to come to me and he'll give you rest when you when people come out of the world when they don't have the holy ghost when they come to christ they and when they get that research in life that is compassion god came down and he died for us because he had compassion he didn't want to do away with us he had compassion me and my state when i was in the world full of idolatry and sinning and drunkenness and no happiness like as eternally separated from god at that point he had compassion he died on the cross for me and that's the compassion he's given to us but there's many times in the bible he came to people and he walked past blind malted people cripples and he didn't heal them he went to one and he killed them so if you've had that compassion understand that god is very compassionate to you and you're very blessed and you need to you need to show that compassion to people everywhere you go and the bible is the bible is full of it and it's just it's pretty much having the same mind as christ too that compassion is a great attribute god have and he wants us to have that and show it to people also this is not just for the old people this is for the young people we're all young here young in christ and we all want to be we all want to we all want to be a vessel for the word and of the lord we want to be willing to surrender just like jesus did he his compassion was so great like this is nothing new to you guys i know you all know but he didn't he didn't have a wife he didn't have a house he didn't have a job description we got paid money like me and you do he didn't have that and it was he did this all for compassion because he didn't want to see his the greatest creation for sin because of the devil's trickery and how he he came against us he warned against us to trick us that's the devil's trick was to to anoint the word to anoint the devil's word to make us unbelievably anointed unbelief through the serpent made us full but the lord had compassion to bring us out of that and he wants us to take on his mind to be able to see the devil's trick in this day and move forward and overcome because the devil always comes with the same tricks in your mind there will be one bit of doubt on the word of god and that will make you fall away from god it's that one thing in the mind we need to have the same mind of christ the devil will always attack us in the mind and if he gets in the mind he just sits backs and laughs he just that's what he does and the lord is very gracious to to give us grace and teach us and use us and keep extending us grace and keep teaching us how to use a sword to cut through each demon as they come because there's a legion of them trying to attack us in this day and it's only through his grace and compassion that he teaches us to overcome i want to um there's so the english meaning of compassion is the meaning of compassion is to recognize the suffering of others and then take action to help compassion is more than a feeling concerned about someone in the stress or caring about a person's misfortune compassion is a feeling of sympathy or pity for others but like especially it makes you help them it's not just a feeling you don't go they're hurting it makes you actually go and help that person that's hurting and you go to them help them not just oh a couple of days they're hurting they'll be right you know the lord didn't when he seen me in my backs in the stage in agony and depressed and worth nothing he didn't go oh the devil's done that too bad he had compassion he died for me like his blood was for me he made a way he didn't want him without us and i'm so thankful because i know where i was and i know where i am now and it's very powerful and i'm when when i see i'll use brother davis example when i see dave went out to the world he had compassion on him and brought him back and it's real powerful because i know he's our brother you know and anyone in our church if we see them full we should have compassion on them oh i don't want to hear myself i wish we should go into fasting and praying we should go see them we should go help them out and assist them because that's what god did for us and for us not to do that is not to have the mind of christ we it might not be to go do everything for that person because the lord is bringing them through something but definitely pray for them battle through and win through prayerf because that's what christ did for each and every each of us i want to um it's a fantastic battle you know it's rigged i've been to this rig because we win you know it's great it's great i nev i don't like losing anyway i want to read jude i want to read jude 19-22 i think these be though who separated themselves sensual having not the spirit but ye beloved building up yourself on the most on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keeping yourselves and the love of god looking a love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference jude to me is a little it's a little it's a something in the scripture but he's really talking to the bride he's talking to his purchase and he's saying he's saying pray through the pray pray in the holy ghost keep the love of god in the mercies of the lord jesus christ until eternal life your whole life and and in the end the scripture stuck out to me when i was um studying it because he said end of some have compassion making a difference brother andy was saying to me a while ago you know you've got loved ones and family friends around the world and you want to come and receive christ and he said you know how are you how are you going to get them to do that you can you can say what you want that can help but really praying for them having compassion praying like you know spending two hours a night praying for that person to receive their eyes be open that's for me that's having compassion that's surrendering your sleep time you're what you want to do your hobbies your interests and really praying through that for that person and if it's a burden of the lord if it's a person the lord has put in your heart and there's a burden for him that compression the bible says it makes a difference it will make a difference in their life they will help or they will overcome they will have happiness and joy and they won't know why but they will be because you're praying for them it'll be the love of god expressed to them we have to have compassion for this dying world we we were once all part of it before the lord pulled us out and the same with that entering into our brothers burdens with compassion wanting to help our brothers winning through prayer our brothers and sisters not in the world but in the church too you know if people are struggling i don't want to jump ahead but praying praying for them entering into their burdens with compassion because that's it's a compassion that christ said through us will make the difference for them i want to go to chapter peter chapter 2 our second peter chapter three eight to nine oh man yeah it sort of seems like some of this was a continuation of my first sermon on the mind being fully sold out to christ in your mind not letting the devil attack you there finally brethren ye o finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one to another love as brethren be pitiful and is that courtesy see how you spell it say it courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contra wise blessing knowing that ye are the who that ye are there sorry not rendering evil for evil or rallying for railing but contra wise blessing knowing that g are there unto called say well your bible says that ye shouldn't hear it a blessing i don't i'm sorry that this is what my bible said didn't make sense that word anyway but i'm sure it does at the end of the city that you shouldn't hear to hear and hear it or blessing not rendering evil for evil or writing for railing you know when someone does your best i'd rather either say if someone does your bad just if you've had a bad deal just it's all good you know there's a blessing in it for you humble yourself and serve your brother serve your brethren be like christ that he didn't he doesn't fight if someone hits him he doesn't hit them back he just forgives he moves on and it's hard but surrender surrender just like christ did and have compassion for them because if that if they're truly ripping you off or doing dirty to you there's a spirit on them that will take them to hell and if they can never see someone with christ in them show them compassion that spirit will take them to hell because i'll never see they'll just this is how they are and this is people when i genuinely they they try attacking back when someone doesn't i'll be like when that person blesses them back like the lord says they'll they'll think and go oh what what's going this is not normal why would he love me back when i'm when i'm ripping him off or doing him wrong or hitting him or hurting him or taking from his family the the christian walkers is a suff it's to suffer with the lord he suffered for us the greek meaning of compassion is to uh to suffer with and in this life we are suffering with the lord we make sacrifices and we suffer with the lord but it's a great suffering i i enjoy it sometimes sometimes it's a bit harder um especially to the young kids i just want to i've seen a little bit already but close close your ears and your eyes and your mind to the devil jesus overcome the devil and just he said it is written it is written that's how he overcame he didn't let the devil's lies enter into his mind he didn't give the devil time he didn't pay attention to his nonsense he just moved forward and said it is written and we know the bible has given us many ways to overcome compassion is one of them loving your neighbor is one of them but it is written don't don't let the devil's lies and and all the things of this world occupy your mind put your mind and your time on christ that's that's when you will start to be blessed and you'll be able to move forward in your walk with the lord amen i want to turn to luke 10 27. so lawyer came to tempt him in the story and then he said unto them and he answered and he said answering thou shalt love thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy strength and with all thy mind and our neighbor as thyself then you know then your neighbor can see christ you know in somebody it's very important you know sometimes we we we fight many battles in this life and if we just keep our mind our heart our strength and our soul all on christ everything sold out to christ a lot of the battles we came and faced we would have really been equipped although we are humans who make mistakes and stumble but if we had been a little bit more sincere a little bit more studying in the world we would have known the battles that were coming and we would have already had the sword of the word in our hand ready to overcome don't be slothful in this light hour it is dark out there take on the mind of christ put him forced in everything and he'll fight your battles but if you don't take on the minor christ if you don't put him first there will be battle scars it will hurt it will hold you back your family back anybody that's around you would be affected if you're if you're walking around like this oh if you're walking like this you'll get attacked and the people around you will also you know it will affect them too because who you hang around is what you become like [Music] i'm not sure if this one was very fitting but i'm going to say it i felt led to galatians 3 10 to turn away from god's compassion is eternal death god's compassion is eternal life without god's compassion without him dying on the cross it would be death we wouldn't there would be no way to access god so compassion for god is eternal love um galatians 3 10. for as many as ye are of the works of the law for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse that is written curses is everyone that continueth not on all things which are written in the book of the law to do unto them now we know we're under grace but this is still a book of law without the blood it's law but we've got grace but it he plainly says that you're cursed if you're if you don't if you care if you carry on and follow in the world you're cursed to do not to do with the things of the lord and to reject the lord's word you're cursed don't do that give all give everything to the lord whether you stumble and fall whether you make mistakes just run back to the lord tell them all about it he'll help you even if it's addictions if it's hurt if it scars from when you're a kid and how you react the lord will help you overcome that if you run to him and tell him about it you know some of my childhood things you know i reacted with anger out of fear and because of past hurts and emotions and that's how you react you react and you react but the lord doesn't want you to react like that give that to the lord he will you might you might cry to the lord about your anger or about your frustration or about how you are as a person or react to situations because of how you were brought up in the people around you that made your life what it was but the lord will take that from you but if you don't run to the lord and tell them about that and you don't do what god has told you to do it it won't get any better you you won't get help the lord is our help he's our strong tower in our refuge i want to turn to romans 9 and 15. i was saying start from verse 14 what shall we say then is there unrighteous with god god forbid for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion it's pretty powerful that he does have mercy on whom he has mercy on his compassion who is compassion the bride has lots of mercy grace and compassion accents to them and if if god's revealing your bride your your mercy and compassion can go out to others too because you hold a very powerful place with the lord with the word it's it's a that's a great it's such a great thing to know your compassion will help and change other people's lives it's not the lord gave his bride power he gave him the word the sword the lord is with us the lord cared he didn't want in he didn't come to he came that everybody would come but he's chosen but our compassion can still change lives our prayers can change lives i want to turn to luke 15 20. when he rose he came and he rose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and his compassion ran and fell on his knees and kissed him now if i remember rightly this is a this is the one of the prodigal sons he was hungry and he came home and he he you know his inheritance he had spoiled he had he had turned from god he'd turned from his father's will we've done everything wrong and when he came home his father ran out to meet him he didn't make him big or grovel the lord doesn't make us big or go he he runs out to us and he gives us his best robe he puts his blood on us he washes us from sins and cleanses us makes us to his own image and that's what the lord's doing right today he has compassion on us i'm so glad that with his compassion comes the land comes healing comes faith comes overcoming power of all spiritual wickedness you can claim your family it's not just some small promises everything is ours we do need to possess the land that we are in the rapture cycle that's the point of time we are the prophet has come with the message we are moving forward it's the truth want to turn to mark 141 a lot of these scripts are just um times throughout the bible where he speaks of compassion and how it was extended and what the people have done around them like like the son who had gone out and when he came home how the father reacted he didn't he didn't scorn him he didn't put him down he welcomed him and i'm so glad jesus welcomes us you know through all of our shortcomings when we do wrong he welcomes us home i was going to read from actually 39 and he preached in the synagogues throughout all galilee and casted devils and they came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canist make me clean and jesus move with compassion put forth his hand and touched him and said unto him i will be thou clean as soon as he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed from him he was cleaned and he was straightly charged and he strongly charged him and went for and sent him away and he said unto him see thou say nothing to any man but go thy way show thyself to the priest and offer for cleansing those things which moses commanded for a testimony unto them and i want to jump over to mark 5 19. i don't know why he didn't say to tell anybody in that scripture but over in 5 19 if i've got the right one however jesus suffered him not but unto him go home tell thy friends and tell them how great things the lord have done for thee and here compassion on thee this is the story with the man that had the legion of demons and he hate compassion but the lord said the lord had compassion i'm sorry i'm getting ahead of myself i thought sorry i thought that was a story where he told him to go tell how the lord had compassion that's right i want to turn over to mark 9. 22. jesus before in 21 just asked how long since this happened to the child 22 in off times it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him this is talking of evil spirit on the boy but if the arcanist do anything have compassion on us and help so this dude's asking for compassion and jesus said unto him if thou cannot believe all things are possible to him they believeth we're all believers here so all things are possible it's fantastic and straight away the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord help me help thou my unbelief and when jesus saw the people saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying to them thou dumb and death spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter into him no more so this stood out to me because he didn't just charge him and cast me he said enter into him no more he gave he he commanded that demonic spirit no more you will go into this person i wanna um touch uh i want to carry on down here with this particular spirit he he said he told him not to go go and i'm sorry i should just keep reading so i'll just keep reading and the spirit cried and rented him saw and came unto him and he was as one that was dead and so much that many said he is dead when the spirit had left him and jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately why would we not cast them out because they couldn't they couldn't cast me even though over in luke 9 1 jesus had already given power for him to cast all devils and diseases the spirit wouldn't leave and i asked lord why why could we not cast this this specific demon out and i asked him privately about this and he said unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by fasting and praying and this is what i wanted to get to in the sermon but because i believe there's some keys in here for us that really help us overcome the lord had compassion on this person the the son's dad had compassion and brought him to be healed jesus had compassion on that person and when he had rebuked the spirit he said enter no more so he he gave he he sent an authority over the demons but he said no more and then and then the disciples were like okay so no more he can't but then they went to him and said why couldn't we do it and he said because you're not fasting and praying this forth will not come forth by passing and praying and when you fast in prayer you're having an intimate relationship with the lord jesus and if you're praying for someone that has spirits on them you're showing compassion on them and that is as you're surrendering your life part of your time to intercede for that person to help them overcome and i think it's very important when we're praying for people if they're going through something in our church or our friends our family to fast and pray for them to help them overcome to have compassion because the spirits in this day and age are all linking together fortifying so we can't so we can't remove them you know so we don't have anointed sons of god serving the lord i just want to read a description of brother ben and quotes john 5 19. then jesus answered said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but will he see the father do it do for what things so ever he doeth these also do with the sun likewise amen it's um it's good it's good that we see that the father faster than jesus faster than pray to the fat the father as you know so we can see to do that too if we see someone struggling we can enter into their burden and have compassion and we can overcome stronger demonic spirits that are battling with our children or our families our lost ones to help them overcome that's right brother branham showed so much compassion this is speak to the rock how do you do sir do you believe me to be a prophet our lord is the same yesterday today and forever he's always full of full of mercy and compassion for those who believe on his name i trust that you do sir this man had a blood disease but this thing stuck out to me because he said he's always full of compassion for those who believe on his name you know when jesus died he had compassion for his lost seed and his compassion was lost seed he didn't necessarily have compassion for serpent seed for the people that actually aren't saved i don't have a place in the book of eternal life he didn't have compassion to them that's why he went through the uh the the waters to stir up the waters you know the angel said the waters once a year when he went through he went through lots of blind and hot altered and laying people but he only had compassion on one person as a person with a blood issue i believe um people don't know what compassion is compassion and love is the will of god this is from brother branham and looking for jesus and you can only exercise that as god gives it not human emotional passion not emotional love but divine love which can only be be rendered and given by god i'm so glad the lord showed compassion on me and you believers we would be lost without him i've just got a couple more scriptures but i wasn't sure if i was going to use them i'll just read this one out for you um this is deuteronomy 3 uh deuteronomy 30 and three almost the wrong one i saw aside from two and shall return unto the lord thy god and shall obey his voice according to all that i command thee this day that thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy soul and then the lord thy god will return will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return to gather thee from all the nations whether the law thy god hath scattered thee i'm so glad that he has doing that now he's calling a bride he's he's going out to everybody don't let yourself be tricked by the devil the devil don't don't even listen to him in the garden of eden if eve hadn't even listened to the serpent and reason with the word of god we would never know jesus redeeming love but we do because it happened and that's fine but don't don't give don't give these things to the devil all these things or your mind secure them give them all to the lord and don't don't let things come against the word of the lord and sit in your mind don't let ill feelings come in don't let scorn come in don't let anything ungodly come in the christ is all revealed to the word if you do this is i wasn't going to edit him i i felt like i didn't want to but i just want to read it to you guys it's um proverbs 22 10. the lord lord gave to me a long time ago and the the scripture says cast out the scorn and contingent shall save ye and strife ye strife and reproach shall cease the devil tries with everything you know like it just it'll just be one little thing you know someone let's just say someone makes a mistake and it's real funny and you and you laugh and you're embarrassing you snicker to yourself about it you know you're scoring that person if they're just trying their best to serve the lord to surrender that's good for them but we can never look on upon someone and scorn or because that scorn bring it can bring an element of pride in the situation and that's like to me it's the opposite of compassion and the lord in the in this he said you know he gave us a way to get rid of it too he said cast a school in a row and contention shall go out and strife shall go and reproach i'll see so if you if you if you if you're struggling just just look at your life and see how you're treating people with if people are falling by mistakes are you showing compassion are you praying for them are you training your will and asking the lord to help them or are you laughing at their mistakes going haha i was once there or you're really caring for them because you know we all want to go on a rapture we all want to be ruptured and we don't want to leave anybody here we don't want anybody to be the devils or go to hell it's not it's not what the bride wants the bride will sigh and cry for the abominations that are done i hope this thing's helped you to our young kids it's good to see you you guys will be up here soon protect your minds give you all to christ okay god bless you all i hope this helps i hope you got something amen praise the lord um the heavenly vision and compassion amen what these brothers just did was push the kingdom of god forward because amen because there has been there has been something in that for everybody that has changed your life for the better for the kingdom of god that's that's the fact right so so what your brothers did was push forward the kingdom of god and i feel like we're moving forward and so uh and us being us we're not gonna we're not gonna lose any ground that we've gained and we certainly aren't to stop moving forward when we've got the enemy on the run either so i think we should we need to book on you seem to be the group administrator [Laughter] we need to book another one and i think yeah hey it done yep we're not going to lose any crowded man and we're just going to keep pushing forward and you ain't seen nothing yet that's how we do it around here because that's that's the king we are called to push forward for the kingdom of god that's what we do we push forward there the armor of god had nothing on his back there's no protection on the back anyone turn around and ran you go on all the protection is on the front because we're only called to move forward amen so the next time i think too there's a um we've got um brother jimmy is going to be up as well the next time so there'll be three we'll have three three ministers on the next one so we're looking forward to that no pressure bro but praise the lord the lord is doing good things and we serve a powerful god and
