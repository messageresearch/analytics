========================================

Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] Good Morning. We were doing a mic check when we had had at a little church in Gizbon. [music] We were setting something up and um it was um Marcus Maloney had to [music] do a little mic check and um when he got up there and spoke into [music] the mic he said uh good morning friends. I thought that's good. I know what he's been listening to. [laughter] Well, good evening, friends. So, good [music] morning, friends. How are you? You good? You ready to praise the Lord? You all refreshed and had a good sleep and ready to just give your all to the kingdom of God this morning and hear the word of God and and and leave this place more victorious than what you are right now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're we're in we're amongst great company this morning. Then let's um let's [music] stand and let's um let's invite the Lord to be here with us. Lord Jesus, we thank you, Lord, that we can walk in victory, Lord, when we're walking with you, Lord, that there's so much strength, Lord, and and so much power in your presence in your spirit, Lord. That's an an everlasting stream, Lord, of love and of power, Lord, and of a sound mind. So, we just thank you, Lord. May you just refresh each heart this morning with the Holy Ghost. Lord, we know that we go through many [music] ups and downs, Lord, but if we just are continually filled with your with your spirit, Lord, [music] it just we can make it through everything that that comes our way, Lord. So, we just want to humbly invite you into our presence. You said where two or three are gathered in your name that there you are in the midst. So, we just know that by faith you're here with us this morning, Lord. [music] May just bless us. Bless the songs. Bless the the word, Lord. May we receive it as being from you and not just a natural experience, Lord, but we draw on the gift, Lord, and that you speak to our hearts this morning. So, we just pray and we just commit the service to your hands in Jesus name. Amen. I was just listening to a sermon last night and this um I fell asleep then I woke up and I heard this but it really blessed me. It says um brother says, [music] "I tell you that's a very good thing to preach on." And he's talking about John that preached on um loving little children love one another. And he says little children love one another. He said as I get old in the ministry now and my about in my 21st year I think all the time as I go along that this the more I think of the Lord Jesus the more I begin to find out that it's love that covers the whole thing. The love of God that's the love of God shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit. You know, and as you go through the ups and the downs, the highs, the lows, the church, the work, the family, the whatever you might go through, you you begin to realize, you know, it's just it's really the love of God in every situation. When you let that come through, and whatever situation it might be, it's that it's that that just holds it all together. You know, it refreshes us. It it just, as Brother Brandham said, [music] the more I begin to find out that it's love that covers the whole thing. So, may the love of God just um fill us this morning. Let's sing um He's still in the fire and he's walking in the flame. Uh let's go with the Let's start with the chorus.

How the wicked king commanded they be thrown [music] into the flame because they would not bow and then deny their father's name. Mama said the king stood high upon the balcony so tall. And when he looked up, he was shocked by all the [music] things he saw because he thought that he would finally lay it dead upon the ground. But instead [music] of three, he counted four, walking all around. Well, I said, [music] "Mama, [singing] wait a minute. There's one thing that I must know." But the street ran in a tree came out and where that mango and I never will forget. Mama [music] danced across the floor. These were the words I heard her say while shouting [music] through the door.

God bless you, friends. &gt;&gt; Good to see everyone. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. So, what? Yep. You can musicians, you can have your seats and um you can all have your seats. Actually, just want to give a real quick trip report. So, greetings from the Philippines. Wonderful time. Um what's happened here? Have I broken it? No. Okay. So, thank you for your prayers first and foremost. Now, can we see that? You probably can't see that too well. So, um there was a couple of typhoons before and during when I was there. I got a couple of messages I think Sunday or Saturday morning saying, "Are you okay?" Okay, cuz he was a super typhoon. Um, so this um I wish I had a pointer, but so this bottom line here, you can see that's the path of the storms, right? So the so the bottom one was a um typhoon that went through I think a couple of days before I arrived and then in the red there was a super typhoon that made landfall north of Manila. Um thankfully we were um un unscathed. Uh we yeah was uh barely any problems there, but uh quite a few people um lost their lives in these typhoons. So, it was it really impacted people. I don't know if you can read the numbers, but you know, there was um a lot of people affected uh in both of those storms. A lot of people. But we thank you for your prayers. They kind of passed us by. We're in the middle of it. We were unaffected, but it affected a lot of people's travel. Um unfortunately, um Pastor Angel couldn't come and come down. That would have been wonderful. But next time we'll see brother John Bravo's um dad. So, uh yeah, but thank you for your prayers there. Um, so the Philippines is a different place. It's amazing, you know. It's it's like so the greater Manila area. So there's 115 million people in the country. 40 million of those live in the greater Manila area. This is eight times New Zealand in this kind of metropolis of this is this is what I woke up to the first morning. There's um a school is doing a fire evacuation drill. There's lots of people around. You know, those are all school kids um holding their bags. I'm sorry there's no sound, but there's a lot of noise. big cities, there's a lot of noise. So, um, but the believers are amazing there. Um, I try and skip through this, so I don't want to turn it into like this tourist video, you know, but, um, then, so, you know, there's a lot of traffic. Um, this doesn't do it justice, but there's heaps of, um, motorbikes. There's like there's no I think road rules are a guideline there. You know, you kind of just pull in and you toot your horn and everyone knows where everyone's going somehow. It's incredible. You know, New Zealand couldn't cope with this deal. you know, people would be road raging and stuff here, but yeah, it just kind of works where there's a sea of traffic and people and um Yeah. Yeah. So, it's quite amazing. Um yeah, so this side streets are very narrow. Don't know if that Yeah. So, somehow they kind of drive through there with vehicles, not just motorbikes. They're like the kings of tight spaces. It's amazing how they fit in and they build everything. And um anyway, so we went there for brother Ron Malivu's church anniversary. So, that's him in the middle there. Um so he's been out here um many years ago. Um but he came to the Lord. So when he was young, so this is the 31st year anniversary for their fellowship. When he came to the Lord, well before that he was he was a rock and roll. He had a rock and roll band playing in pubs on drugs. That was him. Then God began to deal with his life. Eventually he came to the message. He'd been through many different denominations. Nothing satisfied until this word found him, transformed his life. So that's um so that's brother Ron in the middle. Uh to to to my left that's um Pastor Clement from Zimbabwe. He's a good friend of uh brother David Gonzalez who came later but um he wanted to come and experience the Philippines. So he came. He was a real blessing. And then to the taller brother to brother Ron's his right. We're going this way. Um so that's um uh that's brother Kendall from from uh Canada and he does mission work. He goes preaches there. He's like 28 years old. And uh he was it was interesting like after I preached at the min I mean I'm at the anniversary meeting he came met me all excited he's like do you see the pillar of fire do you see the pillar of fire I'm like no I've never seen the pillar of fire said well I saw him today he was there he was there in the meeting you know so I mean the the angel of the lord accompanies the word &gt;&gt; okay so if you have the word the angel of the lord accompanies you right amen but anyway he was super excited by that and um yeah it was real nice to get to know him uh he just came virtually out of the world too God found him at university I felt like I was talking to my former self in a way. But anyway, it's just quite neat how God works, you know. And then to the left of well to the right of him, so to our left, that's u that's pastor Michael Nutter. He's the only message pastor in Korea. &gt;&gt; There's only one church in Korea. He's the pastor of it. He's um so so he's full-blooded Korean, but he was raised he was a war baby, war orphan from the Korean War. Uh he was adopted into the States and raised there. Uh he was a Baptist minister, different things. when this message came his way, changed his life. Praise the Lord. So anyway, that's uh yes, that's who was there. Um yes, he spoke as well. It was great to finally meet him, seeing that sister Hannah and Esther are there already. So trying to get them to meet up and things and you know, have some fellowship and yeah, but yeah, it's um so there was um so at the anniversary meetings, this is all the pastors and ministers there. There was about 25 churches represented. They hired this hall. they can only fit so many people so they couldn't not everyone could just come but um brother Ron does a lot of mission work among the Filipino people uh so a lot of those brothers are from different parts of the country uh few of them came out of say the two souls doctrine different false doctrines he went and just taught them the word and brought them out so he's done a lot of work for people there has a real heart to see people really know the Lord and um and then we had so after um after that that was the Saturday uh we had the anniversary meetings I just had two services there and um and then we had so brother David Gonzalez and his wife um they um they send their greetings, sister Joanne because I think your sister's there with them, right? Yeah. So um yeah, they send their greetings and I thought it was special to meet them because I don't know who was who remembers when they came through through through Wellington and spoke. Yeah. He was our first ever visiting minister back in the day. &gt;&gt; Like back in the day day. Okay. So, it was nice to catch up with them again. They're doing well. So, yeah, it was really really neat to meet them. Um, we don't have any um maybe we'll just um we don't have any audio. Maybe I could just Yeah, I was going to do like a big uh video bomb on WhatsApp. Maybe I'll do that later. Anyway, this is them speaking. I mean I mean I mean singing very musical people. Brother Kabin, I thought you'd enjoy this. You see the the matchy matchy? They do this every year, different colors. So I just gave someone some inspiration and uh church choirs. Tell you what, they can sing. That's a real Yeah, it was just real good atmosphere. And then so that was the um Saturday. Um then um Sunday morning we're at brother Ron's church um and this is Yeah, this is a church. It's like a five-story building. Very well built with different build um areas and things and um in uh in a very tight space. And then we had the youth banquet. Um, and one thing I thought was neat with the youth banquet is they had a sign-in thing. This is not everyone, but you had to draw your your picture as you sign in. So, it's pretty cool. Anyway, so I'm there somewhere. Um, and then so they had the youth banquet from churches from all around and not everyone could come because of the typhoons and so on, but many different uh people came and it [snorts] really So, a lot of the young people, they said their fire was reit. God really did a lot for a lot of people in these over these times when I was there. It really people were you know you know they had storms come through people you know who are organizing part of the church organizing the special meetings. It felt like they had just lived out what we live out before our camp. You know, the devil's fighting, there's trouble, there's fussing, there's problems, all these kind of things. The devil trying to upset the apple cart, you know, but God, you know, if you know, if we just keep the course, God always turns up on his time, right? So, yeah, but a lot of them, they, you know, a lot of the young people here, they um yeah, they said their fire got lit. They're going through things. Prodals coming home wayward, just drifting. But then God got a hold of them through the word of God. So, it was incredible time in that regard, you know. So, we really thank the Lord for all your prayers. Sorry, it's very brief, but I kind of try and keep these things brief, but God's God lives. The same God there is the same God here. Okay? I felt like I was at home over there. Just the liberty, just the love, just wonderful people. If you ever get a chance, go there and have a visit. You'll be blessed. Amen. So, um don't know if we have any more things to Yeah. But yeah, that's the youth banquet. Oh, wait. Sorry. So that was the youth banquet. They hired another place. Man, their musicians have a lot of fun. I thought of you, Jimmy. You should have seen them. [laughter] But lovely people. They love the Lord. Have some real testimonies, experiences, but just real genuine Christian people. And um yeah, it was it was really special. So, [snorts] amen. So, let's um let's stand this morning. I'm sorry that's very brief. You say, "Well, what else happened?" Well, I'm happy. You go to a place, fire of God falls on people, they take that fire home. I think that's pretty good. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you know, see the Holy Ghost move like that. It was really, really special. So, um, thank you for your prayers so much. Amen. So, we're just going to read from, um, first Peter 4:12-16. I, I, um, preached this, uh, in a way over there, and I just really enjoyed it, so I'm going to preach it here. That's okay. And, um, I'm still probably 5 hours in the past somewhere kind of rejuggling, but um, yeah. So, just bear with me this morning. But, let's read here. 1 Peter 4 and 12 down to uh 16, he says, "Beloved, think not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you. But rejoice in so much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye. For the spirit of glory and the God of um and of God resteth upon you. On their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. But let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busy body in other men's matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him be not ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf. Amen. And then we just got one more scripture from Revelations chapter 3. Also like to thank brother Isaac and brother Jimmy for speaking. I I either stream those or watch them later. Those are real blessings. So, thank you so much. Thank you for all those who helped uh my family keep going when I was away. Um Jenny and and and Stephanie, different ones really appreciate that too. Uh thank you so much. Uh so, Revelations 3 and 14. And unto the angel of the church, the lady of right these things sayeth the amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot or would that thou work cold or hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm, neither cold or hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, increase with goods, and need of nothing, knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable, poor and blind and naked. I can count counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, thou mayest be rich, and white raignment, thou mayest be clothed, at the same uh that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with um Isav that thou mayest see. Amen. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. You can have your seats. Um, this morning I want to speak about being the mouthpiece of God. Okay, this is very important. This is the age where the voice of God is in the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. So, you know, as we look at this here, we've got to realize that everything happens for a reason. Okay? We're not going through life just just being battered and bruised and, you know, going through a trial and no, no. Every trial is is is for our good. Now I was looking at this the other day. This is when I was uh traveling or something and you know just a thought came to mind. Why does Peter call it a fiery trial? Why is it not a cold trial or just a hard trial or just a trial? Why is it fiery? Now fire fire produces heat. Amen. Now fire produces heat. Now God wants us to be not lukewarm as we read the um read there in Revelations chapter 3 that the penalty of this age or the or the major complaint of this age is being lukewarm. This is a lukewarm age. But just because the age is lukewarm, it doesn't mean we have to be lukewarm as well. No, but God doesn't want us to be that way. He has conditioned us actually to be fiery hot. Amen. This is how God has actually made us is that everything we go through, the reason they're called fiery trials is it's a heat. Amen. It causes us to be more on fire for God because you realize when a trial strikes you, you may not understand what you're going through, but it causes you to be more sincere, be more dedicated, draw closer to God. Amen. It doesn't cause you to go the other way. It actually pulls you into the presence of God. And what does that do? That makes you more on fire. Amen. It makes you more hot, makes you more fervent. Doesn't make you lukewarm. Doesn't make you indifferent. Doesn't make you cold. We don't sit back and say, "Lord, this is not fair." We say, "God, we know everything's working for our good." Amen. God, you're going to produce deity in my life through this trial. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's what God's going to do, right? So, this is this is the age of of lukewarmness, but we are not lukewarm, cuz God wants us to be hot. That's why trials are called fiery, as Peter would say, the fiery trials. You got to realize every trial you go through is fire. It's to heat you up. It's not a freezer. It's not an ice box. It's not a cooler. It's not a wet blanket. There may be wet blankets around you, but eventually they will catch fire, too. Amen. You just let the fire of God burn in you and consume everything around you. It'll take care of those things. But every trial, you got to realize, I'm sure you as people look at me, you know, you think actually every trial has made you more sincere. &gt;&gt; You may be broken, you may be bruised, you may be whatever more, but it makes you more sincere. That makes you more on fire. Remember, because it takes sincerity to bind the ma. As brother Bram saw that vision, he was twothirds of the promised land walking on the path. He saw that black mumber like that snake come out and trying to bite his friend and he's interceding for him. And you know then but then but then you know the prophet was wondering what can I do? How am I going to deal with this? And God said that it takes sincerity to bind him. This is this represents death and everything under it. So he just prayed God make me more sincere. So even in this vision he was going through a trial but it was it wasn't making him lukewarm. was making him more sincere. And and brother and the Lord told him, "You must be more sincere to bind this spirit." Amen. He says he said, "Lord, forgive me. Make me more sincere." Amen. And then he and then he had power and he spoke to that thing when it tried to come against him. Now, it couldn't bite him because he had he had a a he had a force field, amen, of the Holy Ghost that that death could not strike his soul. We to realize the devil can get our hit our body, hit our spirit. That doesn't mean we're not a Christian. That doesn't mean we're not saved. I'm just going to pour it on thick this morning, okay? That doesn't mean we're not have unbelief. That doesn't mean we've done something wrong. No. God allows every spirit to come against us. Amen. Cuz he wants to prove our faith. He wants it to be a fiery trial. He wants it to anoint us that he can speak through us. That it's not just God speaking through the prophet. He's God speaking through you. Amen. He wants to take your vocal cords and speak. Amen. Just like he spoke through the prophets of old, through brother Brandham, through the Lord Jesus being God himself, that same God wants to live in you and speak. Amen. So that's why now that power was given to brother Bram to bind that mambber. Right? But that same power is not just with him. It's with you. Amen. Cuz it was the anointing of God and the prophet that bound that mumber. It wasn't him and his humanity. It was God speaking. &gt;&gt; You're in that condition this morning. If you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you can bind every unclean spirit. Amen. every spirit that comes against you that see it can't bite your soul. You got to realize that. Amen. It can bother you. You can get sick. You can have a mind battle. That doesn't mean you're not a Christian. That doesn't mean you're not overcoming. That doesn't mean you're not filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. That just shows you're a human being. But you've got a you've got a greater that's he that's in you than he that's in the world. Amen. Power of God, the life of God within you that can overcome all those things. So that thing couldn't bite him, but it could bite his friend. So, you see, this is why we've got to be very sensitive and aware to what others are going through. Amen. Because we may be all on the same path, but it doesn't mean everyone's got the Holy Ghost. Eventually, we all will. That's why we have church, is it not? Amen. That God would touch lives, refill us that have the Holy Ghost. If no one has the Holy Ghost, that they would meet God and receive the Holy Ghost. That's that's part of why we have church. Would grow and mature in the Lord. Amen. So, what did he do? He interceded for his friend. He bound that mumber and then he could see well just to see if I've really got power to loose or to bind I loose you and the and the thing became a live snake again. Then he bound it and became like a you and symbol. He stood he he said there he stood he meshed on it for a while. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I just like that that's free. But you know that power is within you this morning. &gt;&gt; It's within you. You say oh one day one day. No no today. Today we're the sons and daughters of God today. Amen. And God has placed us in the body of Christ. Today we are the bride of Christ. Today we have dominion. We are kings and priests to our God today. Oh, one day in the millennium. No, today you've been made in that condition. Today God has placed you there. So why not use your position? Amen. Why not actually take God at his word? Let him speak through you and deal with every situation of your life. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This is why we rejoice when it's fiery trials. You realize God's going to speak. God's going to speak. &gt;&gt; Remember, many times we just let let the devil speak and we leave it there. You got to realize when the devil comes, God's going to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, the devil touched Job, but Job stood on that sacrifice of the blood of the lamb waiting. Then God spoke in his time. &gt;&gt; Dealt with the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm just going to read this a bit. Hope you don't mind. But this is just from the church age book. Says we're going to look at this carefully. It says that this lady in church age group is lukewarm. This lukewarmness demands a penalty from God. The penalty is that they will be spewed out of his mouth. Here is where we don't want to go astray as a lot of folks do. They are very un they very unwisely say that God can spew out of his mouth. And that proves there's no such thing as any truth of the doctrine of the perseverance of the saint. Um yeah, if that's how you say that word. I want to correct your thinking right now. This verse does not uh is not given to an individual. It's given to the church. He is talking to the church. Furthermore, if you just keep the word uh in mind, you'll recall that nowhere does it say we are in the mouth of God. We're engraved on his palms. We're carried in his bosom way back in the unknown ages before time. We were in his mind. We are in his sheepfold and in his pastures, but never in his mouth. But what is in the mouth of the Lord? The word is in his mouth. Matthew 4:4. But he answered and said, "It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. The word is supposed to be in our mouths, too." Now, we know that the church is his body. It is here taking his place. What will be in the mouth of the church? The word. 1 Peter 4:11, "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles, the word of God." Second Peter 1:21, for the prophecy came not an old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Then what is wrong with these people of the last day? They've gotten away from the word. They're no longer fervent about it. They are lukewarm. They are lukewarm about it. And I'm going to prove that right now. So it says, "Let uh if any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God." Now, if we could categorize what we speak through the day, what category does it fall under? Is it gossip? Is it malice? Is it strife? Is it unbelief? Is it insecurity? Is it doubt? What are you speaking to one another? Or is it faith? Is it love? Is there strength in your words? Does it stabilize? Does it bring peace? Do you speak promises? Because the word of God should be in our mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. What does that word say? Thine and thy house shall be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's my shepherd. He's my shelter. He's my strong tower. He's my strength. He's my guide. Amen. He's my all and all. Are those the things that come out of our mouth? If we could categorize everything that we say in a day. Oh, but what about work and all? Yeah, we're going to talk about natural things, but what kind of if I can put it's probably not the right word, but what kind of spin do you put upon it? Yes, there's problems, but what how do you talk about the problem? Oh, we can't deal with it. No, that's not a that's not what a believer says. A believer says, "Yeah, the problem's there, but the one in me can move that problem." &gt;&gt; Amen. The one in me can take care of that problem. There's nothing. You know, Brother Brham said about the thief on the cross that repented. He actually said God never entered. Not a single thought of God entered into his mind until that moment. &gt;&gt; It was this predestinated moment. But he wasn't thinking about God all the time. He didn't even think about God until that moment that he saw the lamb of God manifested in front of him. &gt;&gt; Oh, I say Lord, fill our mouth with your word. Lord, fill our actions with you, Lord Jesus. That when people come across our path, God will come on their mind and they'll start thinking about him and God will start convicting them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we all okay this morning? You know, I pray that God would live through us in such a way that people actually begin to think about the Lord and their state with him. Amen. And and they don't stay lost, they get found. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just sorry, I just cut out a paragraph. You can read this more in the church church age book. He says, "Now, right down to the line to uh come to the Pentecostals. They have the word. Give them the word test and see." They'll sell out the word for manifestation at just about every time. If you can produce a manifestation like oil and blood and tongues and other signs, whether in the word or not, or whether properly interpreted from the word, the majority will fall for it. But what has happened to the word? The word has been put aside. So God says, "I'm going to go against you all. I'll spew out of my mouth. This is the end." For seven out of seven ages, I've seen nothing but men esteeming their own word above mine. So the end of this age, I'm spewing you out of my mouth. It's all over. I'm going to I'm going to speak. All right. Yes, I'm here in the midst of the church. The amen of God, the faithful and true, will reveal himself. It will be by my prophet. Oh yes, it is so. Revelations 10:7. the days of the voice of the seventh uh messenger when he shall begin to sound. The mystery of God shall be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. There it is. He's sending a vindicated prophet. He's sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years. He's sending someone who's so far from organization and education and the word of religion, a world of religion. That is John the Baptist and Elijah of old. He will speak only from God. And he'll have thus sayeth the Lord and speak for God. He'll be God's mouthpiece. And he, as it is declared in Malachi 4:6, will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers. He will bring the elect of the last days, and they will hear a vindicated prophet give an exact truth as it was with Paul. He will restore the truth as they had it. And those elect with him in that day will be the ones that will truly manifest the Lord. Amen. And be his body and be his voice and perform his works. Hallelujah. Do you see it? Amen. So, there's a group of people in the land that are his body. I'm going to I'm going to speak about that a following Sunday or something. I've been enjoying just the thought of it anyway. I'll leave that for later. But you see there there are people who are not lukewarm, not indifferent. No, but they got a fire in their soul. I mean, a passion for, you know, for the Lord in spite of whatever go, you know, the devil throws against them. Amen. It all it is is a fiery trial that just heats up the furnace. I mean, heats them up. And that fire isn't there to destroy you. It's there to keep you warm. Amen. And it's there to give life. Amen. Remember, fire gives life. The sun is a ball of fire. If that turned off, where would we be? &gt;&gt; We'd be an icicle floating like there any other planet, right? But because it's there, because we're in the right position, all those things, we have life on this planet. &gt;&gt; Amen. And because the word of God isn't now, it's not distant somewhere, but the word of God is neither even in thy mouth and thy heart. Amen. That fire is in the right position. Amen. that God can speak. Who's ever had the experience you've prayed and you know it's not you praying? &gt;&gt; What's that? That's that's actually God taking your lips and speaking. Who's ever spoken something to someone you realize it's not you and God proves it to be him. &gt;&gt; That's not you speaking. That's him speaking. See people see see the church world, they just think, well, if you think of something and speak it, therefore it's God. No, that's just human carnality. just an impersonation trying to put a scarecrow in front of the, you know, in front of the fact that God is speaking through his body in the last days. See, the true bride of Christ isn't trying to just think of things they like to say and humanly say it and say, "Oh, that's God." No, it's God takes your vocal cords and speaks through you without you even realizing it. It's like the same with Isaiah prophesying, "A virgin shall conceive." You know, Brother Bram said if he was conscious of what he was saying, he probably wouldn't have said it because it seemed so impossible. But yet God spoke that through his lips. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we must not let this world call us down. &gt;&gt; No, God puts you through a trial. And it's not because Wait, let's just continue this. I feel like I I got to behave. Okay. Now, a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate that thought is. In the last ages, the world the word was almost entirely lost to the people. But God sent Luther with the word. The Lutheran spoke for God at that time, but they organized. And again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not the simple word. They could no longer speak for God. Then God sent Wesley. He was the voice with the word in his day. The people who took his revelation from God became living epistles read and known of all men for their generation. Then the Methodists failed. God raised up others. And so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there's again a people in the land who under their messenger will will be the final voice to the final age. Yes. So the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It is it is its own mouthpiece. So God is turning on her. He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. For the voice of God will be in her. Yes it is. Amen. For it says in the last chapter of Revelation 17th verse the spirit and the bride say come once more. more the world will hear direct from God is at Pentecost. But of course, the word bride will be repudiated as in the first age. Amen. So he's saying that the word of God, the voice of God is already in her. We're not waiting for something else to come. We don't need some big fandangle preacher to come and reveal this to us. It's already been released into this age. Amen. It's already been given through the message of the hour. And the voice of God is in us. That's why the fiery trials come because God wants to use you as a mouthpiece. I'm not a preacher. I'm not even talking about preaching necessarily. Talking about a lived voice. I mean, a lived life where the where where where the Bible is put on flesh. Amen. And what you speak and do, your actions, all those things is actually the Bible living. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's what he wants. Amen. Now, fiery trials. Well, now the reason that that that we can stand fiery trials is because the word is in us. By the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you become part of the Bible. That's a quote. Okay? Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away. So, it doesn't matter what seasons come, what happens, comes, there's something in you that endures, that is eternal, that is fixed. Right? Remember, there's once upon a time you just floated with the stream. What's hashtag trending today? I'm doing that. I'm dressing this way. I'm acting this way. But then something happened. &gt;&gt; What happened to you? You were just a bunch of driftwood floating. But then God got a hold of your wood. Amen. Crafted you into a boat and but didn't just leave you floating with the tide without an engine. He put an engine in you. Amen. The dynamics of the Holy Ghost and you can go upstream. Doesn't matter how strong the current is. There's a power within you. It's an inexhaustible supply. It won't run out of fuel. No. This thing fuels itself. Amen. Hallelujah. And what gives you power to go beyond or go over the current. Doesn't matter what obstacle comes your way. Your bow is is is manufactured built in such a way you'll break through every obstacle. Nothing can sink you. &gt;&gt; Oh you the devil tries to put fear on. Oh, you're going to go too far and you're going to fail. I can't fail cuz God's in me. The unfailing one. &gt;&gt; I may humanly fall and make mistakes, all those things, but there's something made within us that we just get back up. You may be get that sucker punch. You may get blindsided, just get flawed on the mat, but something in you says, "I'm not staying down for the count. I can't I can't physically stay one with the mat. I've got to get up." I don't know about others, but that's just me. I I refuse to just stay there and wait for the referee to count to 10 or whatever. I'm getting back up. You know, is that all you got? Yeah, I'm here all day, you know. I'm not quitting. Amen. Why? But why? Because the word of God comes into your life and it cannot change. It cannot pass away. Now this word fiery trial it actually means a burning. It's the same word in revelations 18 the two verses there speak about the destruction of uh you know mystery Babylon all these things. So so it is a fire. It's a burning fire. Amen. But this fire is not to destroy you. It's actually to prove you to actually produ actually produce what's in your life. Now many times we think of when trials come we think well we've done something wrong. It's actually the opposite. You found grace in the sight of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You found favor just like Mary was highly favored with God. Amen. Well, you found great favor with God, too. That's why trials come. That's why tests come. It's not because God is dealing with you in such a way like I'm just going to grind him to powder. No, sir. It's because you found favor with God. Praise the Lord. That's what he says here. Now, remember, God has counted you worthy when you have a test. Many times we struggle. Am I worthy enough? Am I accepted? Well, if you're in the beloved, you're accepted. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have accepted his token, his pardon. Amen. His his great grace and favor. Well, you have you have been counted worthy. Not by your worthiness, but by his worthiness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So, when you're counted worthy, well, well, how do I know? Well, you have a test. And that test is not a final exam to see if you pass or not. That's just to prove now what that you're worthy. that the word of God is within you. Amen. When you have a trial or a test, it shows the grace of God has found you. I think we could just chew on this for a while. Put this on your refrigerator. &gt;&gt; Oh, how do I know you? Because well, are we really under grace? Well, when you go over trial or a test, it shows it. I'm not trying to be I just Let's just be happy this morning. &gt;&gt; Let's turn this on its head, right? Because often we think, "Oh, we've done this wrong and this wrong and no." Well, no, that does not mean you've stepped out of the grace of God. That means you're in the grace of God. &gt;&gt; You have found favor with God. And God believes you'll stand the test. &gt;&gt; What part of you is he really trusting in? Your humanity, your character, your upbringing, how smart you are, your human resolve. None of those things. He's counting in that seed of election that's in your soul. &gt;&gt; That's what he's counting. can remember he did the same thing by Job. Job went through a fiery trial and all that was that fire was lit under him that he could stand and say now I know my redeemer lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say all of that for that. Absolutely. Can you imagine a guy he's he's sacrificing he's giving a lamb God instituted lamb out of fear for his family. He's worshiping out of fear. Least even they think of something evil against God. You got read the scripture. He was actually he he was a believer out of fear. He had faith. He was a believer but he was afraid. What's going to happen to my family? Didn't know what happened on the other side. And you know you know he saw resurrection and botney life and all these things. But when a man dies what happens? Where does he go? &gt;&gt; So God God basically said I'm going to allow the enemy to do some things to him because I don't want him lukewarm just just guessing wondering. I want to put a fire in his life that he knows and whom he has believed. Amen. Are you all with me this morning? And and that's why he about to stand though these skin worm worms destroy this flesh. My skin worms that are in me already destroy this flesh, yet in my flesh I'll see God. I'll stand with him on the latter days on the earth. With my eyes, I will behold him. I'll come forth as gold. Amen. Though he slay me, yet I'll trust him. See, that's someone who's on fire. See, because the whole Christian experience is really to do you trust God? &gt;&gt; The Christian walk is based on trust, faith, and trust. And if you love him, you'll really trust him. &gt;&gt; Do you trust me? This is the whole thing because this is why people go, they make denominations. They go find other leadership or guidance apart from the word of God because they don't trust the word of God. See, if they really trusted the word, you don't look for anything else. You're satisfied. Lord, you're my shepherd. You're guiding me. You're keeping me. Nothing can get me without stepping over you first. Therefore, it's got to get your permission. And I know everything that comes against me is for my good. Why? to put a fire in my life that you can speak through me, Lord. That I'm not just standing here just just a, you know, what do you call it? Just being battered for nothing. No, God allows those things because God wants to express himself. Speak. Amen. [snorts] And that's what he did in Job's life. Praise the Lord. So, storms are good. Trials are good. Fiery trial. You got to Every trial you go through, you say, "I'm going through a fiery trial." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It may be a big trial, may be a small trial. It's a fiery trial. Amen. God's lighting a fire in my life cuz he wants to use these lips. He wants to use this to to live. Praise the Lord. That's what they're saying today. Here is uh here this here. Holy Ghost religion you're talking about. Won't be long that that tree will burn down. It don't burn down. Amen. It Oh, the fire only waters it. I like that. I like that phrase. The fire only waters it. This fiery trial you're going through, it's just watering me. It's just helping me to drink more of God and push out Amen. Push out to peace. Push out to joy. Amen. Push out to love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, every every single apple um seed or tree or fruit that ever was was in the very first one that God made, &gt;&gt; right? All that tree had to do that seed was planted and then it had to drink and it drank more than it needed and it pushed out a limb. Pushed out another limb. Pushed out fruit. Pushed out and then and then what that fruit went? It went somewhere else and it grew another tree. But the first one just drank and pushed out to produce the fruit of the life that's already within it. Same thing with you and I friends. There's a life within us that will produce the fruit of love and joy and peace and being longsuffering, gentleness, meekness, fa patience, all those all all the fruits of the spirit. All you got to do is drink. That's why the fire only waters it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. It only gives us new hope. Well, how can a trial give you hope? Well, before I stepped into this thing, God was already there because he leads me. He's doing it for a purpose. He wants to put a fire. Who's under a fire right now? Or who's above a fire? It's cooking you. It's heating you up. God wants you hot. He doesn't want you lukewarm. That's why he allows these things. Remember, all things work together for our good. &gt;&gt; It's the devil that makes us think it's not for our good. &gt;&gt; This is working. God is working mightily in me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It only gives us new hope. It only strengthens it. Every trial testing, every time a wind hits a tree, shoves it back and forth and and back and forth, it only loosens the root so it can grow deeper and get a better hold. Amen. Every time sickness strikes your home, every time a trial strikes your home, every time the neighbors say something bad about you, it's only shaking you, loosen you up so you can get down and get a better hold on the eternal rock of God's immovable word. That's how God does it. Amen. He sends those trials to test you, to prove you, to shake you, and to give you a new hold. Amen. That's why because you're, you know, God allows situations to come in life because he wants us to worship him by revelation, not by a nice idea. You see, before you're ever sick, it's a nice idea that he's a healer, right? But then what happens? He brings sickness and he shakes you. Then you can get a hold of that word. Amen. That that that he becomes the healer in your life. Then you can because it's a revelation to you. He's my healer. Then you can worship him. Lord, you're my healer. Beforehand, it was just a nice idea. But God shakes you till you get a hold of that word. Amen. Whenever you even even even even when you're lost, you know, I remember before the Lord found me, people would say, "God is love and God loves you." I thought, "What an airy fairy mumbo jumbo." I'm just being honest. Makes no sense. It's just vague. But then when he got a hold of my life, filled my heart with his love. What happened? He was shaking me with stirring up my nest, getting a hold of my life. Amen. It caused me to get a hold of that word. God is love. God loves you. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so glad for that. Amen. So, so everything you go through, you know, you're going through, you know, you're troubled, but he's your counselor. &gt;&gt; What's happened? That the wind is blown cuz God wants you, your roots to go down. I'm going to use this over and over. You're going to realize everything's working for your good. You're troubled. You need counsel and you you you know, you're being shaken. What's happen? Your roots are growing down because there's a rock. There's part of the rock. I'm the counselor. I'm the mighty God. And then you open the word. You hear the message. You hear a song and something just drops in. There it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who's that? Who's had that experience? &gt;&gt; What's happened? It just causes you to get a new hold. We could go on and on. You feel troubled. You get shaken. Your roots grow down. He is my peace. He's my joy. He's my satisfying portion. He's my guide. He's my shield. See, all those things require some wind. Praise the Lord. Amen. And if you got a lot of leaves, you're going to catch a lot of wind. &gt;&gt; We ain't some dead stick somewhere. &gt;&gt; I mean, we ain't living as some like dead, you know, middle of winter somewhere, all the leaves are gone off the tree. No, we're being restored to a full bloom. The restoration of the bride tree has taken place. Amen. So, we can catch a lot of wind. Got a lot of leaves. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That means that every trial will shake us the more than a dead stick. And when the wind blows through us, it doesn't give out some mournful sound. This ain't fair. Why me? Woe is me. Poor me. Some pity party sound. No, it's praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz we got green leaves. Amen. On our tree blowing. Amen. Giving praise to God. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Lazarus got sick. Theologians uh believe he died with hemorrhage of the lungs. That I don't know. The Bible doesn't say nothing. Some of the writers said it was all right. He got sick. And sometimes God tries your faith. Do you believe that? Every son that cometh to God must be tried. Think it not strange that fiery trials come because it's only done to perfect your faith. Draws you closer. They're worth more than gold to you. It perfects your faith. How does it perfect your faith? It takes your human reasoning to one side because it brings you to a place that you're reasoning what you think you know comes to its end. Amen. It's like um I think I've got the picture here. I think Jimmy had the same one. This is by Rembrandt, a famous painting of Jesus being asleep in the boat, right? Those disciples were raised on that sea. I know I've said this before, but hey, maybe I'm just getting old. I repeat myself. Okay, they they were old, right? They had raised there. They weren't old. Whatever. I'm jetlagged. Okay, they were raised on that sea. They knew the weather patterns. They knew the storms. They probably built the ship that they were sailing in. They knew how it handled. Okay? When you get when you get so um accustomed to something, you know exactly how it handles. A car, a boat, whatever it is, you know how it handles different conditions. But you see what happened is that storm came to perfect their faith. Cuz when they left to cross that sea, their faith was in their ability, &gt;&gt; right? But they had to get a hold on the fact that there was someone greater in the ship than them. And so God stirred them up because God didn't want them lukewarm indifference saying, "I can handle this." See, this is a big part of lukewarmness. It's not See, cold is complete indifference. Lukewarmness is a little bit warm, a little bit cold. So what has that got? I can kind of handle this. I know what I'm doing. Listen, you know, there's a saying, this is not my first rodeo. I've been through this before. &gt;&gt; And what is that? That's when human reasoning is actually controlled. But you see, the Lord Jesus did not want his disciples to be lukewarm or cold. He wanted them to be hot that deity could speak. They had deity in the ship with them. He had had a big meeting. He knew what was going to happen when they got on this got on the sea and he just fell asleep. Because the devil looks down and he says, "Look, we got him now, boys. He's exhausted. He's asleep on the boat. We're going to drown him." And brother Bram said, "10,000 demons go in the wind and waves saw thy drown him." And but but the reason this trial went so long is because it took that long for the disciples to get to their end, right? It took them that long because you were think about this. They they weren't fair with the sailors. They knew what they were doing. Okay? So the more you know what you're doing humanly, the longer you'll go humanly doing what you think you know what you're doing, right? But then it comes to a point, but imagine if they were just green, they just maybe, you know, they they knew nothing of sailing. They would have woken the master way earlier than they did. But because they were old salts, you know, they thought we can handle it. We can trim the trim the sails. We can drive the boat into the swells differently so we don't take on so much water. We can adjust all the all the weights and all those things. We can we know what we're doing. It took them a while to realize their reasoning was just lukewarm ideas. Amen. But they had to awaken the master. And they got to a point where they thought that the Lord Jesus was indifferent in their trial. He wasn't indifferent. He was waiting for them to wake him up. Amen. Because we're all free moral agents. &gt;&gt; God never intervenes in a way that's against your will. You have to willingly call them on the scene. Amen. So, so, but Jesus was in their ship. That's the main thing. And I trust Jesus is in your ship this morning. Amen. He's in your vessel. But you've got to but but he allowed that trial for them not to be lukewarm, not to be cold, but to be on fire that deity could raise up and speak and take preminence over the whole situation. Amen. I trust that's how you do things in life. Oh, I've got the I know what I'm doing. I know how to adult. I've done it for a while. We don't know nothing, man. &gt;&gt; Let's be honest. We know nothing. &gt;&gt; God knows everything. And the sooner you call him on the scene, &gt;&gt; the better the storm can be taken care of. But the longer you try and hold things together because you know what you're doing, you're just going to get a lot more water in the boat. &gt;&gt; And then the devil will put in your mind that Jesus doesn't care. He does care. You've got to wake him up. You've got to allow him to take over. Amen. That's the problem is man will always say, "No, I know what I'm doing." And they'll use scripture to clarify or to validate their stand. Why don't we just let the Lord Jesus have preeminence? Why don't we let him speak? Why don't we let him take control? Oh, but you don't know what I'm going through. Let's just throw that to the side, okay? There's nothing God can't handle. &gt;&gt; If he can handle hell, death, in the grave, I think he can handle your case. If he can take your sin, everyone else's sin to Calvary as a man, I think he can deal with what you're going through, &gt;&gt; right? I think Yeah, I think he's the professional in the matter, right? So, praise the Lord. Now, so all those things, but what did that do? That perfected their faith. Messiah could do everything. They were they were even shocked and surprised by what he did. What manner of man is this? What's really within our boat? And I trust that we've had enough experiences with the Lord that we could say, "Really, who's in me?" More than a religious spirit, more than a church, more than a group, more than a following, but deity is in man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Trials are here to feed us. Yeah, we pray. Give us this day our daily bread. And that's the word of God. But Caleb and Joshua would stand there with the 10 other spies and he would uh they would tell those 10 spies who brought an evil report to the land. Actually, you're looking at this the wrong way. These guys you see and you've put such a big stature on us being grasshoppers. Um they're bread. They're bread for us. This fiery trial gives you strength. Why do we eat? It tastes good, but it gives us strength, right? Amen. So he's saying these, you know, this giant, this land, the people, all these things, they are nothing but bread for us. Amen. That God is going to give us strength that God can speak, God can live, God can prove his word. So everything you're going through, it is bread. Amen. I I'll be happy then if no one else will be happy. Okay? This is food. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You say, "Well, this is a mountain of bread. This this obstacle or this this this trial is so big." Well, it's like just like eating an elephant. quoting brother and Paul. One bite at a time. &gt;&gt; Take one bite at a time. You say, "I've got a whole host against me." Well, just take down one at a time. Amen. If you're indifferent, take that one down. Amen. You got a complex, you think no one likes you, do the opposite. Take that one down. Amen. If you feel insecure, take the word of God, quote it over your life. I'm accepted in the beloved. Amen. I'm the apple of his eye. Amen. I'm his queen. I'm his all in all. I'm his family. He can't lose one of his. Amen. I'm his beloved. I'm his delight. He delights in me. The scripture says, you know, the Lord delights in you. Take those things. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, I was there. After all things, I'll still be there. The devil's getting off at some point. He's going to lake of fire, but I will still be when he's no longer Amen. So, I think we should take those things. Amen. What does that do? It takes down an enemy. It actually gives you strength. Don't wallow in your insecurity or what you think about you. No. Rejoice in what God has declared about you. Because what he says about you is not based on opinion. It's not based on your facts. It's not based on circumstance. It's not based on your age or what you're going through. No, what he says about you is eternal, perfect, and forever. &gt;&gt; And he cannot change his mind about his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm the I'm the exception to the rule. There ain't exceptions in this baby. &gt;&gt; That's everyone's the same. We got to get that thinking out of our minds. &gt;&gt; God loves you. &gt;&gt; Jesus loves me. This I know. You just have that revelation. It'll change your whole life when you realize he really loves me. And his love is not based on my performance. Not how good I am, smart I am, well behaved I am. His love that's got nothing to do with his love. It's not a human love. It's election. Amen. If this word has found you, it proves your election. It proves you're part of him. &gt;&gt; Case closed. Just go dancing. Amen. just rejoice. We don't need to be so worried. We got to confess and speak what God has said about us. But it's bread. Take one bite at a time. Kill one devil at a time. Amen. But it takes you to do it. But the devil wants to lock you into a thinking thing. Well, this is just I was just born this way. Well, get born again. &gt;&gt; I was something you Oh, you know, people say that this message is just brainwashing. I needed my brain washed. I had filthy thoughts. It was horrible. I needed this thing needed a good soaking. It needed the full dullex wash, you know. I needed the whole thing. Praise God for being brainwashed. You can clip that. I don't care. You know, I needed brainwashing. [snorts] Every man, woman, and child needs brainwashing, by the way. You understand what I mean? Eh, need the spirit to be cleansed out. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see now the word of God is immovable. Now, Enoch built the Great Pyramid. It's endured a lot of things. It's a Bible in stone. It's a monument of God in stone. It's been through a lot of things. It went through the great flood. It's been through famines. It's been through civilizations raising and going down. It endured Moses going in there, God coming and delivering Egypt. It saw It saw the whole thing. It's seen droughts, famine, disaster, wars, plagues, battles, the flood. It's seen all things, but yet it still remains. And God has allowed it to endure there as a as a monument of stone saying my word doesn't matter what condition it goes through climate change whatever whatever it doesn't matter it will endure. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now God doesn't want a monument of stone only. He wants living stones. Amen. He wants a people that are built in the image of his word. Amen. And God is going to put us in different conditions to prove my word endures. Amen. More than a stubborn attitude. more than just, oh, I'm going to be a Christian. No, it's not that. It's the word of God's taken prayer minutes in a people and they can go through wars, conflict, strife, problems, sickness, sorrow, pain, misunderstandings, hurts, resentment, whatever it is, and they will stand. Amen. Just like that pyramid stands. God wants a living witness. He wants a timetested church. Amen. That doesn't become lukewarm and indifferent because of things that happen to them. No, they stay on fire. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm looking at you, by the way. I'm talking about you today, man. He's just preaching about me all day. I pray I am preaching about you today. Amen. Say, "Yes, I am that way. God has put a fire on in my life." Amen. That I'm not lukewarm and different, cold, but there's a fire that God can speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus Christ came from heaven, uh, the glory from glory down here to build a church. And the material that he's putting in it is a time-tested material. You might come to the altar make a confession and when he finds blow holes everything else see the world is blowing the maggots in you and so forth you cannot stand. He just pitches you to one side. God wants a time pardon me a time tested church. Not somebody who's a Christian today a backslider tomorrow in and out up and down. He can't place you nowhere. But he's got a church that's tested. Went through trials through losses through sickness through sorrow through death and still stand with a testimony. just comes to mind the brother that wrote the song it is well with my soul lost everything what was the response he wasn't lukewarm he was on fire so what was the response of God that came out of his lips that that song he went through everything I trust we could stand with the same resolve and and I don't think he was planning what he said it just came out it is well with my soul when peace like a Whoever attendeth my way, when sorrow is like sea below's roll, whatever my lot, thou has taught me to know it is well with my soul. Amen. Praise the Lord. Yes. Uh that's the man. Yes. That's the man he's looking for. I don't care if uh if you're a porper, I don't care if you're a beggar. I don't care if you're a rag picker. Whatever you are, God puts the test to you. Amen. To show that you are a timetested memorial. Now, I see that time is time is fleeing. Um, but you see, a time-t tested church, a one that goes through many things is a one that recognizes the enemy in every one of his tricks. [snorts] Amen. He realizes the devil's not a thought, but he's a real being. Right? We ain't ostriches around here that bear our heads. We don't have ostrich faith. We got eagle faith. And eagle faith that lifts us up into the heavenlies to see where we're going, where we came from. that this thing is just a little thing in time to make us fiery hot to speak. Right? So you must know he's a devil. Absolutely. At the same time you recognize him and know he's a devil and he's against you. Then to overcome, you must recognize that the God in you is greater and mightier than he is. That that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace you're more than a match for him. Amen. There's a real overcoming when you recognize you look back say I'm doing this. I'm doing that. No. Then you're defeated. But there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. Then you realize you've overcome. And you know that he's a devil. You don't say, "I've got a sickness and I don't believe it's a sickness." Oh yes, it's a sickness. &gt;&gt; I like to know the name of the enemy. &gt;&gt; It's like David asks about Goliath. Who's this guy? Who's this uncircumcised Philistine? I don't want him to be some nameless enemy. I want to know his name. &gt;&gt; Then I can take his head off. &gt;&gt; I like to know him. Don't you? That's part of going to the doctor. I believe, you know, you know, there's times where the doctor's um what do you call it? The um GP contacts me saying, "Do you want to still be on our books? You haven't visited in like 5 years." You know, but when I need to, I go to a doctor. I believe that. I believe it's God, you know, it's part of God's way of healing. I'm not against it. Okay. But I like to know what I'm facing as well. All right. Okay. But remember, greater is he. See, yeah. Um yes, it's a sickness. You got you got cancer. You don't believe it's a cancer. It's a cancer. It's a cancer. But remember, greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. You must realize the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him. That's exactly sensible. It's exactly the way the scriptures written overcoming. Amen. Because what does that enemy do? What does that thing do? It makes you hot to speak. It's a fiery trial. Daniel and his friends weren't lukewarm. When they left Jerusalem as young people, they made up their mind. We are the sons of Abraham. So therefore, wherever we go, we're going to be sons of Abraham. Jehovah is our God. We're serving him wherever we go. No church, no nothing. That's irrelevant. I'm a believer wherever they go. Now when when the king had the dream and they would they would you know he couldn't even remember the dream and his uh wise men couldn't bring the dream to his mind or they didn't know what he dreamt he wanted to kill them all. What did that do? This is a fiery trial, right? This has got a time thing on it that if they don't if they don't come up with an answer, they're going to die with all the rest of them. But what did that make them do? It didn't make them lukewarm and different saying, "God, this is not fair. You see the stand I've taken since I've left left Jerusalem and you've allowed this to come." No, it didn't do that to them. It made them hot. It gave them, it was a fiery trial for them because it made them more sincere. It brought them closer to the Lord that what happened that God could speak through Daniel and give the interpretation. I trust we do the same thing when trials come our way. It draws us closer that God could speak. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same thing the same thing when when when Daniel's three friends were thrown into the thrown into the furnace. To me, as I've said before, the great the great thing about this story is the fact they said, "We don't know what's going to happen to us, oh king, but we're not going to bow because we're not lukewarm. We're not just trying to survive and try and keep our head below the parapit." That's that's exactly the word I was looking for. You know, try and hide from things. No, we're believers. I'm gonna believe be a believer. It's who I am, right? I don't identify as one. I am one. Okay? So they just just decided, well, king, our God can save us, but if not, we're not bowing. &gt;&gt; They it didn't make them lukewarm. It now this is a literally a fiery trial. It's a furnace in front of them, but they had already made up their mind. Whatever happens, we will not compromise on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened? They got thrown in the furnace and the and the cords and things that they, you know, that they were bound by, they were loose when they came out. They didn't even have a smell of smoke on them. But the main thing is when they're in the furnace, he won. He they were loose. But why were they loosed? Because God himself came into their trial. God himself stepped into the fiery trial because they're on fire. Then God could speak. And brother Ram said that they were fellowshipping with the Lord in that furnace about what they would uh experience in the future. &gt;&gt; That's what God does. You're in a trial, right? But then something anchors in your heart. This is not my end. &gt;&gt; I'm going through this. God's going to see me through. I'm his child. When this life ends, I'm going to glory. Nothing can touch my soul. I'm safe and secure. Doesn't matter if my mind goes, my body goes, that's irrelevant. It is well with my soul. And that is the real you. Amen. It's not your body. It's not your spirit. It's not your mind or anything. It's your soul that's the real you. And then so it doesn't matter what happens to this body. &gt;&gt; I'm safe. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, the book of Psalms we so enjoy, most of it was not written when [clears throat] David was sitting in a king's palace. &gt;&gt; It was written when he was on the run from Saul. So, the fiery trial of him running from Saul and actually knowing that God would remove Saul in his time. Remember, he had two opportunities to kill to kill Saul, right? But he said, "No, God God will move him in the time." David knew he was king of Israel, right? He wasn't trying to be king. He knew he was king, right? But what happened is that fiery trial came into David's life that the book of Psalms could be written that that God could speak. Right? The Psalms is not David just writing things. It was God anointing him, but it was a fiery trial of being on the run in distress, worried, running with his men, feeling the burden of looking after them, being a fugitive in his own land. All that pressure, what the pressure do? What that fire do? May God speak &gt;&gt; to be like David. &gt;&gt; We're built with the same material. &gt;&gt; You know, David could not fully express himself like we can because he did not have God dwelling in him like we do. &gt;&gt; That's why he would say, "As a heart panth for the waterbrook, so my soul longs after you." He had such a longing and we know that's our longing too. But he could not satisfy that longing under the blood of bulls and goats, &gt;&gt; but under the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine him in this day? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I had this longing my whole life. [laughter] I couldn't EVEN MEET THE LONGING. I COULDN'T EVEN SATISFY THIS thirst under the blood of BULLS AND GOATS. YET GOD WAS WITH ME. YET GOD SPOKE TO ME. YET GOD LIVED ME. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN my soul that COULD NOT BE QUENCHED. BUT YOU, FRIENDS, UNDER THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. YOU CAN HAVE THAT LONGING SATISFIED AND NOT JUST SATIS LIKE SATISFIED LIKE YOU DON'T WANT ANYMORE BUT IT JUST GIVES YOU MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND YOU CAN WORSHIP IN A WAY DAVID COULD NEVER WORSHIP. YOU CAN WALK WITH GOD THE WAY GOD DAVID DAVID NEVER COULD. WHY? CUZ GOD IS CHRIST IS IN YOU THE HOPE OF GLORY NOT JUST WITH YOU NOT JUST ANOINTING YOU BUT ABIDING IN YOUR SOUL. HALLELUJAH. THAT WE CAN DANCE REALLY LIKE DAVID WANTED TO DANCE. WE CAN WALK LIKE DAVID WANTED TO WALK. WE CAN SPEAK LIKE DAVID REALLY WANTED TO SPEAK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have the GREATEST OPPORTUNITY. WE HAVE THE GREATEST WE'RE BLESSED. WE'RE LIVING IN A season of grace as brother Jonathan preached. AND WE'RE LIVING UNDER SUCH A BLESSED TIME THAT THIS FIERY TRIAL HAS COME INTO YOUR LIFE AS THAT DEITY WOULD SPEAK. AMEN. THAT GOD WOULD PUT ON FLESH AND LIVE OUT OF YOUR LIFE. IT'S NOT HERE TO DESTROY YOU. IT'S NOT HERE TO BEAT YOU DOWN. IT'S NOT HERE TO CRUSH YOU. IS THAT GOD WOULD GET YOU IN A POSITION THAT GOD COULD TAKE YOUR VOCAL CORDS, BYPASS YOUR MIND AND SPEAK LIKE DEITY, HE SPEAKS. AMEN. THE SAME VOICE THAT SAID, "LET THERE BE SUN, MOON, AND STARS." THAT SAME ONE LIVES IN YOU AND HE WANTS TO SPEAK OUT OF YOUR LIFE. SPEAK TO YOUR SITUATION. SPEAK TO THE ENEMY. AMEN. HE WANTS TO USE you to do it. That's why he allows fiery trials to come. I mean, we just have a longing. God, help us AND DO THIS. NO, HE WANTS TO TAKE YOU AND SPEAK TO YOUR SITUATION. DON'T SIT BACK AND SAY, "NO, HE CAN'T use me." He can use anybody. Amen. HE'LL RAISE UP ALI RATS. HE'LL RAISE UP STONES. HE'LL RAISE UP ANYONE HE WANTS TO. HE'S GOD. AND THIS TRANSFORMING POWER OF HIS BLOOD CLEANSES US THAT THERE'S NO SIN. THERE'S NOT EVEN REMEMBERED IN HIS MIND. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WE COME FROM. GOD WILL HAVE A TESTIMONY IN this end time. And he'll use you and I to have it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why not? Why not let God live through you like David wanted? Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. You say, "Well, I should I just want to read this one more thing because condemnation's a lie. Condemnation is a lie from the pit of hell. And we don't have to live under condemnation. People were talking to me in the Philippines about if they move or they do something, what if I what if I get cursed? And just struck me. How can you be cursed? Jesus became a curse for us when he hang on Calvary. He took our curse. You can't be cursed. You're blessed. You're blessed to the Lord. I'm not saying this just casually, haphazardly. If you're the bride of Jesus Christ, sure, you may put a foot and God will bring correct you, but you don't get cursed. People are so worried about stepping out of the favor of God and I'm going to put a foot wrong and God's you and the devil's going to destroy my life. We don't live that way. God is my shield. God is my strength. God is my fortress and what he has blessed he has blessed and he cannot reverse it. I mean even even see God would speak through Balum prophet true gift but a wrong vessel and God would actually tell Moab Moab this is what I think of my people. I see you know iniquity in Jacob. I mean what I've blessed I have blessed and I cannot reverse it. So if he's blessed your life AND YOU SAY HOW DO I KNOW I'M BLESSED? IS IT HOW RICH I am? No. Is it how easy life is? No. Is it my job? No. Is it my house? No. It's got nothing to do with it. The blessing is you receive the word FOR YOUR DAY AND YOU BECOME BLESSED. AMEN. YOU BECOME SPIRITUALLY BLESSED. AMEN. IF GOD HAS GIVEN YOU THE ABILITY TO BELIEVE AND RECEIVE HIS WORD, YOU'RE THE MOST BLESSED PERSON TO STRIKE THE EARTH. WHY? BECAUSE GOD'S FAVOR HAS FOUND YOU. AMEN. GOD'S FAVOR AND BLESSING IS UPON YOUR LIFE. AND WHAT GOD HAS BLESSED REMAINS BLESSED. DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COMES AND GOES. TROUBLE, IT DOESN'T. THAT'S IRRELEVANT. YOU'RE A BLESSED PERSON. YOU AIN'T CURSED. DON'T LET THE DEVIL THINK YOU'RE A CURSE. NO. HE BECAME OUR CURSE ON CALVARY. HE TOOK YOUR JUDGMENT ON CALVARY. HE TOOK THE WRATH THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED. HE TOOK IT ON CALVARY THAT YOU CAN WALK FREE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. If you're part of his word, how can he curse his word? He can't curse his word. He is his word. Amen. So by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you become part of the word. &gt;&gt; You're predestinated to it. But God quickened you THAT YOU BECOME PART of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. God can't curse his word. That's why he couldn't take out Sarah when she doubted THE PROMISE GIVEN TO ABRAHAM. She was part of the promise. I mean, you got to realize there may be family members fussing, fighting, AND DIFFERENT LIKE SARAH WAS. JUST KEEP AN ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE around you. Just praise the Lord in your heart. AMEN. SPEAK FAITH, SPEAK PEACE, SPEAK THE REALITY OF THE WORD. WHAT HAPPENS? YOU CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE AND that atmosphere will begin to get them. &gt;&gt; So God can't curse his word. &gt;&gt; How can he curse you &gt;&gt; if you're part of the word? &gt;&gt; Why should we why should we worry then? &gt;&gt; I'll read a quote because Jesus said, "If you add one word to this or take one word from it, our part will be taken out of the book of life." seen no not one scripture you must uh you must take it the way it's written and God watches over his word to perform it and we know that it's got to be just right he watches over you right so therefore no matter what the church would say what anyone else would say if you're born of the spirit of God you become part of the Bible some people like quotes I'm just going to read this to you okay you become part of the Bible told Ezekiel he the prophet said take the scroll eat it then the prophet and the scroll became part of each other and That's the believer when he receives the Holy Ghost. The Holy Spirit wrote the Bible and the spirit of God is the word of God. My word is spirit. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Hebrews 13:8. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And when you are part of that word, oh, then let something come up contrary to that word. There's a little buzzer goes off right quick. I'm just going to leave abruptly. I know I've taken too much time. Let's have the musicians this morning. You don't realize I'm part of the word. &gt;&gt; I can't be cursed. I can't be out of his favor. I can't be lost. I mean, I'm part of him. And so, every in summary, fiery trials are to make us hot on fire for God. Every trial in my opinion is a fiery trial. Okay? &gt;&gt; Right? So, so just put it under that category. Fiery trial. What's it going to do? Make me on fire for God. If we are hot, then we cannot speak for ourselves. You can't. If you're lukewarm, you can. But if you're on fire for God, you cannot speak for yourself. Your the word of God will speak through you. So, thank God for the fiery trials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [applause] So, I think we can rejoice this morning. Amen. Let's stand, shall we? Praise the Lord for the fiery trials. It's not here to break you. It's here to make you. Amen. Let's sing that song. Why would I worry when giants come calling my name? Amen. I won't be shaken. I'm I I am unmovable. Your humanity know the word of God in my soul. Amen. Let's sing this, shall we? Amen. Why would I worry when giants come calling my name? Oh my God is so much bigger than the troubles I face. Why would I hunger for power or riches or way? My God is so much bigger than all of [music] these things. I won't be shen. I won't be moved. My God is faithful. His promise is true. So I speak to [music] the mountain. Oh, it's time to move.
