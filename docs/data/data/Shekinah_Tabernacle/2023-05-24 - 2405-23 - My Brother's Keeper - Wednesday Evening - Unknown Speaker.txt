disciples that they didn't realize that it was you Lord and then later on they said did not our hearts burned within us as he talked with us along the way Lord and that's the experience that we have when we meet with you Lord we we feel the warmth of your presence Lord and there's that that warmth in our heart Lord that only you can bring Lord that only your spirit can can bring to us and we thank you Lord that we've experienced that this evening we just desire that you would continue to draw close to us Lord tonight and and each day of Our Lives Lord May our hearts just burn with your Holy Ghost Inside of it Lord that that Lord we would be soft and tender and pliable Christians Lord not not get cold and unwatered Lord and cold and hard little but maybe we'd be warm and friendly lighters we listen to the prayer lines that brother Brandon would speak would be speaking and someone would come up and you see he would say I sense that you're a Christian I feel a warm atmosphere around you Lord may that be our testimony when we go amongst people made ourselves since there's a warm atmosphere about you Lord and that's what we want to bring a lot to a cold and Dying World we want to bring the warmth of Jesus Christ to each heart in each life that we come in contact with Lord say we commit the service to you we thank you for the songs thank you for your grace and your presence amongst us this evening we just continue to commit ourselves to you in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord God bless you all thank you brother um Josh very good thank you for the song um I was listening to the song and I'm thinking I'm not sure how many songs that I've kind of brought to the church as a song but I always got them off um sister annalize she would sing an item and I think man I want to bring that song to the church and then I'd do it in the church so when she was doing that song I thought oh there's another song for me and brother Josh just slipped in there first but I really like that song that was I felt the anointing on it praise the Lord uh if you have your Bibles with you could you please turn to Genesis chapter four um verse 9. Genesis chapter 4 verse 9 says and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper may God bless his word you can have your seats deceiving how are you all doing you're doing good it's good you look good I feel a warm atmosphere this is a prayer meeting tonight so I'm just going to be about 15 minutes maybe 17 if there are some little wind-up statements and Brother Andy insisted that I have no notes so what we just read was my note hahaha and then after that well um just get get the Brethren's request maybe the ones that have been um spoken here that have been sent into the WhatsApp then also if you have any other requests you can um you know speak those out and we can together come and prayer for those needs and those requests so so as I'm speaking don't think too much about that but think about that just a little bit if you have a need there that um you would like the church to pray for because there is great victory in faith and in Brethren praying and believing so you know one will chase a thousand and two ten thousand so our prayers when we get together to pray for something are effective um and I believe we're all believers so there's just a Powerhouse of faith that goes forth and makes a difference so I want to make sure we have time that you could share the needs and also then we can we can gather them in our mind and then take the burden of them you know it's effective when we take the burden on when we get inside the need of whatever that request was if we just parrot it off and say Lord bless this one that had this need and that one that had that needed that one that they had that need we may be better off just just seeing which one affects our heart like if there was someone in a hospital we think you know what I've been there I know what it's like to be sitting in a hospital bed with maybe that same particular sickness and I know how hard it was and I know that that may be a prayer for me would have been good and like this sort of prayer would have been good for me at that time so we can enter into the burden of her if there's a certain need so so see which one touches your heart and then lay hold of that one because maybe that's the one the Lord wants you to pray for because your faith will meet that need if you have a burden for it you know it's a bit harder to pray for something if you don't have a burden for it Although our words will be effective because the word of God and our what we speak is still powerful but you know when we when we come with a burden it's like we enter into it and we we we can pray so let's let's do it like that um they thought that I had tonight was a thought called I Am My Brother's Keeper I am My Brother's Keeper and I'm going to make this General so brother means sister as well is that all right yeah good we could say I am My Sister's Keeper I'm My Brother's Keeper but because the Bible says brother you know we just sat and he was talking to Cain uh Cain said that to God actually but we're just going to say brother but sisters it means sisters as well so I have my sisters keeper I'm My Brother's Keeper and I didn't quite know what I was going to speak about until maybe about an hour before coming here and the thought just came up I am My Brother's Keeper and I thought it was quite applicable in my current situation because I literally am My Brother's Keeper laughs Hello Joel but I think I actually have a word for the church this evening and I think it's more than just a coincidental series of events but I think that the Lord is calling us to be our Brother's Keeper and I believe this is from the Lord that that something the Lord wants to speak to you and to me this evening that this is the Lord's heart okay so take it as being from the Lord because I I believe that it is and I believe it's the season that we actually are going to enter into more becoming our brother and our sisters keeper as we see darkness and and things approaching on us it's more important now than ever that we are our brother's keeper and we are our sisters keeper there has never been an onslaught that we are experiencing and that we will continue to experience like there is now in the history of brothers and sisters being upon the face of this Earth the the onslaught that we're going to face and we will be our brothers and sisters keeper and and I don't believe that I think life will be very hard for us if we don't have a brother or sister keeping us I believe that's the time that we are stepping into but that's the time that the law monster system step into you know there's a big fight at the moment against communism around the world because they can see communism creeping in but we're actually all Communists you know that yes we're actually all Communists the book of Acts they said they had all things in common we're actually all Communists really and the true sense of the word we don't have the nonsense of this worldly way they do it but actually they were communists and they they sold everything they had they gave it all and then they distributed it as each Brethren brother or sister had need they were Communists and that was how God actually formed the church then that's right yeah see we don't do life like that we do it it's me me it's mine what's mine is mine what's yours is yours but the Bible says look not every man on his own things but every man on the things of others that's right and and that doesn't just mean Goods that means actually what about their need what about their what about what they want yeah we often will try and get ahead of someone else because we want that position what about if that person wants a position why not let them have it yeah yeah it's the same thing you see it's it's being your brother's keeper and caring for them and and so starting off back with with Joel I I don't think it's coincidental that that I've actually become his the lord has laid it upon me to become his keeper in the season and he won't mind me saying this because I feel privileged that that the Lord would say to me I want you to be his keeper you know he shared with me the other day that he was when I said hey maybe you could come and live at the factory and we could get you get you there and get the courts to allow you to be there he said he prayed about it over a few days and he said all he kept on getting was my name coming up in manawatu you know over a couple of days so the that that was encouraging to me because it felt you we feel like actually the Lord's in all this you know and and the Lord is actually in that instance calling me to be My Brother's Keeper and I don't think I'm going to tell you something else that's happened in over the last week or so but it's along this same lines of being our Brother's Keeper I want to start I want to just this little thought emphasized it to me can you put up that photo I had a photo there that I just I'm not going to talk about this but I just want to talk about something because Shannon said to me the other day she said it's amazing how much the devil is attacking the world at the moment mankind she said mankind Christian or non-Christian Satan is just attacking like is attacking the world financially at the moment he's attacking the world physically with health with everything he's actually attacking the world and that got me thinking I thought that's actually a quite a powerful statement that yes Satan is actually he hates all of us he hates human beings he hates them all and he especially hates the Sons and Daughters of God with a pure hatred and he is attacking now more than ever so these two people here this was 2001 and they were having an interview one was a news a journalist who was his views were this way and one was a a very respected uh doctor and a very popular doctor that was um against people getting vaccinated and against the vaccine itself right he was on that camp so so these two and the other guy was very much opposed to his belief so this was a very quite a uh uh and an intense interview with two opposing views clashing head to head on quite a public network and this this this man the the man with the um paper as the journalist the other man was the um the man the doctor he became very very popular because he was he put forward opinions early in the piece to say this is something's going wrong here we shouldn't be doing this as doctors you know the way they're rushing things through and that the the point that the reason why I'm showing you all this is because that was October 2021 and and uh what do we have now may 2023 was that two and a half years later both of those men are dead I look at that and I think this is strange both those men are dead these men are not old men these are just these are healthy men they look reasonably healthy now one man was actually fighting a bit of a battle with cancer the the journalist but there is suspicion that you know you take this thing it makes your cancer Go funny but the the the point is both these men are dead that this is not normal like we look around there's things happening that are not normal there's a there's an attack on the world this other man insisted that he was poisoned because he was becoming so powerful and what he was saying he was poisoned and he recovered from that then he got poisoned again and he's dead it's we we we're at a time where we're under attack intensely yeah and we need to be our brothers and our Sister's Keeper at this time this is unusual man you can take that down now this is just that that just sort of when I thought about that I thought what a strange world that we live in when when I just I can watch an interview now and then I get news oh that man is dead he did that's a that's a serious thing he's dead people don't just die you understand like we are we're at a time where we're I think we're going to be under attack like we've never been under attack before spiritually you've probably all been under attack this week spiritually you'll experience that more and more and more and and what can I do to help you I can encourage you and the Lord I can encourage you in your faith you know when you're being attacked spiritually I can I can encourage you see words are powerful I can I can I can share testimonies with you I can I can testify of how the Lord deliver me and what it does is that it helps your faith to increase yeah you know I can pray for you you can sometimes come away from fellowship with a brother or a sister when you may be feeling quite down then they share testimonies and encourage you and it strengthens your faith and you come away strong you were your brothers or sisters keeper when you do that to them you were the keeper and when you're when you're down the same they can do the same to you yeah yeah or when you when you pray when they don't know about it but you pray and you know you sometimes just feel like well I just done I've started to feel good all of a sudden I'm not sure why someone was praying for you yeah we can't just go about our lives as like oh this is just me and I just do my thing I think the battle is hot and heavy that we must be our brother and our Sister's Keeper I know we have to battle ourselves but I think we should be become more of our brother and our Sister's Keeper and amen and so that's the thought that I've been pondering um and just thinking about as even as I see economic ties becoming quite tough and things happening I'm like I think we need to become each other's keeper a bit more you know we can't just leave everyone to it oh they're just you'll be right see here you go you understand we have to become and so I started to get this thought not just for us here but then I started the Lord started to sort of put it more in a I guess I'm not big enough yet to think National because my International my mind can't really my mind sort of goes to our beaches and stops there sorry I've got brothers from South Africa and Canada and America but I kind of I guess at the beach and it doesn't go any further than that you know I don't have a big enough boat to sort of sail over so so some other brothers think Global you know but I I can't do that yet the Lord maybe will take me along but you know I started to think not just with us because we are an independent Body of Christ there we our job is to help each other you know you if you've got a you have a need I'm going to try and meet your need however I can and you vice versa to me and you know that's what we do here as Believers we and and we're communal right we work with each other and then a a situation came up where um someone in another church raised the need that this this brother in the church needed a certain thing that that the church couldn't provide it it would be like brother Ben saying to another church hey I've got a brother here that needs something like we can't quite provide him this need in the church could you help out okay and and that that need came forward reached our little ears you know that this this brother had said there's a brother in the church that there's got this need that he needs something and and that got me thinking I thought this is an interesting situation because I knew the brothers and that and I thought I thought okay so what happens in that situation like do when the little Fellowship can't sort of look after one of their not that they come but they go through different seasons and they they can't meet a certain need and they put the word out then whose responsibility who was that Brother's Keeper then because they try and in the little group they're like well I'm I'm your keeper but if they can't do it they if that need comes out before outside of their chest and who is that Brother's Keeper and I thought to myself I thought actually then if I just go into the confines of this country I think well then we're all our Brother's Keeper so so then I thought I don't know if you're just going to come to the need for us to meet that need what about all the other churches are we not all Brethren and I wasn't to be like well if I will give if they give it's more like well hang on we need to look at this in a different way if once he comes out to the to an end to a national sort of scenario it's like then he's all of our problem he's not just my brother he's the other churches he's your brother too we're all our Brother's Keeper can't we make something that we all then know about this need and we can all try and meet the need because when it comes outside of the local church it's it's my problem but it's your problem is your problem he's the whole country's problem I understand it's not just like oh we just asked for our walls and no more no this we're all in the same team we're all in the same battle and God happened to have put us on these two islands three four if you can't wake you five if you count the barrier we're all here together reasonably isolated and we need to work together and I don't know if you've noticed during the in the conventions of late over the past few years there's been a real togetherness you know and a willingness to work together and to to gather and to actually help each other out and and ministers are coming through and going traveling around we sort of we're working together and it's been such a nice feeling and so when that need came up down there I thought well hang on it shouldn't just be just asking us for help why don't we ask all these other brothers for help too like hey bro this guy this brother needs some help from that Fellowship can we help and then then we started to to I've got about five minutes to go but I want to share this with you because I think the Lord is doing something exciting in our midst that on with this intention that it's actually to serve not to be anything but to serve and help they say Christian's job is to serve and help if you've got any other intention you're not signed up to the right team because the Lord's team are servants he said the greatest among you shall be your servant okay so we're all servants that's what our that's what our role is so then I thought after that I thought making the making the picture a little bit bigger I thought well then hang on this like if if we can work together like that what about what about if there's other churches that have young ministers that maybe if the purpose use that week after week after week because the way it should be you know because the past that brings the word can't we make a little special meeting here and bring some of these ministers down to be able to get them use their sword and learn to minister and you know like we will not we won't have seasoned Ministers of the Gospel if we don't let them preach the gospel you know like and if these brothers are preaching only twice a year and we then that'll take them 10 years every 10 years they get 20 sermons does my mass correct I mean that's that's not that many right to really and then and then we want to hold these big meetings then we wonder why we haven't got a pool of people to draw from because we haven't given we haven't worked together but I think I am My Brother's Keeper I want to make an opportunity for these brothers to why can't we make why can't we work together to actually help them train up and to to learn to use their sword if we have to sit through a few sermons The Bomb then sit through them yes these brothers might think hey that's the last one I thought I'm not called to it then we're happy with that but if they're just learning let them learn let them grow and then and then it then eventually we're going to have people that can use the sword that can actually go forth with the word of God but but we are our Brother's Keeper we can't just uh what's you you oh that little church up there your ministers are your problem well no they're actually my problem because we're on the same team it's not just your problem it's my problem I want your I want your brothers and your sisters you I want you guys to increase I want you if you do well I do well we're on the same team here if you're if you prosper I prosper you understand we're we're all Communists here you know we have all things in common your ministers are my ministers and our ministers are your ministers that that's the way way we work and and as they get as they as they move on maybe some of the some of these ministers can help look after the home front well some of the Season ministers going on on the mission field more and go and do more of that work and and actually it brings Souls overseas and that that that there's there's countries I mean we heard reports from Brother these countries that is crying out for the gospel to just to go there you know yeah and and if we don't have ministers here to send there but other season ministers and other churches well let's give to them you go it's our prop that this is all our problem this is uh oh you can't afford to seeing your minister I work yes they can't go but but if we have what but if but you going there is my problem because those people there that need the gospel is my problem it's it's all about problem I am My Brother's Keeper if you can't get there then that's my problem I'm your keeper how what can we do to help you to get there you understand yeah so so we were um I think were you and I talking about this on the drive up we were Brother Andy and I we went to up north last week um on Monday to just do some things up at brother Malcolm's and around about and we were discussing these things on the way up how it would be so nice to that that we could all work together more and that the gospel could go forward with the intention of the Gospel moving forward and and with the express purpose of I Am My Brother's Keeper and and we were just sitting around fellowshipping with brother Malcolm and we just happened to you know late into the night as you usually do with Brothers we just happened to share a few of these things we said oh wouldn't it be nice if we brought up the situation with the brother and they had the need and I basically went through what I talked to you now about like wouldn't it be nice if we worked together more on the fellow the churches work together and we you know we could we all be we all looked after each other and and he said brother I've been want to do that for years Years brother let's do this brother Malcolm you kind of he's a bit like Brother Andy you sort of give him a no I'm going to take that back I think he felt like it was the leading of the Lord he said he said brother that this is of the Lord I've wanted to do this for years I think it's time we need to get this moving we thought we thought oh he'll be maybe six months and he'll have another reconvene about it he said let's think about it for a day and we'll talk about it again tomorrow it's like 20 he said 24 hours I'm like man this guy now we're talking he's that kind of guy man gets things done but he he said that's been a burden on my heart that we'll work together and and he wants to go overseas a lot but he's here it's just hard to yeah the pool of people to go to help and do things that he just runs out of resource he said oh we just can't end up going because we don't have the so the he just said let's let's do this and I well then about with the with the basis of this desire well then about a maybe a week there was a there's been a chat start with about almost most of the ministers and the pastors the majority all around the whole country are on now a chat and there's going to be a meeting on Friday to to to to to actually be our Brother's Keeper and and to actually support each other and help each other and and realizing we're in a we're in the thick of a battle here we can't just go it alone and argue to do it you you do your thing I do I think no man we're in the flick of battery we need to we actually need to work together brothers and sisters we this is an onslaught man yeah yeah it's an onslaught and and I'm not going to stand up and say we don't need anyone I stand up and say man I need all the help I can get like I've been under so much like the battle's Raging against me help me all you can man and vice versa if I can help you I will and and I don't know I believe that the Lord is in it so I think there's just something happening with the and the intention is to serve and to help and to edify each other so not only are we all our brothers and sisters keep it here but I think nationally we are all our brothers and sisters keepers and and we we and and I think the Lord is you know I I feel there's a Unity amongst the Brethren the Lord said how good and pleasant it is for the Brethren to dwell together in unity it's like the world that ran down Aaron's head and down his bed and down to the skirts of His Garment we were talking about that the other day when we were following up oil on the Chain so I think it was brother Ben he was putting oil in the chamber oil and it was going and he was he I think he did it too fast and it went all over the side and down on the blade and all on the ground and we said that's likely your anointing oil of Aaron we said he was a real spiritual brother you know he's caught the anointing that was um so that was my little thought that I had but I believe it's the mind of Christ that we are our brother's keeper and it's the time where we come into more of that in our mind and and don't just look at your own things look on the things of others care about them sometimes I've given so much and everything I look at my own some in my resource my own heart everything and I say Lord I'm empty amiti but you know and I somehow sometimes used to think that was bad but when you look at it this way why is it bad if someone else says that you don't have it the lord gave everything when he took his last breath that was the last but he that was the last thing you had and he was done he gave every single thing for us to have everything yeah and we something I think it's bad we we end up oh this is not right I've ended up with nothing and he's got something she's got something what's bad about that that's the gospel amen now we say oh the Lord will replenished it he does but you don't just do it because you get replenished you do it because you do it we give praise the Lord let's um I'm going to close that thought there um now pray requests do um there are some prayer requests on the notice board let's just read those and then if you have any more on your heart let's let's let's bring them up and let's believe the Lord is a Victorious God this evening and he will meet our needs and he will he will answer them in a powerful way sister we're going to pray for your colleague Adrian and this and a sister going overseas tomorrow where are they going nice Canada is becoming a strange country are they work colleagues did you say or are they just yeah okay good good let's pray for this song and Marion's parents Marion isn't here tonight but his um mum and dad are in the Mediterranean Israel for mum's 50th I pray that they would have a real powerful experience there and just come back refreshed and and just have a real good time on the Lord and another request for statista's friend Janet she had a stroke did she hmm [Music] brother it said please pray for the New Zealand ministers taking hands and fellowshipping around the word there's a virtual gathering this Friday I just expounded on on that but that's what that actually is is that um sister Robin you've got to assist in your eyelid no you don't you don't have a cyst in your eyelid it's a I got um I actually know David woke up one day when he was a little fella with another office assistant he had conjunctivitis and
