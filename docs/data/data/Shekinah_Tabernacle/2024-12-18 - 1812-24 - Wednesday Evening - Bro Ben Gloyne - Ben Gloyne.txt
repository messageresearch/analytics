okay so anyway God bless you uh I don't have a slideshow uh tonight um we're just going to turn to the book of um Luke and we're going to read um sorry I was going to open my notes Here uh we're going to read from uh Luke 1 verses 44 to 55 so Luke 1 44-55 this is of course um so Mary has gone to uh Elizabeth who's the father who's the mother sorry of of John and they're just greeting each other here and as it says now for as uh for L as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears The Babe leapt in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believeth for there shall be a performance of those things which are told her from the Lord and Mary said my soul doth magnify the Lord and my spirit do rejoice and gu My Savior for he hath regarded the L state of her handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generation shall call me blessed for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name and his Mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation he hath showed strength with his arm and he hath scattered the proud in in the imagination of their hearts he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree he hath filled the Hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away he hath hen his servant Israel in remembrance of his Mercy as he spake to our fathers to Abraham and to his seed forever amen I want to focus mainly on this on the verse there it says uh uh from verse 45 just want to read that again uh and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord amen Let's uh bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight amen gracious father we're so thankful we can bow our heads in your presence and say you are all together lovely alog together

love you Lord but be with those who couldn't be here tonight Lord if they're traveling Lord of their un well father we just pray you touch their lives for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight so I want to speak about uh I want to go through I love this portion of the scripture you know the um you know Mary going to to see Elizabeth and the wise men and all these things coming out you I enjoy this part of the gospel and uh but I want to uh Focus really on this verse here it says that you know for there shall be a performance of those things which are told her from the Lord this is verse 40 um 45 to me this is a quite an astounding scripture where you look at Mary she was a woman of faith and um you know it's amazing when you think about how she didn't realize she was part of the prophecy of the you of a virgin shall conceive she didn't know that was her her name wasn't written in the scripture but we know when God uh inspired Isaiah to speak that word uh God knew that Mary was going to fulfill it amen it wasn't going to be anyone else it was going to be her and brother Braham would dramatize it in a few different ways but you know he would he would speak about how you know they would he and uh her fiance Joseph they would go to the synagogue and you know the you the priesthood get up to read and one day he uh you know seemed to be a bit of a different atmosphere in the synagogue as he stood up and he would he would he would open the scroll to Isaiah and he would read you know Isaiah 9 and verse6 you behold the Virgin shall conceive and you know there's something about when he spoke it it just seemed to really grip her uh maybe she had heard it many times before that maybe they read it out of tradition I do not know but you know there comes a time when the word becomes alive to us you know it becomes more than nice scripture more than a nice Instagram post or something like that but but the quotes and the scripture come alive to us because it's a season for them to be fulfilled in our lives and so she was she was a part of that prophecy and we're part of Prophecy too we're got to realize that we are a prophetic woman amen where where where Mary was a woman of Faith she was she was she was that you could say that elected lady as John would write to the church I think it's John 3 to the elect lady and I believe that we are part of that elect lady you know of the of the Bride of Jesus Christ has been gathered down through seven Church ages we're the last part of that body to come together sure there's more of us to come that's why we're here but you know we got to realize that you know we are a we are a prophetic lady am mean God thought of us before the foundation of the world and he knew the scripture we would fulfill and so she heard Isaiah 9 and6 so maybe you know Isaiah 7 you I'll I'll send you a super sign and maybe you know the you know the uh Rabbi would get up and he'd speak about the great Jehovah of the old days and you know how he was mighty with Moses and you know with Noah and you know Elijah and different prophets but then he but then he you know seemed to as he's building this platform about saying how great that Jehovah God was but then he kind of went sideways a bit and said isn't it so bad that same God he doesn't need to do those things anymore he doesn't need to do them uh miraculous anymore because we're here we've got our synagogues we got our traditions and we don't need that kind of a god anymore it just seemed to just kind of hit hit Mary like this and something didn't sound quite right to her because she had been taught from a young age that that Jehovah God is the same yesterday today and forever and that so you know and and um so when they went home you know brother Brown would say that you know um you know her and Joseph and you after the after the service there they would gather and they would open the Scrolls and you know they would talk about what the what the rabbi said and you know there just something how she your eyes just lit up where you said Joseph can you find that scripture in the Scrolls so Isaiah 9 and6 you know and maybe you know he'd go get the scroll and open it and we know it wasn't numbered like we have it now but he found it he would read that and be like when he read that just an anointing would come down into the room now I'm just dramatizing these things because we to realize the same God back there does the same things today who's ever had that when you open the word it's just to a particular promise and it seems to speak to your heart then you maybe speak it you read it it's like the atmosphere just becomes different God draws near to you who's had that kind of experience right so there was something so electric about this event it was different to maybe when they read it before and and uh you know then um then then um you know there was a time when she would uh she would maybe the next morning she would go down to the well you know you early in the morning you the well she always went to to get their uh you know water for the for the day they didn't have running water in those days they'd go to the well and you know she was walking there and then she saw this kind and she was thinking about that scripture Behold a virgin shall conceive and think about how Messiah is going to come and she's just pondering on those things if you want the Lord Jesus to draw near to you think on his word think on his prophet promises irrespective of how you feel what day you're going through think on his promises to you every promise in the word is ours okay begin to think on his promises and how he's so the same and he's present amen he's here to help and he's here to fulfill his word she was thinking about those things and suddenly a light flashed around her and you know she she she saw a man seem to appear you know it's amazing no one else was there to uh to to Bear record of this one testimony of a teenage girl our whole really Christianity hinges on that because if he wasn't the Virgin born son of God who are we following we're just following a Jew but we ain't saved by Jewish blood or Gentile blood we're saved by the blood of God and then so that angel you know Gabriel said to her said Hail Mary and you know she would have stopped and you would have realized how does this man know my name and there's a different atmosphere around him and you know then then then then she would you um he he would say to her rather you know you're highly favored of God you're going to have the promised Messiah and you know you know she was taken back by the this because she was remember she had heard the scripture not long before and it gripped her heart and now the Fulfillment was coming into manifestation and um you know you know she said how can this be I you know I'm not even married and you know she but he said to her the Holy Ghost will come upon thee and you'll have the you'll have the Messiah and something in her said I agree with that amen she didn't work it out she didn't she didn't wait for a detailed explanation something in her said yes and there's something about you and I it's not Humanity that says yes to the word it's not our it's not how smart we are it's not based on our nature our personality there's something in us just says yes you can be having the worst day of your life and something in you says yes CU it's deeper than your spirit it's deeper than your M your flesh it's your soul that says yes to the word amen so there she is and she says yes be it unto me according to Thy word now we know six months before this the same G uh the same Gabriel visited Zachariah in the in the temple and we know the story he was he was um struck dumb because he didn't believe the he didn't believe the message of the Angel but yet God still fulfilled his word and then and then here we come down to the scene where where where Mary has has has um gone and she's you know it's amazing testimonies it's amazing the opposition that someone with a testimony receives who's had that kind of experience you think the whole world's because you got to think about it if we go back 2,000 years ago the the whole promise of the Ages was coming into manifestation for the Jewish people and for the world the Messiah was coming more than a prophet more than a teacher more than some great king it was the King of Kings was coming to the Earth and you would think that you know everyone would rally around her and be so supportive and so excited because God had sent an angel and promised her you're the Fulfillment of the scripture but yet even Joseph was struck by it he would you know you know just really knocked him back cuz he thought how could this be it's you know because it's not natural it's not natural for these things you know he was a just man the Bible says he was going to put her away privately because he was afraid well you know I don't want to see her stoned and you know I love her and all these emotions going on and trouble and it's amazing in those kind of circumstances that's when God can draw near amen because no doubt he went to praying in his heart he didn't understand this his fiance turns up and she's got this light in her eyes or something's different about her and you know he you know she began to testify to him you know how we read that scripture the other day an angel visited me and he couldn't because it was so foreign to what he was used to he was used to hearing a god of the past but now he was in the present and now he was you know fulfilling his word in in his own life and then so Joseph was troubled by this and you know and then of course you know the angel came to him in a dream God uh uh you can say protected a son in a secondary Way by a dream and uh you know you know the angel sent him you know fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife cuz the baby within her is of the Holy Ghost right but then now but then you know no doubt that you know that name of being an illegitimately born son followed him all the days of his life and there was a dark mark against her because people did not understand the visitation of God but to me it's amazing how how how here in verse um sorry if I can find it again verse 45 says blessed is he that believeth for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord I think for for anyone to stand and to hear those words she needed to hear those words she really needed to hear those words that God is going to perform that which he promised I mean because she was going to come up against the greatest probably opposition one person with a testimony would ever face because remember this is Messiah coming there more than a prophet so she would have you know had a lot of backlash a lot of people talking about her and all trying to make her doubt the word and all these things but but she was told that God's going to perform this I say God is going to perform this message God is going to fulfill this message that the Rapture is going to take place amen God is going to fulfill it in our lives not just anyone but in your life I mean because remember when God quickens his word to you what is he doing he is giving you the confidence that he's going to perform that which he has promised doesn't matter how impossible it seems doesn't matter how far away it may be I know I'm yeah I'm speaking very broadly here cuz we're going through a lot of different things as families as you know situations right but you got to realize but but make it personal as I'm speaking right that whatever the Lord has promised he will perform it right remember this is not us taking ourselves into a Rapture this is God guiding us like he guided Mary and Joseph he guided them and it's amazing how he guided them through great difficulties there she is n months pregnant they're living in the wrong City he had to be M he had to be born in Bethlehem he could not be born in Nazareth or wherever they were right he could not be born there because that would break the prophecy the prophecy was out of Bethlehem would he come the house of God's bread right Bethlehem means House of God's bread so so you know God God inspired a cruel Emperor to put economic pressure on the people to cause them to move to to where the word could be fulfilled and you know no doubt you know there she is she's 9 months pregnant it's very uncomfortable it's uncomfortable to watch because you feel so sorry for them I'm sure there's okay good there's some husbands here have some heart good praise the Lord but you see you know because you feel so sorry and you can't help them you can't you know you know but you so so imagine now you're going to put your nine uh so your wife who's pregnant nine months she's duw any day on the back of a donkey not on the in the back of a car not so I'm comfortable right it's going to be a donkey it's going to be on gravel or dirt roads dirt tracks whatever it ain't comfortable so no doubt he's going through he's real anxious about it and he feels so bad sorry honey we have to go why do we have to go because this cruel Emperor maybe he's breathing under his breath saying man that guy and Jehovah God deal with him and you know he's getting so mad this taxation so unjust and all the economy of our day and how dare he do this to us and God if you really cared you would alleviate this pressure but God caused the pressure cuz he had to move his children to the right place for the word to be fulfilled for the prophecy to be fulfilled so really when this world is falling apart we say thank you God you're moving us into a position into a spiritual condition I mean for the word to be fulfilled in our lives not just in anyone's life in your life praise the Lord so we got to realize that everything is working for our good amen you got to realize we're living in an exodus season right we're living in the Third Exodus the first Exodus was out of Egypt they did not like being in Egypt they were sure they lived in Goan right they lived in the best part of Egypt but God allowed the screws to get tightened that they would cry out God get us out of this place amen and to me that's why the world is falling apart that we don't get too comfortable down here with our first world problems and everything right but there's a reason why things get tough because Lord when are you going to get us out of here amen God doesn't want us comfortable down here sure he wants us comfortable for a sense but in terms of we should have a desire Lord I want to be where you are amen and really I guess to be fair the the pull should be greater of Lord I want to see you than more than the world's getting bad but I hope you understand God allows it to get uncomfortable because we are getting ready to leave so there they are they go to Bethlehem there's um actually let's just I'm just going to drop a Way Big sigue in here because I want to go into some things let's go to Psalms 19 um we're going to go to Psalms 19 and we're going to read from uh verse 8 but it's more verse 12 I want to really capture here because when the word is fulfilled what is in someone comes out right you know as are we there Psalms 19 and verse 7 says the law Oh wait we're turning I'm hearing some rustling of pages good on you okay um it says here the law so I'm in verse yeah verse S thank you the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple the statutes of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous alt together more to be desired are they than gold yay then much fine gold sweeter also than the honey and the honeycomb moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from Secret faults keep back thy servant uh also from presumptuous sins least them uh sorry let them not have dominion over me then shall I be upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression now I dropped this in here because Mary and Joseph went to Bethlehem David was born so so the man who was inspired to write this was David he was born in Bethlehem now he was a man after God's Own Heart we know that right he was quick to repent when he was wrong he acknowledged he was wrong you know whenever God came his way it brought him back to God you know when he went you know trouble and sideways and all these things he had a heart but but see his cry was Lord cleanse thou me from Secret faults Now secret faults is something you're not aware of it's like you know like a has got you ever seen a horse with blinkers on it like this right and it you know it can't see where it would normally see cuz it's got something obscuring its Vision so it's unaware of things it can't see and it's like things in our nature it's like we got blinkers right there's secret faults so they may be very obvious to someone else but to us it's like what do you mean I'm like that cuz it's it's in a blind spot right but do you see but the Lord now the Lord has an ability to take the blinkers off right and we know God deals with us little by little you know like he said to the children of Israel when they when they first came out of Egypt you know they had to go a certain way kind of like the long way around because otherwise they come straighted towards the enemy and the battle will be too hard for them they get discouraged so God let them come little by little because to be fair if God dealt with me in completeness you know completeness in one moment would be too much in terms of the things that you know God's got to deal with right sure we make a full surrender but then God begins to do surgery in our lives right he begins to mature us and mold us and reveal things like we're like an onion right deep-seated things get taken out and you know every God deals with us in Seasons who's with me tonight you understand right amen so now so David saying cleanse thou me from my secret fault so David recognized that there were things that he did or things in his in his his human spirit that he was not aware with there but because he was he was God's child he had a desire Lord whatever is in me cleanse it from me just like brother Isaac's you know last few Wednesdays ago he said about how there's an amalaki will rais up in your spirit but it's only when it raised up then you kill the thing so that's a secret fold that can hide but then in moments it'll raise its head what are you going to do with it then right so so this is this is how David would David would um you know he would approach God this way Lord cleanse me from my secret faults and and so now here Mary and Joseph they come to they come to the the same place David was born now I trust this kind of ties them together because as I said a few moments ago it's amazing what happens when the word is fulfilled now if you look at the scribes and Pharisees you know they would have no doubt devoted well they did devote their entire lives to studying the prophecies Jesus fulfilled right and it was no there was no uh it didn't bring anything out of them when they debated it of really their true self and what needed to be cleansed from them right they could sit there they could argue they could fuss they could stand up they could write phds and you know thesises and thesis defenses and all those things could go on but it but it's when that word that they were arguing about got fulfilled it really brought out faults in them now it would say in first John here that there's um wait sorry I just got to unlock this phone here so F so first John we're coming back to Mary and and and and Joseph right but 1 John 2:16 he says for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but it is of the world says three things lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life and everything that deals well you know we wrestle with in this life is part of those three in those three categories they will fall into one of them and so now with the scribes and Pharisees now you got to look at now brother BR brings it out very nicely if you listen to Why had to be Shepherds or why little Bethlehem different things he would speak about how Jesus was the Lamb of God so of course he was born in a stable right because Lambs are born in Stables right so the nature of of the Lord had to match the place he was born in okay and and and and he had to and the angels did not go to the high priest didn't go to Jerusalem when Jesus was born but they went to Shepherds on the hillside they went to the ignorant unlearned you know uneducated no bodies of Israel and that's where the Angels declared to them uh to to to human beings messiah's on Earth right now now the reason is is because now the Shepherds didn't know it but their true nature matched who Messiah was right their true nature matched who Messiah was he you know like brother B says could you imagine some high priest dignitary with a pig on his nose like tiptoeing into the manger cuz it's stunk of animals and the animals are doing all kinds of things and who's been in a oh man there's a RoR upon AR RoR upon Aroma and all kind of things can you imagine some dignitary going into that kind of place to see Messiah would they humble themselves to the word being fulfilled in their midst absolutely not they had a secret fault of Pride right they had a secret fault of Pride they could debate about Messiah and how he'd be born and where and all those things but when the word came into fulfillment in their day could they could they be identified with it and absolutely not because it didn't match who they were you see and they weren't willing when Jesus said plainly I am my father or one they didn't say I thought so I'm so glad you told us that Lord Jesus you are Messiah no they could not because their secret fault was their pride and I doubt very much they thought they were prideful what do you mean that we are full of arrogance and all these things we're the religious people of the day we have devoted our entire lives to studying the message we've given our lives look at who you know look at what we've done for we do this for the people but it was Pride are you following right you see it was a secret see but you see the word actually exposed their pride and they weren't willing see the blinker came off but they said no that should be there and you're wrong you see and so and so they weren't willing to give themselves to be identified with some Shepherds now what I love about the Shepherds and the even the Magi see it goes to show it doesn't you know it doesn't matter how rich or poor someone is are they willing to Humble themselves and give themselves to where Messiah is the word you see it's like the Magi they brought gold frankincense and myrrh because they identified as as brother Aman brought out that Jesus was deity gold in the flesh put into service to die right gold deity frankincense is in service mrr is a burial spice so deity would be put in flesh to die for the for for mankind right so they gave the gifts acknowledging what was within him right just like the mighty men with David they knew he was coming into power right they so they realized you're going to be king so they gave themselves to him but you see now others could not identify him at all that way no doubt when the Shepherds they came into Bethlehem isn't it amazing it doesn't say anywhere that the whole city went to the manger but yet the Shepherds broadcasted it everywhere they came in by night now normally everyone's asleep right here they come in that maybe the first manger they went to I don't know there would have been more than one manger probably in Bethlehem but eventually they found it right or the Lord LED them there of course and then once they had met the Messiah that Messiah was upon Earth that the Angel's message was true then they went out of there they would have been screaming at the top of their lungs come see Messiah amen come see the word fulfilled come see God is not a god of History he's in flesh today right in your city they would have just they would have been screaming dancing they would have been elated but no one else seemed to it didn't say the city went there after that they just went back to the back to their sheep you see and then and then when the then when the um wise men of course they thought well he'll be in Jerusalem surely it's the capital So eventually they get there and the doesn't say anything about the star being seen when they went to Jerusalem showing the the religious confusion of that place just obscured where the light was and they go to Herod and herod's like all puzzled by it and of course he has a murderous intent and you know he's not willing to lay that aside and say Here's Messiah and you know I'm going to come with you at all these things and then so of course you know the um wise men had to be warned in a dream after they found Messiah after they followed the Angel's message because remember if this message has not LED you to Christ yet remember the message is Christ by the way you'll see Jesus Christ is the the message right but if you only see a prophet you haven't seen it right it's just like the wise men if they just saw a star they hadn't seen it they had not gone all the way to have a personal meeting with Messiah upon the Earth as the same thing with this word if you can see it's Jesus Christ nothing will shake you from it nothing will move you from it when you see it's Messiah revealed because the the word has always been Messiah and every generation the word revealed as Messiah he say well I'd love to go back 2,000 years ago and see Jesus youo In the Flesh that would be amazing but the same one is is his word today the same one walks in our midst every day the same one walks with you like he does the two on the way to M he walks with you that's in you even better than being in his body if I say it that way because he's in you right but you see now there's many times that we have these now the word comes and and I'm actually going to wrap this up soon but we have secret faults but then the thing is we read psalms 19 just like see it's very e say God come and do something for me but then he uses his body the Angels Came to the Shepherds then the Shepherds had the message They Carried the message into the City and carried it out they carried it in by saying where is he we've heard the angels then they left the angel saying the Angel's message was right he's right here and no doubt there would have been a cry because there was such a burden of the Romans upon the Israelite population and they were crying out Lord when will you send us a deliverer when will you fulfill the words of Isaiah and it was happening right in their midst you see so God works through his body so now we read psalms 19 we say Lord cleanse me my secret faults and then God happens to anoint one of his members and speaks to you right it may be Pride it may be stubbornness it may be a you know not willing to you know stubbornness can be a secret fault he said I'm not stubborn remember the Bible says everyone is right in their own eyes I'm putting myself in this too by the way okay I'll be honest I think I'm right and I've said it before over the years I think I'm right because the Bible says everyone is right in their own eyes we'd be lying if we say oh no I'm not right no I think I'm right okay but we all have secret faults we all have characteristics in our spirit that we don't realize are there but they affect people maybe it's indifference maybe it's Pride maybe it's just being too blunt honest but it's in a hurtful condescending way you know saying things you don't even need to speak about against people I got so annoyed at you that I what did I do oh nothing I was just thinking something well how does that help me I'm just throwing out an example but you know what I mean people come and say things like that it's like sorry for being here I don't know how you know what's my response I'm not sure but you see they've got secret faults you know they've got this thing and then if you talk to them about it are they willing to take the blinker down and say yes Lord take that from me because we're you know I'm looking at a group of sincere people amen I'm looking at people who want to be right with God more than anything yeah so now if we read the Psalms 19 we say Lord cleanse me of my secret faults God will actually allow for that secret fault to come to light in your life and it'll be through every day iron sharpens iron kind of a deal amen you say well you know I just like to dig on people are you sure that's what you should be doing I've got to tell them are you sure that's what you should be doing do you feel do you oh I can see what's wrong with that see being a perceiver and being critical are very much people mistake it anyone can be critical but a perceiver if you really perceive something one you will pray for that person more than anything but two you'll see a way out for them right being critical oh that's just wrong okay thanks that Pro person probably knows that but you see oh well but I've got to tell them and this is just how it is does it help them at all we're not gravediggers people we're not here to push people down holes like take Jeremiah like he got put down the well that was empty and he's just wallowing in the mire in the bottom you know we're not here to do that to one another you know we're not here to do that to one another we here to lift one another up and if you've got a problem with someone you should be praying you know probably really the first question we should ask each other is are we praying for that individual I'm not talking to anyone specifically okay this is just how this is just it's Christmas time but you know do you pray for that individual do you really care enough about them to lift them before the Throne of God well no cuz I have discernment are you sure about that but you see that can be a secret fault where people are just so you know and sure you say well kiwi's have a problem about not being direct enough possibly but the thing is when someone comes to you and tells you something it can be your worst enemy but can you actually take the truth they're giving you a donkey spoke to balum he took what the donkey was saying balum had some sense he was a false prophet you know he was way off doing his own thing but yet he didn't discard what the donkey was saying he just took what the donkey said right can you now we ain't donkeys right but even if someone says something in a critical manner to you can you just take that statement take the emotion out of it of you the bars they're throwing and say well what does what value does it hold for me can we yeah I think it's important you know because otherwise what happens if we we just hit it for six and that one statement could change our lives it could change us for the that could be actually God speaking to you you know it's like Elijah you know Ahab Ahab uh is told well Elijah um reveals himself to Ahab during the drought you know Elijah said you Ahab says to Elijah you're the one who brought this problem on Israel of the drought and Elijah says no you're the one what if Ahab actually took on board what Elijah said to him here is his enemy how do you think ahab's life would have been in the palace with Jezebel because because Elijah was alive it would not have been a comfortable place to live well when you're living with jizel you got a lot of problems okay but two her enemy and sadly your enemy is Alive and Well somewhere and it would have been like a been like a be under her Bonnet a whole a whole Hive under her Bonnet she would have been so mad this guy's still alive and why didn't you get him and it would have been weeks and months of why didn't your guards do something your soldiers are useless and you know so finally he's there and Ahab said finally I've got my moment you've caused all this trouble remember ahab's got big blinkers he's got big secret faults and to him because he thinks he's doing right because everyone in their own eyes is right right so he thinks but to us it's obvious Ahab your lukewarm your backslid you've compromised on the word that's obvious to us right but to him he thought he was doing the right thing otherwise he would have done something else and people think they're doing the right thing okay so then why didn't Elijah when Elijah said no you're the one causing the trouble why didn't Ahab actually take that statement and actually think about that cuz he was so emotionally charged and so clouded in his mind he wasn't willing to say God is is this you speaking to me to take the secret fault from my life now we're not enemies here right no I'll answer that right we're friends okay but you see sometimes wounds must happen and because there's a surgery that takes place right but the first thing is do you go and pray for that person because when the word is being fulfilled a lot of blind spots are being exposed amen like like the scribes and Pharisees King Herod all those ones they were totally blinded to what God was doing even even even Joseph had some blind spots to the word but God because he was sincere in his heart God showed him the blind spot what this is me you can trust you can trust her on this one her testimony is right you're following me tonight right so so God could take those blind spots away you know maybe it's just a you know maybe it's just being so indifferent can be a blind spot you know having no empathy with someone someone tries to talk to you about something it's just like they're talking to a w and they go away less you know feeling worse than when they started talking to you it could be a blind spot maybe it can just be appearing to be unre friend ly well I'm going through something we're all going through something but we're here for one another you know if you want God to answer prayer on for you start praying for someone else start lifting others before the Lord you'll see God begin to speak deal in your life and deal in your family's life sometimes we and now this is definitely me I get caught up in my own little world and what I'm going through what about what others are going through what about more more important things I'm putting myself here right you see but so we're going to look beyond what the thing we're dealing with and begin to reach out reach out to others and see what you know God wants to do amen so there they are they're in Bethlehem now Jesus is born the Shepherds come the Shepherds go the a the word of the Angel of the Lord still is true that what he promised to Mary he will perform it amen and it's very easy to look back now I'm just kind of going back to where I started I'm going to jump to the end again it's very easy to look back and say of course the Lord looked after her he was faithful to what he promised he performed that which he had promised now how about you and I we're in the middle of a Rapture season it's like where it's like where Mary and Jesus is in the manger it's not at the end of the story we're in the middle of the story right but if the Lord if the word of the Lord came to her and saidou going to have the promised son you are the Fulfillment of that of that prophecy a virgin shall conceive and your son's going to be called Emanuel he's going to be he's the Messiah and all these things and God fulfilled that cannot we take confidence in what the Lord has promised you and I there came a moment friends I trust has been that this message goes from more than brother braham's voice to God's speaking the voice behind the voice right where he spoke of a Rapture he spoke of the word coming open he spoke of you know protocals coming home he spoke about many different promises in the word he spoke about the you know the third pull and Mary experienced the third pull brought life she's speaking to Elizabeth Elizabeth you know the baby hasn't moved for six months or hasn't at all and she's 6 months pregnant and then now Mary under inspiration speaks and to testify of what God had told her amen there's power in testimony and then when she comes down to a point of her testimony where Gabriel says you'll call his name Jesus I mean the first time that that blessed name was spoken in a testimony to another part of the body what happened as as Elizabeth was was filled with the Holy Ghost and John jumped for joy and it was actually promised that he will receive the holy ghost from his mother's womb what the power of the spoken word brought life amen we're living in that season amen amen but I think we need to be very sensitive in this season Lord cleanse me of my secret faults am I too proud that I can't take correction am I stubborn can I not forgive that can be a very much a you know where people say they forgive but they haven't forgiven here or there can be a secret fault of people are too intense they get so fixated on certain things and it has to be that way or the highway you're they're not willing to step back and say okay Lord is this actually what you want me to do and it but you know but in their mind it must be this way and this is and you know who's experienced that they get so fixated it's got to be this that can be a secret fault cuz we got to realize when you feel intense yeah I get moments of great intense feelings myself are you so relaxed not all the time I'm like the duck you know swimming along looks Karma but under under the water I'm paddling a lot right but I've got to realize when I get that intense feeling I need to step back amen I say Lord show me the big picture cuz all I'm seeing right now is this is this log coming and I'm paddling and I got to move out with something you know but really what what about the big picture amen you see it can be a secret fault Lord cleanse so in this season you know to me this Christmas season is very special we've had a lot of you know if we're here next year I I would have had 40 Christmases upon this earth right I know crazy but you see but to me this one is very special there's a lot going on I'm talking about not in terms of the holiday I'm talking about us in the Lord this going to be the last Christmas we're upon the Earth amen you know the whole world is caught up in Santa Claus well what about us sure whatever Christmas go celebrate get the ham and the whatever you know enjoy give gifts all those things but don't forget as brother man said last Wednesday don't forget the reason for the season right but but wouldn't it be so fitting that the world is looking this way but the bride's looking this way and jesus takes us that way when the world is caught up in everything else why don't we just be caught up at him and say Lord I want to be sensitive in this season of my life whatever season you're in whatever age Lord Lord I want to walk with you I want to walk very I want to be tender and Lord take my secret faults from me and Lord when you begin to remove them may I be sensitive that it's your dealing may I not be so defensive and so odds that person has to say why is this why is that brother or sister have to come and tell me those things why does God have to arrange things this way for this to be exposed that's not fair the Lord knows how to deal just like Joseph why does the Caesar have to tax and blah blah blah and all these things God had to move them to for for Jesus to be born in the house of God's bread so I'm going to finish the E with the musicians please tonight amen and we I just want to say Lord let's just let's just walk with you Lord amen let's say Lord I want to be sensitive Lord in this Christmas season you know how many of us are going to go see family that that don't know him yep well okay who goes to a workplace where people don't know him
