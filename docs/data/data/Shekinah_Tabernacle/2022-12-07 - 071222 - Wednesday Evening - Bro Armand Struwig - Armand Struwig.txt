Lord we would have come prepared Lord knowing that you were going to speak and confirm your word to us I ask tonight Lord may you do that in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen thank you musicians amen I see brother my name is back God bless you I think my dad will know that if there's anybody that can fall asleep in the service tonight his brother born there you're gonna have to fight you're gonna have to fight all the way eh amen God bless you Saints we have my sermon title for tonight and I'm just going to say it out from the beginning is life of a Believer a true Witness so I believe with all my heart that each one of you there's no mistakes with God amen each one of you has been placed here and you've been placed here for a reason and hopefully as we go through the Book of Daniel tonight we can show you that that there comes a time where you're going to have to stand for what you believe in the pressure will come on and you're going to have to stand and if there's anything to stand for in this day and age in this church age is this message of the hour because nowhere has there been a time like this the fire is hot oh man the the the the the the arguments is all over the show the voices are everywhere no time like now to stand and with all you can stand amen so let us go to our opening scripture and we're going to go there to the Book of Matthew and we go to Matthew 10. and I've got it up there Matthew 10. amen you pray for me this is the nearest I've ever been in my life standing here in the front but it's a good place to be because that means the Lord can do the work and I can relax amen so when we go to Matthew 10 I want you to think about this is if you're a witness there's going to always be a taste are you going to taste what you believe in amen and with that test is going to come a testimony so as long as we can stay with those lines tonight we will all arrive at the end I pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ so he says and ye shall be bought before Governors and Kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the Gentiles but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given unto thee or unto you in the same hour what ye shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you may the Lord bless the reading of the word you may have your seats amen let's turn our Bibles to Malachi 4. so there comes a time where a prophet comes on the scene and God sends a word now before judgment God always has sent a prophet always he will not change his word it will be no other way that is how God does it that's how God runs his business we all believe it amen but see this Prophet was sent for you this message was sent for a reason because when we look at at the when the prophet came on the scene there was a lot of things that was going on a lot of confusion a lot of trains that came in a rock and roll music came in a lot of things hit the world very quickly and God said hold on hold on this is not what I built this is not what I want so then he'll give man a choice to follow what he wants or to follow the full word of God the restored word of God Amen and no I didn't come to have any arguments or fights so just just sit and relax because God will interpret his own word amen so he comes in he says we started verse 2 and he says but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and he shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall treat down the wicked and shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him and Horeb and for all Israel with my statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and grateful day of the Lord now we know that that day hasn't happened yet because we're all still here amen so there is a scripture there is a and we'll finish verse 6 now but there's a scripture that was written under inspiration from a prophet and that's now locked into the Bible it's sitting right there but somebody has to fulfill that scripture because God cannot say something and it returns to him void he cannot he cannot say by my stripes you're healed and there's nobody that receives healing he can't say I didn't for I finished it all I died for all sin and nobody can accept the blood and all sin is strict enough he he won't say that and not keep it when he said let there be light what happened there was light when he formed man and he said it was good it was good okay so what God says will come back so God cannot go into the word and put a scripture there for a people and there's no people to fulfill that scripture so on that basis we're going to dive in the Book of Daniel and prove how they were scriptures in the book of Elijah already that was proving that Daniel and his friends was going to stand upon this Earth okay and I'll show you hopefully the Lord will just show it to you tonight but you will always reap what you sow and God's word will always return to him but not void amen so God Don't Make Mistakes you're not a mistake you were here for a reason and God already saw you here because why he placed you here is he needed lures he needed if he is a great fisherman which I know he is because he can catch all of us he caught me okay as much as I was swimming around he knew what lure to use brother Andy's food was one of them but he knew what lure to use or put on my way so that he could catch me so regardless and what I believed and how I was running there was a Brother Andy and his sister Bronwyn upon this Earth okay that he had to use to get my attention Okay so as much as they don't maybe want it to be in the seventh church and I know brother Andy wants to be here because the most exciting time and maybe he wanted to be back in the book of Acts which we are still in by the way he wanted to be in that age or maybe still fought with a sword and do all those things God said I want Andy Clifford in this church for our monster praise the Lord that that's what you were so just accept it you're here for a reason God didn't make a mistake so young kids if you feel like you don't belong here I've got news for you it is scripted the whole thing is rigged you're here for a reason amen so as much as you might think it's not that it is that because God Don't Make Mistakes amen and guess what you are going to stand for a testimony for this word I know I didn't say you may be stand for it I want you to listen what I said you will stand because if God placed you yeah he said whatever happens to you I will make sure your words won't fall to the ground but just stand on my word I'll take care of the rest now young Sunday school of last Sunday can I please stand up my class stand up what did we preach in the Sunday School Joshua in the morning can you remember what did we talk about I know you take notes very clearly come on Rebecca what did we say who remember that sword amen okay and what did Brother Ben coven do when he came up to the pulpit he stole us on Sunday school lesson amen okay he took our Sunday school lesson and he opened it up now brother Ben have I spoken to you before the service you can never see children so you can never see Davey or do you wanna do you how long could you hold the sword up 20 seconds this man was shaking man Josh was he was going for it as I was reading the old scripture he was just holding on because I said in your strength you can't do it and Brother Andy was preaching the anointing of God and already at my Sunday school lesson so it just dovetailed that when the anointing of God comes that's where miracles happen that's where one guy can turn around and go fight the Philistine Army and everybody walks away and go oh he's still fighting okay let's go back let's go fight again because he could stand because the anointing of God took over and he was fighting the enemy or getting off my notes but so God got your attention because there was something that was in the Sunday school and it happens time and again and you walk into the church and God says but we're not finished yet I'm going to open it up more but that's God that's not an accident it's not planned we don't plan our song Services we don't plan our our service for the week and our Bible studies for the week we let God do the work because God is more than able to do the work amen so let's go to the book of Isaiah 43 and we're going to go to verse 1. so another scripture that I thought I would just share while we go there you you go back there is first Thessalonians 4 who knows the scripture this is your promise this is this is the other part that's written about you because you still see it you know I will send you Elijah the message and you'll hear the voice of the seventh angel okay when his voice starts sound you know the time is at end but this one is for we believe that Jesus died and rose again okay even them that which are asleep Jesus will Jesus will God or sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for we say unto you that by the word of the Lord they that which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with a voice and with the Archangel and with the trumpet of God and the date in Christ shall rise first and they and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord amen so somebody has fulfilled the scripture this this cannot be written and no manifestation of the word of God is taking place it cannot lie there and nothing happens with this God can't come back and take no one up with him because God said it it is done it is said so there is a people upon this Earth that's going to take a Rapture and I believe I'm looking at them because why are we here to fulfill the word amen predestination is a beautiful thing it means it's all rigged it means that God said it's going to be so and we live out God's plan okay we don't I don't want to go into premises permissive wool and the perfect world and those I don't want to go doctrines or anything deep I just want to say if God said you're going to make it you're going to make it amen that's final okay if he says you're bride you're bright just believe it don't fight it amen so get back on subject if we look here at the book of Isaiah um yeah as I I just want to go there I just lost my plate here we go 43 and we go to verse one okay now look here look at what it says here he says but now thus save the Lord that created the O Jacob and it formed the O Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee who is redeemed amen so your spiritual Israel just remember that okay God didn't stop with the Jews he blinded them came back to you gave you salvation he's going to go back to the Jews he doesn't do anything half he finishes his work he says I have called thee by name have you been called by name then he's talking to you he's trying to get your attention here okay he says Thou Art mine amen done finished he said it it's complete when thou pass through the waters I will be with thee and and through the rivers and they shall not overflow thee when they'll walk us through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the fame Kindle upon thee now we're going to go to the Book of Daniel Amen and this is where I think I think see now God has has placed this and and we know that the book of Isaiah is pretty much the Bible and it's all just summed up but this was now a prophecy that gone forth you know this was written out of the heart of God and the prophet penciled it down and he says that I called thee by name and thou art mine so he's got now a expected end for these sentences and these sentences says that nothing nothing that will come to you will hurt you I will be there for you and he says further in verse 3 says for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I am I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and seba for thee so I am the Lord thy God I'm gonna make it this is my work this is not your work this is my work hands off okay don't even try so I want to ask two questions who made the promise and what was the promise so we have to realize When God Says by my stripes you are healed who made the god the promise and whose Stripes were in so all I'm asking if he says that I've died for your sin the iniquity was all on me I took it I went for the cross I took your sins it is Forgiven you've never done it in the first place who made the promise who kept the promise so when we look at the promises of God we shouldn't look at us as we have to obtain to it it's there you just have to believe it and accept it that's faith faith don't need to work it out Faith accepts it believes it confesses it and receives it that's how it works amen so they was Believers Moses I wonder if the young children before they try to fall asleep tonight give me some Believers that had a testimony Joseph another one Daniel to kill one is Jonah Elijah Noah Reuben Paul Joshua Joshua amen yes Debbie David another one Enoch okay amen and Esther and Rahab and all those those preachers and Daniel who who's yours Daniel Daniel that's Daniel Amen yes and what's your name Jonah yeah amen okay so I just want to say I want to keep it like don't get too too tired on me relax okay so here's the Believers and these Believers all of them came to a point where God had to come on the scene and God had to reveal his word through them they did not know they were living out the part of the scripture they were Everyday People Like Us and the prophecies was written and and the scriptures was they Mary knew she was the Virgin that she when she was born did she know she was going to have Jesus no but when it came to us she accepted it she accepted that report it's not hard you don't need to have seven steps to be in heaven you don't need to be you don't need to work it up in here you just have to have it in here if it says it's for you it's you amen he said amen take it okay every believer so here we go to Daniel 1 and let's open our Bible say at Daniel 1 because we're going to go through Daniel 1 2 and 3 quickly and I just want to explain to you that this is you this is you and we're going to go there and so we know that now it's Babylon and we've got and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit and then I'm going to go into the scripture and then I'm going to tell you the story I also will be here all night and I don't think you want to be here all night amen so we know Nebuchadnezzar is now the king and and he is now um he is now busy there and and um he's got he's got a plan he says okay I want all the young men in the kingdom and he says there in verse 4 he says the children and who was no blemish well favored and skillful and wisdom cunning and knowledge and understanding and Science and such had ability to them that would stand in the king's Palace okay and to whom them that might teach the learning of the tongue of the Chaldeans so he's got a plan that he's going to get some cool princess that's got some real smarts they're gonna that's gonna further his kingdom because remember he was already he was the king of Babylon he had a lot okay but so he knew he had to get wise men to help him run the kingdom so now here comes here comes a pinch Point here comes a a a a challenge he says and the King appointed him a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine which they drank so nourishing um them for three years that at the end of they might stand before the king so the King's Way of preparing these young men is feed them give them wine teach them everything and they'll be wise but it didn't sit much right with Daniel go see Daniel knew that this is not for him in his heart God started working within him and if we read on it says now among these were the children was um was the children of Judah Daniel hananiah Michelle and Azariah okay and in it says in verse 8 but Daniel purposed in his heart that he will not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat so he just said whoa something is not right here I I I'm different but see there was nothing written that made him different he just said I don't wonder I don't want to be fed like those people something inside here is busy talking to me saying Daniel this is not your portion I don't want this for you he had to listen to that voice he had to he had to trust what was being revealed he had to know when he looked at it and he saw what all the other kings were and and the princes were and they were drinking wine and they were having an awesome time and and they were watching these Sports and they were doing their worldly things and they wore whatever they could war and say whatever they could say and and then it's blogging this and vlogging that and they can do all those things but he looked at them and he goes I'm different something inside this I'm different this is not for me and that's the still Small Voice that God has for every believer to say you don't belong here this is not for you and as much as you like to drown at that voice I'm telling you now God will come back and say this is not for you and you can fight that voice but it just doesn't sit right in here and it's rubbing and it's rubbing and you're like Lord you you're dealing but see somewhere you're gonna get tested the challenge is going to come and here it comes and it says this is a portion of the meat and then um in verse 8 it says not the wine which he drank and therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself now this is a big thing because the eunuch has been placed over them and the eunuch's job is thus Save the King the king says do it you do it so his head is on the table if he gets it wrong and Daniel Dean goes to him and he says now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs see God works on both ways Daniel had the feeling and he knew something was was not right and he had the confidence to go to the eunuch okay but God was already dealing with the eunuch to know that man this guy is different I like him okay and he's going to come with some weird request okay seriously pulse men okay he's gonna ask me something weird he doesn't want to eat meat he doesn't want to drink the finest wine he doesn't want to eat like the rest of them he wants pulse and then it's going to look better and fatter and healthier than the rest of these guys because remember logic defines us that once he goes on that diet it there's no sustenance that's going to keep him there but see Daniel said that's what I want and I'm now going on with the story because I don't want to spend time on this too much but it says that now the test in verse 12 come and he says prove thy servant I beseech thee 10 days and let them give us posts to eat and to drink water now I like no I don't like water [Laughter] okay but if you think the diet that they went on this is lean and then he says then let our countenance be looked upon before thee and thy countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat and as thou seeest deal with our servants now that's a bold statement but see Daniel now made a stand for what he believed in he made a stand for what God was doing in his life okay so the taste came and the eunuch says to him he says hey bro if you get this wrong my head is off but you know what go for it I'll taste you 10 days remember 10 days it's coming back and then here in verse 18 to 20. now at the end oh 17 he said and and for these four children God gave them knowledge and skill and learning and wisdom God Daniel that understanding in all visions and dreams so that was the gifts that that God gave Daniel and and the other three of them he says in verse now at the end Verse 18 now at the end of the days and the King said to bring them in and to the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar and the and the king communed with him so commune means he had a he had to and fro with him you know he had a bit of a chat with him hey guys how's it going you know how was the how was your training how was everything awesome a couple of tough questions you know because he wanted to see what was now in them okay and this is his report and among all of all was found none like Daniel hananiah Michelle and Azariah so Cedar of music and therefore they stood before the king and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them they found them ten times ten times better than them okay then all The Magicians astrologers and and um and um all these in all his realm and Daniel and Daniels continued even into the first year of Iran he continued in the first year of the king Osiris so what happened now is they believed something the test came and because they believed it and they stood for what they believe in God came and he fulfilled that but but what they don't see is this was not and we're going on with with Daniel too this was all God's plan because God wanted to get Nebuchadnezzar's attention Okay but he wanted to put the right people in the right places first so so King Nebuchadnezzar knows nothing was coming up next now the same for you you sit in your work you sit at your school you're surrounded by people you touch people's lives everywhere but God's blessing you in different places and he's saying I just want you to to stand for a testimony I just want you to stand for a witness I you don't need to say much but when the question comes to you stand on the word of God because if you stand on it it will stand for you they might not understand what you say you say Hey you know I believe there's a prophet that see on Earth and he preached and he's opened the seals they might think you're whack it's fine you stay with what you believe because God has to come and confirm it to those people okay so they'll either go for the word or reject the word that is God's will God's get it right this is all God's work just stand for what you believe in don't hide it if you hide it God cannot back you up you're a false witness if you believe it stand for it that is what God gave you he put you here for a reason so then we go to the next one and we go to Daniel 2. now of course Nebuchadnezzar gets this dream now I'm going back in the story now he gets a dream and he goes back to the sorcerers and The Magicians and all those guys and he says I want you to tell me my dream so he doesn't tell them the dream and say interpret it for me he tells them I want you to tell me what I dreamed and I want you to interpret it and and the Chaldean say to him and all the magicians and astrologers they say to him King you're asking a hard thing how could we see what goes on in your heart how can I read the intent and the thought of the heart I don't have that gift Satan cannot do that Satan cannot see what's in your heart he cannot read your thoughts he can give you them he can give you them all day long but he cannot read the intent of your heart only God sees that okay so don't get it wrong so if God comes your way and he starts working with you and it's working within here you know God's getting your attention amen okay so I just wanted to lift that up as well so here Nebuchadnezzar since sees this dream and it troubles him very much but he can't really remember what he dreamed but he knows it impacted him really much so he goes and he puts forth a degree and he says well you you clever man you're musicians your astrologers and Chaldeans are all those guys you can't tell me because you're trying to buy time I'm gonna make a decree I'm going to off with all of your heads because you're a bunch of fakes because they were they had gifts but they were fakes okay so they could say only what the king said and they can turn the word as much as they like and they can go from Revelation and Genesis and tell you all the nice things but they could not put the word together they could not put it together okay I hope you're reading between the lines here okay they had a epiphany of this and a little bit of scripture on this and David had four stones and that one had that and this one and they're all these little things but they don't want to take all of it so when the king says give me all of it I want to know what's in here give me all of it discern my heart deal with me inside where nobody else knows they couldn't do it it's only one that can do it and it's the loving God amen so in in verse 9 he says so I will make known unto me the dream and but therefore as one decree for you and you will be prepared what you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me so he figured them out it's not a dumb King they say he says till the time that I'll be changed thereof and tell me the dream I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof so he's now putting the challenge forth and say show me my dream then give me the interpretation then verse 4 now verse 4 is where the challenge comes Daniel he's there they they're having a bit of a evening drinking a coffee and just you know just having a little thought and just being in a nice diamond on his door and they open up and he is this guy and he says sorry we're gonna have to cut off your head King said kids I want you to understand King said I'll come and kill you you wise man because you're a fight okay now I'm paraphrasing a bit but you can go read it read the chapter two okay it's in verse 12 that's what I'm talking about and Daniel goes oh stop you Lori whoa whoa whoa whoa what's going on all of a sudden I want to get killed just the other day you know when when we were there by the king and we were so wise and everything he said you guys are the fairest and the wisest and everything I want you to rule my kingdom now I'm going to get killed why and he says and he gets here and he speaks to um ariak I hope that's his name or else man of poor fella Eric tells him about the degrees but what's the degree about he says Nah The King had a dream he had a dream nobody could tell him to dream he goes okay so don't kill anyone now just give me just give me give me a couple of moments I want to go speak to the king now here comes a believer I want you to see this 17 and Daniel went to his oh no sorry I'm 16. he says and Daniel went and he desired of the king that he would give him time and that he would show the king the interpretation now this is bold challenge games fourth believer goes and speaks to the king and says I will show you the interpretation now I want to ask you that Daniel have thus saved the Lord From The Lord no he didn't have it yet he didn't know if God will show him the dream though it was his gifting he had no confirmation that that was going to happen so he stood for what he believed because he knew that the almighty God can answer him and he can show him the dream because he knew in whom he believed so now he goes back to the king and he says to him give me some time I will come back with the interpretation think about it have you spiritual hats on give me time let me go pray I come and sit here Lord show me the interpretation I don't understand the scripture I want to know more about the Revelation I want to know more about why the voice why the shout what's the trumpets about what's the vials about show me more of the Revelation because I know God you can give it to me and if somebody tastes me on it and I have been in my own testimony where people has tested and asked me heavy questions very very cutting questions not just about the prophet and this message but even in my life and I didn't have the answer and I said Lord show me the interpretation but help me stand for me and the very next day coming into church or coming into fellowship and the word comes right over that and those people testify and say didn't we just speak about this yesterday and I said but that's God it's not me he's getting your attention the same year he's going back to the king and he believes and he says I will come and bring the interpretation now he's standing for the word now let the word come and stand for him because remember he's a Believer and he's a witness so he didn't know he was going to get it but he's a Believer and he's a witness amen amen so here we go and we go into verse 17. so what every good Christian does we we organize a prayer meeting because this is serious you know because my head is is going to be gone so Daniel goes back and he goes hey you know Bendigo and that time they their names was different they said uh Daniel went to his house and hananiah Michelle and Azariah he said boys we need to pray but he says these words he says that they would desire mercies of the god of Heaven concerning this secret that Daniel and his fellows should not perish so he didn't say boys you need to pray for me I'm going to go before the king and I'm going to teach him a lesson and I'm going to show him how it's done and I'm going to say thus say of the Lord and God's just going to reveal it and we'll be here either this is his voice we're going to die if we don't pray I hope you get it you're gonna die if you don't pray you will spiritually die if you do not talk to God if you do not talk to him and you don't ask him to help you and you're not there communing with the Lord in your secret place you will die it's always a case of life and death children if you're not praying you will die and I'm not saying a physical death but inside if you have no relationship with God how can God reveal to you his word same for all of us remember what you cast upon the Water will return to you so if you're not talking to God and you don't have you don't have places where God needs to deal in your life and you say Lord take this take this from me I'm tired of this and we don't have a communion with God how can God show you in his word how can God come up the scene how would you even know it's God telling you what's going on if you're not talking to him prayer is the number one weapon you have it is uh it is understated I'm telling you prayer is where it begins if you pray I prayed for my wife when I was still in the world when I wasn't even a believer and God heard my voice and it's a testimony and it's part of my testimony even being unbeliever not really believing in God I came to a time where I was desperate and I got on my knees and I said Lord I need your help here I'm tired and you heard me even when I was an unbeliever how much not more Believers that standing on his word saying God please just come behind this word and confirm it because I'm out of my depth I cannot interpret this dream this is only from you I'm going to go to the king and if I get it wrong my head is gone so I think it's time you step in Lord please have a conference with him amen if I don't understand this I'm not just going to self it I'm going to get on my knees and I'm going to pray and I'm going to pray and I'm going to pray until God gives me answer and I will not stop praying until I get the answer that's a believer and that's why Daniel went back to his friends to say but I need you to pray with me because this is a real matter amen so year 19 the great secret wasn't revealed unto Daniel in a night vision then Daniel blessed God Of Heaven so God came down gave him the vision and now he goes into worship because he knows this is God that's speaking he saw the vision now he worships God and he's praising God and he says here and Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of the Lord forever for wisdom and might is he and he that that changes the times and the seasons and removes Kings and set them them up he knew what God was doing he knew what was God able to do and he says always he says he giveth wisdom to the wise and knowledge to them that have understanding amen and he really went into deep worship and he thanked God and then he went back so now we went back with thus say of the Lord but now it needs to be now he's got the vision from God but now he is a Believer he's now boldly going to speak before a king and he he knows that that's God and he knows that's the dream so the confidence when he goes back is not him being lifted up but he knows now God is going to step on the scene and he's going to tell um I said brother he's going to tell King David neither his dream okay yeah I said why too okay so then he goes in 29 and says in Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said the secret which the king have the man that can cannot the wise man the astrologists the musicians the sufsayers show unto the king but there is a God in heaven that reveal of Secrets and make it known to King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days thy dream and the visions of thy Head Upon thy bed are these so now he's saying my God knows what goes on in your head so so just let's let's get it straight my God is so great that whatever you think of I know children who knows another story in the Bible okay there was a prophet and then the the Philistines will keep attacking attacking and every time they attack boom they just run into a wall who is that Jonah nope cowboy no Reuben nope who knows come on Brothers anyone there yes yes and that King was so troubled of course it goes man every time we attack boom we just hit it was it the Assyrians or was it the Philistines brother be the syrians hey okay sorry got the got the the oldest enemies so they'll just cut them down okay if it's a cancer demon or if it's a or if it's a last demon it's all just demons as long as you just know which one you're fighting cut his head off don't don't let him don't don't let him stand he's got his hero so and then what happens is Elijah leads them back into the camp he's blinded leads them all into the camp and actually Israel could have just stopped it right there but they feed them and let them go so that's the god that we serve that even if your enemies comes to Seek and Destroy you he just turns them around feeds them well and sends them on their way because we don't fight the fight I want you to realize we don't fight flesh and Bone we fight the spirits and we cannot defeat them only God can as long as you can submit yourself he didn't say are you able he says are you available I want to use you will you be willing to stand for my witness I'm coming on the scene amen he says um and then he says that and then we forgot to verse 46 pretty much now the revelation of this taste comes because God knows the thoughts and intent of the heart and he proved it and he said to him his dream and bro and and and King Nebuchadnezzar he goes and says then the king nebuchadne is a fell upon his face and worship Daniel okay and a commander that they should they should offer and uh what offer ablation and sweet odors unto him then King answered unto Daniel and said of Truth it is that your God is a god of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of the secrets seeing thou couldn't couldn't reveal this secret amen so an unbeliever sees this something more going on in the background So Daniel 3 let's go I'm about to close don't don't fall asleep now it gets better so now King Nebuchadnezzar is so in in enthused with this awesome dream he builds a statue man this King can get it wrong he knows God is God okay how about just think about it he knows God is God he sees God proves him from from where he chose the Daniel and his friends to where he shows him the dream he knows that there is more Daniel's God is God and he builds a statue how many of us know that this God that we serve is God and then we run after other statues um look God is Sovereign almighty God and we choose to waste our time on other statues and we look at King Nebuchadnezzar we think man this guy must be nuts man number serious because look at him he he no he sees God interpret his dream he knows there's a God that can tell these thought and intense of heart he listens to every brother Branham service and when it comes to the prayer line he says sister you have this brother you have this he discerns the thought in their hearts not brother Branham God coming down and then they still say days of Miracles are over that that's a bit fanatical I'm telling you if somebody can tell me what I'm thinking of and he can tell me what's wrong with me and then he says you can accept your healing and walk off I think it's worth listening to him because it's not the man it's the God because it stands at the theater at that I'm waiting for him to come not one sermon I ever listened to we brought them brother said I will heal you not one so I stand for this message because you know what this message opened my eyes to what God can do and will do and is doing it made him a present God it didn't make him a fluffy Duffy God that is that is oh he forgives all sin and when I come and really have something I need to ask him I have to beg and beg and beg I just stand in front of him and say Lord your word says I don't know how you're gonna do it Lord but I know you're going to do it amen and then when I listen to the prayer line something in me says this is deity stepping forth every prayer line he stops people the ladies walking at us his lady stop stop this you turn around raise your hand you've got a Gorder you've got a Gorder and it is it has been bothering you for four years I'll get your name okay Lord and He Speaks their name what is that man in all the hundreds and hundreds of people that's standing before him he speaks their name so God calls you by name and you are his so when he gets you attention don't look at all the other things just see what's going on stop don't overthink it say are you calling me is this for me Lord amen So Daniel 3 statue is both here comes another decree man this King loved making the trees hey he did he says in verse 4 he says then a Herald Cried Out Loud okay so we bought the statue and he says this um uh to you that is commanded o people Nations and languages that that at what time you would hear the sound of the coronate flute harp sekmath sultry um delsymon all kinds of music you shall fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up and who faileth not fall if not down and worship it shall in the same hour be cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace so the challenge is set again okay days of Miracles are passed he can't heal me couldn't do it for you and he couldn't do it for you and you and you and what's the hold on God then say I'll heal everyone you said I'm your healer okay just remember God is Sovereign he chooses to do what he chooses to do you just remember you can claim it and you can believe it and you can speak it and you can receive it but God is still Sovereign and he still does what God does they must be a witness upon this Earth they must be a witness they cannot not be a witness upon this Earth that stands for God in the good times and in the bad times and if we say what is the good times what is your good times and if I ask you what is your bad times what is your bedtime how bad can you go because you say you love him but now you're in the valley and it's deep in there and it's dark in there but you know what that's where the fruit all ground is so as long as you get on your knees you start praying that's where the trees are planted by the rivers of life because when I look in a very Valley I see Rivers when I see a river I see life where I see life I know I want to be by that River because I know even if it's dark and even if it's cold and even if it's muggy and even if it's painful I am planted By the Waters and they will feed me and my leaves shall grow and I will go green and I will bear fruit and those fruit will be my fruit that will honor my living God I'll stay in the valley if I need to As Long As I grow no point being on a Hilltop and you just get blown away with the asses don't be there rather be in the valley you're closer to your God when you're in the valley he says now of course you get those backbiting unbelieving people that throws blame in verse 9. and they speak to the king and they said Nebuchadnezzar O King live forever they always come with this nice language you know oh you great king you know you made this beautiful degree by these Jews I didn't see them bow they don't dress like us they don't look like us they don't believe what we believe they they say funny things you know they're just different they're weird people and if you tell them hey do you want to be here they go no so oh do you want to go into this Nightclub not for me brother um said it's so beautiful my feet will not let me go there do you want to go to nightclubs my feet don't go there I'm different yeah but everybody else does so you're just a stop cast who wants you because you don't want to do what we want to do you know I don't want to be afraid you know and then they go to the coolest kids in the school and they go oh you see that Reuben yeah every time we say yes to do this oh he goes the other way but he's living a life he's living a witness he's he's doing something that not being done on this church age he's standing where people are falling I would say this far he's overcoming where others can't overcome because there's a God within him that's going to show that he is predestinated all of them that belief will overcome you have to overcome God said you're going to overcome but you see we we think of all the the ways not to overcome we think of all the things and keeps us off the promises we don't think on the Promises Satan will never bring you back to a promise of God he will never bring you back to a promise of God you and your house shall be saved he will not bring you back there he'll take you everywhere else he'll show you how filthy your kids is he'll show you how wrong your husband is he'll show you how bad you are at work he'll show you that this one's not for you and that one is not for you but when it comes to the promises of God he goes that's how he deals these guys they went to the king and they showed all the obvious great king Off With Their Heads throwing them on the fire they're not bowing to your prison we're not here to Bow under the pressure of this age we are not leducian we are not increased with Goods we are not blind we are not miserable we are not naked we are different and that is my witness and that is my testimony and re you know what I don't care if I'm Different I like myself this way I love what God is doing in my life I can see him everywhere I walk I can drive down the road I can see him I can walk into a in a library where it's so boring and I can find God there I can sit under a tree and a leaf can fall and I can see job's story hey my phone man he was looking at the trees and he saw but that tree dies in its back where am I going see you can see him everywhere but what we choose to do is we keep our Focus off him and then we forget what we are and I'm saying again we forget what we are we are the true witness to a dying age that is under judgment and if you watch the news she's under judgment not coming back and I'm not staying here he says then he calls them forward to make example of them and now the king great King Nebuchadnezzar say come here come here boys very wise very nice got a problem why didn't you bow you know that you didn't bow I'm actually going to have to throw you in the fire now but this is one thing he did wrong and I want to go into that verse verse 14 to 15. and I'm going to read verse 14. Nebuchadnezzar speak to them and said unto them it is true o Cedric misak now he calls them by the Babylonian names and Bendigo do ye serve my God nor worship the golden image where I have set up now I've already that now you know yeah you be ready so now he instructs him that when you hear the sound of the cornered fluid hopsack but Salisbury and dulcimer that all Kings and all kinds of music that you will you will ye shall fall down and worship this image which I have made but if you worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of the burning fire furnace now we heard this before but look at the mistake that Nebuchadnezzar makes look at this mistake he sees and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands big mistake because now God goes sorry because now it's not more my children now it's me but now it's personal because now you say I can't heal you say I can't save Redemption doesn't come from me I died on the cross for nothing so you take on what I say the prophet isn't for us it's not for this age The Voice doesn't matter hold on God will stand for his word he has to he has to and he and he will stand for it just stand for what you believe in he will stand because they don't challenge you they challenge the very Living God that dwells within you this is not a flesh and Bone Affair and Flesh and Blood this is a spiritual and once they challenge what you believe in and this word that is true God will come and you will confirm it and your words will not fall to the ground your words will not fall to the ground oh we don't serve that God that makes that happen so now big mistake King nebuchadnez The Challenge as a god and Cedric music and ubendigo answers the king because guess what they believe us so it doesn't matter if they die great king we are rid of you but our God is more than able to Deliver Us from you but if he doesn't if he doesn't matter I will not bow now I'm paraphrasing but we can read in the scripture because the Revelation that they had is I have no other words who has the words of eternal life no man spoke like this no man spoke like this and when I ask him something and he confirms it to me I got that Revelation the word is to be revealed so once it's been revealed in my heart how can you move me from it how can you move me from it it's been revealed I've been standing in front of the fire it's hot everybody is cranked at seven times harder it's hot but is revealed to me nothing will happen and even if I die I'm just teleported to the next round I'm just there I'm worshiping already so whoever stays behind they lose because I'm already worshiping the King of Kings I'm already there I've nothing to lose amen so they get thrown in the fire face down good place to be and the two gods that throws them in parishes at the fire but the Believers and verse 21 gets thrown in and they fall face down because remember they were bound hand and feet they were bound they fall face down now the Way Up Is Down and sometimes God has to throw your face down on the ground to get your attention sometimes God has to to get your attention in such a way it makes you run into a brick wall and it hurts and the trial is fiery and it and and you don't understand what God is trying to do but hold still because all he wants to do is loosen your bands that's holding you back because you're a witness I want you to realize you are precious in the sight of God you are a witness to a Dying World I cannot stretch it enough there is not enough of us out there that goes to the people that is dying to witness this gospel there's not enough there's not enough people that can get attention of someone to say God can heal you God can save you I've just heard a report where where um and and then we we uh brother-in-law of mine is going through a hard time not going to accept that this is me and my house and all that I live will be there and you know what that devil has got a party on his hands now because his thinking he's having a party with my brother-in-law but let me tell you one thing I'm going to pray for him I'm gonna get him back I don't care what I need to do but I'm going to raise the fight and I said Lord you need to intercede here Lord it is my promise that you've given me it's my family it's my loved ones why shall I let them go to that cosine why should the enemy have that see now you've got a burden now you get on your knees now you start praying now God will go on the scene he's the Living God he's just waiting for you to start praying he's waiting for you to start interceding he's waiting for you to speak to the brother and sister that needs that word he's waiting for you you're the witness you are so important I cannot stretch it more Daniel and Bendigo was the most crucial part in that book of Daniel and the whole book is written around them because God wants to show you that they must be a life that the book of Isaiah said even if they throw them in the fire I bring that back to your memory it will not burn them but someone has to live that scripture and they standing there and they say Okay throw us in the fire because I remember the book of Isaiah in verse 43 said even if they throw me in that fire I will not die it won't even touch me so they throw them in the fire stands up and he sees in verse 24 put that up Dalia police here this is a Nebuchadnezzar King was astonished and Rose up with haste and he spake and he said to his counselors that may not cast three bound men three bound men into the midst of the fire they answered to him and said to him true O King and the next verse he says he's answered and said low I see four men loose so your family won't come I see four men loose okay you won't make it I see four men loose no matter how hot the pressure no matter how dense it is in your house you can't even speak about God before they want to throw you with an apple or something doesn't matter what is going on around you I see four men loose that's the testimony and King Nebuchadnezzar Cesar he says walking in the midst of the fire in this trial and no hurt and have no hurt and the fourth form of the fourth is like the Son of God and we had a jubilee in our house about that how did Nebuchadnezzar know who's the son of God who's testifying you because they are the only one God that could interpret his dream and all of a sudden he looks in the fire and he sees this one standing and he looked forth like the Son of God how did he know he's the son of God how powerful that an unbeliever Pagan worship God that raise up a statue can see the Son of God how much not more a Believer filled with the Holy Ghost can see him come on the scene every time he's praying when he steps into a conversation he knows the Son of God is with him when he gets challenged he knows God stands right with him when the doctor says you've got that he goes ah Son of God is with him see they just walk different they just believe different we just look different so then we finish with this one and then I'll read my last quote and I'll be done I'm about to close then Nebuchadnezzar speak and said blessed be the god of sadrach music and Abednego who have sent this Angel and delivered his servant and trusted in him and have changed and have changed the king's words and yielded their bodies that they might not serve or worship any God but but see what he says Dee he says who have sent the angel and delivered these servants that trusted in him so that they wouldn't worship my God because he he got it wrong and he says accept their own God so he knows who they're going to stand for and I'm going to close with this as the musicians come forward if you can put up that brother that quote dear brother Ben sorry he says all right here was voices Oh how we need how we need in Jeffersonville I say in Stokes Valley I say in Wellington I say wherever you go thousands of lived voices don't Don't Preach to me live show me the life he says here the Thunder of God of thundering out of the the sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around on the Earth today or in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir a real Christian that Thunders against the enemy so the witness of God living in this world right now walking upon the streets you you are the Thunder against the enemy you are God's answer to this Dying World you are the weapon that God can God can use to shake a nation how powerful you are the weapon that God used to shake someone out of certain death he says the devil don't care how loud you holler the devil don't care how much you jump or how much you do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see a a Sanctified holy consecrated to God saying say anything to him call him anything just sweet as he can be move right on oh my that throws him and that's the Thunder that shakes the devil amen I want to play the evidence again of your goodness if you may I want to say I want to encourage you that you are that testimony your life speaks louder than any word that you can say but I want to say if you do say the word it will come back to you because what you confess and what you stand for needs to be tested to make sure that that is what you believe foreign your life must reflect the word because how can you be a witness if you say one thing and you do another thing if you fall this way and you lean that way how if they don't like you it doesn't matter you're still shaking the kingdom of heaven and you're shaking the kingdom of hell because if you shake heaven God will come down and I don't mean to push against the thunderings that comes down and it strikes that demon that's sinning within another person that's got him so captured that he can't see the Gospel Light Shine or glow but you're that life when he looked at you and go what does he have that I don't how can he just believe the word and walk on it it it you are the conundrum this world cannot figure out [Music] but God wants to use you but our focus is everywhere else our focus goes to places where we shouldn't be our time spent is not on our knees we're not busy witnessing we live but we not live such a life that it gets so salty that they want that water [Music] there's not a rebuke I ended High I want to tell you the value of your life right now matters Walker sticking [Music] time is no more there will not be another age after this one when the Gentiles is over it is over would you want to see your friends there family who gives you the report your family is not there cast that down who gives a report that you will stay sick cast it down who gives you the report that this word is false to down you're going to have to stand for something or you will fall for everything [Music] and the earlier you know that when you stand for the word of God God will stand for you amen let us all just raise to our feet just going to pray as we as we close here I just want to say Lord Jesus see Daniel and his friends Lord they just loved you Lord they just walked with you father they didn't understand all the Mysteries Lord though you gave them Gifts of wisdom and Lord you gave them dreams and visions they still had to live their lives Lord in this this Babylon Lord that didn't serve you and didn't recognize you and Lord they came against Kings and kings and More Kings and and Lord Daniel even got later on tested and thrown in the Lions then but their lives were still reflecting what you were doing that you are the Mighty God Lord they were real believers they were hardened Believers that knows Lord if it is against your word they will not stand by that Lord that they will stand for you and they knew that you would stand for them Lord here is Believers in this building that loves you and believes in you Lord that Lord we Are Witnesses for this dying age father that is so busy with everything but you they are so busy with their own minds and so busy with their own little walk and the the own little um hobbies and and readings and and all those things that they forget that they Witnesses father but I asked tonight that you would reveal to them I asked tonight Lord that you would reveal to them the very value you see in them Lord in the very work you have set out for them in this age there will be a voice upon this Earth that will testify of you Lord they will be a bride that will stand here without spot and wrinkle for our father there is one that will be here where no sickness can stand before there will be one year where no sin or no demon can stand before Lord Lord because you said they that believe these signs shall follow them Lord we don't have to figure it out we know we're that people we know that we are called by Your Name Lord I pray Lord that you would give us the sincerity to know that the battle is great the enemy is everywhere father but greater is he that lives within us and if we come before that enemy Lord that we don't need to worry about what we say but the Living God that is within us will speak that word and Lord that will bring Liberty that will bring restoration father Lord may we stand tonight Lord Lord may we stand for the Living God lord may we we stand for this message with all that's in US Lord Lord because this is the this is the very essence Lord you came and gave us a warning you gave us the best warning to say there is fire going to fall and they were going to bind you because you stand for me and they will they will tell you things that that hurt your feelings and that that makes you feel sad and makes you sometimes just feel that it's maybe not worth it they will really close ones will say things hey you think how can you say such a thing if God is living within me and he's testifying of that but Lord we forgive them because we know that there is a promise we know Lord we in this world pass away and that didn't Christ rise we are the ones that will be called up with him to meet you Lord and that's good enough for us father if we just want to see your face brother Ben says it so much we just want to see you Lord and when we get there we know we will see you and all these trials and all these tests and all these things that you you made us go through Lord For Your Glory for your kingdom and for a witness and to call more towards you Lord and get those lost ones in it's worth it father because when we lay our crowns at your feet father when we we put them there by your feet and realize Lord that all the other Saints that's there that's because we surrendered our life to a service for our King and we would lay our crowns down lord and we say we are not worthy father you alone are worthy oh great king and we will worship you and we will have the best
