the stairwell you know you are I don't know any of you who knows this big trucks you know the horse and trailer you know them you know that long long one doesn't have four wheels ah it has got so many wheels there some of them they even go 2-2 have you seen the Malacca some of them go 2-2 so those are not spare Wheels no so if one of them gets punched another one can still hold on if another one is busy another one can hold so so so we we we are here this morning uh By Appointment amen we are here by appointment of the Lord to honor the Lord's Resurrection that's right so let's just read the scripture then I can allow you to sit down to just read Ephesians chapter one Ephesians chapter one amen trust the Lord will just guide us and lead us this morning amen that he can just anoint a speaker and the hero alike so that he's he can have the preeminence amen once you are there just say amen amen I'm the one who's not there yet Ephesians 1 amen let's read it from All I'm going to read a few verses jumping but starting with this one and then jumping to verse four the Bible says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ amen by the will of God to the signs which are at Ephesus and I want to say this morning to the saints that are in Stokes Valley Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Stokes Valley lower Hutt New Zealand amen and to the faithful in Jesus Christ the reason I'm putting stocks very there is because the last part of that verse it says and to the faithful in Jesus Christ you are the faithful so he was writing to the to the saints that were in Ephesus and to the faithful which is you amen hallelujah amen let's read verse 4. now this is a powerful verse this is a powerful chapter according as he had chosen asking him before the foundation of the world Amen right did you hear that now this is you know according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so brother and sister you were chosen you were chosen before you your name is chosen amen before the foundation or you better believe it that you are chosen amen that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen and there's only one thing that is gonna that's gonna make us blameless we'll talk about it now I think I want to jump to this I wrote four two fours there but I know I'll find that oh yeah sorry sorry I made a mistake I wanted that verse that I read is verse three sorry I wanted to read verse three brother eight sorry sister tell you before the one that says according to according to according as he has chosen let's read this one let's let's verse three it's also equally powerful blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ you see he has blessed you which means God can just bless anyone the specific people that are chosen that are blessed and those people amen they were chosen and they are blessed with all spiritual blessings that are found in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption amen of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will having predestinated to predestinate is to fall no to fall choose to know something that is ahead to prepare and something that is ahead and it's all chosen right predestinated in other words pre-determined huh in other words we we are here but we had already been there it's already been done there you are predetermined for knowledge please already preset I don't know the best way to explain it by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure you know when you give someone something and he says this is my pleasure according to your good pleasure according to his good pleasure it is the Lord's pleasure to have predestinated you let's read the last verse verse 11. so I have of inheritance let's hear what they will say in home we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of whom of him who work at all things after the Council of his own will so this is about him then these are everything that is here he's up his will his pleasure his predestination let's play once more thank you my Lord Jesus Christ for the way that we afraid Lord we are so humbled we are so delighted Lord we are so excited father to hear that Lord according to the pleasure to your pleasure to your will you decided to choose me you decided to choose my brothers and sisters we are so thankful Lord and we don't want to take this for granted we don't want to take this light we want to deeply acknowledge it and think about it Lord for it is not a small job for me Lord God it is not a small job to realize that father you chose me no wonder when I got this message my father no wonder when we received this message we felt a connection no wonder when we had your word we felt a connection because we were there predetermined before the foundation thank you my savior for making us part of your plan you commit the service into your hands us and our children and brothers and sisters in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen please enjoy the comfort of your seats and um the that those that have got a strong spiritual eye can already tell you that we are going to talk about the predestination we are already going to talk about if it's possible sister Talia you can display it there my girl brother outside is to me is possible and then we can just enjoy it this morning just relax there's nothing that is out of cater we are not short this morning amen this morning everyone who was supposed to be here is here amen and remember the Lord does not count the numbers no the Lord does not go one two three ah they are short I must add today no the Lord weighs us the Lord can put one man right here he's standing the pulpit and you preach the service and Heaven says hallelujah that's what the Lord because the Lord weighs us he he weighs the spirit his presence right that is why God you can't count him and say he's one the Lord your God is one but you can't say God is like this finger one his presence Hallelujah so we have read that but our topic today I would like us to look at this topic that is very very doctrinal issue and but but such powerful uh if you come to think of it if you just take your time and study it and you will find that it's not as as a subject that brother can come here just in one service and we preach and we finish it it is a long and a deep subject it means you when you know when you eat beautiful food nice food have you ever gone to Sister Hannah and he cooks for you Korean food you know when you eat that food you relax you you sit back and then no rush and then you just take it bit by bit that's what I would like you to do this morning we are not rushing in fact anyone can sit on their row if you want and just press your feet and relax because we are in the presence of the Lord amen so I would like us to take that posture this morning and look at the believer's position in the mystical body of the Lord that I love this body of the Lord there's a Psalm that says I love this family of God so we get into one you see that family is so closely knitted into one it is it is Mystical you know you know what the meaning of the word mystical if you go up a little bit my girl a mystical when I I went to Dr Google and I went to the dictionary I checked I found that mystical they say is having a spiritual meaning or what I like is the reality that it is neither apparent to the senses to these five senses that's right it is it is it is a reality yeah yeah it is a reality you see this thing is a reality from at least for the five senses okay but it is very upper it's not clear you don't need any explanation for me to tell you that this is a highlighter and it's pink and it has got a lead and everything about it is Pink right so it's not something that you your senses can mistaken it for blue or for a pen or a pencil it's clear you know a highlighter do you see a highlighter so but but a mystical body you apparently or even you can't say no no not everybody can say oh that's the body of the Lord [Music] Holland and Germany all they are like this is this is their body no it's a mystical body right an idiot Squad and it's not obvious today to this intelligence right right that is why he said I will come and be in you that only you and I will know but the world won't see the world won't know the word will say come on what body are you yeah that's right but because it's a mystical body all right let's take it easy this morning I'm not gonna we're gonna try to just make it like more a teaching and and I know when you are teaching people tend to lose you along the way and sleep so I don't want you to lose me because this is very enriching it has been very powerful and a blessing to me and I would like it to be a blessing the same way to you amen amen mystical body not obvious to the to the to the canal eye right but it is clear to the spiritual eye are we together it is a mystical body of the Lord and is across the world Amen it's across the globe right and he's gonna take it and he saw that body that bride he saw him and he planned for her he come into that mystical body himself the Lord Jesus so we are going to speak about the position of that believer in that body huh why not say position I don't mean in cashier when we've got about the Cubana the Deacon when we've got brother Ben as the pastor when we've got brother Andy's that no no I don't mean those positions those are physical positions that we have for the administration of the Church of this building and how we manage this how we must be orderly those are good for the church order right but I'm talking about your position as a believer in this body right you will follow me three things we are going to talk about I've highlighted them over there three things only and we go home but my desire is that by the time we go home that it has already soaked in you have really you've really really unpacked and even went further as the Lord speaks to you because remember as I speak the Lord talks to you right the Lord himself is doing the preaching something ignites something in your heart right it's not everything that I say here that is gonna bless you some things the holy spirit is going to speak to you it's ah and we see you jumping for something that I did not necessarily say you see you're smiling and happy and you say Amen yes that's what I read yesterday thank you Lord why because the Lord Jesus the holy spirit is busy ministering so give him space amen open your heart then he will talk to you don't look at me right amen three things we're gonna speak about and we go home what we talk about possessing the land and the positionally being placed possessing the land and positionally being placed then we'll talk about keeping and maintaining your position your possession your possession is that if you have this book as yours it is your possession you own it now I'm saying keeping and maintaining it right within your position in the weight because imagine if I have this book and you want to borrow it right and you find that men some pages are torn it is not it's not maintained huh would you think that is the book that I love something that is yours you keep it and you maintain it because it is your possession my girl sister Elise isn't it it's your position you make sure that you you you you you fight for this position because it is yours you you cannot allow something that is your position that did not come so easy Malachi you can't allow it to go easy and the devil just play around with it fine isn't it because it came at a big cost right yeah now the last part we'll talk about put we will discuss how position your position in the weight determines your position in other words uh you might not get your possession if you are not in position you have to be in your position that's right in order for you to proceed to possess thank you brother otherwise you might miss your possession and take someone's position that's right you see now let's let's go let's read there that that thing that I highlighted over there but I want to study it in the middle of the paragraph the assistant Talia and say second second sentence of that bottom paragraph but once you come into the kingdom of God through the blood I like what the songs the brother was singing this morning he just could not come out of that blood jar brother Jim was just in the blood I I thought he he stick in the blood that's why I felt so immersed in the blood of the Lord in those songs this morning and I said that brother because right now he's got the atmosphere right now the Holy Spirit knows what you are going to be talking about how can the brother talk about the blood and I want to talk about the blood do you think this we discussed before no we never even discussed the sermons we only discussed songs yesterday yes we didn't talk about the same one but he goes and talk about those songs and bring the song that talks about the blood and I prepare someone that comes and tell us that the blood brought the testimony the public testimony of the Crimson blood of the Lord you are in here in Fellowship where God can bless you and you can shout and praise the Lord and the power of God's working why it is God himself his own body the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ here on Earth operating upon the basis of the shed black and that's what I want you to get it as we start right there's a mystical body on Earth of the Lord it is in operation right and it is operating on the basis of the shared blood can I put this page aside now only 12 pages then we'll be done one one down others is just scriptures we must allow the Lord we just read scriptures the Lord talks to us and we just enjoy that you know we just enjoy that let's read the next page there telescope down a little bit page two thank you so much not upon the basis of Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Shekinah Tabernacle not on the basis of a church no that mystical body comes on the basis of the head blood that's how it operates right let's let's see there not upon the basis of water baptism huh I thought if I get baptized that is the basis ah although it is good it is all right but not upon the basis of water baptism not upon the basis of draining a church I thought if I'm a member of Shekinah cabinet not upon the base of joining a cat it is good actually I can say it is necessary but it is upon the basis of shared blood amen that's right you might have a fellowship with the church the congregation but you will never have fellowship with God till you come on the basis on his basis his terms his terms is through the blood that's why he came and died at the cross are we together that's the first thing that we need to conquer to concretize in our Minds I don't want to see our minds because I was talking to someone I said where's the mind yeah so we must concretize it to understand that we come on the basis of the shared blood he died even now when I sin when I do something wrong mama said the Lord can only look to me through the blood is dripping it's dripping even this gospel the Bible says is dripping with blood of the Believers but the Lord Jesus the powerful bleach of the blood when he looks through to me he see pure white but yet I'm a sinner saved by grace why because he looks through me through the blood they say if you take a red color and a red color red sins filthy that great you know that red that is dirty and you take another rate of the blood of the Lamb then you look at them through the light of the Gospel of the word you see white right and why the snow Hallelujah now let's read paragraph 47. and through the blood you become part of him into the same cell that he came out of man how can that be how can I come out of the same cell that he came out and and the Very presence and a part of God comes into you this is magnificent brother and sister the the same thing of God comes through in me yes you because there's something that is called amnesia it made you not to know who you are and one day we are going to realize who actually we are and it will say had to wait in Afrikaans I don't know if it's a swearing weight or not when you say when you say it says one not really I almost said when they were going to say oh man and it will just and it will be over right now there's still some blurries it lasts that we call this flesh we can see we can see it's revealed but one day we are going to see the reality of realities and that day you will know and that day is the day that you will be ascending going home when you will finally realize that ah this you know you know when you close something and it finally just clicks that's it gone and the Very presence and the part of God comes into you by faith you purchase it and that same holy spirit that was in the Lord Jesus Christ comes in you and then you are Sons and Daughters of God yes adopted amen by the Lord Jesus Christ into the body of Christ amen that cannot make a Methodist that makes a son and a daughter of God Amen let's read just two two more scriptures just just as a base for this because I I'll explain to you now why Ephesians chapter two the three scriptures Ephesians chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 those are the ones that the prophet you know said you know in this book of adoption how many of you read this book man this is go and read this book you know I your wife will just say Armand what's wrong with you there Sister Sister command is everything okay downstairs meanwhile he's busy with this if you go and read this book just take your time because the prophet prays for services in here different days so go go and read it and then you will you'll come and tell me and Ephesians chapter 2. verse 8 I'll read 8 19 20 21 22 only and through here through here we both have access by one spirit and to the father right now verse 19. now therefore you are no more strangers and foreign You Are No More Strangers you used to be foreigners and strangers but no more but fellow citizens right I got to see I got a residence of New Zealand I'm not yet a citizen I'm just a fellow residence now now three years from now maybe they'll call me and say hey come come get your certificate you are now a fellow citizen just imagine if the world can give someone a citizenship and say you are a citizen you the only thing you don't have is the blood of kiwi but you are now everything to you are right sign here if the world can do that how much more about the Lord Jesus him the Bible says he put his sleep Gene inside you the cell that brought his blood comes inside you you are you you there's no you pick up you see the adoption of God it's not like the adoption when New Zealand adopts me one day if maybe I'll go to jail they'll say I don't know we revoke your citizenship no it's not like the law sorry my boy you become a Pure Thoroughbred son and daughter of God from your gym from yourself that's how adoption for the Lord wake adoption for the Lord works like this pure you become original [Music] how can you say something is original when he's adopted that's our adoption for the Lord Works yes he makes you a son and a daughter you you become a son and a daughter when you were not that is why it's called a mystical body because the senses of this flesh can't understand it right you see you become a son and a daughter you become a god you can you believe that you are a God and amateur God you are that's right amen let's read it fellow citizens I mean fellow but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God I love to be in the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone of this household right there's 21 in whom all the building fitly framed remember I said I love this family of God so jointly together they are so neatly together to a point whereby we are told that the pyramids when they build them they didn't put Marta in between there and some super glue no those rocks were cut and they were fitting together that you can't even put the razor blade in between there a human being can do that it's not even a discussion whether God can do that or not is it it's told to us they were they were trying to copy that the devil was trying to copy what God can do whatever technology intelligence that human beings can do the devil saw it somewhere and he's trying to copy so God has a family that feeds jointly together framed you are framed here in New Zealand when they build your house they say they make a frame so that all the pillars and the timber can be gently fit together when they were not when they were coming from different trees they are now one building fit together and at the concrete the foundation is Christ himself the Cornerstone and I built upon the foundation of the Apostle let's read verse 21 in whom all the building fitly framed together growth unto the Holy Temple in the Lord in who he also are builded upon for an habitation of God through the spirit can we say Amen habitation it means a brilliant place you know like you know when we say a habitation is a dwelling environment yeah that's what the building that was that family for the cohabitation not cohabitation for the habitation of God through their spirit everything's mystery chapter 3. at the bottom there my girl then we can go to our first part our first point let's read this verse 15 Ephesians 350. in whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named who the Lord Jesus Christ right the whole family in heaven on Earth is named that he will he will grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened this with might by his spirit in the Inner Man if you stop a little bit and ponder about this he will he will according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened by my with might by his spirit his spirit in the Inner Man right the inner man who's the inner man it's the spirit right yeah left underline that will come back to it we underline it he gives you the spirit in the Inner Man so Spirit to Spirit right that Christ might dwell in Your Heart by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love man I just love how the Bible talks me I I think no philosopher will ever talk like this because because it's just only us understand Hallelujah now that we have read I don't want us to take more time but let's jump to Corinthians First Corinthians 12 all these scriptures the three of them that I read Ephesians 1 2 3 that are really the introduction to adoption to how we are adopted how how we were adopted right I mean in the back part of our minds let's put this scripture First Corinthians 12. let's read it just listen to it just just enjoy listening to it carefully we are not right we are not dressing okay amen thank you let's read verse 8. sorry verse 8. four to one is given by the spirit now here this Paul is talking about your blessings remember the riches of His blessings we read in Ephesians 1 and Ephesians 2 we read about them right now here Paul is talking about some of those blessings some some of them remember this they said in which they say they say plethora there's a multitude of blessings you will never finish the gift The Riches of Heaven ah you cannot be exhausted correct yes so this is just some of them that we are already accessing them from Earth already four to one some you know to one less you can say yeah to Megan thank you for that beautiful song sister you've got a gift you you you you've got a gift my sister and thank you so much and then to one let's say Megan oh let's start with Malachi to Malachi some you give them the spirit of wisdom that's what the Bible says fought one given by the spirit the word of wisdom we come to Sister Maggie to the other the one the spirit of knowledge by The Same Spirit right and to one may Again by faith to another Faith by The Same Spirit wisdom faith what huh Same Spirit and another the gift of healing that we can decide we say to finish the gift of healing by The Same Spirit to another Liam the way king of Miracles Same Spirit to another prophecy more Same Spirit that must be really a very rich God to give you such things and this is just this is just still just blessings 101. this is just blessing one oh because the Bible says healing healing healing healing is the bread to the children not in a proud way but it is something that we we daily can eat bread right now let's go down there in verse 12. for as the body is one have many members and all the members of the one body being many are one body we are many but we are one body yes another one is sitting in a prison in in North Korea maybe right now another one is in Kuwait another one is in Madagascar another one is in Chile another one maybe it's in Argentina another one maybe is in Mauritius another one in India another one is in in a country called in Africa there have you heard of that country another one may be sitting in in Mongolia you've got a mystical body him he knows you he knows her and the prophet saw them Matthew he saw the matching and some of them were went out of line a little bit and the prophet says stay in line he says it was right at the very end there as as they were marching the bride he saw you and he said they were of different nations he thought they were matching matching matching into the Rapture and some of them were at the end there we're out of Step a little bit he said the prophet of God because with the the prophet of the Lord you see with God he does not use this time that we use of Monday last week you did this no he's an ever-present help in the time of need so the prophet can see something that happened in the Garden of Eden in him present tense he can see it now like now yeah right that's why he saw Adam and Eve that God made them some some clothing on the sheepskin what I know it's the sound of that skin of the ship hitting he saw them he saw the Lord Jesus Christ and his oh he was in such a pain at the same time he saw you at the end everything you see they say he's subconscious and conscious are like this so close to each other that was just see everything alive like that he can Venture into that Realm I want to be in that realm amen Amen brother and uh now many of us and body huh how is that possible all the members that one body being many are one body but also so also is Christ but let's be stating for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one boat oh is there baptism so this baptism it looks like it's more than just water that that water is just a physical uh showing of the real baptism we are baptized into the board into one body baptized yes whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be born or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit I used to have an uncle my wife's uncle when he he drinks when he trains you do something wrong he says uh you I'm drinking and you get drunk I drink and you get drunk don't do such things so we we we were all baptized and we were made to drink into one spirit and we do all different things and according to the riches that he gave us is everybody following me we just read in the scriptures now I just want us to to go with the thought of this adoption maybe at the end we'll hit the vain when you are digging digging digging for gold digging digging digging stone stone stone oh you hit the vein man you find just a pile of gold yeah you call everybody stop because you hit the vein I want at some point we hit a vein we got it amen amen and then verse 14 for the body is not one member but many right we all know those scriptures okay so let's let's just quickly start with our first point and quickly run through those three points and then we close there isn't the reason I'm reading those three scriptures and this kind of a background is that the prophet in this message he says the book of Ephesians it paralyzed the book of what what we find in the book of Ephesians or in the Book of Joshua we actually find it in the book of Ephesians spiritually you must look at it this way why when the children of Israel were taken out of Egypt right they were taken out of Egypt okay we know that salvation we are told that it's called there's three stages are we together justification all right next one sanctification and the third one baptism ah my good students man you're like you get eight a plus amen but three stages now they went out of Egypt right and they were in the journey the side of Jordan and then they crossed into the promised land right so the book of Ephesians that's what now talking to us Beyond Jordan after they've closed Jordan that's why the book because they were a physical Church Israel everything they were doing were on the physical side but they were shadowing us they are a shadow to us so if they are a shadow to us that means there might be something in the New Testament that is a replica of the reality of that shadow Ephesians is one of them Ephesians is one of them because Ephesians just tells you where as a believer your you are positionally placed way if you go read the book of Ephesians together with this book not only this book there's many other sermons like and a believer's position in Christ like the message called Christ who has read that one Christ in 55 so there's many the word of God is not just like one feather only and you think you've got the whole chicken no no it's not like no the word of God you must look at it and and have it comprehensively and eat the whole thing the sweet ones and the big towers because you eat the whole chicken don't tell me you never ate feathers of a chicken and the shell of the egg you ate them as long as you ate all the chicken you ate them so you ate you drink the whole medicine if you ate an egg full egg you have eaten feathers and everything [Music] built in there amen and shelf you think you broke and throw them in they were inside you ate them so comprehensively right yeah now let's read I want to show you this parallel of Joshua and Ephesians right in the book of Exodus chapter 3. he says can you go down to eat a bit my girl they correct that's in page here four right we're starting with that point possessing the land and positionally being placed okay we we know that there's three stages that we are we are all made sure to know that justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit and all of them is a build up to that it's not you can't get one and then not get the other no no that's why they're going to resurrect and we Rapture with them how can they Rapture without the Holy Ghost they're going to rap and you and me and me so must go through those stages I know that justification Martin Luther sanctification and now yes that's the typing of it but you as an individual must go through those stages yeah I'm not sure where you are now but I want to believe that you've already crossed the Jordan if not don't you worry if we have just left Egypt it's okay we remember we are more than 2 million we are working if you are still in the wilderness in my language they say it doesn't matter who left first doesn't matter some were hired in the morning some were hired in the evening all of them got the same don't you worry if you don't understand and then you can't get that meat oh that is called a little bone put the bone aside and a child the meat how can you throw the meat and the bone together huh I've never seen that the baby wet wet and want to clean them the Navy and everything and we chucked the baby and they paint the nappy in the bin no we don't do that huh we eat the meat right now what am I trying to say I'm trying to say that when when they crossed listen listen to the promise of Exodus 3 verse 8 to 9. it says and I am come down to deliver them out of the land of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land and to the good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey underline this milk and honey because I never saw them eating milk and honey but the Lord said it the length of milk and honey will I take you to and to the place of the canonites and the hitters and the amorites and the parasites and the heavy size and the jebusitis you can hear those guys will kill you man just listening to those guys if you just meet a jebusite now outside let you know let's look at the parasites it's like parasite so the Lord is gonna give the milk and honey in that land yes Milton now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me me God and I have also seen the oppression where with the Egyptians oppresses them that's the background of how they started to get out right because God remembered this promise right let's pack that one there we had it right let's go to Joshua excuse me now God talks to Joshua remember Joshua is the Holy Spirit Joshua means Jehovah savior right are we together Joshua means Jehovah that's what it means so Joshua now we have crossed now that you have crossed Jordan we are on that side of Jordan we are now actually taking the land we are now taking what our possession men they are parasites there are all sorts of size they right be strong Joshua verse 6 and of good courage For unto these people shall now provide child thou divide for an inheritance the land which I I swear unto their fathers to give them God promised them knowing that the Jewish eyes are there and all these canonized and every night is there God said that is your land of milk and honey milk and honey imagine and yet you are still going to fight but it's yours it's yours but you are going to have to fight for every peace but it's already given to you guaranteed but what kind of language is there can you see you catch it it is not the land that you are given and now you just say oh no no no no let's eat take it easy it's our skies god let's just walk in no there's going to be battles my dear leader there's gonna be Harvest there but one thing for sure is ours and it's already been given before the foundation of the world that's right all what Joshua has been told here is that he must be of good courage because he has given a great task and that Joshua is our Holy Spirit he's the that is why the prophet had to leave Moses had to die Moses could he had to move up the scene so that Joshua can take place so that Joshua can take the people into the land and divide for them The Inheritance it cannot be Moses brother Brendan cannot cannot cannot take you into heaven going to be in all these mystical body at the same time his family Moses of our time took us out come out of them Revelation 10 verse 7. he took us out that Mighty he came took us outcome out of her and we came out after coming out now we walked the journey opened up the Red Sea we saw all the Red Seas and everything we ate the Manna we drink water that was bitter and it was sweet everything right I don't want to preach I want and then we get to cross the Jordan when we close Jordan there was a place called cardespania that place that God Espana was a problem because others believe that they can't go through there but there was two guys whose names were named Joshua and Caleb they said but we can take this place why God spoke to him man you can take that land we have already saw the result you have seen the promises you have seen everything you have even already seen the shadow why do you want to believe that you can make it you have already made it only thing that the Lord is asking be of good courage for there is an inheritance do you know what is an inheritance yes and inheritance is a massive thing so the Heavenly inheritance no executor here on Earth can manage it the estate is too big complicated it's big your inheritance is you man but that's why B that is why those double sides they must be moves now you're going to divide them an inheritance which I saw to their fathers okay verse 7 be strong and be courageous let's go to verse eight now listen to this therefore God says to Joshua therefore I want to this book this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth the book in the mouth John said that he ate the book yeah ah and it was sweet and when it came it was better The book must never depart from you this book today is in the form of the Bible boys it must not depart from your mouth this book then that's what the Lord says to Joshua day it must never depart you must meditate upon it day and night and that thou mess may have observed to do according to all can we say all all that is written there in and then Thou shalt make thy Way Prosper us and then Thou shalt have good success only if you be courageous you take this book of the law of God remember now they live in the time of the law we live in the law now today the law of Grace me and you that's the law that you must take and never allow it to depart not the paper the word of God to meditate upon it day and night because when you do that that's when you meet the captain because when you meet him you meditate about him he comes closer to you if you don't you have not following this instruction and you are calling yourself a a real true picture of what happened during Joshua's time no don't let God don't let your father down he has paid too much of a price yes I meant now in the message adoption now what is the land promised to the New Testament believer what is it let's go down a little bit just to see um what what what what is the Promised Land huh in the New Testament the promised land is the holy spirit okay for it shall come to pass in the last days Joel 2 28 that I will pour my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and upon my handmaids and my make servants we I will pour out my spirit and they shall prophesy let's quickly jump to the next one I want to read the way it says uh you know you know he is talking about when Joshua after they crossed Jordan Joshua went through the camp and he was working that's what he's doing Joshua our Joshua he's walking through the camp making sure everybody is ready everybody has done everything right because we have crossed right go through the midst of the camp and clean your clothes and sanctify huh clean your clothes remember the three stages let no man come to his wife and within three days you will see the glory of the Lord and is the process of getting ready to inherit the promise when you get ready to inherit the promise you don't play games you did you clean you get ready now the promise to Israel was God gave Abraham the promise of the land of Palestine and it was to be their possession forever amen they are your shadow they were given a promise forever what about you he's between the lines this is a love letter your promise is forever no God does not change his mind When God Says something he's done he does not reverse it when he says our man he called you before yeah yeah and then whether you like it or not you're going to come because you are his son and you are going to come the way he called you and then you are going to come the way he saw you God can help you is this way that's what he said it is my daughter come you're going to come exactly the way that he called you the way your picture in our family photo album it is is there we are going to sit and why and take it and see ourselves oh Lord is this oh I was so ugly on Earth father he said no you're not ugly I made you like that so that you can come and see the best oh Father why am I say no you are not the Lord is ah is it the real me and you will be so happy yeah when you finally see yourself in the family photo album I can see that table that long one will will be passionate that album together or maybe see it on the screen I'll be saying Armand past fellow I'm waiting and I'm gonna say wait a minute let me just take five years says if Armand is taking so long and poison the middle and he's still between us myself my time to look at my album yeah ah she's coming okay the Lord says ha I'm about to press the button for the Rapture now it's about to happen and we are relaxed we've got a big inheritance my brothers and sisters our kids must know this our children must know no you know when you go there to Israel you find a little boy small smaller than these guys maybe Daniel's age yeah they instill in him there you the Lord your God is one from a small I saw an article one day that boy he took a rock a small boy he took a rock you know and he was crying he wanted to hit those Arabs soldiers or people with the rock because he he was taught that the your God is here that's the enemy that's the armor right or the devil's eyes whatever why can't we teach our ones like that they must know prior must not be an option for them they must love they must we must compare them physically and spiritually our children if they don't have the Holy Ghost yet you must be the Holy Ghost until they get their Holy Ghost who must be the Holy Ghost they can't kill you no I don't do things no me there no you I'm your Holy Ghost until you get your Holy Ghost so hear your Holy Ghost you get yours one day okay but listen to Mom and Dad and I read your Bible because this law is not just as talking here at church more no no it's reality it must be engraved in your heart we are going to pause because I can't finish this anymore and it's so long and it's so nice and just take a sip right where are we sister Talia we are in the paragraph middle from 39 thank you do you notice Joshua before they crossed Jordan Joshua said go through the midst of the camp and clean your clothes and sanctify every one of you and let no one come to his wife and within three days you are going to Cross Jordan Over Now The Promise to Israel was God gave Abraham and God does not go back right let's go to the next paragraph there was three stages okay we spoke about that let's not waste more time on that one I want us to go to the bottom one and that that's that's where the believer comes he comes first to a recognition that he's a sinner this is just a continuation of the stages we passed that stage are we together we passed we have already recognized that we are we were Sinners that's why we repented we got baptized ah we already passed that stage I want us to zoom into this go down um down to the middle of the paragraph where he says now then being justified by faith and he becomes a partaker and a peace with God through Christ baptized into the name of Jesus Christ to Omit him into the journey you get it into the journey thus he becomes a surgeoner and a pilgrim he is on his journey to what a promise that God made us you and me right but Believers the Believers that Kenneth and Joshua outfit that was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land and took the land and settled down in the land as a possession right and we never stop at justification we move let's not stop at Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord Jesus being baptized and let's not stop because he cleaned us up for a life of for from a life of sin but now we we press on into the position to a promise of the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is our actual possession he was in there there's everything that you need amen some of them don't even know that you need they're in there for Peter said unto the day of Pentecost for the promise is unto you and unto your children and to them that are far off into the me huh and as even as many as the Lord Our God shall call you notice Joshua after crossing over the land and taking the land and then divided the land Israel here Manas are here and this one day God yeah Benjamin here he divided the land that is why we are given different gifts that is why we are given different inheritances same land same Nation but he's going to give to a prophecy he's got a gift of that he's got a gift of what he's got a gift of huh why because manasa but one body one is the hand one is a head when you say I when you say this when you say that one body the land has been divided amen and we must keep our land we cannot afford to lose it right the fullness of the word of God as we read in the Bible should dwell in US there'll come a time when the fullness of God is going to tell in you right now is still in a measure you're still within a measure but you you know you you you you you can feel that way you can feel that the Lord is with me but you're still having it within the measure they're gonna come a time when when everything that our man can do I can also do hahaha when everything that I can do he can do amen they'll come in right now he's still within a measure he's in a hand and I'm still maybe an ear and maybe for the agency you say me you see right now we are still given different parts of our but once we get there all Heaven is yours man all Heaven is yours what you want is there Hallelujah no I want to pause because this sermon I would like to come and preach it again one day maybe we'll finish it on your Wednesday we'll focus on our two points but before we finish uh the book is part of inheritance right that book is part of our inheritance it is part of the placement in position the inspiration anointing from the book reveals the positional placement right it reveals who you are and you get placed I was sitting here and praying one night and the Lord said go and talk about being positioned positionally being placed positionally and I start to write I write I write I write then half of the things that I wrote I haven't arrived to them yet but he says you must be placed positionally when you are placed positionally then you you've got the whole understanding the whole view of who is who in this body you you don't grab the duty in the body of another part of the body because you have been placed and the placement is within the word of God hallelujah there's so much to talk about if there is going to divide the land he must then we must be able to keep and maintain that land we must be able to do that we must be able to remember and there was those people there in that land they they were fighting we'll come to see later on when you talk of the other two points that uh that that battle is around our spirit and and there's Kings there of that land you say you've got the Holy Ghost yes Joshua is in us he walks in around the camp but hey guess what they are the kings of the jebusites with funny names even worse than the country names you will hear about them huh did I take very long brother Jimmy very sweet I didn't know yeah I mean it's just half past level now but you may finish quickly do you allow me just 20 more minutes maybe we can grab that point and we leave the last point and we can grab that point and just chew it in as part of the head always say just chew just when you eat building you don't lie no no no no no no no no you know what you do you listen to how it tastes carefully and you listen to it while you are listening that's how [Music] so let's just take that point and chew it and just absorb it right keeping and maintaining your possession now we've crossed the lane we've done we are done with Jericho the request done I'm no more drinking I'm no more doing all sorts of things right I'm in the Lord now now it's time now once you enter Cannon remember there's still Wars they're still battles but Joshua yes Joshua is dead and the captain of the house is also there right but Joshua is there to fight and be in the front for you but you must walk do the walk yeah and every piece of land where you put your foot on is yours did you hear that uh this is to encourage you to motivate you to refresh you that hey it might be tough at times it might be difficult it might look impossible you might be discouraged but the Lord Joshua the Holy Spirit he's there to encourage you to motivate you to revive you to remind you that remember the land is yours just keep walking keep walking right because the more you walk every piece of land promise everyone if you are working here and there was no minerals here in this in this sport here there was no gold and diamond and all the natural resources and then maybe maybe two meters away from there there is there is just a do you know a drum do you know that 200 drum container what do you call it that 201 blue one okay those plastic ones a big one that we used to have the steel ones you used to push it with water you know maybe there's a gold there of that size the moment I do that it's mine just amazing the moment I step on the ground that is also my everything underneath it and above and the base above it their mind everything is yours so the key is to keep working amen no matter how hard no matter how difficult why why should I tolerate that because it's already been given to you it's already yours you forgot remember you left Egypt you left Egypt and remember you opened the Red Sea for you remember he killed the first bonds of pharaoh for who that was Moses we came out of them we came out of Egypt the Lord did so many things along the way there was mixed small tissues and those Miss multitude their purpose they were agents agents of the devil that were planted among the people of God that wanted to take them back to Egypt kindness and jambres and then and when the prophet of God disappeared and he went to the mountain to speak with God they started to say a book is not his sorry to say that but we can't allow that the seven Church eight book the prophet authenticated this and he read it and he approved it that's it right so we cannot allow no no but that's not what the prophet's book that's evil doctrines yes we are we have passed that we came out of Janice and dembrose they must die amen that'll be so how do we keep our our positions let's go to spoken note of adoption also at adoption one and now after you are in you're in now you're in that don't mean that you are out free from war you still have to fight I tell you I'm going to pay 7A you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on see so see Canon did not represent great Heaven because his war and troubles and killings and fightings and so forth but it did represent this that it must be a perfect walk you see now let me show you how you keep your position let's let's go let's read the story of David how many knows David the story of David okay let me just start off by saying I wrote some few statements there I say you see your position in Christ is determined determines and reveals your possession he if you're not within your position you know not really clearly see your possessions or even easily acquire them because you are out of position if you think of a game of soccer huh or a game of rugby you must be in position of you must run around but you must keep your position if you are a flank and you find that on the flank is empty you were running you wanted to make it right lose your position we take you out we must replace you in in rugby or in game in soccer whatever right but now you keep your position while you are supporting other fellow team members the Bible says that uh you know in first Samuel chapter 17 and I'm watching my time and earlier this is David's brother Elliot remember you are David and you're going to have aliens he's eldest brother had when he spake unto The Man David was sent home to come and visit them to give them some fresh dry fruits to give them some water to see how the oil is doing and report to the father now he arrived now the Big Brother hear him talking to the men at War he hears him ah your flesh your brother who is still small in the in the in the in the in the faith he hears you say I am healed say ah the Lord is giving me this he hears you and he comes to you and says hey hey and Elliott's anger was kindled sometimes your brother's Elders gonna be kindled upon you against David and he said why come is down down hida he was not asking him softly he said sorry I remember he was asking him Ashley David invested in he says to you I know your high pride and your naughtiness of your heart for now I'd come down here that you might see the battle just imagine why is David not if he came to see the bed why is he naughty now why is he proud yeah sometimes the devil can use your brother your sister just remember it's not your brother it's the devil watch out be careful no your sister know the devil right he's a daddy's brother they know that David killed Elio they know they know that David was anointed by someone they know right but when you say oh I am healed you know the Lord has healed me oh no I'm gonna get that job or that deal I'm gonna get it oh you know my child is going to be healed and restored my husband my wife when you confess those your big brother come and say no you must be careful huh I know your pride win he talked to you like that and then what must you say David just said what have I done now in verse 20 can you see 29 yeah David says what have I done now is there not a Cause he doesn't talk too much he just asked his big brother your flesh can be your elium and he wants to dispute your faith when you are David inside there saying her my hobby my husband is gonna be restored my wife will be delivered my child will be delivered your ellipses are take it easy actually you're not even supposed to be here in the middle I know your pride to you I know you're naughtiness if you hear those words you must know that it's early up yeah because he knows he was not anointed so you don't listen to such things just ask him what have I done what have I done to you your body to tell me that I can't get my inheritance what have I done verse 30 and he turned from him and toward another they speak like the same manner sometimes you'll find the whole lot is against what you are saying doesn't mean you are wrong all sorts of accusations can come your way remember job all his friends they blamed you just know who you are does not be in your position and know that you are a son and you are a daughter no amount of accusation can determine your destination and your inheritance just don't take a lie of Satan don't take anything negative even from your eyes even from your flesh don't take it be in the spiritual realm where everything the devil says is wrong I told you before even if the devil can tell you the truth tell him is the lion it's not it's not true to talk at that guy he's not a truth talker even if he tells you the truth tell him you lie how can you speak the truth it must be a lie now David and he went to everyone he was talking there then they were blaming him everybody talking the same manner the Bible says and then investor uh 32. right listen to the man who takes his inheritance and David came to the he came to the king and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him who this philistine right thy said and will go and fight with this philistine Goliath how can this boy says if you come to think of it if now just think about this we are in the house my wife and everybody were sitting there and we hear a big bang on the door and I want to try to stand up my my son here for instance Papa wait wait I'll handle that I I I'll I'll I'll check by the door Elia Elliot he wants to say what I know you're nothing now just I'm trying to bring you to the day when David said to the king my Lord don't worry let not every man here soldiers super soldiers seniors and a head of the chief of the general of salt he says let all of them please my Lord let them not worry I will fight this for this time how do you think Soul thought about that right yeah yes okay let me practicalize it then now comes in this house and the Malachi is dead hold on it's just going to the room I'll manage that I'll handle it for you I don't know what Andy will say but me I'm gonna say I know you're naughty why because I'm operating on the flesh any up what's the problem even Saul was the problem but he was a make-believer neither done it no here he ended up saying to David okay okay okay my son I'll give you my armor you see he wants to give you David no no David wants no one's armor he's got a testimony Lord they know these eliabs What the Lord Has Done For Me in fact in such a day I was working here here and I read me a month I read in the Bible Conference with God and the Lord spoke to me I know that amen that's my testimony nobody no brother no devil will ever remove that from you that's right no one amen what the Lord did for you no one not that no amount of devil so why sometimes we allow the devil the aliens and the big brothers and ourselves to give us a doubt that we can overcome Goliath amen no keep working all I have the head will be cut keep walking right so that's our job and then they tell him they tell him they tell him and then he says my Lord I'll fight that philistine and the Soul said unto David Thou Art and thou art not able to do against this Philistine to fight this to fight with him for thou art but just a youth he's just a baby thingy what are you telling me I'm not even supposed to be discussing with you who must go to the door wanted the king to sort out David and Ascend him home and David said unto Saul die seven kept his father's sheep my Lord yeah so he's saying Daddy you are not here I was here and I had the same look during the day and when I head I opened the door I found is the devil and I said I command you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the one who died at the cross get thee behind me huh I said then someone listens now you did that so and and they came a lion and a bear and and took out of one of my flock out of my flock and I went out after him and I smoked the devil and they delivered out of his mouth and then when he rose against me I caught him by his bed and I smiled and flew him wow the devil so that can you see that I'm a repentful father I'm gonna say okay the Lord be with you and then he goes to the door and he sought out he sought the devil out with a slingshot amen of Grace and salvation huh and I even promised him you know us all promised David things promise anyone who defeats I'll give him I'll give them my daughter yes the whole reason why our Lord come to Earth born the way he was it was to eventually die and redeem sinful men me and you it is undebatable it's undebatable that you are a son of God we are not discussing about whether you are a daughter or a son of God that's unquestionable that's not what we are talking about we are talking about being in the land as their daughter and keeping your position maintaining it every day and night he said the Lord to Joshua and I'm finishing move not to the left or the right when the doctors come this way that way everyone this way don't go to the left you walk straight day and night don't go to the left don't go to the right because straight is the gate scenario is the way so walk straight don't go to the left and I will be with you he promised him didn't he and the Lord said so to us go not to the left or the right when they say Jesus there don't go there especially now yeah go and read second Timothy he will tell you now there's so many jesuses and to shock you a little bit they will even come here in the message here inside and they'll call you a cult now you have a joint you must know who you believe now more than ever before more than never before you must know where

someone they cut to the Bone there's gonna come in time it's around the corner because we're saying around the corner Jesus is coming but he said he won't come before these things come to pass Iran
