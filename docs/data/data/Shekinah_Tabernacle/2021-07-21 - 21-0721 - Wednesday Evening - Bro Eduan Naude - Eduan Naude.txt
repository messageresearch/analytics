saved who enjoys being saved there's no fun being lost i remember being lost when i was a little kid we went out in the bush and then it got dark and we were like in the country that it gets dark in the country because there's no lights around or nothing we were lost man and then we actually prayed lord help us get back home i think we took about two hours trying to get home in the dark and now and then a car would drive across the old country road somewhere in the distance you know so we'd see these car lights and we'll think oh that must be that particular road so we'd kind of walk up and over these hills we got back about probably 8 30 and maybe it must have been winter because it was been dark for a couple of hours and we were we thought there'd be this rousing welcome now parents will be so worried about where we were they didn't even know we got back this was the country in the 80s you know it's like oh are you back we're back we've been lost [Music] but it was nice to be

a needy people all we come together here to to come and ask for healing for restoration lord we come and ask for for uh for a refilling lord we are still here on this earth we are still bound to this flesh lord and things go wrong lord but that's not why we are here only we're here to glorify your name we're here to bring thanksgiving we're here to testify of your greatness of your of your almighty work your hand the tender hand of jehovah in our lives lord how that becomes a reality and how our walk changes lord our walk be amplified let us just go up and up lord thank you for the musicians tonight the technicians thank you for this wonderful atmosphere lord it feels that you are welcome here lord lord hear the people's cries tonight the hearts lord what they come here for may they receive but may they give lord may they may they reveal to you their hearts be with me as i minister a small little thought lord and may it be received because it was you speaking and not me may i absolutely step out of the way lord always nervous to be here lord and as i said in the in the back lord if if i settle and if my nerves go may that be the sign that you are speaking lord you prevail you take over just as the song said lord thank you for everything that you do in jesus christ's name amen good evening friends saints of god sons and daughters of the most high um what a wonderful atmosphere there is tonight here um it's just getting better and better um and there's yeah we we are going up and up um i'll just quickly start with an announcement and there we go can go i'm just into my little slider my thought um we've got youth service this this sunday so that's the end of the month if i've got it correctly thank you musicians sorry it just shows i'm nervous aye oh londy londy asked me are you nervous every time brother ben actually every time every time this is oh yeah lord you are great um so yes you service and then we just got a little prayer request so maybe stand and read god's word tonight if you can go to that first slide i thought i had yes i've got the clicker thank you very much exodus 32 from verse 9 and we will read till verse 14. who are happy to be a christian absolutely walking a victorious life did you call it this week did you call it i call it call it i love it eh exodus 32 and the lord said unto moses i've seen this people and behold it is a stiff-necked people now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax cold against them and that i may consume them and i will make thee a great nation what a promise there as well the lord can't yeah you'll see and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why does thy wrath wax co hot against thy people which those brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people what what desperate desperation this prophet of god has in this moment and who's speaking there remember i abram isaac israel thy servants to whom thou swearest by then by thine own self that sitteth unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all of this land that i have spoken will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it forever and the lord repenteth of the evil which he thought to do unto his people that's a very very powerful scripture there and then just a quick one um and this came slightly late into and this is um ezekiel so i can go here oh no sorry ezekiel 9 verse 4. very familiar scriptures ezekiel 9 verse 4 and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the forwards of the men that sigh and that cry of all the abomination that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in the in mine hearing go ye after them through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have ye pity may the lord bless his word you may have your seats sorry it's very powerful scriptures these um but hopefully this thought will will will drive it home will make it real in your life i will start my little thing here to try and keep my time and my my little thought here right at the top is have my mercy lord now i only realized that at the back when brother asked me the title is this can also go both ways and i think our last service that the title also um you could also it's quicker to see the negative connotation to this than the than the positive so i would just maybe explain a bit of an introduction um so yeah so you might sing think have my mercy lord so take it mercy is over let's leave this earth let's go away let's be under your wing no no not yet the little mercy that i have can you use it lord can you take this mercy and show to that outer world take me into that world let i be mercy for them can i stand in the gap so i we we had on sunday i was just praying there in the back and you always got this little you know glory when something is good or amen or hallelujah you know oh have mercy lord there's a brother here in my right that usually say that and and and for some reason i said have my mercy lord but in the moment of where was fervent in a moment where i was sincere and i was thinking of what is going on in this world what is going around us and so from that angle i want to take have my mercy lord and have my mercy me being in a desperate state of what's going on around us yes the victory that we have but there's someone out there that does not have victory we need to show them something what are we going to show them so i just highlighted the the the definition of desperate having lost hope a desperate spirit crying for relief giving no ground to hope the outlook was desperate moved by desperate despair or utter loss of hope victims made desperate by abuse involving employing extreme measures in an attempt to escape defeat or frustration made a desperate leap for the rope now some of you might have seen in the news south africa is in a bit of turmoil and there was this one picture one um headline and i only only read the little subject where a mother was in a standing on the top of a building that was burning and she threw her child to safety but to strangers there's two ways you can take this and this is now media driving um how could a mother throw her baby to strangers well that's a bit of a first world type of yeah i i want to say a dumb question but i'll i'll i'll i'll keep i'll be restrained um it's fight or flight right and that mother was desperate desperate to save a life desperate to have everything that she loves and on this earth to to keep safe to let live to extend life right and while we're on the subject of south africa and there's a lot that's happening around us not just south south africa i found this little video clip that someone shared with me and just to give a bit of context 200 malls in south africa were affected by this looting and destroying and terrorizing a lot were burned down shops and all that so if you want to put that in context 200 malls uh new zealand will never see 200 moles they don't even have 50. so that is that's 40 so in context again 45 businesses in durban is out of commission that's one city in in south africa um just imagine how many businesses we have here and if you want to put that in context uh something that caught my eye 353 000 tons of sugar destroyed yes 1.5 million homes are without income i just i don't want to speak just about that and there's floods all around the world we see germany now and we see rumors of war china and japan fighting over in taiwan fires throughout canada and russia there was another fire i just heard another country i don't know china is now flooding as well people are in desperation perpetual desperation we've got here our own little floods and stuff and i say not a little to be little we are we are a small country but let our prayers go out to people in westport you know there might be one soul we need to get desperate for that one soul what are we doing for that one soul going slightly back i just want to reiterate i'm preaching to myself the lord's laid this on my heart and if it was just for me praise the lord because i need to work i've got work to do perpetual desperation so let's put that into eternal desperation um we won we won we're victorious we called it okay should we not be desperate for those that's lost that don't know their destination we also know their destination destination it's it's it's truth all lies it is black and white there's two paths right should we not be on our knees continuously the prayers are coming and what what are we doing and and satan has got us so bound with time and i'm speaking i'm speaking to myself so with time the allocation of time not getting to the things that we really want to uh or need to um and it's just keeping us busy and this could be work this could be you know you're ambitious you're working for a a job and you the sole income provider for your home and the law the satan will also keep you busy to a point where you go this is not balance we need to work on this as it was in the days of noah now here's my little thought um that i had way back before i had this have thou have my mercy lord is tying into this desperation in the days of noah people not only on the outside but on the inside of noah's ark this is now my view i would not be surprised if there were scratched marks on the inside of that door of noah's ark because when that flood started when the water rose and when the tire hit the road when the reality dawned on the people inside in safety that there's loved ones out there there's people screaming hollering bringing back coming back to my thought here have my mercy lord was this not someone inside that ark on their knees crying out open the door one last time can we not given two people three people is there not space for one more the door was shut that was the lord and that day that time that everything was gone there was i think there was an absolute desperation from inside the ark is seeing remember now yeah so noah was in this time and we've all heard the story where you are ludicrous all this water where will it come from you building a boat in the middle of nowhere there's just no now coming back to this thought as soon as the reality dawn so now water droplets are falling now fountains are bursting now everything falls into place how many times did brother branham talk about a a a a vision that he had and he started explaining and how the how the lord miraculously turned events and people and everything to align to that vision to that thus saith the lord when that happens people sit upright people start listening people in that moment you go that's it that's the lord speaking there you're going to stand guilty of adultery because that the love of god has leaked out of your heart you still go to church you might still dance in the spirit you might still speak with tongues and then things are fine but that's not it no sir so i don't know what's yep so i just want to quickly briefly leaking out versus bursting forth leaking out leaking out as subtle leaking out as you is unnoticeable sometimes and that's a waste you know let's let's take i always take a analogy with a car for example um oil leaking out of a car no good don't buy that car fix that car you know that is not good what is worse obviously is the engine blows up so there's a bursting right there's oil all over the windscreen there's you know the car is not moving it is it's done right tying that to should we not we should not leak here on the on the on the inside we come to church we we we are a a people of gospel for the the message of this hour we are but we we're going through the motions and we come here and we sing and we dance and we and we go home and just this love is just leaking it's just leaking we come here for a refilling sometimes we top up that oil the love is still leaking love is the leaking that love for that guy out there not here love is still leaking we re fill up love is still leaking you don't notice what's happening there maybe but now down the line in the middle of nowhere the car stops and it's had its time engine doesn't turn the car explodes my dad my dad had a little car uh i shouldn't say this brother romantic folks volcan sorry man but it blow i blew up it blew up it was a little diesel and it had a small little turbo and all of a sudden him and mama's driving and there's just oil on the windscreen and everything just you know and and that that was it now you know there's something wrong okay so rather burst in you know burst with laughter burst with joy burst with this gospel that's given to you but keep that leak that leak that that nut at the bottom needs to be tight nothing needs to be leaking out let it come forth let it burst forth show that love and on that you are not comfortable when you are desperate if you're comfortable step up walk more walk further testify his goodness sing of his glory with our testimonies now in our church and that will this will come and you will hear of it of god god moving god speaking truth god take control and and and god coming on the scene in in moments in in families lives of desperation saying lord this is impossible i don't see a way out but then lord rich in mercy you come on the scene so don't get comfortable who did jesus when he was on earth who did he come for yes he came for a few men few few women on the street fishermen taxman everyone that was hungering that was desperate to catch his revelation the revelation of what he is and he was and he is to come so why should you why should you get desperate now you can hear this now either saying in yourself i'm an eagle or you can say this i'm a crow i told you there's black and white there's truth and lies and you can take this the way that you want you are jesus to this world you sitting here are jesus okay we are not to stay here in a little bubble and be jesus just to message believers okay we saved we won we're victorious we're walking let's pray and let's supplicate and supplement each other yes but let's go out there and come back and say testify of his goodness what has he done where did you plant the seed when did you water this morning let's talk about that as well let's complete this journey and get thousands and ten thousands like the prophet seen when he went over the curtain of time when he saw all those coming towards himself brother may that be a desperation on this side of the jordan saying there's one or two out there there's maybe one or two thousand out there are you planting the seed are you being desperate are you giving all your mercy over to the lord to say hold on once more lord one more soul lord let's go out there and things are to be and this is one of the messages that um brother ben sent on so that we can listen um i just want to bless brother ben for his obedience in that and sending us that i don't care whether they match now we're talking about his nice little coat oh let's read there because i think it's a bit more yeah i don't care whether my coat matches my trousers and i have a hard time my wife my daughter-in-law someone have to tell me what kind of tie i have to wear i don't care whether they match if brother ki ben was here he would say i'm matching too much i've just got blue on blue and blue and blue i want my experience to match god's word that's the thing because that's where i aim to live not down in the corner yonder with the joneses but yonder in glory where jesus has gone to prepare us a place yes i want that yes sir keep me from all this this old tabernacle here you know what it is the body is an old coach that you wear a coat that you once wear now you've got one so much better you don't you don't use that anymore the old coat what do you do you hang it in the closet because you've got something better you've got a better coat it's more up to date you're on the inside that garment only done what it bore your image but you don't need it anymore you've hung it up it's a rag that's the way this old body is you you just it's bore the image of the heavenly yet it's not you now to tie back into you are the jesus you are on the inside of that body you the spirit of god is on the inside of this body that's what makes the outcome or the outside come into subjection because the inside is pulling it see bringing it in line with the word of god you're inside you yourself your being praise the lord so it's not just me saying all this little hyped up to get you motivated you are the jesus and the gospel and the bible to this world here's the prophet preaching it back in 65. so don't get comfortable go and preach this gospel we have to we have to pray a lot for the outreach that's happening there and otaki there's a bursting forthcoming and we need to be in in in in step and and on our knees with that thank you for the report also that comes from there it's really good to see that it's in our mets it's close by we don't have to go to to the to the sri lankans and india's and pakistan's or waiver of this world it's right here so right here is a hunger as well i just want to close maybe on this thought and um also just to introduction to this the the um i was i was listening to a message and then and that's why i'm preaching to myself there's a time gone by and then you go oh i haven't prayed i haven't done i haven't started my day with the lord and then you know mid-morning or lunch or evening or whenever you come back home and you want to rest oh sorry lord the day has gone to waste that little leak there the back sorry lord and when i opened up and i started doing my my little thought and and researching and putting everything together this is the very first thing that popped up onto my onto my phone oh listen this week listen for the voice of god to speak to you it'll change you it'll take all the doubts out of your mind knowing that the lord jesus is the same yesterday today and forever when we see him come into the meetings begin to do the same things that he did when he was here on earth then you want to listen close for that little voice that's something that will change you say yes god it that's exactly what the scripture says that's word by word what the scripture says go home take your bibles reason out there see if it's right search through the scriptures has to come from genesis to revelations tie through the bible that's exactly your promise and hear god it'll change you it'll give you faith to believe and there was there was no bible or noah's boat on that door shut what did they have they had the word of god in their season and here's that fresh new beginning that they need to go out and they need to go and preach the gospels and say what who did they go pretty i don't know but they now they need to search that prophecy that they have so we can now search our our eternal prophecy go to genesis in revelation and we can preach this this promise we can we can exhort we can build up we can lift not only the people here but there's people that's that's sincere and fervent and calling on the name of the lord out there let us love that let us love that person that individual that knows his name that calls on his name that sees no other name may we have mercy to them and may we say to the lord lord just here's my have my mercy to use this use this have my love lord we can we can put everything in there the fruits of the spirit have my kindness lord because the wrath of god is coming we need to be ready that we've done everything and he comes down and he says well done good and faithful servant praise the lord thank you for your time yes let us go into prayer i know this there's quite a few prayers um of thanksgiving um brother harness it it went well but there's more to come and let's let's stay on our knees we've definitely got you know it's a really uh great testimony that's building up and i don't want to keep you in suspense and i don't want to give any spoilers away but the lord is trustworthy he's he's true to his word if you are on his knees you call on his name he will come with a could be a thundering voice it could be that small still voice it depends what you want to listen to the restoration pray for restoration of countries of individuals in those countries south africa the looting you know i've got family there mother there's a lot of people that's got still family there and i don't want to just highlight south africa but that that shows when the spirit of rebellious comes into an a body and a majority of people the the dangers the dangers of that and may we may we really pray for that we've got a lot of prayer for for healing i know um joshua's asked for prayer for his he's got the right side so it may be appendix or something we need to look at that we have prayed for that but can you can you step into prayer and maybe on this on this note if there's anyone else that wants to add the the liquify and add their prayer request here i will try and write that down and we can have that on on the whatsapp amen praise the lord amen matter amen i see no matter what i feel no matter what i hear i believe no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe and if i
