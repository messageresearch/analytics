of Jesus Christ name Amen good evening Saints brothers and sisters what an tremendous week we have had trials and tribulations I can give a quick testimony if that's allowed on the camp we were we were rejoicing we were busy maybe before I say that can I just be slightly biased and and acknowledge a few a few cells in ailments we've had we've had this camp set up and we've never never done this this magnitude this the sighs I wish brother Stewart just came but early and help us out god bless you brother now just joking but um yeah brother a month sitting there at the back on his post of duty making everything works tracing as he as he as he does sometimes but he pushed through and he was he was on his post for a reason and he saw Souls come to the altar and give everything and surrender everything and throw those shackles off and I want to acknowledge them and then young ones well the Caleb day at the back he was sitting there behind that desk and trust me if I was his age I would not have been there I know for a fact and he was on his post of duty and he was stressed and he was wanting to to not disturb the atmosphere and created and help it and and and and make the the Holy Spirit and the time of worship welcomed he was trying to get that words as fluently as quickly up and we've had limitations we have we had our struggles but he just made it work and but the Kris maybe that's honors on the boat it was next to him and they made a tremendous good team obviously we have blessed all the all the musicians that helped us out but is those people that sometimes you don't see I just want to lift them up and say they were a true blessing to me I probably pretended Jesus walking there with the iPad and pretending to know what I'm doing I definitely did not they they were they were the handiwork there in the back and sitting behind the screens and sometimes we we could we could just miss that but that helped make that camp tremendous yes handclaps of praise Amen with we've had a quick testimony or two about about the camp and what's what the Lord's done I was busy with the sound and I was I was just praising the Lord I think it was son was a Saturday night Sunday night sister Lonnie would know but um we were just oh I was just having a wonderful time and and seeing the people and as they go forward and as that that rush just comes to me I'm thinking of names and the names it's just coming in my head and I'm it's a break for them yes Lord and just the Christine was here and I prayed for her leg and her ankle so this needs to be healing Jesus Christ's name and I remember you know Joshua was so sincere he wanted to do to worship you know but his his voice was keeping you know holding him back I said pray for I just want him to to enjoy the fellowship as I am and don't take away his voice Lord and I'm just praying for all the sick and I've been I've been having back issues since I was young you know and couldn't play rugby at a certain age and couldn't play cricket and had to stop this and do that and and and one of the one of the muscles were acting up again with all the you know picking up and loading and standing the whole day and and you know I'm there in pain but I'm glorifying the Lord you know it's this this flesh doesn't have anything on us and all of a sudden while I was praying now for sister Christine and Joshua was on my mind there was someone else going to the front this pain just shot it just released it was like a little band that you just shoot into the air and I had to stop for a split second and think that this just happened because all of a sudden this tension in the back is gone all of a sudden I can move and everything just feels so free and that was my that was enough for me that was just the Lord so so

Lord there's flowing from the throne in that eternal place father it's meant to be flowing right through this place right out of every life without any hindrance without any Lord humanistic things that would block it up any complex as any unforgiveness as any Fairs all of those things that would block up the channels Oh Lord call them out Lord tonight father lord I pray that there would be a

the Lord Amen hallelujah well it's good to be in the house of the Lord who's glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen god is good all the time amen hallelujah amen wealth you know tonight I just want to thank the past have been for the opportunity to minister the Lord just knows doesn't he Amen hallelujah the Lord orchestrates everything Amen hallelujah want to speak on unlocking your faiths true potential tonight and you know I don't want to we're not so much going to major on rapturing faith or adoption faith which will unfold as we get closer to the end and I'm not going to major too much on the divine faith or the gifts of faith all right so just so it just as a foundation there we're going to really major on human faith tonight and major on that faith that that we have as when Jesus came to the the Gentile and Centurion and then he said great as thy faith great as thy faith now who in this room would like to Jesus to say that about you would you like him to say great as thy faith I would like Jesus to say that about me amen amen hallelujah and do you know what that is your inheritance it's not meant to be anyone with oh ye of little faith anymore because we're coming so close to the rapture that he's clearing out all the things that would make you oh ye of little faith amen hallelujah and I know I know that we struggle there's lots of struggles we get frustrated I can't pray in this cult doesn't go away why doesn't the cult go away we have those we're all just in this flesh all right but I want to the Lord's giving a burden on my heart you know we want that to finish I don't want that anymore hallelujah I don't want to have a little faith but I want to have great faith great human face face there has no hinder its face that can just believe like a child and simplicity amen hallelujah amen so we'll just tune now that we've got that under control a man will turn to Romans 12 verse 3 amen hallelujah I felt on my heart to just say that because you know the faith is such a vast subject and it's like when you like the Lord gives the burden now the burden was that he would unlock not me but he would unlock our human faith to its true potential and but then you look at the subject you think man's faith is just this vast subject okay and you got to just hone it down and just just take your time on one aspect for tonight okay hallelujah amen amen Romans 12 verse 3 assist for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man can everyone just say that every man the measure of faith amen may the Lord bless his word you may be seated every man has a measure of faith you are born with it it's yours you've been given it and it cannot be taken away from you that's there that's part of you that kept but like your five senses I will get into a bit more later but you've got see touch feel smell and hear right those five senses you were born with right actually you know a prophet came on the scene and he told us there's actually more than five there's six senses okay so let's get this really clear and really straight you have see smell touch taste hear faith it's part of you let's settle it now settle it now the devil will always try and tell you that faith is some eerie fairy thing that maybe you don't have much of let me just declare to you right now you have faith fullness of faith hallelujah amen and that faith can move mountains that faith can do all things as possible if that faith is completely clear and uninjured so you can have you're born with sight now let's say it's just a normal birth no troubles complications whatever and you're born with all your senses you're born with faith as well but do you know things can happen in your life things can you can come up against that can injure that folk injure that which sites can injure that hearing you can do things that can hurt those senses and the same thing is with faith and this world is designed designed to hinder faith this world is catering to see touch hear feel all of those ones but Satan does not want that faith realm in the first world he can't hit help the Africans and then they're just gone there and they believe everything and you just tell them those promises and they believe it there's no hindrance in that aspect but they also has its own issues on the dark side because there's worked crafts and spiritualism and everything and they just believe but here over here in the West and the first world countries the Devil attacks that faith and this plate that allies we just grow up in a garden of unbelief and grow up in a condition that hinders us from believing the simplicity of the gospel the simplicity of the promises that with faith as all things as possible amen Isaac touched on these things I'm going to go down a different channel but we are speaking about the same faith this is a faith that you have it's a faith that God has given you because he gave to every man a measure so you can say and declare boldly regardless of how you feel regardless of how injured your faith may be right now because many of us have injured faith but tonight let me tell you you're injured faith can become healed you're injured faith can be completely healed tonight all the dams that has dammed up through upbringing through schools things and through whatever through stuff that you allowed into your life and things all of those dams can be unblocked the Lord is here hallelujah he is here with a mission he is here with a vision he has sent us Elijah the Prophet and then he took a larger the Prophet after the message was given and the open book was revealed and that same angel is here tonight that same Gabriel is here tonight the one that announces the things of God the announcing angel is here tonight to announce to you to make you understand the vision because when you understand the vision hallelujah God's will God's plan all of these things when you realize what he's here to do for you when you realize what he's here to do for you and that that five-star general is here hallelujah to guide your campaign to guide your life to lift you up to make you understand to give you skill and understanding in the vision hallelujah so that you can see where you are and prophesy so that you can see who you are in Christ so that your true identity can be revealed and you can say yes that's me I believe that hallelujah sometimes I don't feel like that but I'm going to and I'm gonna declare it to my god because he is faithful no matter how I feel no matter what he's faithful and you know whatever injuries that your face may have encountered in your life the Lord is here to heal the Lord is here to clear the Lord is here to expose those enemies that is hidden down deep in your life the ones that the devil tells you that you'll never be delivered from the ones that seem too small and the people tells you it's too small it's just a little thing I can live with that you can't live with that hallelujah you cannot live with that don't live with it hallelujah make a stand against him hallelujah for the small things because you'll realize that when he starts dealing with that when the light shines on it and may he's trying some light on some things tonight when the light shines on it it become you realize how big that little thing really is that little tiny thing can be the thing that's blocking you from heaven great human faith amen hallelujah okay so we're going to just cover a few things here you know you get so nervous with this because it's such a cool subject so powerful that you know it's like man as a human as a person you like man I'm so insufficient to cover this but praise the Lord Luke 17 verse 3 to 6 it says here now take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him and if he trespass against these seven times in a day and seven times in a day tune again to thee saying I repent thou shalt forgive him hallelujah forgive us to relinquish the right to surrender the right to hold it against him amen that's a true that's a it's an experience of forgiveness and the Apostles said unto the Lord because they hear the troubles of this they were like my goodness how are we going to do this because man they probably had lots of accounts and the louia remember this was before the Holy Ghost was poured out so these men probably had lots of accounts a lots of things that people did to them and remember they came under eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and no that thing is just bred into our culture and bred into the this world where people hold things against each other but you see we're of a different culture we're of a culture that's come from above and our culture came to us on there in the hands of an mighty angel hallelujah amen and he brought down a culture hallelujah and he gave it to a seventh angel and said here's my culture forgive hallelujah amen hallelujah don't hold no accounts amen hallelujah amen do you know it's such you know its grace because some nature's just find it very hard to forgive some nature's are very sticky we all got sticky nature's in some area but some people actually really struggle with this thing but did you know God's grace is greater than that stickiness God's grace is greater so if tonight the Lord has spoken to you about holding a grudge against somebody or being having unforgiveness in your heart for the tiniest little thing and summer camp just instantly let it go tonight is the night you can let that go amen because you see faith is based on forgiveness amen because look what they look what happens here it says in the pub after he's there talking about like you know Jesus is telling them why all of it there they would have been thinking on my seventy times seven why how do you do this Lord you know this would have been he would have known that this was going to stir up some feathers this was going to strike them backwards with their fear you know and they're gonna go Oh Lord so what are they ask the first thing they ask is Lord increase our faith help us Lord lit my faith lit the tributary that little river that comes out of me that little human faith amen that faith helped Peter walk on the water remember amen so let that faith access the grace of God to help me forgive and I pray that tonight tonight if what someone in here is needing that grace tonight - that's Harbor that they want to be delivered from harboring unforgiveness they want to be delivered from harboring something that's hindering their faith it's just simple that's the simple the grace let your faith now just just hold those things aside let them aside and say Lord Here I am in the middle of this while in the middle of where these things have happened to me and I can't get it it's so hard but just right now Lord give me some amnesty here give me em nasty from all these thoughts and everything that's troubling me about these people and all that they've done and all maybe they did and it was deliberate and all that stuff whatever it may be how bad it may be lord your grace is greater than that Lord let your grace come into my life let my little tributary river of my little stream now access the ocean because when you access that ocean my brother my sister hallelujah that ocean glory oh my I can't I'm not even gonna go any further for a bit yet hey man hallelujah oh my it makes me so excited because you see you can just bypass the sound barrier of all that unforgiveness bypass the sound barrier of all the troubles and all the things that they did to you and come up into a higher realm come up into a higher consciousness a higher thought process hallelujah a higher culture a culture that you actually come from amen because remember you're already an eternity in God's mind you're already part of that culture it just happened to be that you were incubated in this Western society or whatever society you came from it was incubated in it but you see God is just saying these things to you to break the amnesia to give you an opportunity that tonight don't just sit there and learn Amen this is not a learning session amen this is a you can travel tonight who wants to travel tonight travel into a higher experience in your Christianity travel in your faith from little faith to a great faith that can just say Lord at your word whatever it is Lord I believe it amen because you we all know that here yes we believe it's easy to believe you know it's true the Bible's true how can it not be God is faithful and in your heart and your soul but came from eternity I don't even need to tell you but I will amen it always believed you so cannot unbelief because it's part of God amen but this it's down in here it's down a neck that nature that remembers everything on my it's that one that we know as that one that the Lord connects is tonight so let that little faith that you may hit step out of the boat amen step out of it step out of it and into a higher walk with the Lord now these are simple simple simple things amen but you see we need real faith we need that faith hallelujah amen oh my if I just I just have to keep moving it and the Lord said if you had faith the grain of a mustard seed you might say onto the sycamore tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you hello everyone restored back to Eden hello everybody restored back to the way it was before a fall it's all in you it's all in you right now all of it it's right in you amen and when you got born again at quickened it at quicken that seed it brought it to life amen hallelujah oh my vote for the new birth amen if someone doesn't have the new birth tonight is your night any of you in here amen if you don't have the new birth tonight is your night don't put it off to another camp you got a year who wants to walk again without the Holy Ghost amen let's do it now hallelujah heaven now hallelujah just surrender everything now the Lord knows he knows he knows he knows your heart you can say it all with your mouth you can cry down here you can cry all your light you can speak you can sing worship whatever but he's listening not so much to this but he's listening to this and he knows those things that you've been holding onto those things that's been hindering your faith Oh just surrender them tonight because there's a power in this room hallelujah they can change everything and raise your faith to move mountains raise your faith to do whatever the Lord wants you to do raise your face to connect you to the divine faith I said I wasn't going to go too far into the divine face but we have to see where it connects amen okay we hit the sea where it connects amen let me just put this in here for now so in Hebrews 11:1 it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen I struggled with this for a long time to understand what it really meant because he said such a simple verse right it's so simple but it's like I know that verses means more than what I know what I understand and it still means more than what we could comprehend but and one day I was driving my car and I've probably for you people that have been around for more than three years maybe I've probably said this every time I used to say it a lot but I'll say it again so I'm driving my car and I'm like this is a problem for me I have to understand the scripture you know and I'm just I'm thinking it over my head faith is the substance of things faith is the substance of things what does this mean and then all of a sudden I just say it faith substantiates your hope the Lord help me just changing the word now I don't know I hope you know what substantiate means it's like another oh man I don't know you have to read that in the dictionary but faith it brings you it brings substance but let me just put this here so hope hope now hope is an expectation and anticipation with pleasure right you it's it's a Bible hope that's a real you because a true promise has been showing you and you are like yes I really believe that you know and then one day one day because God cooking that to you then all of a sudden the Spirit of the Lord comes down into your room or comes down into the service where you're sitting and tonight he can come to where you're sitting just let your faith got to him but your little tributary go up to him young people let your little river go up to him because he will speak to you he will change things for you now this little you know there's a promise for you maybe you're looking for something maybe you've seen something in the word you like Lord make this real to me and see there's an anticipation you've got a pleasurable anticipation amen and you're waiting on the Lord and it all of a sudden has mercy comes down and that great angel of the Lord that came down and for the message he gives you a revelation and he reveals to you he brings substance to what you've been hoping for and actually you know he will bring substance to the things that you've hopeful that pertain to the vision for your life that pertain to the calling of your life to pertain to the local vision that he's taking you at the people through that he's taking the church through he will give substance to the scriptures that pertain and eventually he builds and builds and builds and builds for scriptures builds these things that you're hopeful the scriptures that you've seen all of a sudden become reality and the will of God is revealed in it and God's will in his program and as counseling his wisdom and his life and his emotion and his feelings and all of those things comes with that revelation so that you can experience it and he takes the things that was just an intellectual heartfelt intellectual hope then all of a sudden becomes substance in your life amen and the will of God is revealed in it and now faith changes from living by a tributary into a divine faith into an ocean of faith an ocean that can change things an ocean that can move mountains amen hallelujah hope was substantiated by revelation of God's will walking in his vision amen but what about common hyssop faith because we read about this and I want to know about this because I want my common hyssop faith to not live in a life and yet not bogged down by some grudge that I've held that I've forgotten about but you know you can have grudges that you don't even know you've got that you've forgotten about and the Lord remembers and he knows he knows that that little gradual that little thing that you held against somebody down there his light will shine on that one day because he knows it's hindering your spirit that's hindering your subconscious that's hindering that River because remember he says those that believe on me out of their belly shall flow rivers of living water there's too many of these rivers of living waters that is not flowing as stumped up and it dribbles out here and there and every now and again you get something and you believe in there and all of a sudden God and His mercy does something for you and a sovereign grace takes over for you but he's actually really and what he's building us into is that that river will flow that that river will flow freely without any hindrance amen and I believe that we've come into the season as we heard on Sunday where all these things will be eradicated all these things will be clarified all the devil's works will be exposed and a very victory that was won on Calvary well the fullness of it the full measure that will help you to raise up as a son and a daughter knowing who you are will be realized amen he will substantiate these things that we've been hoping for amen these things that we've seen in the message you know they're children of Israel and Joshua preached to them the message Joshua was preaching them and showing them all their land but you see there were so many wars and so many struggles to get those betlem they had to fight for it they had to consult the captain amen and when they didn't consult the captain they fell on their face and the sins come in and all of these things happen but then all of a sudden later on the Lord in His mercy Amen who's thankful for the Lord's mercy the Lord and His mercy comes down and delivers them and you have an angelic visitation now it's the same angel that came down with the sword in his hand because he is faithful and he's intent on letting you gain your land letting you inherit everything that the Lord has given you and all that's been ministered to you in this message the Lord is intent on you having that but there is some healing that needs to take place there is some changing that needs to take place and the simplicity of your life and the simplicity of these things sees here but what it sees now you know this this human faith to believe in simplicity brother Branham sees an identification this is now sometimes faith is unknown to you you got it and you don't know it if you try to push yourself into something you miss it you go over the top of it it's so humble and simple see you actually have it and when you try and work everything up you see that this isn't quietness and Trust show you find salvation and quietness and rest resting and the promise is resting and the fact that we ever kept him we have a law the Lord who was guiding the army pushing the battle he's behind us bubbling and he's before us fighting and cutting but you see we have to be connected to that vision we have to be connected to his leadership so that he could he knows the bigger picture he knows all the things in our life and he knows that he's planned it all out and he's allowing you to go through these things so that he can reveal herself in you so he can reveal himself through the process Amen hallelujah brother branham sees this in ministry explained he sees now hope as one thing in faith as another faith is a positive sense it's not a guesswork you don't just imagine it it's just as real as any other sense of your body just the same as sighters sight is real hearing is real see taste feel smell and hear the five senses of the body that control the body they're real faculties to you if none of them is injured this is where that thought really came and then faith is just as real as any of the other five senses and more real because it'll go in and above those five senses and and above those five senses in and and above them amen to guide them but how does that work you know and our own experience when you have faith it connects you to God because without faith it's impossible to please God and so you see in here tonight as an opportunity and here tonight for each one of us is an opportunity for our faith to be stronger there's an opportunity if there is something in your life that's hindering faith that's pounding at you some spirit of unbelief you've got a question Lasell or why am I being troubled by the spirit of unbelief what's given him acts to trouble me all the time hallelujah and ask the Lord say Lord how do how am I going to overcome this because this has to be a personal thing for you this has to be a personal experience for you we can't just sit here and absorb the ministry in the word and then just go home you know and then just go and live your life but you have to personally now it's got to be a personal connection to the King a personal connection to her me say why Lord Jesus my faith can touch your hem of your garment it's better myiasis faith in the middle of the thronging crowds you see Jesus heard him he didn't have to make a big loud scream he just believed in faith stopped the king stopped the Lord he was an unimportant mission the Lord's always on an important mission but when when faith touches the hem of His garment remember he's the same tonight and if your faith can just touch His garment tonight amen don't let this go over your head or under your head or whatever you may think but just let your faith now we all know the things that the devil fights us with right and you say Lord tonight while we're here in the service Lord Lord just deal with us well what is it why we're all here why we're all can pray and the fires that come together and the devils are scared they're scared when the weakest of Christians gets down on their knees how many people can get down on their knees tonight and ask the Lord for deliverance ask the Lord for healing ask the Lord to heal that tiny thing that's down in there let's be niggling at you all these years and you just want it down I just want it gone Lord Lord Jesus take it away why is it there where did it come from he knows you may not know I Cyril II don't know many of the things in my life that I know is hindering things in my life and you know when a promise comes sometimes and I say Lord I believe there is something downstairs just says no and I go what is it Lord I don't want that I don't want to hear the unbelief in my life whatsoever I want complete dominion in love hallelujah complete dominion hallelujah you know when your soul has full connection to him you know your spirit she becomes more happy she becomes a more happy in the home so this is your home right but your soul needs to be more connected to the king hallelujah amen you know you just think about him and he just comes down into your little bubble of thoughts and his presence is there and you're driving you're sitting you're walking you're working you can be in the highest pressure of cooking situation and all of a sudden you just stuff and you say Oh Lord Here I am and he comes down because he loves you he comes down because he wants to help you hallelujah it's that personal touch the personal touch makes all the difference and all these things that you're hearing or the word that comes it becomes more of a reality when your spirit your emotional realm she becomes more happy inside you because when she's not happy man you have a troublesome home amen when wife is not happy it's a bad atmosphere you can have a bad atmosphere in that home but at first but when when when the soul is in a good place when the lord comes and he funnels through that anointing you know this healing that takes place in the human realm in the spirit because that she is the one that human spirit is the one that's causing all the trouble the one that revolts against but when there's an atmosphere of love in the home I'm talking about this home now the body when there's a love atmosphere because you're in communion when you're walking and you know who you are I know who I am Amen who God says I am Amen you know that identity and you just walk in there and you speak that and you live that and you sing that and you ponder over that and ponder over him and he comes and that love that he is just comes down and broods into you your human spirit gets healed and things is restored and you can believe and you can walk in it hallelujah so if there is something blocking you from that type of walk tonight you can be healed tonight it can change tonight is your night don't put it off to Sunday don't put it off the devil is telling you put it don't worry about it tonight's just a Wednesday night tonight's just it's just brother Andy preaching tonight's just a you're tired you're worn out you got all these thoughts going on all the studies is in full-swing all you're working on Minidoka we're an eternity amen hallelujah brother Brandon when he went up there amen when he went up there he came back down and he said to his church I saw you all there you know I believe that he saw you you were there hallelujah I was there that's my identity I happen to believe that and I claim that and I speak that and I sing that amen I believe that that's why it comes down that's that perfect love that's up there it's that river that's up there that river of life that just rolls down out of his throne hello Lou yeah you know you become a little Oracle a little a little tributary or a little spring for him Alleluia he wants that to fly but there's certain little things stop amen and that's what I believe a look can deal with these things tonight hallelujah who believes that who really who believes that with all their heart that the Lord can deal with these things glory amen right tonight the the deepest things because we're in the season you know as the season unfolds you know and all of the vision and everything has been prophesied in the rapture and all the the third pole coming into its full manifestation really but you've got to look at the practical side of that now the Lord has to deal down and those little tiny things they're stopping it from happening because all that's been prophesied all the third pole the spoken word that can speak a world into existence and you go and live on it it's already in you but it's locked down it's locked up because of these little things niggle these little things that your nature holds against you but remember perfect love is here Jesus Christ is perfect love he is perfect love and we need to give him preeminence amen when you realize how God is manifesting in your hour amen remember we know all about the pyramid and the look at all of the different ages and their different anointings and the different attributes of God that was revealed in those ages who can tell me what is the attribute that is being revealed now perfect love so in this age to see that manifested and its full reality we need to anoint him King him perfect love King let perfect love be the king of your life let perfect love come down so when you just yield and rest and you get into an atmosphere where you can conceive a love atmosphere and in the Lord and you can conceive you know and you're resting and you're enjoying him and you were enjoying your prayer life and you're enjoying your Bible studies and you're enjoying fellowship and you're enjoying the sermons even these young people young children when you get to a place where you can enjoy the service enjoy him it's perfect love and perfect love casts out all fear and it's fear is the next thing that hinders faith so you've got unforgiveness hinders faith they wanted to move mountains that the Lord knew here to deal with something to other disciples they were holding too many grudges they needed to go from a age of law and accountability to an age of grace to a dispensation of grace so the law was teaching and he showed them and he revealed through their experiences just how much of that law was still in them because you see you took he took them out of the law but now you got to take the law out of him and he's taken us out of an educational age of men's ideas and now he's taking back out of us now our upbringings and our parents upbringing has been managed in their administration the way that it's been that Delta the way that we were brought up the way that we were bothered the way that we were mothered the way that schools the paradigm of thought that they talked now it's just completely gone it's just absolutely rubbish but back then there was solidity to it and there was a certain vision that they had but it was Victorian style leadership and rulership and law and hardness and toughness and self achievement and discipline and all of those esteems and everything like that but a hard rigorous affair but the Lord you see in this engrained into us it's ingrained into us it's ingrained into our parents and our parents brought us up like that and all of these things has been ingrained in but the Lord is taking us out of it the Lord is taking us out of that way whole of thing the whole way of thinking he's completely removed us out of it and now he's removing that out of us because all that logic all the logic that we learn in school as the logic of the tree of knowledge they used to teach Bible stuff but it was completely riddled with the tree of knowledge of course because it's an educational system but they had the Bible in their schools and they found it on this and that but they were still but the idea the Greek philosophical idea of logic and and the thoughts of all of these sages and things of the ages that they've encompassed into schooling systems is actually not heavenly logic I'll tell you heavenly logic I like heavenly logic heavenly logic works for me Amen hallelujah heavenly logic says that even if it looks impossible that's possible heavenly logic says then no matter how hard it is no matter how deep you've gone and sin no matter how bad that person did their thing to you heavenly logic says they're okay it wasn't really them it was actually the devil amen and the same bleep hallelujah the police your sins can bleach the problem that that person did for you can bleach them can absolve them can completely out of your whole spirit hallelujah all that stickiness and all that stuff that makes you shake and you have adrenaline when you think about it and it brings you down and weakens you hallelujah beer Azhar breats in this room and there's a power and a voice that can speak hallelujah to deliver you because as you as the one that's holding it against them and that power can deliver you from holding it against him a complete out of your spirit complete from all your emotions so that you can believe next time you get a cult you can say go leave you know Jesus they brought that guy that was foaming at his mouth and chucking himself in a fire had that demon and the demon was too strong for those disciples because they had unforgiveness all those things that he you know he slowly got it all out of them hallelujah so they could believe but first had to reveal the weakness that they had because they did really you know they gave them power to if they deliver right and they could say there was sons of God he said oh I'll bruise your heel so they were already stumbling on the devil but it was something that was just too much for him what was it the devil the higher up I don't know how it all works but obviously there's higher ones and lower ones and more powerful ones now those ones there they have a bit more of a higher law degree in there in in spiritual law they can go out to the Lord and say actually hold on what about the subclause be twelve fourteen six seven seven seven three what about that sub-clause and when we merge that with this case that happened in 512 after Adam what about that you see that demon must have known a bit more than the last ones and so he goes and he brings it before the Lord it says now I'm not coming down ain't coming out amen look we've got unforgiveness in them even though you've given them power but those little demons that already cast there they might not have no in there so they remove but these ones were a bit stronger they had a bit more knowledge on them and they said no I'm not leaving because they've got this this and this and this so they're a bit more knowledge of logic and because you see God's laws as all legal stuff as well there's all different things in this while the accuser the brethren is cast out why because perfect love amen when perfect love comes it casts out the accuser of the Brethren and when you could get to a place when your faith can be healed look I just pray Lord heal some faith heal some faith so that we can have access to this divine love on a personal practical way sorry I'm getting excited man I don't know how to explode you understand hallelujah I need to write a song I get so excited I just cannot fight it I'm going up and I'm going to pop or something like that I don't know amen Amanda there you go bro you know what I mean amen if Shannon was here she would know what I mean I've seen her pop a few times you just get so full of joy and it's so simple it's the most simple thing as having faith that hasn't got a blockage or a damming or you know something that this hinders that little do you know brother Brandon said this is how sensitive these things are really sensitive he's he says you know I'm paraphrasing that's it's a long time since I read her but he says basically like you know the if someone comes up in the healing line and he says even if there's a tiny little shadow like a little shadow that blocks them from getting their healing and it's just a little tiny thing of the fort or something he says that little shadow can stop them from their healing and he can see into it and demons stringing from that one to that one and all of what's going on you know even in the service I mean you know now it's kind of broken but before there was just like demons fighting and trying to stop the anointing and trying to push back but then the Lord just breaks it amen the Lord's grace comes and he steps and you just gotta keep pushing and it's like that when you pray it's like that when you sit sometimes it's just you don't feel nothing and you feel like man as the devil fighting you it's the devil fighting you he doesn't want you to pray he doesn't want perfect life to come down and heal he doesn't want perfect loved you he doesn't want you to sit here and have perfect life coming all over you why do you think these people in this room that are rejoicing amen why is it and then there's some people going why is what do they see in this what's going on here why are they so happy hallelujah now I don't mean like an outward of emotion or anything I'm just talking about in the heart you're sitting there and there's something happening and you're rejoicing and you're enjoying and it's it's perfect love it's because this faith you're believing you're you're in a communion you're in a channel with the Lord and he's coming down to do things for you so that a service is not just sitting there listening to a sermon and getting a bit more knowledge as nice as it is to know a few more things it's fine by higher the net cuz we've come out of the man age we've come out of an age of knowledge increase would come up to an age of deliverance an age where you will be given a glorified body an age of rapturing faith an age where you come into the very image the atom lost an image that was displayed in the first second Adam when he came to the earth and there and he took the four Matthew Mark Luke and John the lion the ox of man and the ego and he took those anointings and he captured that life and then he put that life into pages and then that life was manifested and you read it and you see a life on display he was actually showing the life that you're coming to this you'll this is your inheritance this is an inheritance and the church has gone through all these ages and up and down and finally come back in its time it is time that is why these things is coming forth that is why he's dealing in your life now tonight you can take that opportunity amen hallelujah so and this is here and Matthew 11 no sorry mark 11 verse 22 25 it says and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance saith to them master behold the fig tree which thou cursed as withering away and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea shall and hence shall not doubt in his heart so you see there is a clause there and if he didn't put that there you know if he didn't put that there we would be already speaking worlds into existence if that clause wasn't there but the Lord knows just like he knew that Israel when they first came into the land they didn't have the maturity as a nation to handle the inheritance but he said but I will give it to you but it'll be little by little if you just followed my captain if you follow my angel with the open book if you just have a love relationship with him and let him lead you as Jesus Christ an angelic form if you just let the Holy Ghost lead you with the open book in his hand he will guide you through the land little by little where you get it just like with Israel when that captain came down he said little by little just just beware of that angel he's going to cause you to and here at your land you're gonna get it but you see straightaway you don't have it all right away there's a clause there little by little because you need to grow a maturity to be able to handle that eternal word spoken power amen why do you think the Prophet our prophet William Branham had to go through so many hardships so much training so much so that he was completely and utterly surrendered to the king so surrendered because that one of the greatest events in history transpired on Mount sunset where a man who was born in sin hallelujah a man hallelujah who try to kill people a man who tried to commit suicide a man that went through all of these things just like you just like us Elisha was subject to like passions just like Weaver and we are but God put him through such a he had a race set before him that would prepare him for one of the greatest events the very purposed Calvary happened the very purpose of the blood being spilt the very purpose God and visits before the world even began that he would restore man then he would give man back that creative power but the word that creative power you see such a great event happened on that day when there was a prophet standing there redeemed man that came subject to the blood who had forgiven all because the bleach had come into his life and you see hid li all those things go and he was completely surrendered and now it came time where God would trust a man with the very power that Satan's wanted since time immemorial the very power and he and it came down in his hand that sword came down into his hand this is now a redeemed man that has the very things that Satan has always wanted the creative power and he says now go and preach this land preach this land the very angel that came down to Israel to free Rahab now could come inside a human be and hold the same sword hallelujah hallelujah the same sword I believe that was the same sword the one that freed Rahab hallelujah the one that a race to prostitution has three oh my Oh glory to his name it makes me like just amazed how the Lord can do these things and show it all like this it's same angel it's doing the same thing for you for me for all of us why do you think you're struggling why do you think you're suffering because you shall be found in the likeness of a suffering he has a purpose for he has a purpose for those mind bells he's got a purpose that enemy is just a tool he's only can go so far he will not take the Lord will not let him go any further then he's allowed and all of those things that's happening is for purpose because the Lord needs to remove some things out of lives these things in our lives that need to be removed little things and that's why the Devils allowed so far that's why he's been allowed to squat on certain parts of your land but little by little I will give you the land little by little I will heal your faith little by little those injuries that are causing those tributaries to block up little dams every now and again it spurts forth and you're at camp and the barriers go down but the enough to camp and after these things happen it starts to form up again those little beavers start to build up and that little thing that's been hounding you you know God is the cycle breaker there has to come a time where those cycles need to be broken completely and it has to go beyond you rejoicing over the thought about it it has to say you have to say Lord why not me why not now now come on hallelujah why put off for tomorrow the things that can be done today amen hallelujah because I believe we're in the very Alice the hours hallelujah oh why would he unfold all these things why would he show all these things why is the whole Bible coming open why is every type every story every character becoming personal because he's trying to show you who you are and the power that we live in we're living in a very special hour we're living you know we think oh man that's gonna be such a great time it's gonna be so awesome when it comes but then miss the very event that you might be finding yourself involved with right now right now remember it's so simple it's so humble if we get you know one of the greatest events in history the Prophet preaches before God and simplicity because he knows you know people are gonna miss this thing and they're gonna get caught up in this in there and the horse riders and caught up in there and the very backdrop has been causeth of all of it all the events and all of us and then in the Catholic Church and all its just backdrop the real event was taking place the Lord had descended down to reveal himself to his bride hallelujah so that he could begin the process of his coming hallelujah now this I say this candidly and I say this like you know because we're not but really this is one of the greatest events you know this is the whole thing is culminating the whole thing is turning into this great big crescendo and yet it feels if you think men age thoughts if you think intellectual thoughts of you look at too much Hollywood and see these denominational ideologies you'll miss it because you see now I'm gonna say something and prophets already said it but I'll say it anyway glamour its glamour okay I don't know really what the definition of glamour is but I'm gonna give you my definition of glamour glamour is a false facade a fake reality it's this whole tree of knowledge and all of its glory I don't call it's not really glory but it's it's an glory it's glamour now when you behold that glamour it paralyzes your faith so this your third thing now I can land the plane I've done my three points that we're gonna lend amen hallelujah glamour when we look at it and it's everywhere but you know these things they can be a real blessing but they can be a real curse too because on that screen can come glamour even in the middle of the glory you know you can be looking at something glorious and all of a sudden popping up on the side as glamour and the glamour you we all know this how they're to fix you instantly and I'm not talking about some explicit thing I'm just talking about just the ten everything the ten business whatever and you and you're in a spiritual time and I'm like man this is amazing I'm having a good time but then on the side I see a little thing pop up and it's clemmer and I instantly feel it it's like this pull it's like it's pulling me to that and it's pet and it's paralyzing faith so you were gonna be careful you have to be watchful this is the devil as a roaring lion secrets whom he may devour true lujah the prophecies in perfect faith so I'm gonna kind of when I read this that there's a backtracking a little bit but I just want to give some foundation and substance to what I've been saying because it's the Word of God and I believe it has an effect this is he says now faith is based on forgiveness then and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving you know I think sometimes the Prophet says these things and it's kind of for them but it's actually almost more for us now you see like it's like he's saying these things and just like Paul said things in the beacons it kind of worked into a natural event that took place but then when we look at it we see the full reality of how it's really transpiring on a bigger picture for us okay so it's kind of like I believe it's like that with this message - it's prophetic this is here to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us amen I believe that we're seeing that that's what we all hunger and that's and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it who wants to see more of it amen more of it guess what you can and you will because we're in an exciting time believe it amen sing it hallelujah every revival brings forth music every revival brings forth song and the song is not just for us to enjoy it's actually something for the Lord to enjoy because you see the Lord's expressing something he's expressing his word he's unfolding his word he's revealing himself and what he wants us he wants us to write songs about it to sing it back to him and rejoice in the moment with them it's romance doesn't it the right word for it I don't want to call it romance because that comes from Rome but whatever that is is it what really the word Rome it's cultural like a Roman type of thing I don't know intimate that's it thank you brother imple intimate it's an intimacy it's a communion and song amen I kind of touched on that before we sung that song it came because at such a powerful thought and I believe it's part of it and you know it's not just that always there's another natural a level of it it's at all that's a powerful tool for us to think because you know there's something about music that helps you remember the words you can actually as we know of the Sunday School in the songs you know you want to get the children to remember this long verse you just teach it in a song and they remember the whole song because it's something about it the Lord's made it in us to when there's a melody attached to in a rhythm it makes it easier to remember so if you're singing out the revival and the Lord's inspired you to write something about the revival that you're in and it's faith expressed because it's a lot expressed that you believe it and faith is expressed and you sing about it and then you're singing the church gets familiar with it and they can be just walking around I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them you know and they're singing that and while they're singing that song that's about the revival that they're in and it just goes over and it's thinking about it gets ingrained into your thoughts a manic cook that dibal down hallelujah amen he didn't let the devil win Amen I like this song hello Louie these songs was powerful hallelujah need to sing out that expression that Thanksgiving to him for what he's doing now hallelujahs fresh fresh manna amen fresh libres it's like you're expressing back to the king and I believe that he enjoys that I believe the Lord enjoys music and he wants to hear music when we sing and we sit here we have song service we're not singing to entertain ourselves you know we can get caught up in there and our thoughts are this wasn't a very good song service well it might have been for the Lord not saying this one sorry it I don't mean it but you know I'm just saying in general like the song service man it was a real foot-in-mouth where is he is he gone he he walked out not this one but I'm saying in general you know like you we we get so caught up in passive entertainment that we get geared towards being entertained by something that you know we sit there and we listen to a song and maybe the singing wasn't so good and we think our men it wasn't that nice enjoy that but the Lord wasn't really listening to how good that voice was the Lord amen the Lord was responding to the faith that was being sung through the expression and that's what's pleasing him and so when we get that into our hearts and minds and when we come to church and we're singing this song we're singing them for him we're singing and worship we're responding to what he's doing we're responding to him you'll see what will happen in your life he comes down it says in and he inhabits the praises of Israel he inhabits the praises of his elected seat he inhabits the praises of his people who is he his perfect love what does perfect love do it'll remove unforgiveness and a remove fears here he will remove unforgiveness he will remove fears he will remove unsure ities he will give identity he will raise you up he will increase your faith he will unblock those subconscious complexes that have been handing you he will do it but you see there has to be a connection and that connection comes with a great human faith now I'm not saying if you feel like you've got little human faith because you know the devil will always like to tell us that Amen well I just tell him he's a liar he's an absolute lie he's defeated how can this guy who's on the ground under our feet he just slides up from there you know lies ascending from the ground sending up it's like get out you're a liar the Lord has given every man a measure of faith a full measure amen and he's here now to heal anything that would hinder that he's here now to unblock every channel Amen let's stand hallelujah musicians can we sing that song faith tunes the night into the day and then winds of faith amen hallelujah hallelujah we're going to pray before we sing and I just want you as me as we pray we close our eyes we all know these things in our life and and we're in this battle together but why not now why we're together as the words go forth and let's just pray together and if there's anything that you know that the Lord has touched on that's that's that's convicted you or the Lord's revealed something to you that needs to be let go or there's a fear in your life or there's suddenly a victim mentality or an attitude that you know is hurting you and and you can tell it's not balance you know like a certain situation would come about and all of a sudden you can almost not even stand because of the adrenaline and all of their all of those things may be
