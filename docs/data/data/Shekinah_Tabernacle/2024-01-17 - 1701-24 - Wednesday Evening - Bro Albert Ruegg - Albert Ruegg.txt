you to praise you to hear from you Lord I pray please send your anointing upon the speaker upon the hearers let us see more of you tonight and bring glory to your name and ask you presence to be felt in our midst in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated it's um just a short little few verses to encourage you tonight in I like I like to start um well said this way tonight we going to read a few scriptures and I trust that we um can receive you know when we look at scriptures or hear somebody else it it's different it's it's like uh if you invited for dinner somewhere you get a different type of food it's not wrong food or maybe different but let's enjoy it that's what I mean I like to read a few verses in Psalm 34: 4 to 10 I came across those verses the other day and it really blessed me in verse four it says I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears Hallelujah they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed Glory this poor man cried and the Lord heard him hallah and saved him out of all his trouble the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them oh my Lord oh taste and see that the Lord is good yes sir blessed is the man that trusteth in him oh fear the lord ye his Saints for there is no want to them their fear Him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing you know there's so much in this in these few verses and it's a matter of being able to receive it you sometimes you find people that read these things you know the L Young Lions do lack and and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing and then they think wow I need this I haven't got that and you know it doesn't line up somehow but it has to line up yeah if we believe it it will line up and um I found often that that people don't see what they really have in Christ Jesus we we just don't see it you know we sang a song There light of the world came into darkness you know the Lord came to his own and his own received him not right you can say how how come why did they not receive him because they had a different picture a different idea of how he should be or the way he should come but he came exactly according to the word of God no other way but blindness was the path and it says blindness was there p and in the Romans says because of their blindness Grace came our way but again he will show Grace to Israel and blindness will be part of the Gentiles of most of them and we can see we live in the day where people are blind a lot are religious but they're still blinded to the truth plenty of religion plenty of ideas plenty of politics but blind and we need to have ears to hear and eyes to see that's really what I'm trying to highlight you know we all confess that we believe and we believe the message we believe what we've heard we believe the Bible's the truth but we need to actually see it and experience it otherwise we haven't seen it oh yes the Bible says all your car is cast upon me Jesus said if you still wor it you haven't seen it you haven't heard it it hasn't sunk in you see that's the point I'm trying to make yes sir everything is ours and if we don't see it to be ours it's because we haven't heard and we haven't seen we may have read it with our eyes and we heard the preach with our ears but it hasn't struck home and we wanted the word to strike home that it becomes a reality a manifestation in our own lives and I have heard a man just the other day I mean you can find hundreds of people preaching on YouTube but I just came across a man and he I thought he may say some good things but basically he is this man was full of understanding and theology and he believed in the power of the word and the Miracles in the apostles day but he can't see it today and everybody who believes in Divine Healing and miracles he ridiculed well what a religion what a dead religion wow I want reality these signs follow of them their belief amen I believe that the works I do you will do also even Greater Works that was not addressed just to the apostles that was addressed to the Believers amen yes but if we see it it happens if we don't see it it doesn't happen we don't have to say I want to see this now can I see it now it just you just step into the word and be led by the Holy Ghost and these things happen over automatically I was just reminded um it's always good to share some testimony but I was reminded years ago I went up to visit some people in the Alps over in Switzerland and I had to well I went for a walk with a farmer there up a mountain and just before we left his wife came out totally Disturbed the young daughter was very very sick almost you know hallucinating high fevers and terrible State and they both were in shock and didn't know what to do and I didn't know what to say really but I said uh do you believe in prayer I said and they said yes I said have you pray for her no can you please you know there they weren't actually feeling worthy to pray you see that's that's the sad part they did not see it's for them to step into it yeah you know we are only worthy because of Christ what he's done on Calvary nothing else nothing else no knowledge no no whatever we've done has any any Merit in that sense but he says can you so I went and laid my hand on the little girl she was fiery hot and I prayed and then I said to her I'm going for walk with you Daddy when we come back you're well and so it was she was absolutely perfectly healed now I I left that place uh had hours to drive home and then um there was an emergency phone call to my sister uh and I thought I'll ring tomorrow and I rang the next day but the other girl there two girls got the same sickness one was healed the other one got it and they ended up at the hospital and she had the menitis one good heal one wasn't and you know I didn't say I step into I believe the word no it's just what it says what do you do we're led by the Holy Ghost we just need to do what it says we can't say oh wait till brother Z so comes he's got a gift of healing over there the other one you know that little incident caused so much a stir up that mountain that next time I went up they organized a prayer meeting and I went to the prayer meeting and then uh people had Faith to believe and then when I left that place next day I was driving down a hill and I saw two farmers in the Pedic and I stopped and there was two that came to the prayer meeting and and I said goodbye I said how is it going oh fine you know like people say and then one said I look actually it's not so fine here I think his name was Peter he hasn't been well for three months or six months or how many months he's been sick all the time and I oh let's pray I prayed in a padic with them you know what what else can you offer as a Christian a prayer a slingshot of Prayer and uh I left and I was just saying we just step into the word we don't actually plan things and when I left uh a year later I went up there with my daughter with one of my daughters and on the way up I saw a man in a padic I didn't know who it was I stopped and he came walking up to me on on my daughter and he said you know this this is the same exact same spot you prayed for me last year and I've never been sick since isn't that wonderful that is for the Believers we need to believe it but we also need to see it and to hear it yes sir and you know in Jeremiah it says uh talks about people without understanding which have eyes and see not have ears and hear not and we live in a day where this is reoccurring we know the scriptures in Revelations 3:15 to18 I Know Thy Works thou that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth yeah because thou sayest I'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that they are riched and miserable and poor and blind naked you see I just make that point that is the day the age we live in and that spirit is in the world and and we can fall into a trap where we think yeah I know it I've I've heard the truth you know and I'm restored to the word and I I see it I know it you know I believe it but when it comes to it have we really seen it we should say Lord open my eyes is to this truth and suddenly you start to scream Hallelujah because you actually can see it then it's done you know the deal is done when you see it when you see the completed work of Calvary it's different we believe it and uh we we say I believe it I see it I've heard the gospel I believe it I've accepted it but when you really see it well everything's accomplished we know he said it's finished and you know it's finished and it's so important that we come to that place where we actually see and hear what it really says you know we not just with natural when it hits home inside it's done it's finished you you know whether it's healing or whether it's anything else you may still see the same circumstances but you know inside it's over it's done and um yeah with we live in this uh day and night where there is a lot of of of that going on in I I like to read to you just two two or three more scriptures before we close here um I have um one interesting one in second Peter chap 1: 5 to9 Peter says and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity air to your knowledge the truth we know a to it Temperance Faith add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity or love we have these things we have these things we have to be convinced that they're ours I tell you why he says for these if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that leth these things godliness brotherly kindness patience he laest the things is blind that's what the Bible says it's not that it's not there but you can't actually see it if you see it you have this patience you have this longsuffering you have all these things of the spirit if you actually can see it you start to manifest it if you don't display those things you're still blind the Bible says you know open my eyes Lord we cry open my eyes open my ears I want to see more of Christ I want to hear more of him and I want it to be a reality in my life he that lacers these things is blind and cannot see a far off and has what forgotten that he was perched from his old sins how can you ever forget that you see we live in our last days and the spirits in the world just draw away from what the spirit of God really has for you or tries to draw you away and as is often say the devil doesn't mind you to know everything as long as you don't do anything with it he doesn't mind you to know he doesn't mind you to to learn things and know things like if there's no power with it like I said this man who's criticizing everybody who who's got uh gifts of the Spirit you know who doesn't believe in gifts of the Spirit he doesn't believe in in Divine Healing in this day and he doesn't believe in yeah in Miracles wow what a poor state to be in blind and miserable yeah but we believe it but not just with with words we we actually believe it until it it strikes home till we really know yeah it's true the Lord promised we read at the beginning get his angels incompass those who fear Him well we believe angels are around what did Angels do in in the days of the Apostles for instance they lose prison chains let them out of prison miracles happen what did the angel come to Paul before they were Shipwrecked and said look no problem this that and this will happen you know how encouraging how encouraging but these things are real I want to see it am I I said I once was in a meeting in in syney I think it was and the Holy Ghost is moving and one sister saw a hand coming down from heaven nobody else could see it but she screamed and shouted because she could see it and nobody else could see it but it was still a reality Lord let me see you know there was people you know brother Bram saw the angel of the Lord quite often Angel come but uh not everybody could see it he said do you see that light it's now over this lady you know and can't you see it you know he saw these things by not seeing it doesn't mean they're not there but we can truly pray Lord open my eyes and my ears for what I believe to be the truth that I actually can have a Quicken to me and see the reality of it and it's it's um it's an important thing that we um Embrace these things as I said in the last days there's so many things happening which distract you from believing uh you'll read the scriptures 2 Timothy 3 1-5 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of the their own selves Covetous boasts proud Blasphemous disobedient to parents unth thankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent fears despisers of those that are good traitors heavy high-m minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness knowing truth but denying the power thereof you see from such turn away and I read in in an amplified version it says it's it's actually very interesting it says for although they hold a form of uh of piety truly religion they deny and reject and are strangers to the power of it wow their conduct belies the genuiness of their profession for their conduct nullifies their claim of Faith avoid all such people turn away from them you see you meet people you try to reach out to people all they bring is disbelief and and and rubbishing things keep away from that keep away from those religious people who don't believe in the power of God like this man I said I watching YouTube I wouldn't watch him again it's actually nonsense you know great big Ministry and go and and learn study Theology and and no power no nothing keep away from thyself keep away from the unbelief stay with people who are on fire and love the Lord and and Believe In The Miracles and if we don't see them happening straight away we still believe them I heard once said I'd rather believe die believing in Divine Healing than denying it you know we hang on we hang on and um I just uh want to finish because it's prayer meeting but we read taste and see that the Lord is good so we need to taste it Hallelujah and if you draw a parallel to Natural Food I used to live in inago years ago and the state was a family they were farmers their menu I think it was three different meals it was either muton and potatoes roast potatoes or boiled mints or one thing was some kind of a cerol with rum steaks that wasn't bad but you see that's all they actually ate and the farmer man he wouldn't want to touch anything else wow he wouldn't want to touch anything else and then I said wow overseas we used to fry the m and this oh I wouldn't want to touch this oh and put it in an omelet oh that tastes I wouldn't try one you know and I said look I'll make you one and because I was from overseas they so of agreed to to taste it you know you would believe it but he asked me El can you can you make me another one of those omelets you know once he has tasted it but until then he missed out W and you know there's many words in here for us to Taste and to actually embrace and we know the scripture in um uh when the people were in a Promised Land the the the Israelis Israel was in the promised land and they were fighting for their land that was promised to them and yet when Joshua was about to die he said Is Yet much l to be taken it was still a lot to be taken you know they probably were satisfied with their little pics and their little house there and yeah we're fine but there's more land to be taken and God wants to be glor glorified by us taking that Land by us seeking out promises in this word and say I believe it Lord speak it loud in my ears open my eyes to it I want to experience this you know that there's Words which me may think oh means nothing now when I was young I used to um well I still do but I I used to read through the New Testament over and over and over and sometimes you come across scriptures you've read before you know it by heart and one of was said uh why do you behold the the spe in in your brother's eye and you're not aware of the log in your own eye and sort of no I have got problem with that I love everybody but then I thought how would I even know if I have a log in my eye so I prayed I said Lord if there's something my eye that prevents me to see please take it out take it out I want to be able to see and and you know we assume sometimes or we go to church and we feel very comfortable with what we hear we get a certain diet spiritual diet like the the farmer and the natural diet we get a spiritual diet we feel comfortable with it feeds us we feed on the same thing over and over I've been to churches where they say the same thing every every Sunday every Sunday and then sometimes people say yeah good good things but it's always the same thing the same theme the same kind of thrust on the word same old diet but there's far more in here far more and we miss out if we resign to that kind of thing I want to be you know he's look mercies are new Every Morning the Bible say so I want to wake up and experience the mercies of God are fresh every day I want to search out my promises you you know that that uh story this man I might tell it wrong but he he got an inheritance didn't know maybe some rich uncle died or left him a big inheritance well he he wanted to know what he's he's got a house and everything everything in it you know you go in a house and you want to open every drawer and know what is mine and that's our inheritance that's our promises we want to search it out and say that's mine I'll embrace it I take it I'll receive it so in closing I just say oh taste and see that the Lord is good don't get caught up with just uh a religion don't get caught up with just being satisfied with going there feel comfortable you know I've I have had people in in church you know they feel comfortable they have their seat you know there somebody else sits there you know that that disturbs the whole program well it's not the way we have it you know or you need to sing certain songs we we don't like those kinds or everything or our pastor only goes exactly 40 minutes or something and a minute later they look out to watch you know you get used used to something but we don't want to get used to we people got used to the manifestations and divine healings and and the spoken word they got used to it and they weren't excited and if people first time were in a meeting where the the word of knowledge was presented and and the spirit discerned people screamed and shouted and and then after a few years oh yeah it's this again and oh can you please be Reverend don't don't move don't move you're people casual you know now it's this again they were not aware of what was happening and I don't want to lose that that um what do you call it awareness that God is present that he knows all things sees all things knows what he go through knows what we need he knows everything and if we can just know oh all is at rest all is at peace so there is that there is um important that we keep our eyes on the word of God not to get caught up with man's failures and things uh comparisons of churches and beliefs it's look to True Christians look to Christ and be persuaded that he can do all things and that's all I wanted to encourage you tonight amen it is taste and see taste and see God bless you brother um God his word is unlimited amen we got to press in and take every PR promise amen till we see it till it becomes reality I mean I like that never won for I sat in too many lectures at University you know so I'm sick of theory I want to see reality amen praise the Lord let's have the musicians um tonight uh let's sing that song um magnify the Lord with me then we're going to have a time of prayer amen but let's press in you know there's um many promises may be real to other people but what about you what about me amen it's got to be personal amen so let's press in and seek the Lord you know it says in uh Hebrews chapter 11 if I could just read this really quickly before we um sing here it says um it says but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so if you seek Him seek his word to become reality he will reward you amen so let's stand tonight amen Let's uh sing this we're going to have a time of prayer I me we got a few prayer requests read after we sing I saw the Lord and he answered me and delivered me from every [Music] fear those who look on [Music] him our radi now'll never be ashamed they'll never be ashamed this poor man CED and the Lord heard me and saved me from my enemies the Son of God surrounds his Saints he will deliver them he will deliver them magnify the Lord with me come exalt his name
