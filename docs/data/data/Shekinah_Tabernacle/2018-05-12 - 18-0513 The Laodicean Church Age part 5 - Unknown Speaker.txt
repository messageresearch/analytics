your hands in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you everyone you may have your seats so I want to continue talking about I'd like to welcome brother Harry here god bless you if Jesse feel at home as well wonderful to have you I want to continue on talking about you know the latest in church aging and where we are in this span of time that we're living in and and it's incredible to see yo the the amount of Scripture that God has is fulfilling in this day and I want to as we talked about last Sunday speaking about how revelations 9 how the bottomless pit healthfirst Satan has fallen I mean he fell from his position in heaven and he's and and the bottomless pit is open hell is open itself upon the earth and but but we know that as all of hell is here all of heaven is present upon the earth as well because if you continue to read through revelations 9 and you're going to you know chapter 10 which we will go into more this the service but yes and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven so when this one falls and the bottomless pit opens in a mighty Christ Himself comes down he comes down upon the earth because he's going to do a quick short work in the end time he's going to gather his children to the to himself amen he's going to hold back the powers of darkness as this is going on and I just want to just as a bit of a background we're going to speak about Haggai and then we're going to go to the Ministry of Moses but we see here that so this is this is written during the time of the restoration of the rebuilding of the temple after Israel has been in the promised land many years and they were taking captivity into Babylon and they came back out of Babylon after 70 years of captivity and now they're there and they're rebuilding the temple they're rebuilding Jerusalem and and the people had to be stirred up by the Spirit of God to fulfill amen the rebuilding of the of the city and the temple and God as God is speaking to them trying to get them to see that the same that he is the same God that covenant 'add the word that you know when they came out of Egypt he's tried to tell them that don't thank God I he says according he says and work for I am with you said the Lord of Hosts according to the word that I covenant had with you when you came out of Egypt so my spirit reigning remaineth among you fear ye not so the same God that took them out of Egypt was still present there in the land he was still there with his children that they would fulfill their portion of the word I mean it was allotted to them he was still present and we've got her I trust we understand that when brother Branham was taken off the scene Christ the mighty angel did not leave I mean just because God took us took his brighter I mean took his profit off the scene it doesn't mean God left I mean the same God that was with Malachi forest with the Bride of Christ in this hour he's the same God he does the same things I'm in that same atmosphere I mean that same presence we feel I mean it's the same God that was back there God hasn't changed one bit Amen so now I want to so Moses now we we know just just just a brief background you know Moses he was given you know he was commissioned to take a people out of out of the land of Egypt and God said I have come down I've heard the cries of my people I'm sending you a cease I'm going to give you two signs that have voices and if they wanna and the first sign was the leprosy he put his hand in his bosom pulled it out it became white like me you know as leprosy put it back in and then it went away and then the next one was he took his rod and he cast it to the ground it turned into a serpent and so God told Moses if you if they will not hear the voice of the first sign didn't I hear the voice of the second sign it says after that I'll give you another sign we just pull take water and poured upon the earth he'll turn into blood and then it that he's basically saying if they do not hear this then judgments going to come I mean a brother brand was given given to science I mean the sign in the hand and in the discernment if you're sincere you'll come to know the secrets and thoughts of the people's hearts I mean that ministry was sent to the earth and it caused the healing revival to sweep world I mean because God was causing an exodus to happen I mean there's been a parallel of the Ministry of Moses and Joshua is being looked at in this day I mean we are living in Bible days again it's not just a story of history but it's a pattern that's been laid out and we're living in that pattern I mean suggest is just aunt Moses called the people out of Egypt I mean they came to Mount Sinai God came down on Mount Sinai with a word with a covenant amen and then so but that the purpose of that word wasn't for them to dwell in the wilderness the purpose of that word as they would have fellowship with their God they would have a sacrifice approach to God I mean that God would walk among them that God would dwell among them and the purpose of it was for them when they get into their promised land it wasn't for their wilderness journey only but the purpose of the law coming on Mount Sinai is that God would dwell with his people in the promised land that was the purpose of the law amen it's the same thing now with us many people say well the message was 50 years ago we've gone on we haven't gone on that same word of place today you take that word that God is enjoying to you and you take it into a promised land and it lives as in that right I mean that same that's why this messages is a today's message it's not a yesterday's message you say well societies change God's Word hasn't changed amen brother brand many prophecies of today I mean it's more up-to-date right now the day you're alive than when he spoken hallelujah so but now we're called to work I mean according to the word that I have covenant to do when you came out of Egypt now this is just an I should turn it on here we go let's go to Hebrews chapter 9 Hebrews 9 in verse 13 this is for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that we were under the first Testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance they meant an hour for where our Testament is which is also will there must also there must also of necessity necessity be the death of the testator for a testament as a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first Testament was dedicated without blood for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the Testament which God hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without the shedding of blood is no remission so now Moses here and type because the law is a shadow he receives a word from God he receives the word from God and then he joins by the sacrifice he joins the book the word to the people that they become one by a sacrifice it's not just here something that maybe if you like it you can read and you can you know enjoy and maybe debate about it wasn't that I'm gonna join this word this is good this is God's mind I'm gonna join I'm gonna cause my people to become one with this covenant by am i doing I'm gonna join them but they become reciprocal you cannot separate God and His Word and God joining himself to his people right you cannot separate them so in God God gave that word to Moses and he spoke it to the people and they said all these things we will do he took the sacrifice and he sprinkled the book and the people joining them together that they would become one he said well how does that parallel today we've had a prophet like under Moses come the first part of his ministry was an exodus ministry where a people were called out by the power of God from this world out a denomination out of unbelief I mean where a word would be sent upon the earth and he'll call the people out hallelujah and then the second part that Minister is the reason we have been called out as would become one with Jesus Christ we just weren't called out to be in the wilderness wandering around and it is at some place but because we are called out to - to a union to a wedding that's why he called us up come get married hallelujah can become one with me and we know we don't become one with the Prophet we become one with the God that was revealed through the prophets Amen he's just the vial that God happened to use just like John the Baptist the voice of one crying in the wilderness he just happened to fulfill that Scripture amen and his whole purpose was the join of people to Jesus Christ introduced them I mean this message is to introduce you to Jesus Christ I Pratt has even look beyond the veil in his language in whatever he phrases it uses but it's God speaking through that man here we see this is Jesus speaking to me I mean so they took a word now they needed that law because God said if you keep this word you'll be successful and you'll dwell in your land and you possess the fullness of your inheritance I mean by this word that I've joined to you now we've come to a we've come to a spot now where we know the book is not sealed I mean there was the everything Adam lost went up to the hands of the original owner you know God Himself in Revelations four and five a book was the inheritance the internal inheritance of of the believer was sealed up I mean for a season but now we've come to that season where it's not sealed up anymore I mean we're a prophet would come and he would receive that word that book would come open now I might be jumping here to myself but I want you just to get a parallel with the inheritance with people probably they looked at it what does the Bible mean what does the saying and learn at people would would probe and try to understand how the scripture goes together there's always these loose ends where man's wisdom comes to a scene and it always does that's why God had to seen a prophet in the end time to take all the loose ends take away all the things that was just man's ideas and God would purify the word through that ministry that a people could receive a pure word again hallelujah I was want to put this on you just now I was listening to this is an influence in 1963 brother Branham just a few days before this I think it's New Years Eve he preaches services just the time of the end and he's relating how he has the vision of the seven angels coming to him so this is this is hanging on his heart he knows it's going to happen and he's actually in Arizona when he's preaching these meetings and he says we're told in Revelations 10 that there'll be a messenger in the last day that will gather up these little ends and we'll bring them together and in the mystery of God would be finished at the sounding of this angel which was a messenger of the earth the one came down from heaven with his hands up rainbow over his head and swore that there'll be time no more an angel taking an oath and when we see this thing is materializing oh how sincere we should be all promises of God are true but their own conditions no matter how fundamentally right we are we've got to approach it in the right way now ameen can be fundamentally right and still not receive the blessings of god because it's approached in the wrong way it goes upon conditions now notice this he's looking for something to happen he's looking for something to happen in the future when this when this happens hey but he says we begin to see it materializing around us that's more than just a prophecy but the prophecies about to be fulfilled is how sincere we should be I mean when you see when he sees this word is beginning to be fulfilled he sees how sincere should we be and we're not looking for it to happen it's already happened I mean so how sure how sincere should we be when God is fulfilling the promise of the ages in our day in our and in our lives I mean we shouldn't just come in wide and loose and say well you know just just staggering and what you're wandering around we should be sincere we should be deadly sincere when God has given us a promise they which are alive and remain we're not hinder them which are asleep of the dead in Christ rise first and then they which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air and we know that that that price is really begin to happen because the Lord has descended with a shout I mean the end of his ministry brother Graham says that the shot is the message I mean calling a bride to Jesus Christ so the first part of that cycle has already begun house and says should we be I mean God our Lord I want to be taken off the earth I don't just want to stagger it and stagger out and just take it haphazard and yes you'll be right mating you whatever sweet ass bro and no kick that out the door we should be deadly sincere with this word that we have received we shouldn't just take it casual and say well isn't this just lovely no go beyond that amen we should be deadly sincere he said prophet had to be sincere we need to be sincere amen now we read this we read this last Sunday but he says now you see I'm not making it up I'm speaking of the book coming up in Revelations 10 it says thus saith the Lord I'll read it to you out of the book the mist the sounding of the seventh angels message the mystery of God should be finished has been declared by his holy prophets that the prophets who who has wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh church age the last church age at the all the loose ends that through these church ages have been probed it will be wound up together and when the seals are broke and the mysteries revealed down comes the angel the message of Christ setting us foot upon the upon the sea with a rainbow over us he'd now remember the seventh angels on the earth at the time of this coming so he says when you see this mighty angel will come down when the seventh Ange seventh church eight messengers here he's already come and gone this has already happened how sincere should we be if God here comes God coming upon the earth I'm gonna I'm gonna unite myself with the people this is not a doctrine this is an anointing coming down this is a person and Spirit fall that's why I say over all that health all that hell is may be upon the earth but all that heaviness is here all that heaven all the power of heavens been emptied upon the earth I'm in for a great uniting time I mean where God would take his bride catch her away hallelujah this is this is what's going on today this day hallelujah I mean this day now he's just gone to revelations tender but if you want to turn with me you can see it there on the on the screen he sees here revelations 10 and one and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud with a rainbow upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as well as when a lion roar and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices this is this this angel coming down this is Christ himself rainbow represents the Covenant he comes down the covenant angel the angel of the covenant that led Israel out of Egypt to the promised land he's the same one he's the same God here it comes upon the earth I trust this means something to you this is not theology you look at the anointing you're living under amen and so now he has a book open a Christ seven thunders uttered their voices now we're just going to read down to I think verse nine and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the scene upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things that there are now that time should be no longer there shall be no more delay I mean I'm going to wind up my plan of redemption this is coming to an end I'm going to bring the bride to her position as rails going to go to the homeland to receive me the Beast and all the Antichrist systems are going to come to their position this world is going to come to its position amen this is K this is the end time I'm gonna wind up this work very rapidly there's going to be no more delay it shall not tarry I mean the vision shall not tarry no longer it's going to become material hallelujah but in the days of the voice sorry my but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey now see here we have we have Christ ascending with a book open in Revelation now we know the book of Revelation is not all chronological at all you know it it's like a step letter you go up and down up and down so it's not you know so chapter 10 you know these things so the book coming up and everything this this overlaps the last church age okay even though we're in chapter 10 that's in chapter 3 but at all it overlaps know there was a so this angel that came down from heaven and he swore by him that liveth forever who created heaven and all things therein are and and created the earth and and created everything he's swearing by himself because Christ he could swear by no greater he swore by himself so this is this is Christ coming down who made all things and now he's swearing by himself that time shall be no longer but this is now the end time where I'm going to finish my plan right so now he's can and and will come into this later but this is very important because you got to have now when God swears I'm going to do something we should just we should build a cease from all strife we should judge him faithful he's more than able to do it I mean because that's that's the big battle have you judged some faithful have you just this word to be true I mean have you judged some able to keep us promise that he's given to you you got to judge him faithful because if you judge and faithful and you know he has it all in control you don't need to worry you don't need to stress you can't cast all your cares upon him because you know he's faithful if you don't believe he's faithful you hold on to your kids you'll hold on to your burdens and will become your problem but if you judge them faithful that now becomes his problem if you cast your kids upon him right so you got to judge them faithful now so there's a voice that cries out these seven thunders that that John Sorey heard he is about to write it but he was told to seal it up so there was part of God's Word that's been sealed until the time of the end now when God speaks it causes things to happen now you say well that's very obvious but you know you see John the Baptist came into Israel he began to speak that was God speaking forth out of a man from the wilderness and it caused an awakening over people it stirred up the whole you know originally the whole nation gets his multitude came out of Judea and Galilee and different ones to hear him I mean so everyone was stood up but there are a few among that group that their eyes came open and it awakened them and when Luther came and preached the just shall live by faith there was an awakening going on where people were sitting in cold traditional you know your Catholic Church they came out of that because there was there was a word went forth same with Wesley same with Pentecost and the same in this hour but there's a reason now God sends his word for a specific purpose now I just want to now brother branham if you go look at the healing revival before before the post will World War two a healing revival that the world actually attributes to the Ministry of brother branham being this being the one who actually initiated it before that the Pentecostal church was at a low ebb spiritually there's a great revival and God put a spirit out upon the earth and ministries just raised up overnight there was a great revival going on the Pentecostal move was the biggest move in the whole world in terms of converts coming into a church you know the the whole the whole landscape of you say America was changed because of the Pentecostal revival because the post-world War two healing revival the whole spiritual landscape of the place was changed so everyone thinks they're having revival but then brother Brahim sees this and doesn't third seal he says now he said it'd be the same thing we live in that day with it could be our guest it could be six hundred promises of them like that out of the scriptures just referring to it now but they rejected she held to her traditions and substitute instead of that she held to the substitute blood instead of the real blood the speaking of Jesus coming the first time Jesus the word said when he was manifested to her because she held to those tradition to these traditions Jesus the manifested word said to them to the bride Hebrew bride because you hold to your traditions you make the Word of God without any effect to you it can't be effective now that's what's the reason today that the revivals that the revivals that we're supposed to have we've had denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring and they thought they're having a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we've got revivals we haven't we've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival no where no no the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it and yet we say well how's there being no Manifest no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet you know there are miracles upon miracles the thoughts of people's lives were you know their lives were exposed before them where this is where you're from this is your address this is what's wrong with you thousands and thousands of times the son of man was was revealed but he says there hasn't been a manifestation of God to stir the bride yet amen because it takes the word to manifest the bride it takes the opening of the word to men - what - awaken someone that's why supernatural will not convert someone it takes God opening his word to them I mean that their hearts become open and God makes his word real to them that awakens someone that is the true awakening when God reveals his word to you personally I mean it goes beyond someone else's testimony someone else's story but it becomes a living reality to you that causes an awakening I mean once you were maybe did in some religion or in the world but then he revealed his work to you and it went from here to here and you heard more than a man from Kentucky you had the voice behind the voice and a spoke to your soul and you became awakened I mean so now he say you'll take these seven are nine thunders to wake her again he will send it now he promised it now this is in the third seal this as the word because you could understand as brother Branham walks with God the message unfolds to him he doesn't know everything when he starts his ministry God and falses were the prophets only know what God reveals to them like the shunammite woman comes to Elisha and you know the shunammite woman's son has has died this is all been going on but now she comes to the prophet and the prophet Elijah doesn't know what's going on God hasn't told me prophets don't know everything they just only know what God's revealed so as God is walking with brother Branham God unfaltering the Prophet amen so not only does the message unfold to us it was unfolding to brother Branham as he was preaching it right Amen so now but now he sees this so this is this is 1963 during the seal sees it will take symma non non thunders to stir the bribe and then now we come to recognizing your day in its message in 1964 he says they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that they will be awakened they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride see by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour I I pray you feel more than the pull of the hour amen I pray you feel more than the pool but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something supposed to happen but see they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you don't put it off God's going to move God's gotta move and he's already moving he's already moved oh he went he's he can open his word he's already open his word when is he going to take her people and adopt him into the body of Christ he's already done it when's he gonna call the bride he's already calling a bride I mean it's already happening don't put a wife in the future someplace the church world is looking for a great revival and you know and they prophesy it's going to happen and they're looking at the promise to Israel after the bride is already gone and they think it applies to them but applies to Israel they're gonna be bitterly disappointed amen and I pray we don't fall into that bracket that's why I believe with all my soul the same God that was there that you hear about on tape is present where the bride is that same God that same covenant angel as with his children that same Jesus was there he's here I mean if we just throw aside our whatever we're going on in love and just receive as promised take him at his word Amen you know we should all just go to digress a little bit there was a man it was a slave in America you know the story slave buyer goes to a plantation he wants to buy slaves and he sees this one slave he doesn't act like the rest of the slaves he's very different and he goes to the plantation owner who owns this slave and he sees can I buy that one he says no he's not for sale well then why is he so different and the owner says well I was wondering and I asked other slaves I come to find out that he is the son of a king his father is a king in a tribe in Africa and though he may never get back there and take his Father's throne he conducts himself as the son of a king because he is of royal blood so now but he was fed the same way as the other slaves he did the same work as the other slaves so everything of his life was the same as the other slaves but he did not react to the situation based on his position Amen of being a slave but he he reacted to it based on the office said he had the office he had was he is the King son are you following me so he reacted to everything around him because I'm a son of a king so he conducted himself that way and there should be the same thing with us we should never react to life based on our situation we should react in life based on the office that we live in right it's like a king you know a king if he forgets who he is then he can you don't worry about what's going on in the kingdom what well you know what are we gonna do with this and this this problem is this problem but if he just woke up and recognized I'm the King I have authority to deal with this I was authority to sort this out I'm gonna thority to fix this I mean all the kingdoms behind me it's in my hands I mean he he would wreck to something very differently than just appeasing on the street and it's got to be the same thing with us we can't just look at life like other people do and then we're to look at life according to being the sons and daughters of God I mean it'll change how you look at the world it'll change how you look at your family change how you look at your children I mean we don't need to be worried about everything who are you sons and daughters of God I mean that's why we should react to everything based on who we are and him a man isn't that right all of heaven is behind his children brother Bram says God will bankrupt heaven mmm before he lets one of us promises fail and never comes back insufficient funds I mean you gotta have confidence what does God made you what places he placed you in throw away the mind battle and say no his royal blood now flows through my veins what does he made you to be have a slave could do that amen the sons and daughters of God that are redeemed a meek ensure live that kind of way amen now they was believing in a coming Messiah they believed there'd be a forerunner come but it was right on them they didn't know it they didn't recognize it they believed there was a forerunner that would fall around the Messiah and they cut his cut his head off and killed the Messiah because it was prophesied that they'd be blinded Hosea said so and the same spirit that Spektor Hosea spoke through John and see the church and this last days would be naked blind and would put him outside of the church they failed to see these prophecies fulfilled but being in there they realized that something has got to happen they just don't get it they don't realize it much like the Jews of all times blinded later see a riches theology hostile with the church hostile towards the message because it didn't come their way and they failed to recognize the awakening of the bride now we read before they'll take these seven unknown thunders to stir her up and brother Brahim set off the other thing of the seals she has been awakened and he's asked very very straight questions he questioned had the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals but are yet but are not known to us as the thunders yet no this is his answers and questions and answers no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the seven thunders was about they was to reveal the seven thunders then head out of their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to ride it but he said but in the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel as a messenger to the seventh church age so he makes it very clear it's no longer that's like when Jesus was there and he said father glorify thy name and then a voice from heaven Sparkle I've glorified it and I'll glorify it again some head of thunder some heard a voice so a thunder is the Word of God not not made plain but but it's not a thunder anymore it's a voice to us I mean you say well what has this got to do with me well I'll tell you when God releases his word he releases a power in that word I mean just like Winnie when that law was released on your Mount Sinai there was a power in that law that they could go to their promised land and possess it I mean there was a power in that law that they could march around Jericho they could conquered Jericho they could conquer every city every obstacle in front of them could be conquered because there's a power in that word now he sees here in Hebrews 1 and 3 God who at sundry times I'm just trying to get you to see we don't just have a little musket we don't have a bow and arrow of some former age we've got the hot most high-tech weapon I mean with you know the full arsenal of heavens been opened it's been released to you use your weapon I mean don't be afraid to use the word take God at His Word He is God who at sundry times and divers manners spake in times past unto the father's by the prophets has in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high now I want you to notice this he says this is in verse 3 and upholding all things by the word of his power not by it now this is not a play on words they don't say by the power of his word but by the word of his power so when God releases his word he releases a power with that word right he releases a power with that word that's why that's why when we receive him when we receive his word he gives us power to become the sons of God as many as received him gave him power to become the sons of God this is John one right to to become placed as a son of God in their position that's why it's so powerful faith is such an incredible thing what makes you believe what makes you believe you wait really you gotta think ability I actually don't know what caused me to believe this I really don't know but I heard a word one day I heard a word and it spoke to me like nothing else has ever spoken to me I mean it impacted my life like nothing else has impacted me and I just happened to believe it I can't put it in words I can't put it in some formula or some equation but I just happened to her believe this and then you can see now the life you now live I mean you live above what you used to be right because it gives you power to overcome whatever had hand you down now you stand on it right here you're the boss now I mean the Word of God in you is the boss and everything else has to shut up everything else is now under your feet I mean because God releases a power in his word hallelujah this now he say well now why is this now so why these seven thunders being released why is it because God didn't release that in the first church H John saw it he was about to write he said see all those things up says part of a power part of God's power was held back for the endtime are you following me right it was held back because there had to be something that the endtime bride would receive which would break the cycle of revival and death amen just like the day of Pentecost there was an awakening knows a revival I mean but not very long after that death begin to sit in to the Ephesian Church I mean then God would God would repeat the process here here at like someone's candle I mean to be a revival again but then it would die down and go on to death again there's a cycle of revival and death you can see it all the way down through church history take even in the Old Testament Moses you know you know the children of Israel came into the promised land under Joshua there was a revival they took the most of the land but then what happened and that generation died and then the people turned from serving God they started serving idols there was death now coming and then there be a season where they were under slavery they called out upon God God seemed to judge send a deliverer they were free for a season a revival happened but then they turn their hearts return to where again they started serving the idols of the other nations and so the cycle you read the book of Judges it's a cycle of revival and death revival and if all the way down because there wasn't a power in that law to break some nature out of the people and for them to break that cycle right but now but then you come to your fees and age and Ephesians means to aim it but relax they aimed at the high calling in Christ but they relaxed and then eventually the church went down to the dark ages revival and then death and then you come down to our age the cycle has to be broken the cycle of revival and death must be broken that it's just revival right because God is the cycle breaker that comes you know we have seasons we can have years you know we are creatures of time but there has to come a time when there's no time I mean where it goes from time to eternity and there's no time anymore so it's like why God releases his word to us as we would come to understand we're not creatures of time right our main existence is not in time right this is just a little part of our existence we came from God and we go back to him I mean we came out of a sinking we manifested upon the earth then he takes us home right we're not just here that you're our 70 years of what if we're allotted you know that's not us that's not the sum of our existence this is just a brief gap an eternity that's going to come to an end it has to come to an end amen of death and sickness and sorrow and pain and the devil's got to come to his end I mean he's got to burn and all those things are going to be done away with Oh hallelujah so we have to begin now we have to begin to see we are part of that breaking of the cycle I mean just like you can trace your family lineage and maybe you can see there was an alcoholic spirit I mean down from your great-great great-great-great or maybe not so great-grandfather you know there was it was a drinking problem in your family or there was a your unfaithfulness or you know whatever it was lying or resentment or unforgiveness or you know you can you can see that in your family but there comes a time when that comes to an end that cycle of that affecting you know that affecting the your your that generation in the next generation and then the one who has normally raised up under that they can see it in their parents eyes now I'll never be like this they become exactly like that because they have not the power to overcome that thing in them oh yeah I mean but there comes a time with ears of people that will break that cycle because God wants it broken not it's not they're doing it's his doing I'm going to wind up my plan I'm going to give the people a total victory I mean that they will overcome all of these things hallelujah and then you just find yourself at the end hallelujah and there's a person down in the lineages who has to break the cycle and you just find yourself sitting in that role Here I am here's your script what's my motivation victory what's my motivation redemption what's my motivation Satan's going to burn hallelujah what's my motivation divine love have been expressed hallelujah and then to the things that your forebears are you once wrestled with you don't wrestle with them anymore because God has given you Dominion hallelujah because he released God released a powerful power and his word for you to overcome these things that's why in faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God I mean that's why we've got to listen that's why we should be a you know this thing takes up too much of our time and we let it do it this world is full of distractions just like Haggai and then where you're you're you know the rebuilding Jerusalem they're all distracted here's the enemy trying to come and stop building we're gonna kill you and all these things they got distracted by all those things they they had to get focused we're gonna rebuild the city I mean don't worry about the distractions of life you gotta make a make a look at your day or your week and and look at where y'all look at where your time goes where does your time go this is about redeeming the time you gotta claim back your time these things we have to do in life about children we've got jobs we've got responsibilities but what about your time what are you using your time for because you can scroll through all the you know I'm just scrolling through the news you know most of that we don't need to hear or read or see how did that help me it didn't help me it was actually negative impact on my life I don't want to know what Hollywood's doing or what the sports world is doing I don't really even care too much what Trump is doing let him do what he's gonna do he's gonna do it right oh god what are you doing what are you doing God what are you doing for me amen we should we should stay focused friends these are just a few more days to labor now for as the rain cometh down this is one of my favorite scriptures and the snow from heaven and returneth not feather but water with the earth and maketh it go forth and bud isaiah 55:10 and 11 that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word that go forth out of my mouth that shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper the thing with - I sent it I mean his word shall accomplish what it seemed to do Amen it's been sent to call a bride in this hour he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle washed in his blood made in His image I mean where the prophecies that she is him because to become one it's going to happen and you're gonna look at yourself and say it's happening and that's happening because I heard a word and something my eyes have come up and I become awakened anymore than by supernatural by a word that's been released and stirred me up it's awakened me hallelujah it's well what is it its effect on you amen I have become awakened I'm not a sinner anymore I'm not in the world I don't have some dated religion I have a living God I mean he's joined himself to me I mean he's awakened me we should never take these things casual you know we take it for granted we're the Bride of Christ we take it for granted oh we're going in a rapture we take that for granted we actually just take it for granted we should be so thankful oh Lord I want to serve you with everything all of my energy all that I am because he's worthy I mean we should just sit back and watch the world go by let someone else do that there's plenty of people doing that I mean there's not a lot of room on the grandstand let them sit there I want to run I mean let's build let's run with them amen his word will accomplish what it seemed to do that's why I said before have you judged him faithful you've got a judges word faithful because of it if you do judge it faithful then lord have you sent a messenger in this day to call a bride I mean he said the bridegroom call will come right through this this this ministry the Ministry of Malachi for he says well if that is true and that's you speaking hallelujah then you will call a bride and the bride's being called I mean you know we're like the 11th of the 11th 11th our workers we just we've just turned up just before clothes time it's like it's like for 459 and and the office closes at 5:00 and here we are hallelujah I'm glad I'm in there hey man you glad you're in hallelujah I'm glad now this is from Hebrews chapter 6 as we read in Revelations 10 there he swore by himself that time shall be no longer for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater swear by himself saying surely saying surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I'll multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men fairly swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation as to them and into all strife wearing God willing more abundantly to show to show unto the years of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath so Abraham said God swore by himself Abraham I'm gonna do it I'm gonna make you father of Nations it looks impossible to the flesh amen you can't do it in your flesh but I've already done it I have made your father not I will I have that's why you know we just as we walk with God we're just becoming what we mean to be I mean we're we're meant to be made in His image God God took a photo of you at your best before the foundation of the world and put it in his family album and you're just becoming like that photo I mean you say well this thing's getting old though talk about the real you this is just your house you're in at the moment but your eternal self is becoming like that photo we're just going from glory to glory changing us bowling us every day amen and it's by his word that he doesn't write so he swore by himself he's going to do it and so with a confirmation of an author's Amen for men barely swear by greater and and oath for confirmation as to them and end to all strife that's why we enter into rest they mean that's why the the bride truly is resting in this hour in terms of he said it I believe it he confirmed it to me he made his promise alive to me therefore I can rest amen I can rest in him I mean we're still got to fight for every inch of ground every divine promise sure but we can race that he is going to do it you just got to step forward right hallelujah now we read that John was told to take thee well maybe I'll put it back up there 8 and 9 he was told to take the book out of the Angels hand and eat it become one with this promise become one with this covenant now John in the book of Revelation is actually a symbol of you John is a symbol the Book of Revelations a book of symbols it's a book of prophecy but John himself is you the book because you come through you're from revelations one and he says I'm standing on the Isle of Patmos and hears a voice for voice behind him he turns and looks he sees seven golden candlesticks he sees the seven churches he's at the end of the city so this is already behind them this is like he's walking in time he doesn't know where he is until finally he's here at the end and and he turns he hears voices he sees the seventh Church ages behind him so God is actually telling you this is where you were because it's where John was because behind him was already the seventh Church ages right the seventh church age is already at its end where John was actually there and he heard the voice of the one walking in my seven church ages and then God begins to show so this is where you are in time anyway so this is what has been this is what is happening this is what will be right and then and then after you read the letter C in church age which is our church age revelations for one I heard that same voice in heaven and as the doors open say come up hither so it's the rapture the rapture of the bride at the end of the seventh church age so one man in a vision one man is a symbol of a whole group of people those that are dead in Christ and those who are alive and remain as represented in John right so John is a seal in the book I mean I mean it's a symbol in the book so as so as John was told to take the book take this open book out of the Angels hand and eat it now so it is speaking now over people now this is the book that's come open every divine promises in here right this message makes this plain it reveals Christ in here the message does and so now every divine promise everything that Adam fell from we have been restored to right so now we have to become one with that and then it becomes manifested in our lives so it's not so john is instructed don't just look at the book don't just talk about the book don't just talk about the message brother and sis don't just talk about the message become one with the message come under the message the messages Christ I mean don't just say yo yo cuz he says in the token message brother BAM I believe every word you say he says that's good but that's just being able to read races you must receive the token the whole ego Raisa just intellectually saying yes it's true and that's not enough it's got to be revealed in here and become a living reality amen amen so now he was taking take that book and eat that book become one with that book so now that's why we must become one with this word today because after John ate the book you don't see the book anymore you just see John Amen with their book goats in me hallelujah just like the you say the children of Israel there the law should have been embodied in everyday life that you wouldn't need to read the read the scrolls of Moses you can just see the life they lived if they really became one with that word then life became the manifestation of that word amen you people say like like what does this mean in the law well let's just go look at that guy's life we'll be able to work out what it means because their life is the interpretation of what the word should be right and it's the same thing with us now what is this message let's have a look let's look at some people amen because the life of the believer should be should be the interpretation of the word because we're living epistles read and known of all men amen now we're gonna we're gonna begin to take a bit of a turn on this oops he just sees he revelations chapter four he sees what John represent John represent an entire church that was taken up I told you one person here in a vision can represent the entire body of Christ and then and then and then and then in the same message I would notice John being taken up immediately after the church age was the type of the raptured Church immediately after the church ages over this lady accenture chage then comes the rapture right I just want this I just want the book of Revelation to become more personal and then you see when the angel comes to John and says come and see and come and see this and I saw this and I saw this you go to the message in brother band talks about future home it comes about souls under the altar he talks about the seals so all those things he's told to come and see the message shows you what those things are amen that's why it's more than doctrine God wants us to see who we are he wants to see he wants you to see who he is right this message is a personal message don't let the devil ever allow causes to become common - you should be fresh now you say what's this got to do with hair guy we're we're there where they are told be strong all you people of the land side the Lord and work for I am with you say at the Lord of Hosts according to the word which I coveted with you when you came out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not so he's told be strong and work ok if you do not see the Engel and in mind for anything you will lose heart and what you're doing you know it's just like those who are you know you know you take any sportsman if they do not see the prize that they can obtain they will lose motivation in their training right just any project at work at home wherever maybe if you do not see the in goal you will lose motivation and that's and that's what the devil wants us to do he wants us to lose sight one day it'll happen well you been no today could be the day he could take me away now he's come for many the Lord has come from any in our generation Amen he could come for you before the service is over right so we should be looking like it could be today amen and we shouldn't be worried about it we should be say thank you Lord if it's today I'm ready you've made me ready I'm waiting you know really at the end of the day when they did in Christ rise we should say I've been expecting you I've been expecting you Amen then we take it up to meet the Lord in the air we could say I've been expecting you hallelujah it should be that way shouldn't us we've been expecting him catches waiting bright away now we just got to take a big turn in this in this in this sermon because you think I haven't been talking about theory because of you asked if you've been awakened you got to realize you've got to work to do right you've got to work to do not just evangelize in the world evangelism starts at home right it starts in your four walls of where you live and it starts also in here because you're responsible not just you know you're responsible to God but you're also responsible to yourself because we want to be yielded vessels to him right we want to be available I mean when we just sit there say Lord whenever you want to use me Here I am and it could be driving it could be at the supermarket could be at home it could be on my job Lord whenever you want to use me I'm available I don't have to get ready I'm ready right we want to be ready okay so if we have that in mind then we will not go like the lady I see in church age that's lukewarm and different you know not excited you know not not motivated you know we will not be like that but we'll be on fire now how that fire manifest is different to each one right some people are very exuberant some people are very quiet that is not that does not show how people are on the inside so your watch a deep core through the deep is a man saying before brother branham and the in the discernment line he's just standing there like this and the Prophet talks him says I can see you're a little bit excited I can see you're excited sorry that's just him he's not shouting he's not jumping he's just standing there she can't always take how people manifest to be how they really feel right we're all built differently God is a God of variety praise the Lord he's not a cookiecutter doesn't make us all the same I mean but but if we really if we're really convinced and then concerned if we're convinced this is the coming of the Lord then we'll be concerned not only for our people on the street will be concerned for ourselves and concern for our family right so that gives us motivation now we're going to work because God gives us the tools I mean to liver overcoming life he doesn't force us through a pipe and cause us to overcome we have to overcome he enables you to overcome just like God told Moses children of Israel I give you the land the land is yours you must go fight so they had to go fight for every promise then you go fight for every city but God had already give it to them right that's the same thing with us so that but this this world doesn't want us to be motivated you know with the things of the Lord or really anything just just float by keep with the status quo there's brother Armand summed up this country very well as a sheep paddock with some fences and this sheep it's flat it's grass that's this country it's all the same keep it all the same don't don't be too different tall poppy syndrome someone rise up a little bit different they get cut down jealousy listen this is this country we have to fight that spirit we cannot let that enter and you know if we're born again we're not under that spirit amen and now but our minds many times and our way we look at things it's got to be retrained we have to look at the things according to who we are not our situation okay so this country maybe in a sheep field but I'm an eagle in the sky hallelujah I worship as well but I'm an eagle I mean but you know we shouldn't just let's not live according to this New Zealand culture this New Zealand spirit she'll be right know if God said so I'm gonna press the mark of the high calling the Apostle Paul never said she'll be right I mean just just just you know what a press in the kingdom of God the violent take it by force and it's not someone with a sort but the vile the ones you press in they mean hey if the promise is mine it's mine you've seen people you go you know it's like that what the Black Friday sales and you know you're the big discount sales people fight yeah it's like one TV and people are fighting in the shop just to get that TV have you ever seen that kind of thing because they want it it's on it's on special I want this it must be mine and they will literally push everyone out of the way that they get it now that's just a that's just a TV or or whatever it's gonna burn but if people are so jealous over something they believe is this how much more the Bride of Christ with the promise of God it's mine push every devil out of the way this belongs to me right man that's how we should be so should give us motivation let's work let's build they had to rebuild the city and at 70 years it was Branton ashes and rubble and whatever more they had to go through all the rubbish they had to get the stones they had to rebuild have you ever seen a ruined city that's a little be a lot of work be a lot of work to rebuild but they but some of them were motivated God's given us a promise we're gonna worship God according we're gonna rebuild this temple we're gonna offer sacrifices we're gonna build walls we're gonna have a city again God's going to dwell among us that was the motivation and should be the same thing with us God has restored his word I mean his presence is among us hallelujah he's caught he can have living stones he does lively stones he's going to take those stones place them into his body hallelujah that once we were bunch of rubbish on the ground Brandon charred and broken he'll pick us up and restore us and wash us molars and put a sir put us into the building where we should be amen now proverbs 20:4 I went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and needles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall there always broken down then I saw and considered it well I looked upon it and received instruction now I'm not just when I read this I'm not just talking about a natural farmer but he's receiving instruction this means this means I say this means mind this man spirit realm is broken down full of full of wheats thorns and there's no wall of protection this is there's actually someone's mind this is how some people are they have no wall of protection around their mind that's why I see it on Wednesday you've got to capture take your thoughts captive you've got a you're responsible for this you are responsible for what goes in this and how much it's entertained or what's thrown out you're responsible for your thoughts God doesn't make us robots where we just all automated you know nature runs by instinct but we have a free moral will right and God gives it to you and he entrusts it to you and he's saying what are you gonna do with this now first tip is you've got to give that will over to him right but what are you doing what are you feeding upon every day are you building up a wall of defense which you should be the Word of God in your heart right are you getting rid of the thorns and the you know many times we think people who are negative they're full of negative thoughts or pessimistic you know they're full of pessimism different ways because they're thinking in a certain way I say that's a bunch of thorns that's a bunch of needles it's got to be a Brigitte it's got to be taken out this is someone a man void of understanding because a man of understanding doesn't want weeds growing in his garden ears want weeds growing in his vineyard or in his field he wants it all taken out you know the Song of Solomon the bride ceaseless bride see it's coming to thy garden speaking about herself there's no just talking about a natural garden talk about her talking about you and I we're a garden we're a field right and so now we should never let this be us because we should be a people of understanding isn't the bride a people of understanding we know who he is we know who we are we know what he's done for us we know where we're going we know where we came from we know who the devil is we know how he works we know as tactics and then we should not be ignorant to his devices so that's the case now we shouldn't be like this we got to be responsible you know what are we what are we paying what are we paying attention to well I'm just gonna scroll through a few things and then and then and then that gets lodged in there and you've got to get the whole and you got to rub it out and you've got to spray some stuff and why don't you just scroll through the Bible scroll through the Bible instead scroll through the message instead what are you putting in here because what you put in here will it'll change how you think it'll change how you treat your treat each other you see these people who become mass shooters and whatever more they never started off that way mass murderers and things they never started off that way they were like anyone else sure they had their temperament and their and you know certain things happening but they didn't they were not born to be a mass shooter but as what they lived in here and it grew and it took over and then they began killing people amen but we came for what we what we do and the problem is in this age was quite any age with mainly this age you know children's brains are still growing even into their early 20s the brain is still developing and then but the world has put everything in front of us and emotionally children cannot handle what they see they can't handle it and that and that's a problem if you're being given stuff the emotionally cannot handle I just want you to think about these things because what are we what are what are we putting in the garden because we're responsible for them too I mean just think about it now Ecclesiastes 1018 by much slothfulness the building decayeth and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through and then in proverbs 25 28 he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls just like the man's vineyard the wall was broken down so if you have no rule over your own spirit Amen it's like you have no defense anything can just come in raid go away or set up camp or whatever because you got no rule over your own spirit remember it takes a strong man to be in the house because of the strong man's in the house of the God himself is in the house nothing else is stronger than him right and he takes dominion where he is given room he takes over I mean but you got to let him take over he will take as much as you'll give him Simon the Pharisee invited him to a feast he was unwashed feet and welcome but yet he was there because Simon gave him that much how much of your life are you giving him he giving him just a little bit on the corner are we giving him the chief chief seat at the feast as he number one or Z number something else you gotta think about it now he the slothful slothfulness the building decay ahthe are honest of the hands the house drop us through it's like a relationship you got to work at it yeah amen if you don't work at a relationship it will collapse like this buildings it will drop through amen it's like how's your prayer life how's your prayer yeah you know brother Brahim seed gives us how do you get closer to God read your Bible and pray what are the two hardest things to do every day read your Bible and pray why is that because the devil was sitting in the congregation taking probably better notes than everyone else and when he heard that he's okay I've got to work on this and then we have this world we have everything and what does it do it just robs us of our prayer life I'm not talking about length of time don't make it a religion but the quality of prayer amen we don't have to spend five hours to get into the spirit we just get in the spirit you just be talking to them driving along and have a glorious time we're gonna be it you know sometimes I've been at work I've been there working in the lab it feels like Heaven's just gonna I'm gonna leave I'm just thinking about him amen and then he begins to speak to me hallelujah so how's your prayer life you say well I don't know how to pray it's just like any relationship user hello how are you it's that small talk from your heart you don't need some big flowery words talk from your heart God wants people who are real he doesn't want something that's all polished up and washed up and looking all great he just wants you to be real I want you to be honest amen and then from there things can grow so I want to ask you i I just want to leave you with that thought this has happened wait so now let's just read this this is speak this is from influence again as well speaking of Uzziah I believe now when you're corrected by the word you must be subject to the word and he said he would do as he pleased this is when he went into the temple tried to be a priest when he was a king a CD of do as he pleased he was the head of the thing he just do what he wanted and you know what happened he was spent with leprosy and while his anger rage was upon him the priests detected the leprosy in his face now you say well what do you mean leprosy represents as a type rather of sin and when a man won't stand correction by the word of God he's full of leprosy blows up and carries on what does you do what do you do you ruin your influency something happens people knows it and can tell the word that you're corrected by that you're not going to do it therefore you ruin your influence now this is a man whose vineyard has been full of weeds and everything pride comes in and that's the biggest thing you look in the Bible you look at the Kings the biggest danger God blesses them and they come to a junction in their in their reign are they gonna stay humble or are they gonna think well I can just do anything and you and you look at them you go through seeking Kings you see the godly Kings 99% of the time God blesses it because they because they cast out the idol say you're repair the house of God all these things God blesses them they begin to have victories over their enemies then they get lifted up and pride they're not walking humbly with their God anymore because they think now they can just do anything and there's such a danger right as I read as I read very early on I said yo we see revelations 10 manifesting among us materializing among us we should be so sincere right because we're not waiting for it to come a Dorian motion and it hurts this fellow anger got on him and while he was in his anger leprosy was in his face and we find out that not only did he drop the sense that he ran from the house of God never be able to return because no matter how great he was how much influence he had when he was corrected then he refused to take his correction because his social standing had become more to him than the Word of God had become okay what of God had become I'm sure you understand what I'm driving at see have become more to him his position as King became more to him than the Word of God that's why we have to remain sincere we're not when we talk about these things you know this is precious God as God and His mercy would awaken you when maybe the person next to you maybe your childhood friend he hasn't become awakened well she hasn't become working their life has gone on a different road and your life has gone down this road with God and you may have been exactly the same neighborhood same everything but then God awakened you didn't awake them yet well why is that God's grace God doesn't ask anything do you know if he'd never if he never blesses us one more time if he never answers another prayer if he never moves again he's already done more than enough amen and we must never forget that he doesn't owe us a single thing we worship Him not because of how good life may be we worship Him because He is God and he made all things and he is our Redeemer we do not worship Him based on our circumstance we worship Him because of who he is we must never forget that we must be sincere because we've got we've got the greatest thing in the world the greatest treasure of heaviness Christ among us why do we want a substitute of some little influence to try and make ourselves somebody big among somebody here why not be a humble servant to Christ we have the greatest treasure and when I heard that I listened to the sermon it gripped me and when he said that we have the greatest treasure Christ among us amen I want to leave it there friends this just bow head shall we I just want to ask you a question if you've got all indifferent and hard cold why don't you just raise your hand gracious father Lord you see these hands all over the building I just pray father your Lord we would ponder these things Lord may we not be just a a hearer of the
