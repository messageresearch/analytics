Um this morning I actually have a a testimony or like a it's something I do funny things now and then I I just want to tell you something that happened because I like to um sometimes publicly say these things then they stick. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Okay. I I'll be like about five minutes. Um, so I'll just take this off. It's a bit guitary. So this is about the thing that I'm doing making the film. I just want to say something about it. Um, so each one of us, we all have a purpose or a calling that we are called to do. We we're not here just to fill a spot. We have a plan and a calling and a purpose. And mine I've always had this thing in my mind is mine was always going to be to do something more so than what I mean is not just be something, but to do something, which means I start here, I do something, I finish here, then I'm happy, you know. Um and I guess that's I have had opportunity to do easy earth things but they haven't appealed to me and I've probably um uh in some ways made my life slightly hard because I haven't settled for like a certain hill that maybe other people might settle for. I think in some ways I've been jealous of people that can settle for a certain hill and think, man, I wish I could settle on that hill. But, you know, I'd often say, I'm not dying on that hill, man. I I can't. So, often times I've walked away from things that maybe I should have stayed with and made life easier. But when the idea came to do the movie, I thought to myself, now that's a hill I'd like to go and climb. Because it seemed like quite a big hill to do considering at the time 12, 13, 14 years ago, I knew nothing about film whatsoever. Um, and I just will say this because it ties in with what I'm saying. There's I have another annoying trait that I just can't seem to quit sometimes. You know, there's no button there to go just quit. You know, some days you I think, Lord, I wish I could just quit. It's quit button. But it, you know, you end up when you should quit, you end up waking up the next day and doing the opposite. You think, is that all you got? Bring it on. You go even harder the other way. And it's it's you know, you can't help being like that. It just is the way that it works. It's um But back to the hill idea. When I think of that in my mind, I think this hill that's in reference to my life, it's the biggest hill that I've got to climb. So then I thought that's kind of like Mount Everest. I would type it to, you know, cuz I think naturally what's the biggest hill that we could look at and that would be the biggest hill that you see. Okay, I've got a little story, a little thing that happened. So this here, see that peak up the top there? That's Mount Everest. It's nestled among all this the Himalayan mountain range there about 29 and a half thousand feet. If you had a if you were cruising a Boeing 747, you'd hit it. You have to go up a little higher. Um, brother Bradam wrote a poem when he was younger and it was he wrote it about I'm lone Samosa lo for that far away southwest. And then the the end of the poem he said, "Somewhere in the distance I can hear a lion wine in those far off Catalina mountains on the Arizona line." Now he was over in Jeffersonville and this was west which were the Catalina Mountains in Arizona. And so he always thought about going there and then one day he was hunting there and he heard a lion wine and he realized you know that poem I wrote was a prophetic poem. I'm now living out that poem. I'm I'm on the in the Catalina mountains on the Arizona line and I can hear in the distance I can hear a lion whine. So he wrote this poetic he wrote this poem that was prophetic. So about knowing this thing about Everest, I've wrote this song and I called it Ed because if you know if you don't know the first man to climb Mount Everest officially that we know of was Edund Hillary which was a New Zealand guy in 1953. and and just typing his him to doing that was what I thought my thing is, you know. So, you just write this I wrote this prophetic song. Can I read you the words to the song? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, it's um this was like six years ago. The song goes, "Ed is going to go for a big walk. He's going to walk to the top of the world, leave all the bees with his brother and his daddy, and go and see the Nepoese because he was a beekeeper." And then at the start of the expedition, they all met up in Catmandeue. Then they hiked to the base of the mighty Himalayas, the monster they were walking into. But the monsoon rains were coming and Mr. Hunt said, "We best get running. If they beat us to the top, then we'll all be packing up and you'll be going back home to your mummies." This happened. But Ed said, "I I didn't come this far to give up now. I can see the mountaintop, and I won't stop until I knock it knock it knock it off. Second verse. Then they all left off from the base camp down the bottom and made a home way up at South Cole. Bore, Dylan, and Evans tried to make it to the summit, but the summit said, "No, no, no." Then then Mr. Hunt called Ed and Kenzing and said, "You boys can go for a shot." So they packed their bags and the oxygen tanks and started pushing their way to the top. And they pushed on up through the snow and the rocks and the ice and the lifeless air till it looked like they couldn't go on. Tenzing said, "Should we turn back, Ed?" But Ed said, "I I didn't come this far to give up now. I can see the mountaintop and I won't stop until I knock it. Knock it knock it off. Cuz if you knew what I've been through to get here, blood, sweat, and tears, you would see why I can't just walk away. You would see why I can't just walk away. If you knew what I've been through to get here, blood, sweat, and tears, you would see why I can't just walk away. You would see why I can't just walk away. Cuz I didn't come this far to give up now. I can see the mountaintop. And I won't stop until I knock it. Knock it. Knock it. And then at the end of the song, as every good song has to have a climax, the end of the song is Ed singing, "I'm standing on the top of the world." So that's the prophetic song. So I'm at the So I'm driving the other day. I drive to the dump to drop all this rubbish at the dump. And I I reverse my trailer with all this rubbish on to this almost the Gizbborne dump. Brother Ben, it's you can still see the rubbish. It's all there. You can sort of like smell it, you know, nostalgia. Brother Ben talked about the old Gizbborne dump the other day, which was just a pile of rubbish by the beach. Just a mound of rubbish. So, so I reverse up and I get my trailer back to where you chuck the rubbish in. And I walked hop out of my car and walk down the side and I see this old crusty can on the ground. And I'm about to I think I'm going to boot that old can in the rubbish um dump. And somebody said, "No, don't boot the cannon. Keep the can." I thought, "No, the crusty old can. It's just going to probably be all dirty. I'm just going to boot it in." But I just picked it up, had a look at it. Looked like a pretty old can. I do like old cans cuz I made old films and I had like collected old like tin cans from 1900 and that. So, I liked old cans, but this one didn't look really that old. It was kind of rusty. I thought I would chuck it. So, I chucked it down. I was going to boot it in again. But you know the second time somebody said keep take that can home clean it up and never get rid of it. Never get rid of that can like quite a strong feeling. I thought man I better what on earth is this said can you know? So I pick up the can and I look at the front of it and it says that on the front Romney's Kendall Mint Cake. I thought what on earth is Romney Romney's Kendall Mint Cake? So I read on the back and it says Romney's Kendall Mint Cake was the first mint cake to be successfully carried to the top of Mount Everest on 29th of May 1953. This being the first successful expedition to the summit. Romney were approached by the 1953 expedition to Everest to see whether they could supply mint cake to them within seven days. This had to be packed into high altitude packs for inclusion to this um in the supplies to be sent ahead. Hence the need for haste. Fortunately, they had sufficient stock to meet their need and the staff willingly gave up their sweet ration coupons to comply with the law. Sir Edmund Hillary and Sudor Suda Tenzing ate this mint cake on top of Mount Everest as they gazed at the countryside below them. Since then, Kendall Mint Cake has been a firm favorite with hikers, climbers, and visitors to the Lakes District. So then I realize why I'm keeping hold of this little this little tin. I got a few more minutes. Now, people often ask me, "How's the film going? How's the film going?" And I say, "Yeah, it's going. I'm doing stuff, but I really haven't started the film. But like like Edund Hillary, I think he climbed a few other mountains before he climbed Mount Everest, you know? So I said, "Look, I'm doing stuff. I'm just not doing the film because I'm just climbing this one, climbing that one, learning this, learning that." But I hadn't actually officially, it's been 14 years, I haven't actually officially started it yet. But the funny thing with this was when they got the supplies, they were at base camp. And when they got the supplies and they started their walk up to the top of the hill, they had to wait till they got the supplies. And call me crazy, but the Lord said, "Now you got to start making the film." Like you you got the supplies now. You go you can officially start and go and ascent do your ascent up to uh the top of the hill. So I kind of like that. And I and I kind of got asked how long I wanted. I said three, but now I said three and a half. I want three and a half years to to do it. If you give me from now, give me three and a half years and I'll do it. And so then the date was the 14th to the 7th. So three and a half years will be the 14th day of the first month. If you are Jewish, that would be the Passover. But we're not Jewish. We are Western. So that's 14th of January. But the 14th or the first is Passover. Now, so I wrote the date on the inside of the can. The start date. I wrote the finished date on the inside of the can. I'm going to hold on to this can that's sitting at home along with my bird's nest. If you remember the bird's nest, still got the bird's nest. The law seems to do these things like this. Now, there's going to be two outcomes in this whole thing. The one outcome would be I get to the top which would be reasonably satisfying because then I can push stop please. Another outcome is I die on the hill. But I think about it and I'm like that's not a bad hill to die on. Now the reason why I want to come up and say this publicly is because it makes it official if I do this. I kind of in a way I hold myself to it as well rather than it just be sitting somewhere and the devil can mess with them. I'm like, "No, actually set it back there and I'm going to do it." But I I wait till I get these things anyway before I move forward with stuff. But the I guess the only problem is is that Satan is I mean, he already hates you. He hates me. And he's been at me for years to try and destroy me. And this is only going to make him a bit more Yeah. And probably all hell is going to be against me, against you guys. But that's all right. If God be for us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; We s we we're stronger than he is. And then I thought about it cuz I thought this this almost seems crazy to start it now. But so I've been through through so much stuff in the last two and a half years. Like Satan's thrown everything he can at me to derail me and to just ruin my whole life. But I stand up here today and I think, you know what? I'm still here. &gt;&gt; I'm still standing. And is that all you got? You know, and I thought back and I think, you know, it's it's actually you deal with the stuff every single day that I have for years. You actually get stronger. I thought I'm stronger than what I ever have been. The scheme to ruin us actually makes us stronger. &gt;&gt; And you know, we just become mighty warriors because we just get so used to fighting that's all we know. We just get up, we fight, we move forward. And I've also got a bit of uh righteous anger built up in me. And I feel like it's the day of vengeance, too. It's a day of vengeance. So, at the premiere, mark my words, at the premiere, you're going to get a little pack. And in that pack is going to be one of these Kendall's mint cakes in the in the premier pack. So, you're going to, if you all are going to be there, you're going to be sitting on the chair eating some Kendall's mint cake while you're watching the film. Okay, mark my words. So, yeah, that's what I wanted to share with you this morning. Thanks for the time to just share. I really appreciate really appreciate it. Can we just stand? I've taken up the time, but let's just sing. Um, why I won't be shaken. I won't be moved before I ask brother Ben to come up. I speak to the mountain. It's time to move. My God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. [Music] Why would I worry when giants come calling my name? Cuz my God is so much bigger than troubles I face.

We serve the all powerful, almighty, mighty conqueror himself. And we face a defeated foe. Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you all. Praise the Lord. Thank you, musicians. Amen. Thanks, brother Isaac. Climb your mountain, my brother. Just climb it. That summit's yours. Climb it. Amen. Praise God. Well, we got a birthday girl here. Happy birthday, Lilia. &gt;&gt; Yeah. God bless you. Praise the Lord. Amen. Some you'll be celebrating afterwards. Amen. Um, so sadly this is the Sturwig's last service together as a family. I'm basically yes uh sadly. So yes, a brother Amanda after the minister's meeting this coming weekend is going to go up north. So they're moving to Fungare, I'm sure you're aware. So we're not happy about this at all, but the Lord's will be done. So we're going to miss you terribly. We'll pray for you at the end of the service, okay? But just um sorry to put a dampener on everyone's day, but you know, anyway, let's go to the scripture, shall we? uh today let's go to we're going to go to Joel chapter 3 and I want to speak about yeah so Joel 3 and 11-14 so um yes as you can see Christine's not here today Lord willing another time okay so I thank you for your prayers really appreciate it your love and support it's really phenomenal so we're going to talk here if we have so Joel 3 and heaven. I think this ties in very nicely with brother with what brother Jimmy was speaking on on Wednesday. So he says here, "Now assemble yourselves and come all ye heathen and gather yourselves together round about. Hither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord. Let the heathen be wakened. Come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat, for there will I sit to judge all the heathen roundabout. Put you in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, get you down. For the press is full, the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision. For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. So I want to talk about the valley of decision as the power of decision or indecision. Now when I talk about this, I'm not just talking to people who have not made a decision. This this is for all of us, okay? because there's a journey that we're taking. So, I pray this is very personal. I pray God speaks to all of our hearts, including mine. I pray the Lord has his way today. &gt;&gt; Okay? So, let's bow our heads and let's just commit our lives to the Lord. Amen. Gracious, loving father, how thankful we are, Lord. You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. We praise your great name for this day. We can gather as a people once again, Lord. We don't take for granted that we can be here as a body of believers praising and worshiping you. Dear God, as we've read your great eternal word, Lord, we I invite you, the great author of the book, Lord, now step forth. May you speak, Lord. May you listen through everyone who's hearing, dear God. So don't just anoint me to speak, Lord. I pray you'd anoint everyone to hear. Not just hear those who are streaming, dear God. Father, may you. We just want to plead your blood over our lives. Take control of the service. Guard my tongue, dear God. Have your way among us. We love you with all our hearts. We thank you for this day. Be those who couldn't be here today, Lord. We always mindful when someone's not here. Dear God, especially Lord, my darling Lord who's who's recovering, thank you for your healing hand upon her. And anyone else who couldn't be here because of sickness or travel, Lord, wherever they may be, be their abundant portion in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Friends, you can have your seats this morning. So, I want to speak about being in the valley of decision. Now, I want to just break this down a little bit because there's uh oh, wait, let's put the scripture back up because I used to think this scripture said that the Lord is near in the valley of decision. Like he's there in the valley to help you make your decision. But this scripture actually is far more has far more gravity than that. Because as we read here, this scripture speaks of today because the day of the Lord, this is not the day of the Lord. I'm just going to break this down and we're going to go a bit of a journey. Okay. So, let's just put the first bit. So, so put in ye the sickle for the harvest is ripe. This is the harvest time. I mean, this is the harvest age where the tears are being gathered and to be burned and the wheat's been gathered to the garner. This is the harvest age. This is harvest season where every seed is coming to its manifestation. Whether you're a wheat or you're a tear, whatever you are, it's going to come out what's in you. And I just want to say from the very beginning, I believe we're all wheat this morning. I don't believe that there's any tears here. Okay. &gt;&gt; I just believe all wheat. &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. So, but this is the harvest season. This is a gathering time. Israel has been gathered that 144,000 will be harvested. Amen. The bride has been gathered to the word that there will be a harvest. And the world council of churches has been gathered not for a harvest for a burning. Amen. So, this is but this is a time when there's, you know, and and then also this time is a time where their wickedness is great. Whether has there been such a time as as since the days of Noah where the thoughts of man are evil continually. The imagination of man is either on some woman or some drink or some pleasure or something wicked. You know, there's no sound mind really. Very, very few people have a sound mind out in the world or even, you know, and it wants to come in among us and and pollute our minds. But I say the Holy Ghost is here to keep our minds clean. Amen. We can take that double barrel shotgun like I was talking about last Sunday and blast those things out in the name of Jesus Christ. So the wickedness is great even as Abraham was told by God that you know that the iniquity of the Amalachites had to wax full before Israel would come out of Egypt and go into the promised land. And you know I believe this is this is the season that we live in. But while this is all going on there's multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision. There's because this is a day where every idea under the sun can be given can be sent to you. You can access any idea under the sun. And so there's multitudes in the valley of decision. And even among believers, there's a multitude in the valley of decision where there's a now this may be a bit heavy today, but let's just take it personal. This is I just want to get this off my heart. Then I can just be happy and walk out of here, okay? So let's just don't don't put up a shield, okay? Because the last thing we want to do is be left behind. Okay? We don't want to come and where's everyone gone? What's happened? and the raptures happened and we've and we've been around the truth and been around rapturing faith and around the presence of God and yet we just been feeding off the blessings of it and not becoming one with him. He doesn't want you just to feed off the blessings. He wants you to become one with him more than anything. I mean that's why he sent this message is that you and Christ would become one. Amen. This is what he's wanted. That's why he died for you. Amen. That you and him would become one. So there's a there's a multitude in the valley of decision. They can't make up their mind. Amen. And it says for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. So when there's a time there's a multitude of people in the valley of decision, the day of the Lord is very close. Now the day we live in today is not the day of the Lord. This is man's day, man's ideas, man's religion, man's opinion. He says this in the Patmos vision. He says, "Now let's get back to our scripture. We know what the Lord's day is not. It's not Saturday or Sunday. It's not keeping a day. We know that, right? The reason we gather on a Sunday morning is to honor the resurrection. But you, we could have church any day we wanted. &gt;&gt; It's not about, oh, you got to keep a day. No, the true day of rest is the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the true Sabbath. We know that, right? So, it's not keeping a day. Well, what is it then? Today is certainly not the Lord's day. This is man's day. This is man's doing, man's work, man's church, man's idea of worship, man's everything. For it's man's world, cosmos. But the day of the Lord is coming. Yes, it is. It is just like that at this time. of the revelation of Jesus Christ. John was taken up by the spirit and transported by the spirit to the great day that is coming. The Lord's day is when the days of men are over. The kingdoms of this world will then become the kingdoms of our God. The day of the Lord is when the judgments fall. And after that comes the millennium. So that so so this day of the Lord is the great and dreadful day of the Lord, which is the great tribulation time where salvation's done. Mercy's gone back to the Jews. If you're holy, you're holy still. filthy, filthy, still righteous, righteous still. Your the Gentiles are locked in their position and God turns back to the Jews and they have a day of grace of well a season of grace of three and a half years where God turns back to them. So that is that that happens in the day of the Lord. So this is this is near in the valley of decision. So we're living in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we all agree together? &gt;&gt; Amen. I just trust you can see this here. It's more than a vague idea. No, Joel is looking at you and I and the world in 2025 where there's a great valley of decision that that multitudes are in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, see, right now the world does what it wants to do with the Christian. They call them all manner of evil names making fun of him. But there is coming that great and notable day when they will wail in hell for the lamb is coming in wrath to judge the world. That is when the righteous will have their day with the Lord. For the wicked shall burn and the righteous will walk over their ashes into the millennium. Malachi 4:3. And they shall tread down the wicked, and they shall be ashes under the souls of their feet in the day that I shall do this, sayaeth the Lord of hosts. Now, I don't say that or quote that with any satisfaction. I don't want to be treading on anyone's ashes, right? In the world, anyone. I want everyone to get there, &gt;&gt; right? But you've got to make a choice, right? You can't just float along and be around. It's like helping Noah build the ark, but you don't get in the ark. &gt;&gt; Because the problem is people don't make up their mind. is because they think the devil's offer is good as the the Lord's offer. It's like if you've ever had two job offers at the same time and it takes you a while to actually pick one. It's you're standing in the valley of decision. You can't actually work out which one's right. You think, "Oh, this one's got merit, but this one's got this kind of merit." And maybe if I just, you know, pick this one, but then this one, what you doing? You're in the valley of decision. And the, you know, the devil always tries to come to us and say, just, you know, you don't need to really give your heart to the Lord. You don't really need the Holy Ghost. You don't really you just need to be part of the group and you know cuz the group's going and you know I heard something ridiculous the other day. I heard no one here said it but but some people believe that going to church makes you a Christian. &gt;&gt; Like going to church makes you rapture ready. Like just being part of a group. I think it was Billy Graham made the saying very famous. He said, you know, coming to church doesn't make you any more a Christian than standing in a garage makes you a car. &gt;&gt; You can live in a garage. You'll never become a car. I'm sorry. You never become a car. It doesn't matter what car you want. Oh, I identify as a Ferrari. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really going to help you. &gt;&gt; But that's the thing. People think, "No, well, I'm just part of the group and I'm part of the group and well, the group's going to go and I see God live and I see him do miracles and God changes lives in front of me and all these things." But you can't just be part of the group. &gt;&gt; Being part of the group does not save you. It's a personal walk with the Lord himself. Amen. When you get filled with the Holy Ghost, you make a because you've got to make a decision. And you know there's one thing that God will never tamper with, which is your free will. &gt;&gt; He will never force himself upon anyone. He never makes you makes you surrender. He never makes you give your life. It's a it's a gift &gt;&gt; that you must receive &gt;&gt; and it's your decision and he will respect your decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Either way, &gt;&gt; there's consequences either way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; On one hand, there's a great tribulation and the white throne judgment. On the other hand, there's a rapture and a wedding supper and walking on streets of gold and walking in this life knowing there's no condemnation because you're walking after the Lord and you're sealed to the day of your redemption. You're safe as safe can be. So, which one do you want? &gt;&gt; I would I want the rapture side, &gt;&gt; right? I want the rapture side. But you see, there's always a pressure now. Well, the group, you know, and and the problem is, you know, the church could hold us back. &gt;&gt; Because you think, well, everyone else is doing certain things, so I'll just match up with what everyone else is doing, and therefore I'm fine. &gt;&gt; That is a false culture. &gt;&gt; That's a false message culture. Amen. We must never ever let a lady sin message culture come around where we're just part of the church and we, you know, we we need to be part of a group. The Bible says, "Do not forsake the assembling of yourselves together, especially when you see the time approaching, right? So, we must be part of a body." Good luck going to try and live by yourself and be an overcomer. You will fizzle out. People have done it. People have tried. It's just the devil's lies getting somewhere away and they refuse to be part of a body. We must be part of a body. And I'm not saying that because I'm a pastor. I'm saying that because I'm a Christian. I mean, if I wasn't standing here, I'd be there. Amen. If I wasn't there, I'd be helping somewhere being part of a body. Why? Because the body of Christ, there's something in a believer that wants fellowship. It yearns to be part of a body cuz God doesn't want us separate. He wants us united. Doesn't matter what church we go to, be part of a body. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see, now people want to be. But the thing is, people are in this valley of decision. And they and they and they wonder, well, you know, do I really need to? I say, you must &gt;&gt; give your life to Christ. &gt;&gt; I need something to happen. Well, it's happening this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. The word of God is here to actually say make up your mind because the devil wants to hold you in this in this in this holding pattern. It's like being a it's like being in an airplane, you know, like a holding Who's ever been in a holding pattern in a plane because there's a queue that, you know, going to the runway and you circle and you circle. Now, you're not worried because you know that the aircraft has got enough fuel. But what if the airplane circles forever? It's not going to stay up there forever. It's going to crash, right? So why hold in a holding pattern when you can land into safety? You can enjoy the goodness of God. You can have your own revival. Amen. You can have the power of God living in your life and you're not just part of the groupy. I tell you what, friends, the church never saved saved nobody. &gt;&gt; This church has never saved a single soul. The word of God coming to a open heart saves. Amen. It redeems. It's not the church that saves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You will never get salvation through Shikina Tabernacle. You get salvation through the word of God. Amen. If the word of God is preached, salvation will come. Deliverance will come. Healing will come. Restoration will come. Why? Cuz it's the word's God to do it. Amen. It's it's the word's job to do it. &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see what happens is is being in the valley of decision makes you unstable. As it says here, but let him ask in faith, never wavering. For he that waverth is like a sea um of the I mean wave of the sea driven like uh with the wind and tossed. Let not that man think that he shall receive sorry for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. So someone in the valley of decision is unstable in all their ways. And I'm going to come to it. It's not just those who haven't even given their lives and been baptized. It's those on the journey &gt;&gt; can be very unstable because they haven't actually made up their mind. They've just gone with the mess and while everyone else is doing it and well my friends and this is no, it's got to be an individual decision. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I'll just drop this in right now. If the if if I cease to be if every preacher or lay minister here ceased to be and the deacons and the tech and the musicians, what would you do? &gt;&gt; Would you just just just just just drift back into the world somewhere? Or would you say no? We need to gather. &gt;&gt; We need to have a place where God comes down and meets our needs, Lord. And and would you pray in such a way till God comes down and speaks like he did in the book of Acts and said, "Sparans to be um Paul and Barnabas for the work &gt;&gt; that they must do." &gt;&gt; Amen. That that that the officers would be replaced by another gift or would you just just float? &gt;&gt; What's holding you? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you haven't made up your decision, I say a church is holding you. But if you have, it's God. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter what happens, you'll be a solid soldout Christian all the days of your life. But if you're just going because I've seen churches fall apart in the past and all the believers leave because the pastor stands up and says he's an atheist. Now, &gt;&gt; what was holding those people? &gt;&gt; Obviously, it wasn't the word. It wasn't Christ. It was maybe the pastor's care and love and personality. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be kept. I trust you're not kept because of me. Yes, &gt;&gt; I would have I'd be the biggest failure in I would die on a bad hill &gt;&gt; if it was me keeping a people. &gt;&gt; Humanity will disappoint you. &gt;&gt; If your if your faith is in me, you've really placed your faith in the wrong thing. But if your faith is in the word, then you'll know that God will use a gift to help your life. Right? But so if your faith is just in man, that man will disappoint you. &gt;&gt; Right? We understand. I trust this is all coming out. Okay? Amen. If someone in the valley of decision is unstable in all their ways. If someone is sold out, they're stable in all their ways. Right? You you'll still have trouble. You'll still have mind battles. You'll still go through many different things. But there's an anchor. There's a rock that you're built upon that you cannot be moved off. Doesn't matter how much the wind blows. Doesn't matter how much floods come. Doesn't matter whatever happens. Like the Lord says, he that builds their house upon the rock. Amen. He's a wise man. He digs down through culture, through human upbringing, through just well, this is how we've always done it. They dug dig through that sand. Amen. Till they hit the rock of revelation. Then they build their life upon that and they're satisfied. And storms come and they go, but their house is still standing. But those who build their house on the moving sands of man's idea, and well, I come to church cuz mom and dad take me to church and I believe this cuz mom and dad believe this and we do this cuz the church does this. That's sand. &gt;&gt; That won't hold you. All those things may be perfectly correct and right, but if it's just if it's just culture or upbringing, then it's just sand. But if you really dig down and say, "I want to know for myself. I want to know Jesus Christ for myself. I'm not I'm not satisfied with a secondhanded decision or a secondhand opinion or just cuz mom and dad, I don't care about them no more for a walk. I want to walk with him myself." Amen. That's when a real man stands up. A real a real adult stands up because they're accountable for their own actions and they say, "Lord, I'm going to walk. I want to walk with you. Doesn't matter what my family does. Doesn't matter what everyone else does. I'm walking with you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's it's a it's a thing, you know. It's like Elijah when he was on Mount Carmel, he asked the question, "How long will you hold between two opinions?" Isn't it a strange thing? On one hand they have a statue Baal done nothing for them. It was enforced by the queen. You have to worship this way. &gt;&gt; On the other hand, they had Jehovah of miracles that brought them out of Egypt that part of the Red Sea that brought the plagues that brought the mana that brought the word. Amen. That gave them the cycle of you know revival when judges came and delivered them and incredible miracles happened. That was that was the track record of the Jehovah of miracles. &gt;&gt; The other guy, he's just a dumb statue, a forced religion by a by a queen who's not even an Israelite, &gt;&gt; Jezebel, right? &gt;&gt; But why on earth would they be between these two opinions? Which one would you rather have? &gt;&gt; You see, obviously they thought Baal had some kind of merit. What did he do for them? &gt;&gt; Nothing. And an idol will give you an unsatisfied, disappointed life. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're following an idol of your heart, you'll never be satisfied with it. Fame, beauty, wealth, power, prestige, job, whatever it is, reputation. If you're trying to, if that thing is your thing, I've got to have the house and I've got to have the trophy wife and I've got to have this and I've got to have that. That's an idol. and you will fall at its feet with disappointment because not a single idol has ever helped anyone, never aided nobody, never given that satisfying portion like our Lord Jesus does. Amen. But if you follow his word, I tell you what, you'll have trouble, but you will not be disappointed. Amen. He will always come on time. He'll always manifest his word. He'll prove himself in his time. You don't need to. You'll never be dis I've never been disappointed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've had times when I don't understand what's going on. &gt;&gt; Right? I've had times saying, "Lord, what are you doing?" But there's I've just come to a place in my life say, "Lord, you're in control. I'm not indifferent. Lord, I'm not become detached. My heart is more in you than ever. I know you're more than able. Lord, I trust you. I've trusted you with my life." Amen. For since 2007. And Lord, I trust you with my life now more than ever. Amen. So, I haven't become, you know, indifferent or detached. I know he's more than able. So, you know, why why not be like that? &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my thing and my life and my problem and my past and all these things. Give it to him. &gt;&gt; We can't sit here being doubleminded thinking the world has anything to offer. Remember, the devil doesn't have the keys to his own house. He has no eternity to give you. Hell is made for the devil and his angels. God made it as a place of destruction for them. and they're going to go there. They're going to burn. They're going to be destroyed. But we there's been a place prepared for you which is a new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Which one would you rather have? It's really your actions are proving which one. If you're in the valley of decision, have it up made up your mind. You're actually I'm going to say it. You're thinking hell's actually has some merit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say it flat. But if you've made up your mind, &gt;&gt; you've realized actually I just have heaven to gain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've got streets of gold to dance upon. I've got an eternal body to enjoy. I'm going to see my Lord Jesus. Amen. I'm going to a place where there's no pain, sorrow, fear, death, whatever. It's all perfect, sublime, beautiful, wonderful. Amen. And because I've made up my mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, but I'm if I'm predestinated, I'll get there. If I'm not predestinated, I won't. That's unbelief talking. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I am predestinated. &gt;&gt; You got to believe that. I am not predestinated to destruction. None of us are. We're predestinated to be overcomers. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now you say, "Lord, take that predestination and manifest it in my life." Amen. Cuz the Bible says, "Whosoever will, let him come." &gt;&gt; And say, "Lord, I've got a willing heart. I'm coming, Lord. I'm your problem. I'm on your hands, Lord. Doesn't matter if you turn me away, Lord, I'm going to be your I'm going to I'm going to annoy you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz I'm on your hands, Lord Jesus. I'm not on my own hands. I'm certainly not on the devils. I'm on your hands, Lord. Amen. He does that. All that comes cast out. He said, &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Amen. So why why why be stuck between two opinions? Why just sit there be part of the group? Why not stand up and you know it's like it's like God would God would speak to Job. God's not afraid to offend anybody. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's not let's not hurt anyone's feelings. No, God says no. He said to Job, Job's gone through his big trial. His friends have come and accused him. He's lost everything but his wife. And you know, he's sitting there with boils on an ash heap. And you know, God comes to him and he just says, "Good up your g up now thy loins like a man. I'm going to talk to you like a man, Job. I'm not talking to you like a jellyfish or some pansy. I'm going to talk to you like a man. Stand up, Job. I'm going to give you an answer. God will always answer you." Amen. But he wants you to stand up and take it cuz he knows what you're made of. He knew Job was a man. He knew he's a perfect man. He said, "Now Job, I'm going to answer you according to who I see you as." &gt;&gt; Amen. So he wasn't like, "Oh, Job, I'm so sorry." And here's a count. I'm not against counseling, but I just wanted to put this out. Yeah, I'm going to give you a therapy course and you know, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to explain. He didn't actually explain it. &gt;&gt; He just told him, "Where were you before the foundation of the world? You were there, Job, with me. That should settle everything, Job." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Get up your loins like a man." Sometimes we need to stop being jellyfish &gt;&gt; and stand up and say, "Hey, where am I with God today? How are you with God? How's your walk?" &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; What's in here? &gt;&gt; Is it culture? message culture. Is it mom and dad or is it well I'm, you know, my children are fourth generation in this message. Praise God for that. &gt;&gt; But they need more than a fourth generation experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. They need a burning bush experience. I don't say they haven't got it, but everyone needs that revival. Everyone needs that awakening. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where it's a personal walk with you and God. Amen. Where you can look on the inside of it's not culture build up. There's a pillar of fire burning flowing out of my soul. Amen. The word put on flesh in me. And even the Philistines talk like this. Be strong and quit yourselves like men. This is when they're going to go fight. I think it's Saul. You know, oh ye Philistines that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews as they have been to you. Quit yourselves like men and fight. This is your enemy talking. He's like, "Come on, man. Let's stand up and fight. Let's not be jellyfish. No, let's fight this thing. We're going to fight to win." You know, the devil fights to win. &gt;&gt; If you read the Bible with a true lenses, he he's going to lose, but he's fighting to win. Why do we fight like we're going to lose, but we actually know we're going to win? &gt;&gt; We should be fighting like we're going to win cuz we are winners. &gt;&gt; You're an overcomer this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm not. And and and God's telling you that. &gt;&gt; I mean, this message has told you you're overcomers. I mean, so why not fight like you've won? &gt;&gt; Have an assurance in your soul. &gt;&gt; Don't be, oh, is it going to what's going to happen? No. Don't walk by sight. Walk by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you've made a decision, you're not walking by sight no more. These things lie to me all the time. I don't walk by my eyes. I walk by revelation. Amen. That God is more than able to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if his enemy said, "Quit yourselves and be like men and fight, why not you and I?" Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see now what happens is if you're between two opinions, it causes am and amnesia and it gets you to a place where actually what you've done, you've lost your reasons. You've lost your you've lost your mind. You don't know who you are. You can't identify yourself. You can walk around and eat everything, but you still just can't identify yourself. So, you can be between two opinions. You can have amnesia. Who am I? But you walk around, you eat everything. &gt;&gt; You enjoy the blessings. You enjoy the atmosphere. You enjoy the fellowship. But you're still in the valley of decision. &gt;&gt; Come out of the valley today. &gt;&gt; Make a decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you'll be able to identify yourself. Amen. You have got your scoly education. Same education you had, but you don't know where it come from. You don't know who you are, where you belong. That's amnesia. So we are told. What's the scoly education I could relate this to? Well, I know every quote from 47 to 65. But you don't know where it came from. It came from Kentucky. It didn't come from Kentucky. Didn't come from Jeff Jeffersonville. No, it's the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. It came from heaven. You should realize, no, this this word came from heaven. Oh, the apostles wrote this and the prophets, this came from heaven. &gt;&gt; Oh, was, you know, was the King James had it translated, the King James Bible, whatever version you use, that's fine. But, you know, no, God inspired that. &gt;&gt; It brought revival. That's how you know God inspired it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, even this, now here's a question. Then Peter said unto them, "Repent, be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, to all that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." That's a decision you've got to make. As many as believe, the Bible says, "Were baptized." If you're a believer, you must get baptized. &gt;&gt; It's the next step of your journey. Why not take the next step, &gt;&gt; right? You say, "Oh, no, but you know, I don't need to do it." Every believer in the book of Acts was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Baptism in the name of father, son, holy ghost is not a baptism. I know we all know this, but Jesus never said in Matthew 28, repeat these words when you immerse someone in water. I baptize you in the name of the father, son, holy ghost. He said, baptize them in the name &gt;&gt; of the father, son, and holy ghost. And the name of the father is Jesus. &gt;&gt; I come in my father's name. He said, right? What is he? He's the Lord Jesus Christ. He said, "Well, a more convenient time." The unic said to Philillip, "Here's water. What does hinder me to be baptized?" Just a few minutes in a chariot reading the scrolls from Isaiah and opening the word. And he realized, "I need to be baptized in the name of the Messiah." So, he said, "Here's water. What's stopping us? &gt;&gt; There's a whole river out here. There's a pool under this pulpit right here. &gt;&gt; What does hinder you?" &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. A better time. I need a better environment. No, now is the good environment. &gt;&gt; Now is the best time. I don't care how cold that river is. I'll always get in there if you want to get baptized. &gt;&gt; It's a cold grave. But if you want if you really want to get baptized, you'll get in there. &gt;&gt; Oh, but you know, I haven't made up my mind yet. Why not make it up? &gt;&gt; Oh, you're putting pressure on me. There'll come a time where you put pressure on yourself. I wish I had Listen. &gt;&gt; I wish I had obeyed. &gt;&gt; Be too late then. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is mean. No, this is love. &gt;&gt; I want this place to be empty the day of the rapture. I want well I pray she comes too but the lady who you know looks after us when we're here you know from this church I pray she's messaging saying where are you we haven't seen you in so long &gt;&gt; and there's no one here and they can't find anyone they can't contact anyone who even is associated with us cuz we're all gone &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh but you know there's a more convenient time. This is a good time. &gt;&gt; This is a very good day. &gt;&gt; If it was bucketing down outside let's get in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let anything like that hinder you. &gt;&gt; Because if it's the word of God to be fulfilled, it's not God stopping you fulfill it. &gt;&gt; It's really that simple. It's like you love your enemy. I can't I can't love that guy. What's stopping you love your enemy? &gt;&gt; It's not God. &gt;&gt; It's the enemy. It's Satan stopping you fulfill the word. See, the devil doesn't care how many services you attend. But when you become part of the word, that's what really bothers him. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like the hund, you know, it's like the apostles, you know, they were with Jesus during his ministry, of course, and there's many times in the Bible where the Pharisees, the scribes, they wanted to stone Jesus, but they didn't, but the disciples were there. Why weren't they wanting to kill the disciples? Because the life of God wasn't in them yet. They were just associated with the Messiah. But then on the day of Pentecost, the same Messiah came and dwelt in them. Then they wanted to stone them and kill them and threaten them and all these things. Why? Cuz the life of because they parttook of the word. &gt;&gt; They became one with the word. And that's why the devil wanted to destroy them. So it's not just hanging around is not good enough. &gt;&gt; You've got to &gt;&gt; become one. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, this is not just for these people. This is for everyone because I'm going to come into some things, right? Even even brother Bram said, "The only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 years old because a spirit hung over me, a devil saying,"Wait a minute. Wait a little longer. That's the reason you wasn't saved and you become the age of accountability. A spirit you got in a crowd that hovered over you, kept hanging over you. You wanted to do right. There's not a man who's got his right mind, but that what wants to do right. But there is something won't let you do it. Is that right? That's the devil. Hallelujah. Christ paid for your healing and your salvation. &gt;&gt; So you got to realize that it's if whatever is hindering you is not you, it's the devil. It's reasoning. &gt;&gt; You got to realize that we say, "Well, I'm going to do the opposite to the reasoning." &gt;&gt; Now, let's just come down to this now. And I'm going to jump around a bit more, but here we are. Now, Joshua would come to the end of his life. Now we know Joshua was with Moses, came out of Egypt, came through the Red Sea, came to Sinai, went through the desert, took the promised land. Now he comes down to the end of his life. And he's giving, you could say, his last sermon. And he says, "Now therefore, fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt, and serve ye the Lord. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom you will serve, whether it be the gods of your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the God of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. Now, I want you to think about this. Isn't this a strange thing for him to say? He's been leading the Israelites all these years. They've been following the Lord, but now he comes to the end and say, "Choose, you make a decision." Haven't they made their decision? The generation that was with Joshua did, but the next generation had to make their own choice. They had to make their decision because the the the people of Israel, they served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel. And also all that generation were gathered into their fathers. And there arose another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which they had um he had done for Israel. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served Balam. Isn't this a strange thing? These are Israelites circumcised sons and daughters of Abraham living in the promised land. But yet they didn't serve the Lord when Joshua and the elders at that generation passed off. And I wonder if that same thing could happen today where those that have a testimony are no longer alive in our midst. I'm just going to This is We're here today. If you're streaming, this is for here. Okay. But I want But what happened is the younger generation, it degraded to a culture. It degraded to an Israelite culture. It wasn't God moving in power proving his word in their lives anymore. That was the older generation. And that human leadership held Israel together. The testimony of Joshua and the elders kept them from serving Balum. And that's powerful. But should it not be the younger generation now have their own revival? Should not they make a decision that I'm going beyond the youth group. I'm going beyond the church. I'm going beyond my parents' expectation and I'm going to have my own revival where God lives in my life like he did the four beers. Amen. where God manifests his power. He proves his word. Where you where the fire of God falls on my life and the word becomes real to me and it becomes everything to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see that? Because brother Johnny Deof said at our first camp. I think it's 2014. He said a very uh a thing that stands quoting to me. He says when human leadership is or is it just you with a religion because you and a religion will end up serving something else and you'll wonder why God isn't moving in power. Where has he gone? It's because you're serving an idol instead of serving the Lord. But this is not meant to be our portion. Even even Israel, let's just let's just go to this here. The people who came out with Joshua that generation out of Egypt, they followed the group, but they were still in the valley of decision all the way through the wilderness because they came to a point if you look at, you know, if you look at the wilderness journey, they go from yay to ah moments like, "Yay, the Lord's delivered us. Praise the Lord. The Red Sea's open. Hallelujah." And then they're complaining the next minute. And then God and then you know they have no water and God takes them to water. They complain about the water and then they're hungry and God sends mana and they're yay there's food. Then they become dissatisfied with the food. It's all very reactionary. People who are in the valley of decision just react to things. They're always reacting. Yay we've got quail. I'm sick of quail. Yay we've got mana. I'm sick of mana. Yay we're here. I hate being here. I want to go back to Egypt. Why? Because they're still in the valley of decision. Isn't it amazing? They're basically saying, you know, I want to go back to Egypt where our children are all massacred, where we're slaves, where we're not even a human, our names don't matter. I want to go back to that. That's what they were saying. &gt;&gt; Cuz they thought being in Egypt had some kind of merit. They weren't free. They couldn't walk with God. All they could do is complain about the economic problems. &gt;&gt; That's that's someone in the valley of decision. Who cares if you got money or not? That's right. &gt;&gt; Our God supplies all our needs. &gt;&gt; Oh, things are tight. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Things are bountiful. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I'm busy. Praise God. I'm not busy. Praise God. Don't complain. That's a valley of decision mentality. It's all reactive. No, but if you make up your mind, like Caleb, Caleb and Joshua when they went through the land to spy it out, they weren't making up their mind. &gt;&gt; They weren't in the valley of decision. And the other 10 spies were walking through saying, you know, they're weighing up all the odds. Yes, this is ours, but look at the giants. Yes, this is our land, and look what it does, but look at the cities. They're weighing up in their minds, they had not made a clear-cut decision. Though they all had been baptized in the Red Sea unto Moses, though they had been sanctified in the wilderness, so they were they had more than just made a decision like a give your life to the Lord decision. They were walking with God with the pillar of fire, but yet they were still they were just feeding off the blessings as opposed to becoming one with the word they meant to fulfill. But Caleb and Joshua, they weren't they weren't making up their mind. Caleb. Yes, Joshua. Tomorrow, we're going to go spy the land out. &gt;&gt; It's going to be good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're going to see where we're going to live. &gt;&gt; Hey, Joshua. Yes, Caleb. I believe when go when when I see my inheritance, God's going to quicken it to me. &gt;&gt; I believe with you, Joshua. I mean, I believe with you, Caleb. Hallelujah. Let's go see what God's given. &gt;&gt; Amen. He brought us thus far. We made a decision. We're going all the way. &gt;&gt; Absolutely, Joshua. It's not even in my mind to quit. &gt;&gt; We don't quit. We made it made up our mind. We're going into the land. It's our land. Doesn't matter what obstacles are there. We're going in. The other spies. I wonder if we can do it. I wonder if we can. Do you think their cities are that big? Do you think we can? you know, yeah, I know he brought us out of Egypt, but you know, church is a bit hard recently and you know, there's trouble and there's things and can we really take these promises and you know, I heard someone else who went to the land and said it's theirs, but they just they just came in defeat and all these things. And that's someone in the valley of decision. &gt;&gt; And that's what they did. They came back cuz their minds weren't made up. Their heart wasn't set on the word. And what they do? They came back and they said, "Yes, the land is good, but there's giants, all these things. We can't take it." Why? Cuz they were in the valley of decision. Yet they walked with the Lord for 40 years. &gt;&gt; I pray none of us are in that condition. I think I've got everyone's attention just now, &gt;&gt; right? As I said, this is for all of us. Have we actually made up our mind like Caleb? See, because Caleb still the people for Moses. Let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it. Amen. That's someone who's made up their mind. No, the Lord is on my side. I'm God has made a covenant with me by his own blood. I'm his child. every divine promise he died for is mine. We're more than able to overcome every devil. I mean, every cultural problem, every every family trait, we're more than able to overcome all things. Amen. Let's go in and take it at once. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, this is God testifying. He didn't have the spirit of the valley of decision. He had the spirit of God with him. That was the other spirit. And followed me fully. See, he wasn't just weighing up and he wasn't looking for a way out. He wasn't looking for a convenient time to disappear. Now he's like, I'm sold out. Where the pillar of fire leads, I'm following. Wherever that is, down through valleys, praise God. Up high mountains, praise God. Through bri patches, through the water, through the fire, through the flood, through trouble, strife, anguish, unanswered prayer, it seems to be sickness, sorrow, pain. I'm going all the way. &gt;&gt; That was Caleb. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. This this this valley of um just trying to see where we can my notes are never in order now. This valley of Jehoshaphat Mr. Google tells me this is a valley mentioned in the Bible specifically in the book of Joel where it is prophesied that God will gather all nations for judgment. And I've shown you they're there before this judgment because the Lord is near. The day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision, right? And God will gather all nations. It's located east of Jerusalem between the city and the Mount of Olives. While the exact geographical locations is debated, it's often identified as the Kidedron Valley. Amen. The name Jehoshaphat itself means Jehovah has judged. Now this Kidron Valley, it's just east of Jerusalem. There's a lot of wonderful things have happened in the Kidron Valley. Amen. So in the Kidron Valley, Amen, is where idols were smashed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where idolatry, where the temple was purged and you know, idols were were were destroyed. Amen. in the you know king king um you know when Assa became king he removed his mother as queen destroyed the idols all these things and what did he do he stamped it and burnt it at the brook kiddron amen this is in the valley of decision see when you make a clear-cut decision all the idols have to go it doesn't matter if it's a family heirloom of strife or temper or lust or or debate or or stiff neckness or indifference that thing's going down &gt;&gt; amen and king Josiah brought out of the grove of the house of the Lord unto Jerusalem unto the book brook brook kiddron and burnt it at the brook kiddron and stamped it small to powder and cast the powder of upon the graves of the children of the people. So um um Josiah was you know uh he was 7 years old when he became king and his I think his grandmother Ailia um you know she was ruling she was the daughter of Jezebel she was ruling in Jerusalem but then but then Josiah was raised in secret because um Ailia wanted to kill all the royal seed but he was hidden when he became um seven he was made king and she was taken out by the horse gate and killed &gt;&gt; that gate points to the valley of Kidron. &gt;&gt; Amen. So a religious Jezebel spirit gets killed there too. Amen. So all these things got destroyed. In the valley of Kron is the garden of Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; So in the garden of Gethsemane is where is where betrayal was manifested. Where Judas betrayed Jesus was manifested in the garden of Gethsemane in this valley of decision. He had made up his mind. I'm going to betray the word for a material gain. &gt;&gt; But then something else happened and I pray I can come around this. Okay. But this is how you get out of the valley. Because in the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus was in the valley of decision. He was there in the valley because he had to make up his mind. Will he become what he's ordained to be as the lamb of God? Will he fulfill the prophecy concerning himself? Will he do it? &gt;&gt; Amen. As he was in the valley there, agonizing there in the garden, sweat, so much agony in his body that drops of blood like sweat came down his brow. And he is weighing this up because he knew what he had to fulfill. He wasn't walking blindly to Calvary. He knew what he had to do and what would what he would face. Amen. But he was in the valley of decision and heaven was waiting for a reply. And then the reply came back. Lord, if it be thy will, take this cup. If it's possible, take this cup from me. Never lest not my will, but thy will be done. Amen. And that decision brought him out of the valley. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's how and what was it? It was a death to self. Amen. And it wasn't a well you know you know it wasn't just some indifferent thing. He knew the magnitude of his decision. Amen. But he said but the Bible says with joy &gt;&gt; the joy set before him. Amen. So he's in the valley decision weighing up the cost that it would be upon himself. But he looked beyond the cost. He saw you and I redeemed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's a death to self takes you out of the valley of decision. Amen. That's the only thing that will take you out. Not just a well I'm going to turn over a new leaf. No, you're still in the valley of decision. It's a death to self. You've got to sell out lock, stock, and barrel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to make up your mind. That's how you get out of the valley. Amen. Sham Shamgal was in the valley of decision year after year. Philistines would come steal his crop. He didn't do anything about it. He would raise some wheat. They'd come in, they'd take it season after season. But he was in the valley of decision. He was of two minds. He he he received he had amnesia and he's just thinking, well, I've just got to survive and this is just how life is going to be. He was double-minded. I'm a son of Abraham, but there's the Philistines. I'm a son of Abraham, but there's the Philistines. But one day, when the crop, the harvest had come in and he heard the stomping of the boots down the road. 600 Philistines were coming to get his harvest. Amen. He looked he looked at his wife and she was half emaciated and his children, you know, raggedy and rag, you know, skin and bone, all these things. And something rose up in him. He said, "I'm going to stand up like a man. &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with this." Amen. I'm going to come out of this valley of decision. I'm not going to be indifferent anymore and care about preserving my own skin. If I die fighting, I die fighting. Amen. But I am anointed to win because I'm a son of Abraham. Amen. So, he picked up his ox code. Amen. And brother Ram said he realized he was a son of Abraham and that made all the difference. He realized what he already was. Amen. And he came out of the valley of decision. He killed all 600 Philistines. Amen. And a revival broke out. Amen. Because the blessings he received of that harvest weren't given to the enemy. No, his family could enjoy it all. Amen. Why? Because he came out of the valley of decision. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Daniel and Daniel and his friends, what's happened here? They were that age when they went to Babylon. They decided before they left, I'm going to serve God. I'm going to what if there's there was no church there. &gt;&gt; There's no minister there. There's no temple there. There weren't mom and dad there. It was them. &gt;&gt; And they didn't walk like jellyfish saying, "Poor me and I'm just a I'm just a victim of circumstance." They said, "No, we're going to be Christians." I'll put it that way. In Babylon, they got out of the valley of decision. They made a choice. If they can do it, you think about this. They didn't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They didn't have the blood of Jesus Christ. They didn't have all the mysteries revealed, right? &gt;&gt; They did not have what we have right now. And yet, they could stand and say, "This is me. What whatever happens because of my decision, &gt;&gt; I made up my mind. They didn't know they'd be maybe thrown to a, you know, Daniel into the lion's den, the other three before the, you know, into the fiery furnace and all these things they had to face. But they made up their mind. &gt;&gt; I'm a believer. This is who I am. It's not, it's more than what I do. It's who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what did they do when the king tried to bring his food to them? They said, "No, we're not going to eat of the king's table." There's pressure there, man. They did not have some personal improvement plan they had to go through if they weren't doing their job. They got killed, &gt;&gt; right? They didn't have a, you know, they didn't have what we have if you're not doing what you meant to do. No, they just got axed. Out you go. Let's get someone else. But they stood because of that decision. &gt;&gt; I pray that we are the same way today. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we're not just reacting and poor me and this is this and this is this. Friends, if you're if jealousy rules your life, you're in the valley of decision. If you are if if you get offended when other people do better than you, you're in the valley of decision. Amen. Because you if you've given your life to the Lord, then you know your walk is personal. Your walk is not comparable to anyone else because God has ordained your footsteps. Amen. That whatever you go through is for you. It's not for anyone else. Right? It may affect other people by how you conduct yourself through the trial. Brother Ram said that we should conduct ourselves like sons and daughters of God in every trial. But how do you conduct yourself like that? Yeah, it's hard, but God's good. &gt;&gt; I'm being carried by him. &gt;&gt; How are you going? I don't know, but he's carrying me. Amen. I'm going through the trial. I'm going to come out the other side. God is working in this trial. Praise God. It's all for my good. Amen. God is using every moment and I'm savoring it. and I've decided I'm going to count it all joy cuz I've made a decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you're in the valley of decision, you look at, oh, this is happening and then this is happening. This is and we walk according to those things. &gt;&gt; But if you're sold out, you're sold out. Oh, your life is turned upside down. God allowed it. It's working for my good. He's not angry with me. He loves me. God's molding me. Praise the Lord. Don't you like the molding? &gt;&gt; Thank God for those deserts of experience, Brother Bram says, where men and women are molded into saints. &gt;&gt; Thank God for those moments. Thank God for the breaking. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the bruising. Thank God for the crushing. Like Jesus was the rose of Sharon, right? How do you get the perfume out of those pedals? It's got to be crushed. Amen. So, he had to go through a crushing for that life to be expressed. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We got to look beyond our circumstances, what we're going through. We really got to look beyond it. Those in the wilderness were just looking at sand and scorpions and manner and things around them. Caleb and Joshua looking to the end &gt;&gt; cuz they made a decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just going to read a couple of quotes, then we're going to wind this up. Every generation must have its own revival. Every generation has its own chance at the word. Every generation. This message is not just for old people and parents. It's for the young. It's for the teenager. I tell William, William, you're about the same age God started talking to Samuel at. You're that age. God is not You're never too young for God to speak. Amen. You're never too young for God to use you. I remember Lilia here was 18 months old, couldn't even really talk. And Corbus and Ha were here, Arman's parents, and he was battling and he was fighting cuz he was in the valley of decision. Do I keep with religion that's made me miserable or do I accept the word? He was in this valley and God was calling him. Come out of the valley and he's like, "Where's that phone that you can just pick up and talk to God? People say God talks and he never talks to me." And he was talking the whole time and God was dealing. And then we were there the last night that um you know they were there in New Zealand. They're going to fly out the next morning and decides to get baptized and he says flat. I'm not getting baptized. &gt;&gt; But God had other ideas. God would take a 18-month old girl, pick her up, get her to come stand before me as I'm reading Romans chapter 6. I still remember it to this day. I'm stand there by the couch. I'm reading Romans chapter 6. Before we baptize her in the bathtub, I see this little lilia come up and start pointing to the Bible. They have no idea what she's doing. Then she go and because Corbus is trying to get her to come sit and be still and sit down with him, but she just wouldn't. She came was pointing at the Bible, looked at him, pointed at the Bible, and then went and picked up a little mask and gave it to him. Then he broke down. He said, "God's just spoken to me through through through this little lilia here, saying, "Listen to the word and take off your religious mask." Amen. He got baptized. He came out of that water, raised his hands. Probably never done it in his life. Amen. A changed man. Why? Cuz he came out of the valley of decision. Amen. So it wasn't so what doesn't matter what he was raised in. when he saw the word, he had to make his mind up. Amen. And God used an 18-month old girl. So, we're never too young. &gt;&gt; We're never too old. Every generation must have its own revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're we're we go beyond just we go beyond just, you know, well, we're in the message. What does that even mean? If you're in the message, you you're in Christ. That's truly being in the message. If you're in the message, what that really means is that the pillar of fire, God himself, dwells in you. If he's not in you, you're not in the message. You're just gathered around it. Amen. He says this here. Now, I'm just going to read this. He says, he says here, there's a cycle. There's always a cycle of revival and death. Amen. It's like, it says to the saints of Ephesus alone that um he says, now you have left your first love. To understand this, you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of Ephesus alone, but this message is to the entire age, which lasted about 120 years. Its message then is to all the generations in that span. Now history keeps repeating itself. In the generation of Israel, we see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next. In the third generation, embers may be glowing slightly, but in the fourth, there may be no vestage whatsoever of that original flame. Then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated. It is simply the manifestation of truth that God has no grandchildren. Amen. And you can be a grandparent and yet not have a revival. But God wants to restore it. God wants to give it. Amen. We got to get out of the valley of decision and say, "Well, I'm in church and I'm doing well." It's good to be in church. Come to church, whatever you do. But don't think that coming to church saves you. You must know him. Amen. You must have your own personal revival. But the only way to do it, friends, is come out of the valley of decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come out of the valley of decision like Jesus did. You got to die out to all those things. What's holding you back? Should be nothing. But your life is telling you what's holding you back. Oh, another day, another Sunday, another moment. What about today? I've always been this way. You need a change. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I had a joyouish time 10 years ago. What about now? What is your life producing now? I know this. I'm I'm talking to me, too. Have we just got to a place where we just go through the motions? &gt;&gt; Or are we rejoicing in the goodness and mercy and love of God? Are we thankful that he saved us? Are we thankful that he found us? We're so glad we said, "Lord, I'm so glad, Lord, when I surrender my whole being into your hands or has it just become some common callous thing and it's just critical and there's trouble and all you see is the problems." Come out of the valley. &gt;&gt; Come into the promised land. Come into Christ. Amen. Because if you look at a valley, I don't live in a valley. I live on the mountaintop. Now, if you live on the valley naturally now, that's fine. Okay? But I like being on the mountain. I like being on the mountain. Amen. Look at down those valleys. Gloomy shadows, damp, cold, fog. Why not be where the air is clear? The sunshine is striking your glorious face. Amen. This sen, the sunlight of God is striking. You feel its warmth. You feel its lifegiving flow of the word. I mean, you're not down in the valley where it's dark and dismal and damp and moss and all that stuff. No, you're standing on the mountain. &gt;&gt; Come out of the valley today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come out of the valley. Well, I've been raised in this church. I've been raised in this church. Come out of the valley. &gt;&gt; Sell out &gt;&gt; whatever you do &gt;&gt; and come up on the mountain. The air is good up there. &gt;&gt; It's full of joy. &gt;&gt; It's full of peace. It's a It's a bubbling fountain. You I was talking to William. We're driving. I was talking about, you know, Moses, you know, speaking to the rock and the and the water came out of the rock. And I was just imagining this big massive gusher because it it it it watered two million people and their animals. Wasn't this little trickle that came out this nice tranquil pull? That thing would have been a big gusher shooting up. It be such a pressure behind it. I mean, it would have flooded the whole place. They would have been drinking. Why? Because I say that's what happens when you make up your mind and you sell out to God. Amen. What? He becomes an inexhaustible fountain that's bubbling out of your life continually. I mean, you don't have to pump it, prime it. It's just pushing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, why not come out the valley this morning? &gt;&gt; Let's have the musicians, please. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have the musicians. I just want to leave that there. Isn't it a great view? &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful? Who's ever who's come out of the valley? who's decided to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; The valley's &gt;&gt; the mountaintop is great. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's stand. [Music] I want to sing that song all the way. I'm going all the way. I'm going all the way with the Lord. I pray this morning this is more than a song. But it's a reality. And if you haven't, it's like the Bible says as many as believe were baptized. What hinders? Oh, my dad or my mom or No, it's you and God. When I stand there on that day, it's not me and my family. It's not even me and you as an it's me and as an individual before God. And I will give account for what I did. And the excuses of peers and family and things, they won't stand. It's you and God. It's your salvation. It's your soul. It's your eternal destination. It's you. So why not when we sing this in your heart say, "Lord, I'm going all the way. &gt;&gt; If I've got to be baptized, Lord, I'll get baptized. I'll give my life. Lord, I'll get baptized. Lord, if I've got to if I got to die out to this jealous, indifferent spirit, this this this complaining, whatever it is, I want it gone, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be in the desert. I don't want to be complaining like the children of Israel. I want to be on the mountain in the promised land. Amen. Rejoicing in the goodness and reality of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's sing this as a declaration this morning. Amen. All the way. I'm going all the way. All the way. I'm going all the way. All the way. I'm going all the way. I'm going all the way with the Lord. Let's sing that again, shall we? Oh, all the way. I'm going all the way. All the way. I'm going all the way. All the way. I'm going all the way. I'm going all the way with the Lord. I made my decision. I'm going all the way. I'll make my choice. I'm going all the way. I'll make my decision. I'm going all the way. I'm going all the way with the Lord. [Music] No turning back. I'm going all the way. No turning back. I'm going all the way. No turning back. back. I'm going all the way. I'm going all the way with the Lord. [Music] I've drawn the line. Have you drawn the line? I'm going all the way. No turning back. I'm going all the way. I've drawn the line. I'm going all the way. I'm going all the way with the Lord. Let's go to verse two. Have you made your decision, friends? I'll make my decision. I'm going all the way. I'll make my choice. I'm going all the way. I'll make my decision. I'm going all the way. I'm going all the way with the Lord. I mean just softly. All the way I'm going all the way. All the way I'm going all the way. All the way. I'm going all the way. I'm going all the way with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Just want to ask you a question. If you want prayer, you're more than welcome to come forward. But have you really have you really made your choice? Have you really decided or are you in the valley of decision saying, "Well, I'll just hang around church. It seems all fine. I don't really need to step out and walk with the Lord. What choice have you made? I pray today that your choice is Lord, all I am is yours. My life is in your hands. Lord, take all of me, oh God. Hallelujah. If you want to be remembered in prayer, just want to slip up your hands, say, "Lord, remember me, Lord Jesus." We just open our hearts to him. Let's just talk to him together. Gracious heavenly father, as we raise our hands, Lord, I've raised both of mine. You see the hands that have been raised, dear God. Father, I just want to commit everyone into your hands. Lord, I believe I've delivered what you've placed on my heart today as you said that it's in this day multitudes are in the valley of decision. God, may none of us stay in the valley. Lord Jesus, forbid it, Lord, that any of us would stay in that valley between two minds, two opinions, two things which we think is right, dear God. Father, there's only one thing that's right, Lord. There's only one way. You are the way, the truth, and the life. So, dear God, I pray, Father, would we, Lord, that we would realize, Lord, if there's something hindering us, may we realize what it is, Lord. It's the enemy trying to stop us from selling out, giving our lives, being baptized in your name, laying aside every weight and sin and walking with you, dear God. I pray, Father, none of us would be in the valley, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name, I commit each one into your hands. Father, for your glory, have your way. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's sing that song. I got my mind made up and I won't turn back. I want to see my Jesus someday. Amen. I trust this is how you feel in your heart. Amen.

But you know there's always transitions in life. Some are easy, some are not easy. But the thing is the main thing is we're in Christ. That is the main thing. That's really the only thing that matters. And thanks be to God we can say you're in the Lord. Okay. So let's let's bow bow our heads and our hearts and let's commit them into your hand. Commit the Shurig family. Gracious father how glad we are. Lord, we are so thankful for what you have done. Lord, truly, they are trophies of your amazing grace. Lord, when they left South Africa, they had no idea what awaited them on the side. But you ordained their steps, my God. You caused them to come of all places to Wellington, Lord. Of all places to Stokes Valley, Lord, of all places, Lord. You planted them there, dear God, because you had a divine appointment with their lives, Lord. That they would never be the same, Father. They came in more in contact more than just with a church, &gt;&gt; or even just more in contact with a more than a prophet, my God. But Lord, they've come in contact with your mighty God, the voice behind the voice. So, Father, I pray, dear God, as they uh this is their last Sunday together, we just want to pray their your richest blessings upon their lives. Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, may they just continue to love you. &gt;&gt; Lord, may they never let a negative thought, nothing negative come into their hearts, dear God. Lord, you know what they're going to face up in fun. Dear God, you know all about it, Lord. You have been in their future, Lord. As brother Isaac preached many years ago now. Lord, you've been in our future. You know about it, dear God. So, I pray, Father, may you continue to lead them, continue to guide them. Father, may it be you and you alone leading them. And may they continue to be the Stuig family, Lord. May they be them, Lord. May they be you. &gt;&gt; May May they be them and you, dear God. Father, how you built them, Father. May they not try and be like anyone else. And Father, may you shine through them, Lord, like only you can. The unique way you've built them, Father. Dear God, may you touch many lives up there, wherever you'd have them go, Father. Lord, may they continue to be the salt of the earth. Father, full of love and joy and thanksgiving and thankfulness, Father. May you grant it in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray, Father, for this next season, Lord, as brother Aman goes up and he's looking for a house and there's all the schools and different things, Lord God, these logistics, but we thank you, Lord, that you already know, Lord Jesus, you know the right spots, Father. So, Lord, I just want to commit them into your hands. May this transition be smooth, Lord. It'll be very sad to see them eventually all go. But, Father, we just want to send them under your anointing, Lord, under the shadow of your great wings, dear God. May they continue to walk in victory. Father, we commit them into your hands. We thank you for their lives, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Brother Arman, do you have a song that we're going to sing? It's bubbling. So, let's sing in in in honor of them. It's bubbling. And then and then we'll be dismissed. You want to stand? If you need some room probably to sing this, &gt;&gt; you need space. Amen. Amen. Well, it's bubbling. It's bubbling. It's bubbling in my soul with singing and laughing. Since Jesus made me whole. Some folks don't understand it. How can I keep it quiet? It's a bubbling, a bubbling, a bubbling, a bubbling, a bubbling day and night. It's bubbling. It's bubbling. It's bubbling in my soul. We're singing and laughing. Since Jesus made me whole. Some folks don't understand it. How can I keep it quiet? It's bubbling a bubbling a bubbling a bubbling bubbling day. And not now, sisters. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Okay, brothers. It's lovely. It's lovely.

You're dismissed in Jesus Christ's name. Take the love of the Lord with you. Oh, just before everyone goes, I think Hannah asked if she could do a special. will have a cushion by then. So, I wrote the song um I finished it last night, but I started writing it um in February. So, in February when it was summertime, I'd go on walks in the morning. And one morning I was walking back and it was early and I saw the sunrise above the hills and I looked out and then a line came to me and and the line said, "I'm a wash with your mercy in the morning." And I thought, "Oh, I really like that line. I'm going to make a song." And I didn't the line didn't make it to the song, but it definitely inspired it. And so after I got home, I started looking up. I'm not a musician. I can't really play or do anything out of the ordinary. I can't write songs like that. I can't play the piano like some people. But I just really like this thought of there being something something special in the morning. So I got home and I started looking at all the scriptures and I've been reading a lot of Psalms. And David really likes mentioning the morning in his Psalms. So I started looking into David's story and something that David went through caught my eye. So when him and Ba Sheba had their she was in travail with their first child, the child of their adultery. And the scripture says that David fasted and he lay upon the ground all night. And then in the morning, you know, the servants were scared to tell him that his son had died, but he heard them whispering. And then he got up and he said, "Is it as he did?" And they said, "Yes." And then he got up, he washed himself, he anointed himself, he got new clothes, and he moved on. And I don't know why I'm shaking cuz I know you guys pretty well. But I just thought, you know, I quite like that story. I like how David, even though he went through something really terrible and he had a such a big mistake in his life and he went through so much suffering because of it, he was able to come through the other side and he was clean. So I wrote a song called In the Morning and I haven't practiced it cuz I finished it last night, but I set I set myself a deadline last night. I thought it'd be cool to sing it before the Stuigs go, but I didn't know when the Stuigs were going. So, when I got here this morning and they were like, "This is the Stuigs last Sunday." I thought, "Oh, I better sing it quick." So, now I'm here and I'm going to try and sing it for you guys. Even though I hope you'll have a lot of pity on me. I haven't practiced it like in full before. Okay. So, we'll see how it goes. [Music] They say you're safe. They say you heal. They call you great, the God of grace. So I will call. Sorry guys, let me restart. [Music] Say you save. Say you heal. They call you great. The God of grace. [Music] So I will call upon the name, the one that's raised above my shame. And it's so dark and I can't see you. Will you hear my prayer? I'm so nervous. Can I redo that, please? &gt;&gt; I'm so sorry. [Music] They say you save. They say you heal. They call you great. The God of grace. So I will call on the name the name that's raised above my shame and is so dark and I can't see you but will you hear my prayer in the morning Lord and will you hear my cries as they arise in the morning And will you see my hands raised against the canvas of the dawning sky? And will you come with the morning line? They say to pray, to call out in faith. They say to shout the loudest praise. that I'll just speak. The sinners plead. Forgive my grief. You're all I need. But it's so dark and I can't see you. Will you hear my prayer in the morning, Lord? And will you hear my cries as they arise in the morning? And will you see my hands raised against the canvas of the dawning sky? And will you come with the morning? Will you hear my prayer in the morning, Lord? Will you hear my cries as they arise in the morning light? And will you see my hands raised against the canvas of the dawning sky and will you come with the morning light? So arise, be washed, be anointed by the Lord. My hands are clean, my praises have been heard. Arise, be washed, be anointed by the Lord. My hands are clean, my praises have been heard. [Music] You have heard my prayers in the morning, Lord. You have heavens [Music] at last. You're reaching with the sky. And will you come with the morning light? [Applause] Praise the Lord. You're dismissed in Jesus name this afternoon. &gt;&gt; Thanks Hannah. That was really good. Who told the sun where to stand in the morning? Who told the ocean you can only come this far? And who told the moon where to hide till evening? Whose words alone can catch a falling star? Well, I know my redeemer lives. I know my redeemer lives. Let all creation testify. Let this life within me cry. I know my redeemer lives. very same God that spit runs to the weary one and the weak and the same gentle hands help me when I'm broken they conquer death to bring me victory Glory. Well, I know my redeemer live. [Applause] I know my redeemer live. [Music] Oh, let all creation testify. Let this life within me cry. I know my redeemer. He lives to take away my shame. And he lives forever. I'll proclaim that the payment for my sin was a precious life he gave. But now he's alive and there's an empty grave. Well, I know my redeemer lives. I know my redeemer lives. All creation [Music] I know my redeemer. Well, I know my redeemer lives. I know my redeemer lives. Oh, let all creation testify. [Music] In me cry, I know my redeemer here. [Music]
