========================================

[Music] god bless you Saints welcome to the house of the Lord what a week a weekend maybe but I've saw testimony before we start you know in the Lord gives you a promise and the devil tries to steal it from you you got pretty much a fight on your hands Lee and brother Isaac preached on negotiation - how do we negotiate with the devil and and bit of a testimony and I thought I just felt led to share it with you guys we had a bit of news come away and was good news and halfway through the trial didn't basically or beginning of the trial the doctor says it's not such may be such good news you know like they're going I can maybe say if I'm allowed to share it so we found out that sister Chantal and I was expecting another little one and so what happened is halfway through it she got really bad stomach pains real real bad stomach pains and she wasn't feeling too well we had to go to the doctor and they were all saying oh it's gonna be a miscarriage maybe you and all those possibilities of what it could be and this was the Friday when we went to the doctor what's the fried it wasn't it and of course y'all stressed out because it's all new stuff again and I just kept saying if the Lord's given the child then the Lord will bring it to pass because it's from the Lord which we prayed it in according to his world so I said so I'll just state was the word of the Lord and I won't believe the report of the doctors though you still in the back of your mind you fight these mind battles what if what if and all those things but you still have a choice to choose the Word of God and the promises of God above anything else and there's so suddenly when we came in we have this sermon called negotiation and how much of that pie do you want to give away and thank you brother Isaac God bless you fall for all the the labor that you put into your sermons as well because pretty much most of them are for me and and I was sitting at the back and I just decided yes how much of this do we give to Satan and how much do we give to God if everything belongs to God then all just let him fight the battle and I'll just give everything to him because it's a win-win I can't lose if he takes away I can't lose if he gives I can't lose it's still his walk and there so the Monday we went back and we win for some scans and the doctor said everything is fine there's just a couple of things that should still heal and stuff but everything is fine and praise the Lord there is a heartbeat and everything so yeah raise the Lord so yeah what do you believe so let's just all stand up and I

Here I am okay yes we're gonna have lunch after service let's go to Isaiah 14 and who loves the Lord tonight a man who's happy to be a Christian amen you know you you use more muscles in your face frowning than smiling so you use less muscles and smile it'll do you good amen Isaiah 14 and 11 we're gonna read I don't have a slideshow or any such thing but let's go from Isaiah 14 verse 11 it says thy pomp has brought down to the grave and the noise of thy vials the worm has spread under thee and the worms cover thee how thou art fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which to this week in the nation's for thou hast said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven I shall exalt my throne above the stars I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation and the sides of the north I will ascend above the height of the clouds I will be like the Most High that's a lot of i wills isn't it yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee can you turn me down a little bit saying this is as this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners let's go to Luke chapter 18 and we're going to read from verse 9 down to verse 14 of Luke 18 this may seem rather unusual scriptures but here we are Luke 18 and verse 9 and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that were righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray one a Pharisee and the other Republican the Pharisee stood and prayed thus within himself god I think neither that I am NOT as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican I fast twice in a week I give tithes of all that I possess and the publican standing afar off would not lift so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalted himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted I mean this bow heads for a word of Prayer gracious Lord Jesus we truly are amazed that you love us law we want to thank you Lord your love is not like human love it goes beyond and gracious father we want to thank you we can gather on this cold night Lord in your house and Lord we just pray that you'll anoint your word - Lord anoint speaker and hear one more time and not your word - every one of us dear God I pray that Lord as you said in your word that your word will not return unto the void but will it but it will accomplish that which you've sent it to do so father I pray your word would accomplish this night what you've sent it to do and dear God we just ask father you'll just touch each one here Lord those who are sick and body those may be the troubled in spirit Lord I pray you would heal them father be at those who maybe are watching by the way of the internet dear God and I just ask father that you'd have preeminence Lord in our lives not just here in these four walls but Lord when the Lord when we leave this place may have preeminence in every life for your glory we want to commit the service into your hands we thank you in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats tonight so what do I want to speak I want to speak about self will worship now we we read here about about Lucifer and it's amazing where you know here here he was and in his great splendor and you know we would read if maybe you want to maybe go to the Book of Ezekiel but you know we were going to turn there soon but you see how he he had this ambition that he wanted to ascend and to heaven you know he wanted to be like the Most High one to exalt him yo whose throne above you the stars of God and and we understand that be but the end of his his plans that he'll come to ruin now this met these two men we read about here in Luke 18 now you may think that these are two very different type of scripture but I'd like to speak on the subject of of self-will worship and I want to show you that what started in the heart of Lucifer ends up in man and and the the ambition that Lucifer had and then his heart that eat that he had that finally there come to a point where iniquity was found in him we that that is born in every man whether he liked it or not so you know we understand from the scripture that sin did not start on upon the earth but it started in heaven as it says in Revelations 12 that there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not I like those words and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with them so soon began in heaven and we know that it didn't just start in any place in heaven but it started in the heart of Lucifer that's where Sun began I mean he may never have I don't know time I know time was there but you know you could say there came a time where he began to think about himself above what God made him to be and you know I'm so glad that the Word of God reveals the enemy's heart so we know what he's thinking we know what is the gender is we're not ignorant to his devices so you know we do not know how long Lucifer you know when he was created as the anointed cherub that covereth you know we do not know how long he really maintained that position that God made him to be we do not know how long he was there and he actually you know worship God according as God has made him and we do not know how long it took until finally iniquity was found in his heart we do not know these things but the thing we do know is that he began to look he has his focus went upon what God made him to be to himself and this is where Nick what he started when he wasn't looking at what God made him to be he began to look at how great he thought he was and this is where iniquity started when your eyes go off the Lord and go upon you you have the same heart Lucifer hairs amen now and then and then we know that there came a time where he began to look at himself and nicker he was found in his heart then he began to influence angels to leave their original estate as well of of you know their function of worshiping the Lord or whatever they are called to do in heaven and you know and and there came a time when Lucifer he did not begin to worship God out of a pure heart but he began to look how great he was instead of looking how great God is and we read here as I said turning to Ezekiel 28 we can read this if you want to follow with me this is very important because we will man worships their situation they they worship their own poor Me's they worship their pity parties and what's happened the same heart that was in Lucifer's and in that person and we don't want to get into that as that that state of being because as you take the two in the temple one was worshiping God out of a pure heart forgive me Lord I'm a sinner the other one was worshiping God out of a complex or a pain or whatever I was saying Lord I'm happy I'm not like this guy and who was received the Pharisee wasn't received he was a Pharisee you see Pharisees aren't received but a pure heart is received by God and we don't want to worship God will be believers based on what people have done to us what other people are doing that's irrelevant we want to worship God because He is God I mean in our whole lives don't wanna be based on some conflicts or pain or something from our past our whole lives when we based on here's God that's where I'm going if you're earning where are you going with this that's where I'm going so I'll just color in until we get to that point all right so zekiel 28 and 12 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and we know that this is actually speaking of the anointing that was upon that King and say unto Him thus saith the Lord God still thou seal us up the sum full of wisdom perfect and beauty thou has been in the garden of God every precious stone was like covering the sadhus the Topaz and the diamond the Beryl the ox and the Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle the gold the workmanship of our tablets and of our pipes was prepared in the in the day that that was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth I have set thee so that was upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in my ways from the day that that was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have they have filled the mists of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God I will destroy thee Oh cover antara from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted by wisdom by reason of our brightness I will kasi to the ground our lady before Kings that they may behold thee see see his heart was lifted up because he began to look how great he was I mean that's why iniquity he was perfect in all his ways in his ways until iniquity was found in him why because he began to look at how great he was more than how great God is amen so this is why his heart was lifted up it wasn't lifted up because of something around him because who he was his heart was lifted up and it's the same thing can happen with us because we know that that same nature was injected into the human race by the original sin whether we like it or not now see if we look at this great being his heart was lifted up because of his own beauty and because of his own beauty his heart was lifted up then he began to have ambition and sidon began with two words maybe in his heart I will now when you say you will instead of God will all thy will be done Jesus and the model prayer thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven what on earth does he really talk about to me thing about this earth this living earth may your will be expressed in this as it is in heaven see that was the model prayer that God yo yo that Jesus gave us disciples that we would call Lord your will not my so as soon as we say I will out of our own humanity that's Antichrist that's an antichrist spirit right there because anything that's anti god is Antichrist so if your will is contrary to the Word of God it is an antichrist will it is what it is a mean so that's the last thing we want is to have our own will but the devil wants you to have your own will that's why you've got to give your will over to God he that loses his life shall save it and he that saves his life shall lose it well how do you lose your life you give it to him you give it to the Lord therefore you'll save it you've got to give it a way to keep it or to save it he says I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I'll ascend above the height of the clouds I'll be like the Most High what did he do he begin to worship his own will because his will was no longer God's will because it was now focused on his own ambition his own self you know many times we say we don't feel lead to do something but really we just don't want to step out of our comfort zone and we use our own comfort zone as an excuse they're following the Word of God I don't feel late - it's actually because we just comfortable in what we do we don't want to follow earn will man has followed his own will and look where the world is there's bombs and the hangers it's going to blow and it's going to be horrible we've already destroyed this world plastic and everything they found rubber you know some some plastic things that you know the deepest part of the ocean this rubbish deepest part of the ocean they found rubbish down there we've polluted this world because of man's idea it's man's world let's do this how's it going to work out not good and your own will will always end up not good now we can come to a spot where we are no longer worshipping the God out worshiping the Lord out of a pure heart or motive but we worship him out of a complex or hurt from other believers or something someone said or even pressure amen yes we can actually be worshipping our own pain our past or current situation what do you give first place in your life the thing you give first place is the thing you worship be it your job a hobby you know whatever it may be even your family you just worshiping that if it's first place see or a pup or our past or something even something that happened many years ago you never see the person again but yet that grips us and we worship it why cuz everything that happens to us now we filter through that event or help you know the words that person said or how they treated us and we get taken back because we're still holding it and what happens we're reacting out of something that happened maybe years ago I don't want to worship God that way and when I talk about worshiping God I'm talking about living everyday life because everyday life is worship it's not just here and singing and raising hands and whatever everyday life how you treat each other how you treat your family hey treat your brother and sister how you treat people in the world that should be a worship because you should be expressing to them what God has done for you now we know Satan has been studying humanity for 6,000 years and he knows how humanity works he know how the human spirit embody work he knows how to use our own human nature against us so remember the devil he will attack us with sickness in our bodies he'll attack us with sickness in our spirit realms give us mind battles try and use our memory against us our frictions our reasoning our imaginations he will we try and use all those things against us but we're going to understand just because he's attacking us in our body or in our spirit doesn't mean he can't get our soul I mean so we can be he can be bombarding us but that doesn't mean we're not a believer right but what happens is we expect that once we meet the Lord everything's going to be fine there'll be no more troubles no more but that's when the battle starts I mean that's when the devil really points us guns are you I mean when you meet when you meet God for yourself that's when has the guns of hell are trained amen we understand we're not in a picnic but we're being given overcoming power I remember just because we may be sick or we maybe whatever that doesn't mean we're not a believer but the devil will use those things against us you see that you see that you see that you just said no no you see him we will be tried by every spirit I'm just throwing some statements out there we will be tried by every spirit I didn't expect a hallelujah will be tried by depression will be tried by pressure will be tried by lust will be tried by jealousy will be tried by bitterness what we tried by hatred every spirit you can name it will come and try you whether you like it or not but God has confidence in the salvation yeah you have to have confidence in it - amen no brother brand makes a statement of why Christ speaker says I'm so glad that man can so completely serve God till he the devil don't know what to do with them that's right just obey God so completely till the devil said well get out of my get away I can't don't want to hear it no more you can do it so completely now that doesn't mean that you know a man can so completely serve God till the devil doesn't try that means that a man can so completely serve God til the devil don't know what to do them so the devil will try bitterness or resentment or lust or jealousy or money or pride or job or whatever more and he'll just come to conclusion nothing that I do works why because the person is so completely surrendered to God the devil tries all of us tricks and they don't work amen I try I trust that's our testimony I mean the weekend so completely serve God the devil just I don't know what to do with these people Allu you but in order to do that we have to stay surrendered and you like that you know you make a choice will you be surrendered to the Lord or will you surrender yourself to that complex or what the devil does or what that person did deal what it will the you know what are you going to yield yourself to you've got a choice brother BAM says the greatest enemy I've got as william branham he's the one that gets in God's way I'll say the greatest enemy I have is being glowing he's the one that gets in God's Way amen he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to apply sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture my Amen but when I can get rid of that guy I'll say this guy when I can get to a place where he's out of the way thank God can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about or or if I can get this guy the way God can come and do things that being glory knows nothing about I want to be that kind of person yeah God so I'll say you know can I tag in have you ever seen wrestling they tag in and out because I want to tag in I want to show you some things gonna get yourself out of the way hallelujah those who don't know wrestling looked at me with blank faces right in now that's when God can use you it's when he can he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot he says all right us is that imperfect drink by perfect weakness so he fights you the devil fight you in these places you know the spirit realm in your body because he knows he can't make you an unbeliever amen see just because he fights you it doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost brother and says heal heal heal heal heal fight at you but sit but it's up to you open the door or not amen now let's look at the two men in the you know let's just look at the two men of the temple the Pharisee was not worshiping the Lord out of a pure heart he was worshiping the Lord based on how he was compared to others so he was little this is like this this person's like this he wasn't there saying all jehovah god you're so wonderful thank you you're our God thank you you saved us from sin and we're not worshiping idols and thank you we're your people and I'm one of your children here's others persons like this and this person's doing this and that's the I don't quite like there in the church and you know he was examining analyzing everything he wasn't worshiping God saying you're so wonderful he was there saying well and better than those people and God doesn't accept that kind of worship I've often marvel where David or you would say sacrifices and offerings thou yo you don't want them you know you want people to come with a pure heart you don't want all these things and you're going through the motion God's not interested just going through the motion he wants people with a pure heart to worship him that way I mean so so the Pharisee he was but then you know there was a reason he became this way a Pharisee isn't born a Pharisee he doesn't just pop out of the room and say my mother sees this here and listen Lauren didn't know he's molded a certain way his environment and what molded him to become a Pharisee you see you know so we have to we have to be careful and I'll come down to the life within us molds us now the two men in the scripture here we were in the temple you know those that you know those that are like this Pharisee what do they have they have some kind of conflicts some kind of inferiority something that they actually worshiping God through it's not a pure worship it's worshiping through something hey you all follow how's everyone tonight we don't want to come to church and say well this is this way and this is this way this person's like this and all they wore that two months ago and I can't believe this is you know I'm not here I'm not here to worship based on those things I don't have a good service of brother Andy's got a red tie on or not you know that's not what dictates my worship you say that sounds ridiculous anything that gets in the way of God is ridiculous I mean well that person did that to me that's what you know compared to God waters it's just ridiculous throw it to one side who you who you're here to worship who you why are you upon the earth it's not because that person or that person that that's you now you're a believer because God revealed themselves to you God called you God loved you hallelujah amen in there and that's but but that's always the challenge you know I remember when Oh you know you first meet the Lord everything's wonderful I mean I know what it's like to be lost I know what it's like to be found I know what it's like to not have the Holy Ghost I know what it's like to receive the Holy Ghost I know what it's like to not know my sins are forgiven I don't know it's like to know my sins are forgiven hallelujah and you meet him and it's just glorious and the word comes up and he becomes real amen he is having a jubilee and doesn't matter what's going on you know and and maybe is letting people would say to you remember that happened and that happened you know I don't I was having a Jubilee myself it's just you and God in this great bubble and your rejoicing amen now you say well why isn't it like that anymore well what do you got your eyes on amen you know you know what I mean see self-will worship can come in the most subtle way this Pharisee on the outside look good he did everything to the leader he was a good Christian you could say a good believer outwardly but inwardly he was wrong we don't want to be like that he was worshiping his own will his worship was out of not out of love but it was by selfish motives the brother Braun would speak in the church age book and and he would say this is in the age of the Reformation and he says for one thing they did not oppose this is from a Sadducee in church age for one thing they did not oppose the church state marriage of the Nicene council but actually fostered that Union had me the defense of the gospel by the state was welcomed there was no word for it and and though we can see the wrath of God praising man and such events as Henry the eighth taking up for the Reformation and the rejection of the papal Authority it was a far cry from the truth truth of Pentecost and the protection of an omnipotent God now Henry the eighth wanted to remarry who knows history Henry the eighth want to remarry but the Pope said you can't so he just got offended say I'm gonna do it anyway and then he broke the you know the Church of England he broke it away from the papal control and made the Church of England so was the wrath of man praising God so he wasn't endorsing the Reformation because he wanted a closer walk with God he wanted the Bible printed and he wanted people to walk in truth he was worshipping God because he wanted to get married again it's that simple why did the Reformation really start in England there because he wanted to get married again so was the wrath of man praising God it wasn't out of a pure heart that's because he wanted to get married again amen and people can become the most devout believers because of something like that because the bigots in their bonnet because of something and something and something and it's the wrath of man praising God oh but we're in the Eagle Age brother being here we are but if you're on the ground you got to you'll be like that but if you're soaring in the heavenlies you're not like that you cannot be amen this is in 2nd Corinthians 10 and 12 for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise so if you compare yourself with yourself yeah the bride compares herself with the bride you're not wise we want to be wise I mean well who do you compete yourself with this amen that's why I should spend time listening for the message reading the Bible say God mold and shape me amen to your image amen brother bran picks up a scripture from Galatians where faith worketh by love amen faith does not work by the wrath of man or a complex or pain or pride whatever it is he says now the word plainly States if you want to put this down in Galatians five and six that faith worketh by love see faith worketh by love and the only way you can have faith is to have love first because after all faith is loves incentive and sin if that's what faith is it is an incentive to love now if you don't love you can't have faith how now how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that's in the Fila that's human love then how about the agapo to God how can it be if you don't love God if you said you love your wife and never tell her about it never sit down and make love to her express it to her kiss her hugger tell her she's the best cook in the country all the things that you know and how pretty she is and how much you love her if you don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you do love her you express it and all the husband said Amen absolutely and all the wife said Amen that's how I express my love to my spouse I tell them and I showed and word indeed amen my I need to preach on love of it amen hallelujah see faith worketh by love what's your motivation the Pharisees motivation was one better than the sky if I stay better than this guy it means my social standing is better people will look at me better than they look at the publican isn't he and yo mr. Pharisee goes the temple all here he comes look at him he's already maybe you know made him looking mat yo made himself local contoured and sincere or whatever you know this stuff he's just a Pharisee but outwardly aw paste eyes look oh he's the model believer is he the publican was the model believer Amen this world is in chaos because man has said in his heart I will now external influences will make you a part of who you are but if you are totally surrenders of God and surrendered to his word then no matter what circumstances they are in life the life and you will be produced now humans you know you take you take you take natural life you take like flowers and so on the life and the seed will bring forth it may sure you know things will grow in better conditions but the same life will be produced you know just say if you take a pumpkin seed and you put it on one kind of soil it's not going to make an apple tree it's gonna be a pumpkin right you change it to another soil it's going to be a pumpkin again because of life within it now but the human being in one respect is a little different because we're born with a fallen nature and without God giving us a new birth where there's no longer our first nature living but his life has nature amen then the the life within us will mold us a certain way how our human that's why we have to be born again because our first nature is rotten amen the first nature that you receive doesn't matter how good your parents were how great whatever it's still rotten you ought to be birthed I mean and when you receive a new birth you have a different nature than what you once had a man it's not a patch-up job but the life has now being lived out of you it's very different to what you once had amen now let's say the environment that we live in can change us but it all depends if you're allowed to or not you're we all have a choice I mean we all have a choice and every choice in life will either make us better or better choose either stay which what you want to be a better person or do you want to be a better person amen I'd rather be a better not a better Amen it's isn't you know about Daniel Daniel was a man incredible men he was taken from Israel and to Babylon he was taken to a place with a strange language strange gods strange culture different kind of place in the world he was taken to an alien land but yet he purposed in himself that he would not defile himself with the portion of the Kings meat amen he it would it would say of Daniel Daniel 6 and 3 that this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit was in him I mean so Daniel had an excellent spirit Daniel purposed in his heart that he would serve God hallelujah so now he didn't he didn't um so so he purposed that his environment would not change who he really was I mean cuz he knew who he was in the Lord now this was more than just being fundamental and praying three times a day like Daniel having our quiet time but what is the motivation in doing so I meant as our motivation out of love thank you lord I'm redeemed I'm going to heaven that should create worship hallelujah all my sins are washed away all my guilt all my shame on my pain all my past that's washed away I don't know where it's God I don't care it's gone hallelujah glory be to God amen so you got to see what is your motivation and doing it now the devil will try and tell you there's no point but there's a great purpose and worship listening to the word and prayer amen the scripture would say you know many people worship their own will and this is not just people who are not Christians or even just denominational people but this is message people we're people - I mean we're not different you know this thing is the same right yeah the scripture would say that people would become lovers of their own selves they've been lovers of pleasure more than lovers of gods they love God but they love pleasures more so they love their own will and what pleases the flesh more than loving God amen now brother Bram says an identification he says and you know it's one of the greatest hindrances that the Church of God has the bootlegger the gamble of them people we all know which way they are headed and they know themselves but the fellow who possesses professes to be a Christian the woman that professes to be a Christian and then live something different that's the greatest stumbling block that the outside world has got that as their as the outside world anywhere it's worse than anything the world can produce as a person that's supposed to be a Christian and lives something else different than that lying stealing cheating doing things that he ought not to do that's a discredit to us testimony when you take people that do those things there and they re says our character is moulded and thereby the life that's in us so if the life of God is in you your character will be molded by that life but if your carnal nature is in there then your life will be your character we were molded by your carnal nature to can't live in the same house at once so I thought I'm dead in Christ lives Rome alive in Christ is not here I mean brother Brahim signified the spirit of Beethoven I'd write great symphonies if I had the spirit of Michelangelo in me I'd do great masterpieces he said my cleanser and I can't live in the same place to give either he's live or I'm dead or he's dead and I'm alive amen brother Brown would speak in the restoration the bride tree now forgive me for I just want I'm just going through this okay he would he would speak of the four stages of the Antichrist spirit eating away at the church and the last part of it was the bark being being eaten off and their bark we know speaks of the doctrine that covers up for the life to come forth now you can you can actually say well I believe right but how you treat people and the character you have because what you believe is expressed right so so what you saw it saw it so in other words if I believed that a husband should just be like a like a dictator and my word is final my family can't say anything if I really believe that then my life would show it right so that is my doctrine being expressed you following me right but I don't believe that but if I did that's that's what would happen amen so now if you take away so real doctrine will allow the life of God to come forth but because if you had you kill a tree you ring bark it and then the life camp can't grow up and it actually kills the tree just by cutting the bark off the tree so if you take real Bible doctrine out of a person's life brother om says what happens as they as they as they take away the bark they put a rag over a man-made rag to try and cover it with a bark is gone you can't put a rag on a tree that's being ringback expect the life to come forth and it lives it will die it means it's the same thing if we take away what we believe and replace it by a man-made way that's why we can't have a culture in this message we can't have a human Kiwi culture you're whatever culture it is others how much yeah this how my parents were it doesn't mean it's right I mean doesn't mean it was wrong either but doesn't mean it's right you got to go back say Lord how should it be I mean that's you know there's a reason why a whole generation is gone I mean so we don't want to we don't want to take doctrine that's man-made it's just like a rag around us and life can't come forth you following me I mean we don't want to be that way Peter would come to a place because of his internal nature he says Lord I'll die with you amen jesus said you're gonna forsake me he says no I'm ready to go to death with you that was his own pride those as I will there was his own ambition I mean his own carnal nature actually rejected what the word said he would do imagine that imagine that here's Peter the Lord speaking to him yo Jesus says to his disciples you're gonna forsake me this night and Peter said to him I won't I'm going to die with you and the word himself looked at him straight in the eye said before the crows three times you will and he didn't say forgive me Lord I'm wrong don't leave this happen he defiantly said with his heart I will not what was that I will that was carnal full of nature saying no you're wrong you're the Christ but you're wrong think about it his own carnal nature was actually Antichrist God knows how to get people on the ash heap you know what happened to Peter here to die to that amen there's an Ephesians 5 and 17 wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of God will of the Lord is and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit now this would and wise in the stronger that means properly mindless ie stupid by implication ignorant or especially egotistic now egotistic means a self-centered person so it says wherefore be not self-centered be not unwise be not self-centered I mean but understanding what the will of the Lord is you say well how can someone become a self-centered Christian because remember we're here for one another I'm not here for myself I mean no part of the body is for itself it's always for something else right so how can someone become a self-centered Christian because of pain because of hurt because of rejection because of complexes amen all those things bad experiences what happens is why because when you first meet the Lord you want everyone else to meet them and then you get rid you know then you get rejected a few hundred times and then it begins to wear you down a little bit Wow when I first met the Lord I thought now everyone's gonna believe because he's alive everyone just has to hallelujah he's alive today and then after about the 20th person up against the door on you maybe not everyone will but God has his children now what am I gonna do now am I just gonna say well I guess that's it and that's me and here we are am I gonna let that become a complex right actually just become self sin it's all about me I've got to become like the word I'm gonna become like you Jesus help me to do it it's all self-centered or am I gonna actually let the Lord overcome that I mean I still have the same heart everyone's got to believe it because he's a life hallelujah see so what happens is we people withdraw within themselves where once the Lord was there all and all from their hearts Elijah going into the wilderness while running from Jezebel is the classic example of this he was a he was a man of the wilderness you'll find people always have a default setting there's what I call about Elijah being a wilderness man that was his default setting he always liked the wilderness amen now when he ran from Jezebel he ran into the wilderness and it wasn't God telling him to go your read account God and say now flee from the hand of Jezebel and go to the mountain of God you know God didn't tell him he led himself there his own because of the own rejection he had is because his own nature led him there that's a comfort zone people can use this as a comfort zone they can use that as a comfort zone they can kick a ball around as a comfort zone they can read books they can disappear on the internet or even just press play and just sit back and let them actually control God's speaking to them amen you know but all it's just actually just a religion and it actually becomes a safety zone in a bad way because they're not effective and actually reaching out to people right reaching out to the body it's all n-word now amen you may not agree with that but people do God comes to Elijah on Mount Carmel he asked him a question what are you doing here why are you in this place what dost thou here Elijah why are you in the state why have you isolated yourself from where you mean to be he was meant to be in Israel being a prophet a mouthpiece mouthpiece to God in Israel he's not an Israel he's ran away what's happened brother bran became the same way he as I always wanted to be a trapper that was his default setting I always wanted to be a trapper I never wanted to do this but God led me and I followed him but then because the word open see you can be he was brother Brown adopted son of God the sword lands in his hand and Sabino Canyon amen the word of the Lord the sword of the king lands in his hand he's come to his adoption he can now he's be given the authority go back to Jeffersonville the seven seals gonna be open the mysteries that have been in the Bible are gonna come open to the endtime bride and you're gonna be one of the ministers it hallelujah and even seasoned most sermons he says now thousands of my friends gonna leave me because of this he knew was going to happen but when it happened it hurt and then he said well no it because of rejection he's standing in the gap who's hurt standing in the gap I trust you all have a means he says well because the reject sees is well I'm just going to go up northern British Columbia I'm just going to be a trapper I'm gonna be an Old Testament prophet if God wants me to come down now the worldís I'll stomp out the willness say thus saith the Lord then go back here was an adopted son of God because of rejection withdrew himself from the people hears me to minister to Amen he wasn't a sinner he wasn't a new Christian he was adopted in the body he was now a dispensational change had happened in the church God from church ages no the age of the son of man gone to the bride age here he was as the as the as the breach between the two that ministry and he withdrew himself because of rejection when immune amen so he asked the question why what dost thou hear and and Elijah's responses because I'm the only one I'm the only one who believes you there's no one else no one else understands what I'm going through no one else can relate to me no one else has faced the same trail hallelujah Amen why what's happened his eyes have gone off the one leading him to himself the same problem that Lucifer had but just expressed in a different way you know pride manifests in many different forms pride can range from I'm I'm awesome to poor me no one helps me no one comes to me that that's why a pity party that's pride amen because it's all look at me just in a different way it's not I'm awesome but poor me but look at me Amen why are you here no one understands there's no one else and God says hold on I got 7000 which were we you were but you lift them amen he tells them to go back see people people get to a point now and understands what I'm going through you know there's nothing new Under the Sun it changes form but it's the same thing and people and that's what the devil wants us to do look at our own selves look at what we're going through they were to observe lying vanities forsake their own mercies the work of the devils actually lying vanities you say well it's pretty real right now he'll come add a witness not even a memory it'll be in the lake of fire watch it become ashes dance around a little bit hallelujah will still be amen that's just lying vanities the only thing real is those things that are eternal everything else is temporal it will pass away amen he say but I've been enduring this for a long time one day a thousand years with God is one day amen a thousand years upon the earth who's loved that long I've yeah I've been listening to the history of the Bible 600 years ago Ash was you know white cliff and different you know the Reformation was starting to come forth I think that's not that long ago really but we think our little things been going on for ages it's just a little speck of not even a blink of God's eye amen see you have to see well once where once we worshipped him from our hearts out of love it becomes a duty and something to do amen because of pain because of you know we can't just go through the motions I just want you to think about it where we you know what were you like when you first meet him you should all have a moment you may like may not be able to put a specific day but something happened to you what were you like hallelujah I I don't think you were sitting like this not that I'm trying to work you up but you know you know you were rejoicing well I trust you were happy you're worshiping him everything was wonderful the clouds look different or maybe it's just me the clouds look different God painted a sunset he thought well he just did that for me hallelujah this is how I felt I was down there in Christ you're seeing the clouds over the southern alps and the and the evening RAZR thought lord you painted that just for me hallelujah and it's all foggy in the middle of winter down there you can't see too much it's pea soupy and you know before it used to be a drudgery to walk to university in that way but you just begin to sing it shall be light in the evening time the path to glory you'll surely find I found it hallelujah everything's just awesome it's freezing in your flat glory hallelujah oh yeah oh yeah oh yes having a good time doesn't matter what's going on hallelujah but anyway you say I wish it could be that way all the time it can be it can be it can't still be wonderful it shouldn't be work shouldn't be like a job hallelujah see it shouldn't matter what's happening in life you should just go to thinking about hemin issues be such a bubbling joy come forth doesn't it good there's the wonderful isn't he glorious he's glorious he's wonderful hallelujah I know what it's like I said I know and I wanted to actually preach her I know I know what it's like to be lost I know what it's like to be found I know what it's like to be blind I know what it's like to see hallelujah I know what it's like to be you know because there's a point I remember hearing the message brother been preaching on Redemption and completeness and enjoy I had no idea what there was he talks about people with back slit I wasn't even front slit I had no idea I was lost and I'm done in the world I was lost no you have no idea I was completely absolutely lost hallelujah lost as lost could be but he found me he found me when I heard that messenger say good morning or a good evening friends he began to speak about Redemption and completeness and enjoy hallelujah I realized two things or three things one I knew I didn't know him the Lord - I knew that I didn't know my sins were forgiven me and three I knew I didn't have the Holy Ghost that's a good place to be at least you know you at least you know where you are hallelujah and if you know you're in that estate God's trying to get your attention I don't want to leave you in that state hallelujah but then when I know I knew what it was like to go from lost to found I mean from senator st. I mean - guilty - sinless I mean forever from guilty to forgiving I knew what it was like hallelujah to not have the Holy Ghost and to have the Holy Ghost I knew I was like not to have the mind of Christ receiving the mind of Christ hallelujah I knew it's like when the book was sealed when the book came over Helia I knew I was like when the mighty angel was there and then he came to me hallelujah I know I remember the moment in the time I mean where where the word came open and the book came open and I wasn't listening to a sermon I was just reading the scripture I just finished talking to my darling wife she I wonder about the Seventh Seal I think God just opened scripture to me I realize he's here hallelujah I knew I was like to hear about horse riders to hearing about the lamb take the book hallelujah I knew what that was like hallelujah amen it's just me it makes me happy Polly I can see I use like to read about John them become John Polly they took the book and jump again to rejoice hallelujah I knew what it's like I still know what it's like hallelujah you know we're gonna have a kind of worship in heaven that the Apostle Paul won't have a lot you won't have hallelujah you know what I mean hallelujah he'll be worshiping a certain way glory to God you know his his walk with God his revelation and then we'll comin hallelujah what age did you come from later see ya glory what happened the lamb came hallelujah holy John what John would maybe worship a certain way I saw the vision of the book of Revelation and the wake of alone hallelujah John what you saw in simple form I've seen in reality for hallelujah we have never got a worship hallelujah glory hallelujah this doesn't make you feel happy hallelujah amen you think about how great it'll be but a brim come along worship a certain way and and you would say we heard your word you said that this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world and it did here I am hallelujah and the things he saw in seed form was seen in reality form hallelujah he saw the world would be in he saw it we're living in it hallelujah amen glory now brother Brahim sees in the church age book I'll be nearly finished they didn't say that but I'm just saying that now the Satan knows are shortly that the original Church at Pentecost I'm glad and give me a means with that one with the power of God mark mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all the houses false it has to be now remember this Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm and formal and powerless and exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's words right down to the time he is cast like a fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for then she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as deftly thoughted today as when Christ was stood as every effort to gain power over him and the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell could not prevail against us but we will prevail over them now many times we think of that Antichrist spirit is coming in the form of false doctrine wrapped up a message quotes yeah amen and while that is true the devil just does not just come in that way look at depression you know I was reading I can't remember what what message it is but brother Graham says habits of spirits habits are spirits so something becomes a habit to you you say why do I keep going back to that thing the spurred driving you look at depression its inward looking pain nursing nature what makes a person that way it was a wound or a bruise in their spirit and the devil comes in and afflicts them amen that's what depression is and you can range the pressure can be extreme a very mild or what is that inward looking this is how the Antichrist spirit comes into filing the church making it formal lukewarm and powerless not just with false doctrine wrapped up a message quotes it's more saddled The Devil's spot you know I've given one thing he's he's cunning he's clever he's not dumb amen he's clever but with the mind of Christ we can discern and withstand hallelujah see or see look inward looking people whatever the devil's got them to take their eyes off the Lord and upon themselves I mean you say well I don't know you say well you don't know what I've been through my Lord Jesus does amen he knows what it's like to be rejected he knows what to be tempted on all points here without sin he was tempted on all points sexual sin everything he took my sin up Calvary he bore my son he was you know he went to hell in my place he died a sinner when he was there between heavens and earth on the cross saying my god my god was our for sake and me he wasn't just saying some words being a robot he was crying out why have you forsaken me hallelujah a me see is that what caused the hurt no it's how the hurt has treated you take a person who's been physically wounded and that person you know you take a big wound if you physically keep ripping open a wound is it gonna get well you take someone who goes into a A&E and they try and rip tubes out of themselves and different things that person is not in their right mind in the hospital something's wrong with that person now you take that from the physical and you take it into the spiritual and people ripping IV lines out of themselves and tubes you know guys trying to patch us up and heal us and make us better but you want to rip open the wound and bring those memories back and relive it all the time and what's happening people are ripping bandages off and pulling out IV lines spiritual ones what's wrong the devil sang rip it out you don't want that you know I look at that thing oh yeah it's all you because he doesn't want you to be well sometimes the Lord heals like this sometimes it takes time because he's faith worketh patience amen see we don't want to sure we get wounded we all been wounded Amen but there's a healing balm present there is a balm in Gilead I mean there is a healing place and many times it just starts the healing process but we have to overcome brother Graham said that God doesn't just force us through a pipe and then we're overcoming you have to choose to overcome you have to make the choice I'm getting lured by you I'm gonna overcome this enemy by you I'm going to overcome my flesh hallelujah amen hallelujah see as long as you keep in your heart see this that's a healing process and you've got to overcome but as long as you keep in your heart that there was a time when nothing matter but walking with him loving him when you never noticed your kid about any fusses around you you just get caught up in him it's such a joy to walk with him amen if you stay on that spot you got to go back to when you meet him the devil always uses bad memories against you why don't you use good memories against him hallelujah even when he's yeah well he touched me once go back to that once he called me once go back to the ones He healed me once go back to the ones hallelujah you know that's the thing no trauma affects us more than just physically I had a I to great-uncle my my my parents grant my parents are my mom's parents and my mum's uncle lived next to us growing up and my great uncle uncle Ted he fought in North Africa he was at Battle of Alamein he fought all the way through Italy and I'm about to cross up and to Germany wherever but then they demobilized he fought at Monte Cassino fine you know a lot of these names don't mean anything to he fought great horrific battles and he lived till he was 90 after World War two many times he'd wake up screaming because of the trauma that he suffered in battle it was one you know a few years he was 19 years old a few of those years he was fighting in World War two and those moments affected him for the rest of his life even though he wasn't in the battlefield anymore he was in New Zealand he wasn't in North Africa or Italy where ever he was he was back in New Zealand he was a shepherd then he retired you know he wasn't on the battlefield anymore but those experiences gave him deep trauma in his life and when he went to sleep it would come back up again and that can happen many times it's never the actual incident that affects us it's the trauma that comes because of it Amen who's been there many times at the moment it doesn't seem that bad but then you go away it gets real big right what's heaven trauma comes in you don't even maybe realize you're packing it but it's there they meant now as a Christian I sadly I don't know what kind of state he was in you know when he when he passed away and I don't know if you had any kind of faith but I'll say this we don't have to live with trauma affecting us every day we do not have to live with trauma you know make us that we can't sleep at night or to fix our life there is a healing in this place Amen hallelujah whit bill I'm built exactly the same way my uncle was built my great-uncle right if I went through that I would have had the same things but there's a healing balm in Gilead right here in the Lord Jesus Christ where trauma doesn't need to affect us anymore hallelujah amen but depends you have to make a you have to make a choice will he let those things big be a garrison that the devil can use or we use it as a city of refuge for others there are six cities of refuge and the promised land the seventh is Christ right many of those places were actually enemy cities in those reliance winningly they took it and became a city of refuge but the devil put something in your spirit and the devil use it as a door and to the rescue to invade what's it an enemy garrison pull down the strongholds the scripture says so it becomes an enemy garrison right but then God can come and bring healing kick the devil out and then that same experience now you could actually use that when someone else has the same problem and you can enter into their burden and really pray I mean you know people can go through things in life and I can sympathize but if I've been in their shoes amen I can really enter into their need a mess just like you have children children come up they're sick you can enter into that prayer because you've got kids yourself right or anything else you've been through in life God can use it brother Bram said about you know Sharon Rose she's their little baby she's dying her eyes crossed over in pain and then he said hundreds of cross-eyed bate children came over the platform and not one of them left with cross-ice and he said the people never knew what cost them in order that that would happen because he saw it in his baby he now had a burden I don't want to see that ever again then cross our children come across he could enter into the burden of that child because he's seen it before and you always hear him you know when he said about the boy in Finland or or other children that it did he begin to think about his own children back home what if that was a little Billy Paul or Joseph or whoever it was he enters under that burden because he knows what it's like because he's got children what happened it became a City of Refuge God stepped on the scene brought brought mighty deliverance amen hallelujah so it depends what you want to do now he sees here in El Shaddai and I'll just close with this he says Lazarus no no I'll read this from Luke 4 actually first he sees the spirit so Jesus found in the and the scroll of Isaiah the prophecy to spread laws upon me because he's anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised that is all about spiritual healing brokenhearted yeah amen healing of the brokenhearted preach deliverance to the captives we know that's just not physical captivity you can be captive by a memory right recovering other sides of the blind people get clouded over with complexes looking through pain all the time they're not looking right right they're not seeing things what they are you can be healed from that blindness and set at liberty them that are bruised that anointing is here I mean that anointing is not just here on a Whizzer or Sunday that anointing should be with you hallelujah because the same God that was there as present amen to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book he gave it again to the minister sat down and the eyes of all them were in the synagogue were faster on them if we're going to send them this day the scriptures in your ears brother have see the rest of the pod that book I prophesy was as fulfilled today but it continues on from this so if this is the case we don't need to worship her own selves Lucifer's I will doesn't have to be your will amen it's up to what you want to do he says now shadow I Lazarus died that's true he rose again he lived a normal life for many many years because the resurrection Jesus gave him and then course he died again because
