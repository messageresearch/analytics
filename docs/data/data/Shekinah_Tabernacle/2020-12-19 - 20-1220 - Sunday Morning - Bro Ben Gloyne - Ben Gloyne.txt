[Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] praise the lord good morning everyone how are you that was a direct question to everybody individually [Music] [Laughter] it feels good it's good to be in the house of the lord again to be with saints and to have an opportunity to be able to praise the lord this morning i was getting some songs together last night um and i thought to myself this is the last service that i'm doing before christmas [Music] and you all know how i feel about christmas christmas is my most favorite time of the year you know because it's like for this brief moment in time you get as close to what heaven will be like as is humanly possible on this earth you say well how is that like because in heaven we don't have to work and we can all just relax and it's like a constant festive season so over here we kind of all save our money and the companies will save their money and then everyone has a holiday and they all can all sort of live and pretend that life is wonderful and that just you can just live without being paid and not having to work and things you know it's true and you you look around you know like the 26th 27th 28th you go to the petrol station everyone's happy you go to the the wherever you go to people are happy because they can they don't have to work anymore you know we just pretend that the curse isn't around for a little while and then on top of that there's like these christmas carols playing in the supermarket and different places you go not so much as what they used to be but you know it's the only when when and during any other part of the year do you hear a song about jesus in paper plus or pack and save or somewhere you don't hear it right but christmas they kind of have to because it's well even our dating system declares it the year of our lord 2020 and but i grew up in the 80s not like the 80s were very christian but where i was it kind of was because we were out in a little country community and actually a majority of the people in the community were christians so the school i would say 50 of the children at school were christian so we grew up singing christmas carols all the time like at christmas time but i kind of worry these days because all of these young fellows here that go to school probably they probably think christmas carols are like rudolph the red-nosed reindeer or jingle bells or i saw mummy kissing santa claus or some nonsense like that you know those aren't christmas carols you young fellas that slop so i thought i'm going to like push the christmas carols you know so it kind of ingrains into the little children and ingrains in our memory this is what this is what these are the songs we sing and i don't really mind that this is not the year actual time of the lord's birth and all that it's kind of like hey my mind can pass that and say well this is what we allocate it this is where we'll just the general public put it here so hey who really cares it that's it it doesn't really matter it's it's the and people say well we don't you know the lord didn't say to celebrate his birth but he didn't say not to and it was a momentous occasion it's probably the most important person that was ever born like so i ranked the day that he was born quite a powerful day a very powerful day and i love the my most favorite line in a song ever in the existence of the world is probably i think it's um silent night and it's the line i'll just get that i'll just get the verse because this is such a um that's the second verse of silent night no third verse here it is and the fourth line of the song is probably my most favorite line ever in existence silent night holy night son of god loves pure light radiant beams from thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace because that's what it was you know there's something dawned and it was redeeming grace was dawning and it then of course the the the outcome wasn't wasn't all roses and pretty because he had to actually die horrible death on the cross but it was the dawn of redeeming grace so let's um i'm going to ask brother ben bailey to open in prayer this morning i just saw him coming and he looked so good in his black suit and his thick hair flying back i thought are we on [Music] [Music] from you lord they just won't go away lord we need your love for everybody lord let's pray you have our hearts often this morning lord and walk away different people or god

like to ask my wife to come up here she hadn't known she was going to come over here don't need a hinbu you know this song i really need some volume you don't mind [Applause] amen i just realized that this is the last sunday before christmas brother isaac reminded us of that amen so this song here is a personal testimony to me i hadn't planned to sing it but there's a way i feel just since every sense you get pushed and pushed and pushed like a fire uh does that preach that sing or know what i'm talking about amen now this song i've sung it before but i haven't sung it playing the guitar i'll play the guitar because there's a certain way it rises and falls there's a certain bit i follow amen so if i sing it with the choir they play very well but i need to practice with them first to understand how it costs otherwise i might go too slow or you might feel you're going too fast so amen now we i'm singing about waiting upon the lord i will take it right back to the beginning when god spoke the word into creation amen he said let there be and he waited would you imagine if god had said let there be the light let there be the moon and he started worrying about it is the moon coming i spoke it where is the moon brother branham was told by god just speak the word what is it exactly that you want and he said squirrels where do you want the squid how many do you want be specific i want three where do you want them to come from the first one will come this way the second one that way it was that third one that was a problem he started doubting god now he's getting dark and this third squirrel has not appeared sup if it appears and it's darker am i gonna be able to shoot it lord i know your weight is true but just two would be enough god said no you said three so you shall have three now i don't know why i'm singing this song but i'm sure someone there there's someone who is prayed for something you asked god for something it hasn't materialized yet amen so you're starting to worry oh it's getting to christmas before we know it is 20 21 and i'm still waiting i am still maybe god has forgotten about it okay we got a question for you how long did abraham wait how

today god bless you praise the lord amen we're going to go to luke chapter 2. i mean everyone feeling good today i'm feeling pretty nervous say right here but i don't know why but anyway god bless you amen praise the lord um so just one announcement as you turn to luke chapter two so not this wednesday but next wednesday we won't have our regular midweek service but we'll move it to christmas um new year's eve to have watch night so that'll be the following day or whatever the calendar sees they mean let's go to luke chapter two and it came to pass you turn me down a bit there by the raman please and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be taxed with his with mary has a spouse wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end and we're going to jump to first corinthians 6 and 19 just as a bit of a context i'm here can you oh are we yeah why not yeah hold on just um oh my god to 19 but my context here is plot know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost can you just turn it down a bit which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glory god in your body and in your spirit which are god's amen let's just bow heads in a word of prayer if you don't be remembered and pray this morning you want to raise your hands to the lord amen gracious lord jesus we just want to approach you this morning and we're so thankful we can not by our own merit but by your blood lord as you said in your word you told us to come boldly before your throne of grace lord we thank lord i'm so thankful it's not anything i could ever do or achieve but it's what you have achieved lord gives me access to come into your presence and i thank you for that dear god and i just want to pray lord as we have read your word i just ask that once more you would inspire it lord jesus may you anoint it to our hearts mate go beyond our mental faculties and might anchor down into our soul and lord you see the hands that are raised lord jesus you know the burdens behind those hands the needs maybe the questions and lord i just pray you'd meet those needs this morning lord we thank you that you are a supernatural god lord you do supernatural things lord and you answer in ways that lord go beyond even human reasoning lord jesus and lord i just want to pray that lord by the time the service is all said and done and we walk out these doors lord i just pray that burdens would be lifted lord jesus would be encouraged would be strengthened would be renewed would be refilled with your holy spirit lord anyone here who has not ever ever met you before may they meet you in the service lord lord may may our hearts be open and and and receiving lord welcoming unto you may you grant it dear god pray you touch those who are sick and body as well we thank you that we have a report from the doctor saying i'm the lord god that heals all thy diseases and by your stripes we were healed lord that's the script that we have taken the prescription and lord we've taken the medicine lord and we thank you lord that we're well lord hallelujah thank you for healing us lord jesus lord and i just pray you'd be those who couldn't make it here today maybe those who are traveling on holiday lord we know this is a busy time on the roads oh god and i pray you just keep us all safe as we travel around the country lord and just everyone else lord may there be no road toll over this christmas season lord may you grant it dear god we just want to commit our lives into your hands and we thank you in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning amen i really enjoyed the specials this morning hallelujah praise the lord we've been trying to get them to sing for a while but i you know thank the lord that they amen so we've read here um from from luke luke 2 and i know this is a christmas season but i want to just talk about the manger i want to talk about the where where jesus was born and i just want to maybe just uh you know the prophet tells us we're one in a million we're one in a million we're special we're special to god you know we're not we're not just haphazardly you know god god think highest he could think of anyone he thinks about you and i hallelujah he doesn't just think oh just that that's just another christian average person whoever no no he thinks he's the we are the apple of his eye we are special to him his whole plan of redemption is wrapped around you his whole purpose of being to express himself is wrapped around you we are important to god we're incredibly important i mean he put he put your life above the value of his own life right he you know his sister shannon gave that yo did the skit at camp and said you know we're worth more than worlds or money or gold or you know anything could be given he gave his own life because there was nothing more he could pay i mean to redeem us what was his own blood so you know whenever the devil comes along and says you're worthless and you know you're good for nothing you never amount to anything just tell them devil you've come too late because god put a value on my soul and it was greater than his own life it was greater than his own existence hallelujah was the value he put on on my soul amen because we know if he would go for calvary if he had to go to calvary for one he would have gone for one right if he you know if if if brother branham if elijah was sent upon the earth and the end time to rapture one he would have gone through the ministry all the same he would have preached all the same it was just for one soul he would have got god would have caused him to go through it all hallelujah so you know we're very valuable to god we're a special kind of people you say well that's very proud no no i'm saying that because he told me i'm special and if he told me i'm special i'm special hallelujah i'm not too interested really what other people think about me but if he says i'm special i'm special if he says you're the jewel in my crown i'm special hallelujah you know i'm sure no husband here would yo you know down you know yo yo treads their wife down says they're good for nothing says they're useless no we never say that because that's not our heart to them we think they're the greatest you know we're their biggest fan i tell christine i'm your biggest fan hallelujah i want to get a t-shirt made or something you know but i'm a biggest fan hallelujah you know but that's what we think about our wives i'm sure brothers say amen you know we think they're the greatest they're you know they're the best and and that's what the lord thinks about us we're a very special kind of people harley and now it's amazing where you know you know we look at the scene here and you know there's there's there's um things are happening and you'd think that you know god if he would really cause it to happen you know why would mary have to take that hard journey on you know you know the donkey's back all the way from nazareth down to bethlehem and you know she's about to be delivered and would have been a difficult journey even even you know you know in in today's standings with our cars and everything you know you're about to be delivered you don't want to go driving around anywhere you know so it would have been a difficult kind of journey but you know god knows how to orchestrate world events for his word to come to pass yeah so nothing that's happening today is out of cater right we see the world's falling apart you know there's a great i want to preach on it one day there's a scripture i think it's in habakkuk where there'll be a like a whole net that will steer the whole earth and we have the world wide web right brother brown speaks about how women are caught in a web of fashion and they can't get out there's a web that's trying to entangle souls but uh you know i'm so thankful that we're built in a certain way we can get through that net you know some fish can get through the net you know hallelujah we're built a certain way to get through the net amen but you know there's a lot of things going on in this day and age but god is here to fulfill his word and just like in the first christmas you know i was thinking about christmas the word christmas is a is a mess it's a you know it's a catholic tradition that word christmas and it's basically you know mass you know you know i may have it wrong but it's basically you're kind of communing with the dead it's a mess but christmas we're not communing with a dead person we're communing with a resurrected jesus christ so it's not a it's not a worship of a dead person people say well jesus died but he rose again and he's alive today amen he's alive this morning so you know to me i think brother braham said yo christmas should be such a worship and he says that santa claus you know has been put out before the people to take all the worship from jesus christ and you know there's nothing wrong with presence and everything we give presents whatever more we have tinsel and all those things but you know we should never let it diminish the true worship of christmas you know as i say the reason for the season he's the reason for the season and he's the reason for the season of redemption as well so here we have this difficult kind of scene brother brown dramatized it in many places and you know you know he had to you know this this decree came out and mary was about to have the child they had to travel down to bethlehem and you know it was a difficult kind of journey they you know they went real slow and you know mary would even ask joseph sometimes you know do you want to go do you want to ride on the donkey's back and he says no no no sweetheart you just stay right there and you know then they begin to see a star rise and you know they they were looking at that and joseph said honey have you seen that star and you know she would say you know i've been watching that since you know you know for a couple of hours now and it was those those stars coming together to give that star bethlehem and we know there are wise men that were looking for that star and you know what i love about you know i love about this here where you know maybe we'll read about the shepherds later but you know a true star of god will take you to where christ is in your day we've had a star rise a seventh angel in this day and he pointed us to where christ is in his word and it's just like the shepherds they were they were led the angels the angels visited them and said you will find them in a manger and it's amazing they found him in a manger they found they didn't find nothing they didn't find a stable with just animals and a manger they found the word made flesh in the manger where the angel said that they would find him and it's the same thing we've had a seventh angel speaking this day and he's instructed us exactly where to find jesus in his word and we went we heard the angel's message we we obeyed the angel's message and what did we find christ hallelujah not a story not a tradition but christ the resurrected jesus christ the living word he pointed us rights he say how do you know this message is true because it pointed me to a resurrected jesus christ and it's not to a story or a god of history but a living god today and i've met that one what did the shepherd say after they met the lord there in the in the stable they went everywhere saying we've seen the messiah we've seen the messiah he's born hallelujah angels met us on the field and we went exactly where we're told to go and we found him hallelujah they didn't find something different they found exactly what the angel told them they would find they found the baby christ hallelujah and it's the same thing today this message the seventh angel messenger pointed us to where christ is and i've i've seen him he's alive hallelujah so that's why it's a glorious christmas season hallelujah you know those wise men they would be they'd be journeying brother ramsey it took them two years to get from you know where they were in the east and you know they were studying the stars being made giant different things and you know it took them two years to go there and he says the reason is that because herod instructed that the boy male children from two years and down had to be killed in bethlehem but they they kept traveling they were following that star and to me wise men still seek him right you can still find him you know they were they were caught up there were many different constellations but brother ram says that that that that one particular night there was a visitor in the heavens and they say oh i wonder what this one is and then they begin to because they were trained by daniel because he instructed the wise men of babylon this was generations before them but but you know that knowledge was passed down and they opened up the scripture and they would go to numbers and balaam you know to me this is phenomenal here's a false prophet and he prophesies that a star will rise out of jacob yeah but but the anointing item was true that's why it's in the scripture that's why we don't throw it out because the anointing on them was true and that prophecy came to pass because those wise men no doubt they read that scripture and a star would rise out of jacob then they would read you know in another section where the scepter will not depart from judea till shiloh comes and your king would rise out of judah so they saw that star and then they said well you know according to this scripture we've just read that's been passed down to us that many people long to see but we live in the season of it the king of the jews is born upon the earth and then they begin to you know you know load up their camels get ready for the journey and you know brother man makes a statement how there's um one of the wise men you know you know he tries to take his old life with him so he puts on his card table and his you know drinks and all these different kind of things and if we kind of brought it into today's language he tries to put his xbox on there and his computer games and his netflix and all those things and his tick-tock and you know tries to pack those on the camel but the camel gets so burdened down it just collapses it can't move you can't bring your old self with you so then he starts throwing it all off throwing it all off and his wife says honey don't you need those things there's no i've got to laugh at every weight and every sin i've seen a star in the west and i've come yo i've got to follow that start of the christ child hallelujah so so he unburdened his life and it's such a good thing just jettison stuff that holds you down just chop it let it go oh but i love that stuff chop it let it go you'll find a far greater thing hallelujah and we are there we got testimonies of that in this room hallelujah so you know then they followed that star and then of course but in their mind they're like well we need to go to jerusalem to find out where he's going to be born but if you read in the scripture we i don't think we have time to read it now but you gotta read the account when they go into jerusalem they don't see that star anymore the place they should have gone now this ties into being a manger and things because you know we read about how we're a temple of the living god and when god says no to a place it's because he's saying no i can't be born here i've got to be born in a place that reflects me and so so they go to jerusalem they think well this is this is surely they'll know where he'll be because this is the religious headquarters of the nation but when they go in there the star basically disappears because they've gone to a place where man is just filled with tradition and it's amazing because here here is the center of the you know here's the center of the country or of the world that should have actually seen that star should have been looking for it and when they come into the city saying where is he born king of the jews it says everyone was amazed what is this noise these strangers are making what's all this going on all this tamil these people are looking for the king of the jews what do you mean what's going on and they go and talk to herod and the wise men and you know and then they go and it's amazing because they go into the scripture themselves the scribes and pharisees and they say well he'll be born in bethlehem according to the scripture they didn't go down to bethlehem to see if he was there you think he has these three visitors crying out through the streets and alleys through jerusalem where is he born king of the jews you know expecting that they would know where he is and they have no idea where he is and what's going on and then and then they go and take the scripture and say well he'll be born in bethlehem and we know herod was a murderer anyway so he says you know you go find him come back and i'll come worship him you know if he was a real believer he would have been the first one in the front of the caravan you'd think jerusalem would have been emptied out every man woman dog you know every man and his dog and you know saying it that way they would have gone to bethlehem to see where the lord was but they didn't go and then so but then you read in the scripture when they come out of jerusalem they start making their way to bethlehem then the tsar appeared again because the traditions of man is like clouds which blocked the star light but once they got out of those traditions they could see where the star was and the star led them straight to where the christ was hallelujah and then the and then the wise men before they left where they came from in the east they they packed gifts that that was a revelation to them of what this man what this child would do we know they had they had gold frankincense and myrrh and it wasn't just because they were costly gifts but it was actually a representative of what what this baby messiah was going to achieve they had a revelation gold gold is deity so they had a revelation this was more than just a man but this was a god man being born deity made flesh heaven and earth became one hallelujah and then the frankincense is always mixed with prayer in the old testament so i was putting deity in the flesh now now he's going into service remember he came not to be ministered to but to minister right so you know that's what jesus says jesus said i haven't come that people would serve me i've come to serve the world right but then myrrh is a is a is a anointing spice food for the dead so they realize that death deity would become flesh and put into service to die for humanity that was their revelation and they and and then when they went to the place that should have known what this baby was going to perform they were the most surprised in jerusalem and so now here we are coming back joseph and mary are going down to bethlehem now as i said we're special people has jesus told you you're special you're the apple of his eye amen he'll bankrupt heaven before he lets you be lost amen he would rather you know that's how important you are to him his whole plan is hinged on you getting there you're going to get there jesus is going to get me there hallelujah how's it going to happen he'll get me there it's amazing here you know i i've been thinking about it you know imagine if if if we were there in the days of you know mary and joseph going down to bethlehem remember a lot of people were traveling and there here's a very pregnant woman on a donkey and a man is leading them they didn't look like anyone different there probably wasn't some great big aura like the hollywood movies trying to say some great you know they were just common looking people walking on the road but here was the greatest event god becoming man to redeem humanity that that that was prophesied of just just after the fall the first prophecy ever to come was that the seed of the woman was going to bruise the head of the seed of the serpent that a man was going to come and undo everything that just happened and here he was he was about to be delivered and he's just a man and a woman and a donkey going down the road maybe some great big carriages went past them maybe they had to pull off sometimes you know it's just like people don't change there's people who speed and there's people who cruise along on the road but imagine they maybe had to pull off the side of the road some great big carriages turning past and all these big white chargers and they're thinking they're you know they're the bees knees they've got it all together and they just nearly run over hallelujah the foster father and foster mother of emmanuel who she is carrying so i often think you know god you know he's so glorious he's so incredible you know he fills brother ram says hundred billion times of light space you go out into the eternal and then there's god you know but yet how he reveals himself is very different we think of this god of great glory who just said let there be sun moon and stars and here it is but yet brother ram says what makes him so great is because he can make himself so little and how easy it would have been for people just to walk right past maybe would have had some sympathy maybe we're thinking why are they traveling at this day you know what irresponsible father and different things and you know these people look so poor and you know maybe keep away from them they might you know but here was god coming to where he was pre-destined to be born in this place is everyone i'm about to close everyone's awake again good stay with me lunch will happen really well but here you know here they are coming down the greatest man is going to be born upon the earth and this is how he's being transported down here you know but god he's so great he can make himself so little amen and so here he was now to me now now this is just just me and my little mind just just dramatizing it but you know bethlehem was full of people and maybe and so and so the lord knows where he's going to be born remember when when when the prophecy came that he'd be born in bethlehem god wasn't wondering do you think it would be a stable do you think of being in maybe someone's house do you think they'll even make it to the city no he knew the stable he was going to be born in because it represented a part of his character to be born because remember lambs aren't born in inns they're not born in palaces brother brown would tell us that you know sure there were better places in the nation for the king of glory to be born there were the palaces in jerusalem you know they're great cities of refuge there's great places but he bypassed all of them because a lamb could never be born in those kind of places a lamb had to be born in a stable and so now and he also said you know that's stable and the people that came into that stable i mean we're actually reflecting god himself as well could you imagine the high priest with his wonderful clean robes walking into a manure full stable to see the christ no that would embarrass him he wouldn't yo i just got this tailored this is the finest silk from carthage or somewhere you know i'm not going to get this dirty in this place i'm not going to come see him there it would embarrass me and a lot of people feel that kind of way you know brother brown tells a story of um uh i think it's taught in the time of slavery i might be wrong but there was a there was a brother mo's and you know he got gloriously saved and he told his boss boss i got saved i got real heartfelt religion and he'd be testifying and things and you know he was getting he was salty so his boss started to get thirsty and so he said you know his boss said to him you know most i want that heartfelt religion too and then and then you know where can i get it and then and then they go to a hay loft and they go to kneel down and moe says you can't get it here then they go to another like a nice meadow he says no go to another place no and then so the boss says well where can i get it follow me and he walks straight to the pigpen starts squelching in the mud kneels down and then the boss you know because he was right by him because the other boss is excited right but then but then when they're about to go to the pigpen the boss stops moses in the pig pen he turns around and says aren't you coming in and he and he says no no i'm not coming and when moses then you don't want it why because people you don't really want it because people don't want to humble themselves because if he really wanted it he would have been there right with most he would have been kneeling down in the slope who cares about that and he would have got it but people aren't willing to humble themselves right to really get it hallelujah oh but i'm you know i've got to keep a reputation no we have no reputation i lost my rep i never had one to begin with hallelujah i was never part of the cool group and who cares about the cool group really i want to be in the one call group i want to be in the cool group which is the the one in heaven you understand hallelujah you know so yeah so could you imagine the high priest going in there maybe have a pig on his nose or maybe it's okay boys go and clean the place up first sweep me up sweep me a path then i'll come in he would never have gone in there but shepherds are very comfortable in a stable they're very comfortable they're right at home harley they don't have to say oh you know how do we act in this place and how do we no no they knew exactly how they were why because their nature was the same as that of the stable and we've got to have the nature of a stable hallelujah no you say on one hand well i'm just nothing but a stable yeah but you're very valuable to god because remember here they come into bethlehem and maybe maybe joseph tries the first in and it's got a no vacancy sign this is how a lot of people are when i'm talking about ins now i'm talking about how people's reaction to the gospel sometimes they just put up a sign don't even talk to me and then maybe maybe he went to another inn and then the door opened a little bit what do you want uh my wife's about to be delivered can you help you know can you have mercy on us please we've traveled a long way and she's you know she's already got uh you know contractions and you know it's more than a braxton hick contraction and you know you know no get out of here you know and then and and that's how some people are they'll they'll some people won't listen at all because they've got their own thing going on you know they've got their own thing going on they've got it all sorted out and got it sorted out you know i studied i studied pre-life evolution at university on the chemical level it doesn't work the own laws of chemistry forbid it happening but they have their theories as you know hydrothermal vents deep under the ocean that's where life first created and the laws of chemistry stop it happening but then an atheist will say no no when i talk about evolution i'm not talking about there i'm talking about when cells first mutated and you know became more than a single organism and and i just say hold on no no you've got to start at the start you can't jump because it takes faith to go from here now to this oh you're a believer now right oh no we just stick to the facts no no no you have faith if you can't work out what happened at the start and your own chemical laws forbid it happening then how how on earth can you say well we'll just ignore this but we'll just focus on this to prove there's no god no no no it doesn't work that way but they i don't know why i got onto that but you know that's it but it's how people are they've got their own thing going on they got it all sealed up this is how it works and then and then maybe they went to the third inn and the door came fully open maybe this one was just as grumpy and stressed about you know as everyone else because maybe they had to give up their own room for other travellers but then joseph said sir what do you want sir what you know help me please there's no room at the end but can't you see my can you see my yeah my wife and we've tried these other guys and you know other one just had a sign wasn't interested the other guy said just get out of here now here you're the last in bethlehem and then maybe he looks and you know feels sympathetic remember he's looking you think about outwardly he's looking at a very pregnant woman but in reality here's god about to be born emmanuel is about to be born this is incredible this has never happened before he says well there's that stable there that that cave in the side of the cliff you see it right there you can be there but really what god was doing is when joseph went to the first inn god was saying no i can't be born in there too proud he's got his own he's closed off to what i'm doing in this day then he goes to the second inn and god says no they've got their own agenda they want to do you know they've got their own kind of faith they won't open their hearts to me and then he comes to the third one and god's basically saying as soon as as soon as that innkeeper says yes there's a stable god says yes this is my predestinated place where i'm going to be born to the earth hallelujah and i'll just say it like this there's 7 billion people in the world i don't know how many billion were upon the earth when i was born or when i got saved but i'll say this god's infinite grace bypassed millions of people to find me at universities a lost drunk student he bypassed thousands and millions to find me you say well that's not very fair well it depends what side of the line you're on because to me i'm like thank you lord that's amazing grace hallelujah thank you lord you'd bypass and i don't know why you bypass them that's not my that i don't have to work that out all i have to do is say thank you lord be born in the manger of my heart harley and come live here make your abode in here and the reason is is because there's something in us remember it goes beyond this thing it goes beyond our temperament nothing to without temperament nothing to do with our raising our bracket in society it's got nothing to do with those things but there's a predestinated soul there's a seed of predestination in your soul where god says that's my manger hallelujah hallelujah now do i wait can i still drive this here we are i love wait we'll go back i like this statement here this is in the message of grace sovereign grace is from a sovereign one sovereign grace from a sovereign one sovereign what can it do sovereign can do whatever it wants to listen to this now sovereign grace can be only can only be given by one that's sovereign and god is sovereign so he can give sovereign grace therefore being sovereign grace don't have to ask anybody it don't have to it does what it wants to isn't that wonderful it don't have to ask can i do this or shall i do this can i must i will i doesn't do that it does it itself grace is sovereign therefore he can save the vilest glory he can save the worst hallelujah he can save the impurities thank you lord he can save the immoralist he can heal the sickest hallelujah so that remember god did not ever have to ask the devil could i take this one he never ever brought the devil into the equation when he was when he was moving on your life he never had to say uh devil do you mind if you just take your filthy hands off my property can you no no he just barged in there he says no this is my child and you have no say in this this is my child take your hands off my property hallelujah you have lost the battle and this is my son or my daughter he didn't ask the devil he just went and grabbed us hallelujah because remember he does what he wants to he's suffering amen i'm glad we serve a sovereign god i'm glad this is not parliament excuse me mr speaker uh can you you know no none of that imagine the opposition the devil would have so question time you know who cares about question time how god's suffering he does what he wants to hallelujah so so he chose the stable don't be offended you know on the count of the years they had their choice but he already chose that stable he's saying i can be born in this one as the same same with you and i as i said he bypassed billions of people to get you hella because he was looking for a manger he's looking for a specific kind of person and you should be saying right now hallelujah thank you lord i'm that specific kind of person he was looking for me and he found me hallelujah and he doesn't have to ask anyone about his children his children are his children and he's going to gather them he's going to get them he's going to redeem them and woe beat any spirit or person that will try and stop it hallelujah amen you know it's amazing too when you think about how how the lord protected his son you would think in our mind there would be the the elite of the army would be gathered around them right you would think that you know there would be a great you know incredible security he did have incredible security but how he how he led joseph was was by dreams now we know dreams are a secondary way that god speaks to a people normally he would speak through a prophet and you think such a magnitude of his son being born to the earth as as a lamb for our sins you'd think there'd be a prophet there too to conduct the way but there wasn't one there was a man and god dealt with him in dreams remember the first dream he was given as as he was questioning he was questioning in his heart about mary mary you know was you know was was visited by gabriel and you know she said let it be unto me according to thy word you'd think such a thing it was 800 years about between the time isaiah was was inspired to speak those words to finally when that predestinated womb was upon the earth do you know we're a predestinated people we're very special to god i may have to repeat that but we're very special people we're at the bow down to any spirit we don't have to be subservient to any other spirit anything but the word of god hallelujah so don't let anything get in your way that will wear you out stress you out break you down emotionally or physically or spiritually if something is wearing you down to that magnitude i would say hold on this is not god doing this right this is actually the devil trying to destroy me lead me to a mental breakdown and i'd say no this stops right now i'm not putting up it doesn't matter what they did and what they've done and you know i would say no no no no this ends this ends because remember the lake of fire hell was made for the devil and his angels we are made for a dwelling place of the living god and the new jerusalem is made for us hallelujah hallelujah you know when you know when you have a wedding or you have some great you know you have a birthday party or something and you send out invitations yeah you don't just put a thing on facebook i'm having a wedding such and such everyone's welcome bring a plate no no you handwrite an invitation or have it printed but you put the person's name and their family upon the invitation and then you send it to them you don't leave it on your table and think well maybe they'll get it you make sure they get it right and the people that are closest to you they you really make sure they get it hallelujah and you give a rsvp date and everything but you know in your heart those who will accept it right just for example you know when we got married and we invited say you know our immediate families we you know we knew they'd come we didn't have to guess i wonder if my parents will be there i wonder if christine's parents will be there i wonder if my siblings will be there you know no no we knew they'd be there right so it's the same thing but some people were invited we knew they wouldn't be there but we gave them an opportunity right but it's the same thing with the lord when he gave you an invitation to the wedding supper he knew in his heart you'd accept it he knew in his heart you'd accept it he wasn't wondering i wonder if brother queben will receive me and let me live through his life for the rest of his days and take a rapture i wonder no he knew hallelujah he knew exactly that was going to happen i mean it was the same thing when god gives the invitation to the wedding supper to you he knows you'll say of course i will hallelujah why would i not do that hallelujah so he wasn't guessing so so when when gardner's great mind had the plans for the new jerusalem and however we're going to live in the other dimensions and you know he is the best city planner there is right he does not build things for now but when they're built they're five years down the track and they're not big enough he's the perfect city planner right he knows exactly what he's doing so so when he planned the new jerusalem he knew who would be there he knew where they would be he knew if they would be you know in the city outside the city if they were just the temple guards or you know what position the bride different ones we know there's we you know we know there's different places you know heaven is not a communistic state hallelujah you know but he knew so when he thought of the new jerusalem he thought of you and he thought of you being there hallelujah and and his thoughts can't change so he he saw the city and he saw the inhabitants of the city and he saw how those inhabitants would receive him in the earth and when they'd come here and he saw them there hallelujah so now that's why when he gave out the invitation because brother ram says this message he says the bridegroom call will come right through this what is that that's an invitation to the wedding and not as a gift but actually standing at the altar as the bride now we know the marriage takes place here but there's a wedding supper is the reception afterwards hallelujah and the food will be great hallelujah we won't be disappointed with that one that's for sure not there anyway hallelujah but you know he knows exactly no i just want you know you're special to god hallelujah remember he gave if you really want to give someone a gift who's who's a real gifty person here who likes to give gifts and you know we all like to receive gifts i mean that you know but but who likes to really give gifts yeah so you put a lot of thought and a lot of heart and and what you give it's actually it's not just the object and you're not emotionally attached that object actually your heart is in that gift right your heart is in that gift you you want them to receive it in the spirit and the love that is given in amen and so it's the same thing with our lord he is the ultimate gift-giver right and he didn't just you know sometimes you uh you know sometimes you think when you give you know people get up in years you think what am i going to give them for their birthday or you know for christmas and you know the default i will just get them a voucher or something you know which is which is all very good nothing wrong with vouchers okay but you know but they could turn around and say not a lot of thought went into that voucher even though it's probably exactly what you wanted but some vouchers you get for multiple things you can get a queensgate vouching you can spin it any you know hello are we all here you know what i mean so but you but the person who receives it could either say thank you very much that's what i needed or they could say well actually you just got me a voucher you did not put a lot of thought and heart into this gift but if they but if they were given a specific thing that they really wanted then the one who received it could actually realize the giver gave them exactly what they needed exactly what was on their heart now you know we needed salvation we needed a lamb we needed a lamb we needed one to stand in the gap hallelujah to be our sin offering right we needed one so so when the lord gave a gift to us remember he didn't just give us a voucher he didn't just send a card and twenty dollars nothing wrong with that but you know then you know he didn't just he didn't just you know like uh he put a lot of effort into his gift he put incredible effort incredible heart into his gift and he wanted to give us the best hallelujah and he gave us the best he didn't give us a second class gift he gave us the best gift he gave us eternal life here was eternal life and it was born in a manger now this mange as i said was predestinated god chose it as the same thing with you and i now we are pre i i like the word predestination because if my destiny is predetermined and i know my destiny is to go on a rapture and is to go into the new heavens and new earth you know in the new jerusalem i'm pretty happy about that that's a good deal what did you have to do well i just have to receive it hallelujah get my whole life to it done but brother rahm says you're improving his word in the last days there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest and we're now living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man so he's saying i'm just going to take the first part of that that there has to be a place for the word a place prepared for the word to be made manifest now i'm sure we can all agree that manger or that stable even the manger in the stable was a place prepared it was a prepared place for emmanuel to take his first sleep on the earth it was the first place i meant yeah it was the place that he'd be born it was a place prepared for the word to be made manifest now we know that we are when we think of christmas that's just a historical event but there's another place for the word to be born into and it's far greater than a stable but it's the soul of man for for god to be united with humanity that word to be made manifest in a person's life that's an incredible thing hallelujah you know you don't need to go to bethlehem to see a stable and if you go nowadays while the some orthodox church just built a big ugly you know church on that location and you've got to pay i don't know how much to get into it and you know so the stable's not there anyway but you know there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest so we know that in every generation there is a word right every season so there was a word for the book of acts now we we sell our book of acts church we know that but then there was a word of restoration with luther and wesley and pentecost and then now the fullness of that word was manifest in this message right it was the son of man revealed jesus christ but brother rahm says that that that the son of man jesus christ being revealed wasn't just to be in one person but and to be a multi-member body and so what it was in the fullness of the prophet now it's now down through a body so the son of man jesus christ is still being revealed today it's in you and i remember that we're not here to manifest an argument or a debate or an intellectual understanding we're here to manifest the word jesus christ that that that he would live again so so just as the manger was prepared so our hearts were prepared to for a place for god to manifest his word in hallelujah now now to me well i just love that i am by god's grace a prepared place and i was not prepared to be a habitation of devils though under my first nature and the things i got into in this world i was a habitation of devils i was but god said no no this is this is not what is meant to be in this in this manger this is not what meant to be in this stable and he had to clear it out i mean by the power of his blood that he could make his abode in the stable and manifest himself out hallelujah i love it where you know the first time the name of jesus is spoken here in matthew 1 he says now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was the spouse of joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost now it's amazing when you think about this only gabriel only mary spoke to gabriel it wasn't a group revelation this was her revelation but joseph wasn't leaping for joy at first when she told him honey because you know there comes a time where where a woman can't hide a pregnancy and i don't know how quickly she would tell him about this but you know there came a time where they had that maybe it was an uncomfortable kind of discussion no doubt mary would have brought it up first and would have explained the visitation of the angel in different things but you know he was troubled about this and it goes to show that a testimony doesn't always make everyone leap for joy right but it was anchored in her heart it was emmanuel that was being formed in her womb hallelujah but he was troubled but so but it took the lord to come and speak to him and say no no what she is telling you is the truth so found with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily but while he thought on these things he was thinking should i marry her should i not what shall i put her away how's you know what's the fallout of this going to be you know all these things this is what he's thinking about behold the angel lord appeared unto him in a dream saint joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mirror thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and he shall bring and she sorry shall bring forth the son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins so so joseph was thinking well maybe i just got to put away privately and you know obviously he would have been heartbroken at that thought because he would have loved her but then the angel lord came to him in a dream now this was god protecting his son because joseph was ordained to be a shield i mean to mary and i mean yeah yet to mary and jesus but you know so so this is how he he he guarded the child by a secondary way of a dream because there's no prophets in the land but then he tells remember that angel tells him here you shall call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now when i think of being saved when when he shall save his people from their sins it's not a you know to me it's not well you know you get rescued from one sin just to fall into another sin and then you get pulled into another sin then you get pulled out of that sin that's not what he's talking about he's talking about when he talks about being saved from their sins this word save in the greek it means safe it means to save that is deliver or protect to heal preserve to be made whole so to me when he says he shall save his people from their sins it's going to be i'm going to deliver them from that sin and they're never going to go back into it right there's going to be a full deliverance out and they're not going to go back in hallelujah now in order for this to happen the lord has to do a work on the inside of the inside of us because we you know we as as as human beings born with a fallen first nature we are more aligned with the devil and sin than we are with god with our first nature that's why the scripture tells us not one seeks after god so built in us naturally there's nothing in us to seek after god but because of a seed of predestination and you know there's actually a hunger and a thirst there's got to be more to life than this you know maybe we may have tried many things tried to fit in many different kind of places but they didn't satisfy that's because it was something that was calling but we didn't know what we were calling to but god was drawing us the whole time hallelujah so god had to come and he actually had to break that sin nature by us giving it to him he had to actually kill that out of our lives now if we look at with with moses and the golden calf you know he came down off the mountain and they heard a noise in the camp and they didn't know what it was it says it came to pass that as he came nine to the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and break them beneath the mount so here was a man under the blood of balls and goats when he saw something that was contrary to the word he broke the word he couldn't keep it and he took the calf which was made and burnt it in the fire and ground it to powder and stored it upon the water and made the children of israel drink it now what he is doing there he's not just punishing them with yucky water but he's actually signifying because remember that golden calf where did it come from we say well it was the earrings and things and aaron made the calf no no where did it come from it came from the hearts of the people because they wanted a god that they could see that they could worship but it's amazing that while that was being made moses was on the mountain getting the revelation of the word from god so if they just waited they would have got something to worship so so that golden calf game came out of the hearts of the people because remember this is man's nature is to worship something right you can worship you can worship people worship them themselves this is a selfie generation it's all about me me me what you know what is the main thing about an instagram account look at me this is what i you know this is where i'm living and it's all you know staged and fake and and it's amazing there's studies done that people who have now this is not always true but the majority of people that have the happiest looking photos online then they're the most unhappy in reality so they put forward a fake representation of who they are like look at my happy family and all this stage stuff and when the camera's turned off they're devouring each other at home some people actually are happy you know during the photo and after the photo but a lot of people are happy in the photo but it's just it's just staged there's no reality in that so it's you know you can worship yourself but you see so what happened is this calf came out of the people and moses was by by by strawing it he i thought um ye so he grounded the powder and strawed it upon the water and made the children of israel drink of it what are you signifying is now that idolatry was actually still in the people went back into them because the blood of bulls and goats could not destroy i mean that that fallen nature and man for them to be an idol worshiper but the blood of jesus christ does hallelujah so now now here we are because remember he shall save his people from their sins so god had to come and actually deliver us from a fallen nature we're born with hallelujah and the only way he could do that is is when he comes in he kills that sin nature now brother brown when he talks about you know our body else our spirit and our soul he says in a couple of places he says about how the holy ghost god has to kill that snake he says it's either in the soul or in the spirits there's that serpent nature that we're born with that god has to kill and that's why someone who's really met the lord is a new creature why because how we think has been transformed our outlook our appetite you know everything we are we've been made new again sure we'll have our failures we'll form or stumble but you know but if our nature's been changed hallelujah if our nature's if there's life there you know you take children you know not you know it won't be very long you know william kind of half just capsizes onto his side he can't roll all the way but there'll come a time where he'll roll because he wants to move he sees his sisters come and run and dance and play and go off and no doubt he's like i want to do that too hallelujah you see it in babies there's a desire because there's life they want to be like a mature adult right that's why you know we should spend time with our children and get them on board it may take 20 times longer than normal if it's just you but you know they want to be part of everything we do remember steve brisson mentioned this at that camp hallelujah and so and so there's a desire as long as life is in his body and he just keeps eating food hallelujah he will eventually be walking and he'll be talking and he'll probably be more coordinated than me you know i was i was had the boys out the back at our place on wednesday we had like reuben and liam and and jono and jonathan were there and and we got the cricket set out now you know the girls are you know trying to you know get them to play qriket and different things and i told them you know i said i said i'm going to teach the girls to bowl an in-swinging yorker okay so a non-cricket player language as it's a as a bowl you bowl really fast and the ball swings through the air and it's and it's aimed to land on the batsman's feet that's an you know either swings in or swings out and so i said you know that's what i want to teach them and i in my stupidity i begin to explain this to the boys and then what they do is they're playing cricket and every one of them bowled it and right on the batsman's feet i thought man i've gotta i've got to work on my game so they knew what i was talking about but initially they could not do that but they saw it being done somewhere and they had a desire i want to do that too that's pretty cool why because as long as there's a desire and now i'm talking about christian things now as long as there's a desire and don't let the devil ever take that desire out of you because we're going to realize there's many desires we have in life right we have a desire you know there's a natural desire in a person to have children to get married have children right natural desire to travel natural desire to have a job buy a house that's all natural desires but don't ever let it don't ever let it become first place in your life hallelujah because sometimes people think oh an evidence of the holy ghost is all i want is jesus and nothing else but god doesn't just switch off you know he doesn't switch off those desires but they come into their place you're following me right you know people get all 12 but you know there's this and this and i want to do this and this and does it mean i know the lord well who's number one because if he's number one he will guide those desires it won't be you guiding yourself but it will be the lord actually saying because you know sometimes we say well i want to do this and the lord just shuts the door you know i remember this is when we just got married you know i was i was going to go to teachers college and you know i wanted to be a teacher because i didn't want to be a lab monkey and you know and um before i met the lord the last thing the lord took from me is is actually i was worshiping my education i want to become a professor i want to climb the ivory tower and become a biochemist and but but it became my everything now there's nothing wrong with education nothing wrong with those things but remember what's first place right so but it became my everything the lord just said you're worshiping your education so i gave it to him but i didn't quit the studies i finished the studies but now he was number one so um and then and then i had this you know i was thinking now what am i going to do because i didn't want to i didn't even finish my master's but at that stage i was planning to finish my masters and then i wasn't going to do a phd at a you know and i didn't want to become a lab monkey as i call it so i thought well i'll become a science teacher and i just had such a euphoric feeling over me i'm going to be a teacher nothing wrong with being a teacher but then i enrolled into the um the um program which trains you to be a teacher and and i was put into because i want to be a science teacher a chemistry teacher i thought if i'm a chemistry teacher i'll avoid teaching evolution but then you know i start we got married i start teachers college and man it's your life you know hats off to teachers you know it's a calling but you know it was just i thought of my mind well i've got all these holidays therefore we'll be able to do mission work and you know it'll be oh no you know it's not that way but you know then but then i was praying i speak but my see the thing is my feelings were leading me i was excited about it but that wasn't a word from the lord and so i came to a spot wrong like lord do you really want me to actually be a teacher and so we prayed about it and the very next week we're teaching evolution to the junior science class not the theory of but a fact so i just said to them well i can't do this i quit and i became a lab monkey and we moved to you know but the thing is you got to be careful don't let your feelings lead you let the lord lead you and then when the lord leads you he'll bring the feelings right so you've got to say what is first place now so there are many desires that we have but you know but okay now going back to babies that's where i was see they have a desire in them to walk they won't be able to just stand up and just start walking have you ever seen a baby just maybe there's some in the world but you know they never you know they never ever you know stand up and fall over they just perfectly walk first time no they they hold on to things they walk along and you know and then they kind of push off and go into space and you know they're kind of like this and they fall over and things they fall over and hurt themselves but they walk and eventually they don't have to think about it they don't have to just hold on they can just keep walking it's the same thing being a believer as long as there's a desire lord i want to be like you that's why i got to focus what is really the desire in my heart now don't let the devil cloud it over don't let him take it away you know we can walk it first and we can fail many times you know i still trip over sometimes right walking naturally now yeah spiritually too but there's a desire i want to walk i want to be just like the lord hallelujah says so it should be the same thing with us now but you see he had to he had to come and he had to break he had to take a idolatry out of people and the only way he could do that was by the blood of jesus christ the blood of bulls and gods could never do it hallelujah i'm so glad we can be made new creatures don't you remember he shall save his people from their sin so he's gonna save them from them and they'll never go back hell it's not an in and out thing you're in hallelujah you've been delivered hallelujah you know there's a thing if you have to keep yourself from something because you're afraid you'll fall into it you've got to get rid of it now that doesn't mean you like so for example i've used this example over the years i could i used to make beer i drank a lot of it but the lord took that out of me i didn't i didn't have to say well thou shalt not drink the lord just took the desire away and so i could live in a brewery and i'd still be a sober man because the desire for it is not there it's gone i and i you know i can't help that i don't want it back but it's gone so it's the same thing now now i don't have to keep from from alcohol i don't have to you know stay away from that part of the supermarket or stay away from the body low and you know because there's nothing in me that wants it i can't help that i'm just happy it's gone so you know it's the same thing it should be the same thing with us you know it's not we're keeping ourselves from things but he changes our nature that it doesn't bother us anymore now i was talking on the power of prayer power of speech power over holy life amen that's what the holy ghost has to do some of you people walking along saying well i just can't quit drinking i can't i just can't quit this the holy ghost comes to live in you to make all these get away from you that's right make women stop cutting hurt their hair make them quit wearing shorts and slacks no excuses makes them quit tattling oh yes that's what it's for to make you live a holy life see how he puts this kind of thing with this kind of thing it's all the same to god oh yes that's what it's for to make you live a holy life it'll follow the instructions of the bible every time a woman says it's just too hot i just have to wear these it gives me a headache if i let my hair grow but there's no excuses with the holy ghost it's there to make it so it'll follow the word just exactly that's what the holy ghost is to do is to make you man turn your head from them half naked woman and quit lusting after them and the church members and that's what is to do is to quit making you smoke and drink and want to be a big shot you know someone who wants to be the biggest in the group it'll take that out of you it'll take that out of you it'll humble you when you do that that's what the holy ghost is for it's for a holy life that's right make it quick gossiping make equip playing cards shooting craps now that's another gambling game i had to google that one and all these other things that you do around the corner it'll make you quit you're carrying on the way you're doing living untrue to your wife that's what it'll do that's right it'll quit making you want to marry someone else's wife that's exactly right that's what it is it's to make you live a holy life that's what the holy ghost is powerful to set your affections on things above where god stands by the right hand of the majesty on high the mind of christ is in you you can't help from seeing those things when you look at them you turn your head that's right it is to make you you say i can't do it oh i can't do it sure you can't but the holy ghost i mean holy spirit can't come for that purpose that's what it did as you take it out of you and all them old habits and things you're doing i mean so it takes the counts out and gives you overcoming power i'm so glad it's that way hell it's not i saw i can't do it no no he takes it out of you hallelujah what is this he shall save his people from their sins hallelujah hallelujah now he says here in james let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lusts and enticed then when he hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished bringeth forth death so it's we are enticed away by our own lusts but if that thing's killed there's nothing to be enticed with sure you can't help from seeing these things but you turn your head right but you know the thing is if if the devil can get us to agree with something then he's got us amen but remember he's a liar i think brother impal said doesn't matter if he's saying the truth he's lying because of who he is hallelujah so we don't have to put up with his nonsense now i love this the steps of a good man are ordered of the lord now i just want to go back to my opening statements then we're going to then we're going to finish we're very special people right we're a very special people now actually i want to go back to this guy i got something in my notes this is why i don't like slideshows now when a man what happens is people you can get so used to a captive someone who's holding you captive that you can actually begin to love that thing or love that person right there's a there's a syndrome called stockholm syndrome who's heard of stockholm syndrome now this is just from healthline.com says stockholm syndrome is a psychological response it occurs when hostages or abuse victims bond with their captors or abusers this psychological connection develops over the course of the days weeks months or even years of of captivity or abuse with the syndrome hostages or abuse victims may come to sympathize with their captives this is the opposite of fear terror and disdain that might be expected from victims of these situations over the course of time some victims do come to develop positive feelings towards their captors they may even begin to feel as if they share common goals and causes the victim may begin to develop negative feelings towards the police or authorities so those who are actually there to protect and save them they may resent anyone who may be trying to help them escape from the dangerous situations that they're in this paradox does not happen with every hostage or victim and it's unclear why it occurs when it does many psychologists and medical professionals consider stockholm syndrome as a coping mechanism or a way to help victims handle the trauma of a terrifying situation indeed the history of the syndrome may help explain why that is so what does that mean you're tormented by a spirit but you can come to actually love that spirit but it abuses you it uses you you know there can be a cycle of shame that you know you know there was a cycle of my life you're drinking and you wake up hung over and you'd remember terrible things you did and i'll never drink again you just go back into the thing why because the stockholm syndrome because you love the spirit but there came a point where i hated it so my stockholm syndrome had to break that that thing could abuse me no more right and then i set free so anything you know so that's the thing when people actually begin to have a positive relationship with the spirit you know but but i've done you good in your life look with look where i've got you i've done so much for you i've helped you so much and then they begin to love the thing but that thing's abusing and using them tearing them down breaking them down emotionally you know mentally in everything we can't ever look at anything like that you following me we can't ever sympathize because if you sympathize with a spirit you'll never be free of that spirit and the devil would always say but i love you i love you so much and he's just an abusive partner because you'll say on one hand i love you the other hand he'll be beating you you know mistreating you making you think you're worthless you're worth nothing you'll never amount to anything but i love you you know there's a there's a way to break people and torture where where people are tortured and someone comes and interrogates them and they're the bad cop they pour it on but then what happens is someone else comes in and they're the friend they're working for the same people who are trying to get information out of out of the hostage they're working for the same government but one comes in and really threatens them and i'm gonna kill you and this is gonna happen i'm gonna get your family because they're trying to get information but then the other guy comes in and he's he's pretending to be the buddy and that's what people do to try and break people's will to get things out of them and that's what the devil does as well he comes along abuses downtrodden you know makes you feel horrible different things but then he comes along says i'm your pal we've had some good times haven't we and sometimes you say you know some people say yes we have had some good times i'm here to look at you it's fine i'm here to look after you whatever more but actually he's working for the same group that wants to destroy you because that's why when the devil comes along where'd this come from not from a root that's not from your soul where this stuff come from this is the devil trying to be your buddy let's have some good times man let's go do it again let's go do it again no no and you gotta say hold on this ends right now this ends right now i'm not dealing with you another minute you can talk to my lawyer the holy ghost is the lawyer you can talk to my people i'm done hallelujah oh but i love you no you don't love me you want to kill me amen and the lord does not want us stuck in that kind of thing he wants us free do you think it rejoice it makes him happy when he sees us go through those things you know he's our kinsmen redeemer but you know another part of being a kinsman redeemer is a kinsmen avenger who's heard of a kinsmen avenger a kinsmen avenger has the right just say if someone wronged me and they were proven to to wrong me and they were part of my family they have the right to go um ex put the avenge carry out the avenge on the one who wronged me that's the kinsmen redeemer i mean i mean a kissman avenger and our lord is a kinsmen redeemer but he's a kinsman avenger right the devil that's troubled us troubled our families troubles our children troubles our lives there will be a time holy where he is kinsman avenger and he will pour his wrath out upon those spirits and they will burn in the lake of fire and they will be no more and they'll be shown guilty and they'll be gone he will be our kinsmen avenger imagine the satisfaction imagine the satisfaction that he'll get this enemy that he made hallelujah that he's tormented his children all the way down through you can say now satan this has come to an end you know i was thinking of the words and you know in the book of revelation where the lord says it's done and all the way down through the scripture he could say to the devil it's done but it's not done i'm not finished here hallelujah what do you mean by that he walks into egypt gathers the children of israel out of there he'd say it's done so the part that's done is they've been delivered but it's not done because christ has got to come and i'm going to dwell in my people once again you know the temple's built everything's done and then the lord comes himself purchases our salvation on calvary hallelujah he says it's finished it's finished but it's not finished right he paid the price that part's been finished but the rest of part that's not finished is we're going to be in a new heavens and a new earth down you know around the dancing on streets of gold so it comes to save the devil in the days of moses it's done but it's not done you know sometimes you think is it over yet who's ever been who's ever been in that you said in an exam where you you know you know are we there yet who's ever sat in the car we're there yet it's like a million hours and it's just down the road are we there yet you know sometimes i think maybe the devil says that sometimes is it done because he's been tormented our christmas gift torments him i'm talking about eternal life you know and so he says it's done no no this is just me i mean my little mind i enjoy these kind of things yeah and the lord says it's done but it's not done but then it's inching forwards towards it and then he says malachi fall hallelujah bride rises upon the earth but he says the devil devil is done but it's not done because he couldn't stop this word coming to you and i hallelujah and then they take it up in a rapture we are but god says the devil now it's done but it's not done because i've gathered my bride she's up and up in glory it's done but it's not done and then he and then he calls the two witnesses they come to come to israel 144 000 of birth into the kingdom they enjoy you know i you see photos of the wailing wall and the jews they're crying out for the restoration of the temple what you went there right yeah you would have been such a feeling the thing they're crying out for we are because we are that temple we are that temple that they want and and there's 144 000 that will be the temple too right but they're crying out for this restoration and here we are and the lord says what their that that longing they have in their heart they'll get it one day but you you didn't even have that longing but you're part of that building you're that main job been looking for and i'm going to restore you back before there was a fall hallelujah i'm going to restore all things and place them in your hand hallelujah and then so tribulation happens all those things there's the millennium god says the devil is done but it's not done and then he's loosed for a season and he's cast in the lake of fire and he could say to the devil now it's done amen that is done hallelujah amen amen let's just read this and go the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be at least cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand i've been young and now i'm old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and and lendeth and his seed is blessed depart from evil and do good and dwell forevermore for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints what's my status not forsaken i never can be and they are preserved forever hallelujah but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off but this tells me i'm not forsaken and i'm preserved amen jude says to the server the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in christ jesus then called he's talking about me jude's writing to me hallelujah what's this got to do with the manger that's who we are we are that stable a prepared place and if the musicians could come i'll just close with and put this back up there has to be a in the last days there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest that's us and now we're living off we're living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man that's the word come open to you and i we're living by the evidence of that new land hallelujah what have you been trying to say to us simple that stable was predestined by god to to to house him and you are the same way god had in his mind i'm going to have a people i'm going to dwell on those people i'm going to manifest my word and those people and he thought of you when he said that hallelujah is christmas really that great you can have tinsel nothing wrong with tinsel or you can celebrate eternal life aren't you glad we have the greatest gift without money or price he says here's eternal life i want to be born on you hallelujah how could you turn it down amen let's let's down to our feet and we're going to pray and then i want to sing that song when he opened his word i've been watching that a bit over the weekend it just it just thrills my heart amen let's let's pray together i ask you a question do you see how god sees you do you see yourself as someone trodden down who's not special who's not worth it or do you see yourself at greater value god put a greater value on your your soul than he did his own life and he'd do it all again if he had to do it or you know you're all again to purchase your salvation so if you think you're worth nothing look into the scripture and see what god thinks about you doesn't make you proud doesn't make you arrogant makes you humble if anything but just think about it lord you put my life on greater valley than your own and that's why you were born in a manger amen so let's just pray together this morning gracious lord jesus i just pray dear god these these little chopped up words lord i just pray to god that we would see ourselves lord as you see us the value you put on our souls lord lord it was a joy lord you said in your word that it was a joy set before you you endured the cross despising the shame sit down on the right hand the majesty on high lord that joy was us redeemed but you you said for this cause i've come into the world i've come to purchase the salvation of my people and you shall be called jesus for you shall save your people from their sins and i believe i'm standing in your presence lord jesus with with many here who have who who are a living manifestation of that lord you have saved them from their sins you've made them new creatures in you and lord as as you're born in a manger just over 2 000 years ago lord what a what a day of worship that should be lord we think of your birth we know you're born in spring but we thank you we have it on the calendar that we can worship you we can remember your birth and lord there'll be many gifts traded and given lord between us between families and parents and children different ones but lord i pray as we give those gifts to one another lord may in our hearts just be that great gift you gave us lord of eternal life lord of forgiveness lord of lord of overcoming power lord of you lord not just being a distant god as as as you were lord when you came down on mount sinai and the children of israel they could only come to a certain place they couldn't come any closer to the mountain but lord you you weren't that kind of god that wanted a lord a separation between you and your people that's why you shed your blood upon the earth to break that middle wall of partition down break that chasm oh god to bridge that gulf that no man could bridge but you lord i want to thank you for that dear god thank you lord that you're not far from us lord you said you'll be with us even in us to the end of the world so lord i just pray dear god may you lord to the outside world we may seem just like a stinking stable but lord in that stable in bethlehem you were born emmanuel lord jesus and lord i pray to god each and every one of us here may we open the manger of our hearts lord lord may you be born in us lord may your word be born in us oh god maybe more than a song but may it be a reality lord that you come and dwell on the inside of the inside of us lord and you live lord may you grant it dear god may we may we house deity lord in these little stables oh god that we are of these bodies lord may you grant it lord i just want to pray for each one here lord may they know that you love them with an unfailing love not as a man could love a woman as a human love or other way but as a as a love of god that does not does not diminish does not grow old does not wax stale or common but it's rich and pure and gets greater all the time oh god lord may you ground it lord may each one know that they are loved by you and treasured by you o god as the apple of your eye may you grant it lord for your glory we just ask these things in your wonderful name and name the lord jesus christ amen amen hallelujah amen let's sing this together shall we amen
