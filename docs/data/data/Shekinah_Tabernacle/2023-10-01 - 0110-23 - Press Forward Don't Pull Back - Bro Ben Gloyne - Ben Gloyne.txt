bless you oh boy amen great to have you all here amen let's just go to the scripture uh this morning I think if I've got control this going to Hebrews chapter 10 and we're going to read just some verses here Hebrews 10:35 to39 amen amen so Hebrews 10: 35-39 then we're going to go to Genesis 15 and just verse one amen so so Hebrews 10:35 says here cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not t now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him for we are not of them who draw back un predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul yeah amen and then we got just here just you can just read it on the screen just the save time if you wish says here in uh Genesis 15:1 and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward amen I trust we'll link these scriptures together as we go along but amen who wants to surrender all this morning who wants a closer walk with God and a greater consecration amen let's just pray together shall we gracious father Lord you see the hands that have been raised this morning Lord the the desire behind every hand is Lord we want a Closer Walk with You Lord we want more of you oh God less of us and More Of You Lord we're so thankful we can come into your great presence Lord because of your blood because of what you have done so dear God I pray we just focus on you this morning Lord what you have done for us oh God your great work in our lives Lord your mercy that is new Every Morning Lord we need you to come on the scene oh God and just may you stir us up Lord may you awaken us father may you Quicken us to your word Lord Jesus Grant it father we commit Our Lives into your hands we ask

that he can be to the front of the queue Lord Jesus granted dear God and may He touch every life here Lord meet every need for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning I mean I want to speak about pressing forward and not drawing back I mean I trust that's everyone's desire this morning we don't want to draw back we want to press on I mean we want more of God we don't want to stay where we are we want to go forward amen now everyone who's ever done anything for God has has um they haven't sat back in the shadows but they've pressed the battle I mean I just want to find some brother brand would say this in the second Miracle he says that's right you're not here to a picnic where everything is handed down to you in a silver spoon am mean you've got if I must fight if I must Reign because uh increase my courage Lord must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas now I must fight if I must rain increase my courage Lord help me and support me by thy Everlasting word yes sir stand on God's word now this is this is a um this is not a an this is like an ABD version of of John Wesley's diary now notice the trouble he went through I'm just going to read it Sunday morning May the 5th preached in St ANS was asked not to come back anymore Sunday p.m. May the 5th preached at St John's Deon said get out and stay out Sunday morning May the 12th preached at St Jude can't go back there either Sunday p.m May the 12th preached at St George is kicked out again Sunday morning May 19th preached that at St somebody else's deacons called special meeting said I couldn't return Sunday p.m. May 19th preached on the street Ked off the street Sunday a.m. May 26th preached in the meadow chased out of the meadow as a bll was turned loose during the service Sunday a.m. the second June preached out of the edge of town was kicked off the highway Sunday p.m. uh second of June afternoon service preached in a pasture 10,000 people came to hear me now this was this was the experience that that that that that John Wesley went through many times he wasn't welcome as as we read he was kicked out of many churches and they and and the reason they got offended at him is because he basically told them you need to know the Lord you need to know Christ you can't just be in a church and be and and say you're a Christian we're all Sinners saved by grace but you need to be saved by grace and they got offended at him because of that now he had a lot of difficulty in his life but he didn't let the difficulty stop him he had a lot of trouble but he didn't let the trouble stop him they'd say well but he was the church age Messenger to the Philadelphia and church age he didn't know that I mean he didn't know his position in the world he just had a burning in his heart that there's lost and dying people out there they've got to know Christ that was his burden that was the thrust of his whole life and he didn't draw back because of all the trouble we just read about you know this would be quite discouraging but there's a difference between discouragement and drawing back okay so when I talk about drawing back I'm not talking about being discouraged we all get discouraged but we shouldn't let the discouragement turn into drawing back okay so so sure we all get discouraged in life we will be and if you haven't you will get it okay but discouragement comes and goes but I trust there's an anchor in the soul that keeps you in spite of all discouragement I mean Teddy Roosevelt Theodore Roosevelt who is one of the um I think he was yeah he was he was the president of the United States uh he you know he was quite a um quite a forceful kind of a man had a lot of energy he said this this is this is from a speech about the man in the arena he says it's not the critic who counts we're all going to have critics they don't count okay don't worry about the critic don't let don't let any critic make you draw back we're pushing on okay it's not the critic who counts it's not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the do of the Deeds could have done them better you know it's amazing how when it comes to any great sporting event there's so many arm armchair coaches and managers and Sportsmen that dissect their team and their failures or their successes and even in successes they rate the players on the field how good they did none of those critics are on the field none of those critics gave their time and their energy and their passion to end up on the field they they couldn't do it they weren't even built to do it I mean you see the smallest scrawniest white guy who's the big biggest critic of the All Blacks he couldn't stand 5 seconds on the field I mean even the smallest player of an international team will just Bowl him over and he'd be in the hospital but yet he'll criticize he'll blame the coaches he wasn't picked to be coach he wasn't in the coaching St you just think about this there's so many critics will criticize but they'll never put one ounce of time or try and get to where that person is that they're criticizing and the reason they're criticizing really is because they're jealous of where that other person is we must never let jealousy come among us we must never be unhappy when someone else is blessed if you want God to bless you you be happy when someone is blessed if you want to be actually stay in the darkness criticize when God does something so we should always be happy when God does something Hallelujah I mean you want God to use you be happy when he uses to someone else amen so it's not see the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena amen whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who ears who come short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcomings I pray God just brand these words into our hearts amen there is no effort without error and shortcoming you say well I fail all the time get up and keep going get up and keep going amen but who does actually strive to do the Deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the Triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly I'd rather I'd rather end up in that category than not do anything at all I mean so that his place will never be with those cold and timid Souls who neither know Victory nor defeat I think we should be like this man in the arena amen because remember it's not those on the sideline the critics who think they know better but actually not called for the job it's those who are in the arena that count God's called us into a great arena in this day amen God's called us to fulfill his word in this day see God wants vessels to manifest himself through and you just happen to find yourself in that position so we're not called to draw back and say well you know because we can sit in church and be drawn back that's right you know I'm not talking about just people who just go and leav in the world but we can actually draw back within ourselves and not pess the battle I mean we can be hide behind our families behind our church behind whatever some excuse and draw back but let's not draw back let's push on Amen let's let's let's press the battle Hallelujah see now this confidence is you I'm just going to break down you I love to look into the meaning of words because to me it just brings out the scripture a lot more so cast not away your confidence right so this confidence the Thea Bible dict tells us is a freedom in speaking and unreserved and speech and open frankly without concealment yeah this world does not like Frank talk it doesn't even like debate are many discussions that we would you know talk about you know there's a lot of things that we can't talk about you know I heard sorry Josh I'm just throw you into it but they were talking about transgender stuff in their classroom and you know the teacher says is there any questions he says we can't really talk about this can we just move on we can't really say what we want to say can we just move on that's how this world is but at least he's honest to say because everyone else is W to say he's the only honest one in the class is you know you know we're not going to accept what we're going to say so let's just move on with it right but you see this world has come in such a way that we can't be frank sometimes we need to be frank sure there sometimes we got to be a little bit gentle but sometimes there's got a frankness got to come I mean that you can't just pity party with the devil you got to go really push on let's go beyond you know the poor Mees of life if our focus is is on us in any way we're not going to get it we're going to draw back and we're going to get into that soon I mean so it's it's without ambiguity or circum location of that's how you say that word now that word basically means just saying a word salad who's heard that word you know a word salad like a politician ask a question and they give a 20 minute answer but they don't answer anything that's a word s just throw out some words and maybe just you know that's basically what that word means I had to look it up you know so people say what do you believe don't let it be a word salad let it be God's restored the truth of his word God has sent a prophet sure there's a lot of scarecrows but he's restored his word we have the book of Acts his word is alive he's true he's not an argument he lives come and see amen let me share my testimony what it's how it's impacted my life amen I think that's a pretty straight way to answer because you are God's billboard right we are the advertising amen hallelujah and we say hey this thing works praise God I I tasted and saw the Lord is good he's changed my life amen see without use of figures and comparison see we shouldn't compare you know well if this happens this well the you the Giants are too big in the land like you the 10 spies did they're comparing Caleb and Joshua said no no we're not comparing God said let's take it amen free and fearless confidence cheerful courage boldness and Assurance amen the deportment by which one becomes a conspicuous or secures publicity we want to not lose our confidence amen we should be more confident than ever He's Able He's Able he's more than able doesn't matter what's going on our favorite song if you've ever seen the L forains they have a an now worship I don't a night of worship where you know there whole bunch of singers and stuff and one of the choir sings a song He's Able if you ever feel down yeah I'll put the link out you'll like it it's real good that's our favorite song He's Able we came to church playing that song He's Able I said Lord you're able amen you're able to turn turn service into a SE Supernatural event and you're able to turn a fellowship at a place where you step in and change our lives amen you're able oh God because you're the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah now am this word uh it's very interesting it says if any man draw back now this word drawback is one word and it's the Timothy of one stealthily retreating this our people drawback it's not just an open I quit bye just abrupt there's been there's been time maybe years years where it's a stealthly I'm withdrawing it's not outwardly openly just you know I'm gone that's that's the that's the manifestation of a stealthly retreat you if someone's stealthly retreating they don't make a bunch of noise about it they just slowly withdraw and they pretend like they're not because they're trying to be sneaky and they just begin to withdraw themselves from The Fellowship of believers they withdraw themselves from the word they don't talk about God so much anymore they bring the emphasis on onto something else and their problems what they're going through and their troubles and it's a stealthly retreat but the but the end goal is I'm gone see the devil doesn't the devil just wants us to withdraw wants us to have a stealthly retreat and even that Retreat can be not even leaving the fellowship but withdrawing from actually pushing a fervent desire to please God I mean can be just a withdrawal than ourselves well I'm part of the church I'm a good person you know that can just be a stealthy Retreat as well cuz we can look like Believers act like like Believers speak like Believers but we don't have a life of the believer the Holy Ghost himself within us amen so we don't want to have the stealthly retreat I think we should press on Amen that we shouldn't withdraw even within ourselves our own thoughts and our own ways but we should really push the battle who wants to push the battle today amen we've been given the greatest opportunity in this day amen to take a Rapture so I think I think we should press in like never before amen so we don't want to stealth Retreat I mean cuz there's a saying that many people leave church before they leave church in their minds they're they're gone somewhere I trust you're not gone somewhere I trust you're here saying Lord change my life I want more of you I want to have some time with you Lord amen speak to me Lord minister to my life Lord I'm here I love you Lord I mean I trust I trust that's your heart asire this morning so we don't want to have a stealthly retreat amen because God has no pleasure in this we want God to be pleased with our lives like he said about his own son you know this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased wouldn't you want that to be your testimony where God speaks of you it's may be just a phrase but it's you know how God sums you up to the devil I'm well pleased in this one there's there's no one like him or her in all the Earth I'm pleased with how they conduct themselves in a trial I'm pleased how they conduct themselves not just in church but everywhere wherever they are Supermarket driving at home with their children with their whoever it is I'm pleased how they conduct themselves you know that brother B says a man can be so surrender to God that the devil don't know what to do with them I mean that you know you the devil can give you sickness give you trouble give you heartache give you sorrow give you broken family broken life but then there's something beig you're so surrendered you can't you can't go back there's no drawing back there's no retreat amen and the devil just you know comes to a place he scratches his head saying man I just don't know what to do with this guy I've given them trouble after trouble test after test sickness after sickness mind bad after mind battle you know trouble all around and they're still here I just can't do anything with this guy he's a big problem I want to be the devil's problem Hallelujah May might be looking at me like man you're a crazy man but the Lord is so good to us he's redeemed us from hell am mean he's redeemed us from Darkness amen he's you know he's he's put the Rapture within us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are really going to walk on streets of gold one day I mean we're really going to see him face to face we're really going to see the devil burn up I'm going to enjoy that moment you you anyway but I want to see the Lord Jesus most and first and foremost but you see this this this this stealthy retreating always begins with a doubt because you always because a person no matter they always go from one thing to another there's always something that people go to now the devil came along to Eve and you know he made her stealthily Retreat from God's word with a quick question yeah hath God said is that really true that if you eat this fruit you're going to die and all you know it just starts with a question and the devil loves to come to you with questions are you really if you're really a Believer why would you do this if you're really a Christian why would you do this and you know questions and he's trying to get you to doubt your salvation try to doubt your position you see but he but what he's trying to really ultimately do is put a question mark on the power of the blood in your life yeah see the Devil's the devil's tactic is see the Book of Revelation no no well I just read the whole quote now remember this that Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukew formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works which is the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down pardon me to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it so he he wants to try and destroy you and he wants to discredit God's word in your life yeah see the power of it the potency of it the ability of it he wants to dilute that down to get you to think it can't really do what it says it will do but it will do exactly what it says it will do I mean God's word is more than able what he promised he will do amen so he tries to make us lukewarm formal and power see that is someone who is withdrawn who has pulled back amen but we're not called to pull back we're called to push on amen because we don't want to be see we we're in such a a a a deceiving age where it's a lukewarm age see someone who lukewarm is a little bit hot and a little bit cold mixed together that's how you get lukewarm water bit of hot bit of cold it's not completely hot otherwise it would burn be on fire it's not completely cold otherwise it would freeze so there's a mixture of both so there's a bit of God and a bit of the world and makes a lukewarmness and indifference you know it causes someone to lose their enthusiasm their abandonment to God the sin sincere desire to please him you see and this world is a lukewarm world but we're called to cast out that lukewarm spirit I mean we are not ordained to live by that lukewarm Spirit but the devil wants us to pull back into lukewarmness but said let's push on into fervent fire amen let's push on into where all things are possible am mean let's push on to see the realities of the word of God manifesting Amen where we lose control and God takes control amen I think that's how we should be amen that it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me like Paul said amen it's not us trying to be a Christian we let him be the Christian in US amen if he wants to shout let him shout through you if he wants to dance let him dance through you if he wants to do whatever he wants to do live a surrendered life let him live it through you what surrender to what the word of God Amen you see now it's our live seat I think you know like in Wesley's day the church had gone so calvinistic you know in terms of well if you're predestinated you'll be there if not you're not just like we don't need to do any Mission work let's just rest cuz God knows who's there and God you know we can we can lean too much that way and become so calvinistic in our think oh but we're in the message but we're still human right we shouldn't lean we you know we we're going to be in the middle of the road we really it's the life we now live shows what we are you know brother Ram says in Investments that the word in you produces the Life of Christ if take the life out of a peach tree and put it in a peer it wouldn't bear peaches no more it would it would have peers on it because the life in the tree produces what it is the life that's in you shows what you are your life testifies so loud in you until your testimony is not heard they know what you are by the life you live and the things that you do am mean if the Life of Christ is in you then therefore the works and Life of Christ you live because that's his life living through you you're just in a vessel to carry on the work of God Amen so it's a life we now live now now here's the question if if Mercy was over right now where would you be what condition would you be in would you be in or would you be out you know is the saying about the Titanic there was rich poor whatever but when the boat was going down there was either lost or saved it was just two groups where are we now honestly where are we now see there's such a lukewarmness I'm preaching to myself very much today there's such a lukewarmness of just a coasting through life especially in Shi be right New Zealand we have this problem of the Shi be right kind of just coasting but and and that's the devil wants us to Coast but God wants us to walk with him it's a very different thing from coast see you say but what about being in rest sure I'm resting but I'm fighting I'm resting because I know where I'm going I mean but now I want that salvation to manifest through me to everyone around me amen and that every promise will be manifested I want to see God do everything in his book amen that that is concerning me amen so our so we may have the greatest testimony in the world but the life we now live is so loud we can't hear the testimony so what so in the condition we are right now where would we be where are we going I just want we to think about this for a second I love you all okay but let's just think about because there'll come a time when Mercy's done you know that just like that um um that Israeli message believer report I put on brothers and sisters I scrolled down to where there's the quotes of brother Braham in Hebrew and I just showed them to Christine I said look at this to me that gripped me because here's Believers now the bride is made up of Jew and Gentile but now here's his his his Jewish bride translating the message this end time full restoration message into Hebrew the gospel's going back there I thinking where are we I can't read it but but but you know because it's in Hebrew but it really I thought man it's here we're here we're here in the end you know I think it's pilg was progress I haven't read the book but you know the last part of the challenge they went through was they kept falling asleep that was one of the last dangerous Parts they went through on their Journey I've told they keep falling asleep they to wake each other up now I think we're living in that time I really think Pilgrim's Progress from what I've heard and scene it's really a prophecy of down through seven Church ages right and we're around the end time where it's so easy to fall asleep let's not fall asleep let's not pull back let's push forward I mean let's not pull back into the just Comfort but let's push forward out of our comfort zone with God Amen let's not get comfortable and say well here's my family here's my church this is what I do go beyond that Amen Let God live in your life like never before amen so you know we want to we want to not draw back now there's many times in the scripture we can see people drew back but yet they were still Believers cor and Dayan Drew back from God's leadership they drew back to say you take too much on yourselves they gather themselves together against Moses and Aaron now they weren't gathering for them to help them they were gathering against them why because they drew back and say you take too much on yourselves we want God speaks to us too how dare you say you're the only Authority you know how dare you say the you know the word is the only Authority we have you know so they didn't leave Israel they were still part of the congregation but they drew back into their own ideas we don't want to draw back into those things to a to just a comfort zone of existing let's push on he amen let's push on but you see now the word isn't based on human interpretation see he says knowing this verse that no prophecy of scriptures of any private interpretation now many people think well it that means it'll just be a group consensus that's not what the scripture says because if he continue he says for the prophecy came not an old time by the will of man but the holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost this is how the prophecy came it wasn't man's private interpretation but God moved on men to speak his will to the Earth amen and it's those who receive that will pushed in amen and got what they wanted Caleb and Joshua heard the same words cor and Dayan heard but some of them Drew back and others pushed forward am mean you see see the confidence that Caleb and Joshua had was not in Moses it was in the god in Moses here's a big difference see they saw Moses failures they saw everything that Israel did but their confidence wasn't in Moses their confidence was in the word amen and if our confidence is in the word amen I believe that same spirit will come upon us and we'll push in and take every promise amen we must fight if we must Reign I mean we're not given a free pass I mean every age had its difficulty we have our difficulties if they overcame we will overcome amen the same Jesus that caused him to overcome will cause us to overcome but what are you doing about it amen are you are you pulling back and saying well you know I'm looking forward to Christmas Camp's coming I'm going to sit back and watch the world go by I've got other burdens of life or you pushing forward we all have families or we're part of a family we all all got cares of Life bills to pay economic troubles whatever more debts things but is that causing you to pull back or you pushing forward with God which one do you want to have amen he says now the just shall live by faith if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him amen so that word pleasure means it seems good to one it's one's good pleasure to think good to choose determine or decide I want God to choose me to to actually decide I'm proud of my son here I'm pleased with him I know I've said it before but who wants God to be pleased with them amen am mean to do willingly to be ready to prefer to choose rather to be well pleased with take pleasure and to be favorably inclined towards one amen that's that's what I want God to think towards me about I mean to be favorably inclined towards me amen when I'm praying the archangels have got to hush up because God's listening to my prayer amen you because Gabriel and WW they could all be doing things in heaven but then as soon as I got on my knees or I'm just driving in the car just talking to God he says sh quite everyone of course it's just a dead silence come over comes comes into heaven because they listen my son's talking to me amen I'm sorry but you're down the list cuz he's my priority cuz he's part of me he's bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh life of my life he's part of me he's named by my name he's been redeemed by by by my blood amen hallelujah I trust we live those and remember it's not oh let's just jump to this I'm just going to let let's just go here picture speaks a thousand words okay let's go here I've been talking about praise these last few Sundays you Garment of Praise and the oil of gladness and so on now this is a picture of the parable Jesus speaks about the public you know the you know the Pharisee and the Publican in the temple I'm not going to use it exactly but the thing is now here is here is this is how we draw back or can draw back here's the Pharisee who thinks he's awesome I'm a a Believer my family's all in line my wife's in line remember the message brother R preached is not as your life as your wife worthy of the Gospel it's is your life worthy of the Gospel two very different things well my family's in line they say the right things they do the right things that play the right part I believe all the words open I can tell you every Revelation I know I know quotes and you know numbers and chapters and verses and I can string it all together let me draw you a chart I've been to every convention look at the pins I have I got photos in Sabino Canyon you know I I'm glad I'm not like the others in the church who are not so well revelated I pray for them quite a lot Lord give them the Revelation that you've given me and it's a comparison well if I I wouldn't let my family be like that family that's comparison I wouldn't let my kid do that don't say that because I've seen people have given child raising advice and their children have done 10 times worse oh yeah it's true never ever put those judgments on someone cuz you'll find the measure you give out as a measure you receive really it should be Lord I need Grace Lord I need your enablement I need your spirit of my life Lord I need you I need you Lord Lord I don't want to compare myself to anyone Lord I just want you to live Lord Lord I never want to be condescending in my thoughts towards another believer or someone who's teetering or whatever more I never ever want but you see the phes like that Lord I'm awesome that's basically how he is Lord I'm I'm God's gift to the Earth no Jesus Christ is God's gift to the Earth amen I'm the best believer I'm in the best church I'm whatever whatever whatever you see see he's that way but now so that's one way to draw back why because his heart is not focused on his lamb his heart and his life is not focused on the Lord he's worshiping himself True by comparing you begin to worship what what becomes exalted when you compare it's not God it's you you see so we never want to be in that comparison kind of way of that guy look at me everyone get my best side you know but then so that's one way to draw back but then equally there's another way to draw back here's the man down in here like this I'm unworthy I'm never going to get there Lord how could you ever forgive a sinner such as I now you start off that way but you can stay that way Lord look at my past look at what I've done wrong look at me I'm never overcoming I'm never Lord I've had the same trouble for year after year see the focus is still not on God the focus is still on the person right the focus he's still focusing inwardly about himself Lord there's this problem and I see these people Prosper Lord I see this guy up there looking up towards heaven I can't be like that Lord I'm like this what's he done he's actually pulled back because he's not looking at his lamb I trust this comes out in the right way he's not looking at God he's looking at himself sure we we always come to a spot before we meet the Lord Lord I'm unworthy Lord I'm wretched Lord my sin is great I'm I'm wicked I'm evil Lord clear but then you don't stay that way because you come to him on faith saying Lord I'm like this but you can change me like you Lord I'm a sinner I'm riched I got this filthy Fallen nature that drives my life and I can't be free but Lord you can free me Lord hallelujah so you don't stay like that but you turn into the right way amen but you see now both those men are focusing on themselves one's the Pharisee message person and one is the false humility unbelief message person but they both focused on themselves and both can look right yeah but you see they've taken their attention off their lamb amen and so this is how you know that you really praise the Lord with your life is you're not focusing on yourself in any way but your focus is on your lamb I mean because what you look at brings a reaction right what you look at brings a reaction like John John in you know Revelations 4 and 5 is weeping because he saw no man was worthy to take the book but then he saw the same one that was in the boat with him the same one he walked with the same when he saw say Lazarus come forth the same when he saw die on Calvary the same one he saw resurrected was the same one stepped out amen and took the book and It produced a rejoicing praise out of his life because his focus wasn't on himself being unworthy his focus wasn't on the rest of the man being unworthy his Focus was on him amen and if your focus is really on the Lord it will produce a praise out of your life whether you're in church out of your church at home on your job wherever you are why because you're looking at what he has done and you're looking at what he is doing in you amen and it produces such a Thanksgiving amen if you're looking right it produces a Thanksgiving if you're looking the wrong way it just produces a judgment upon yourself amen so we want to always have a praise amen so don't be like those guys be like the thankful worshipper Hallelujah Lord You're My lamb you're my king I was lost and now I'm found I was blind and now I see I was wretched now I'm cleansed am mean I was covered in sin and I'm cover in righteousness amen it's all you Lord hallelujah that's how we should be friends see we should never be focused on how good we think we are because you know oh your brother Andy's not here but we're talking on Wednesday about you know like in the drug world there's this there's this term it's called a delusion of grandeur where people who become either drug dealers or they just high on drugs whatever they think they have S they think they're awesome but it's a delusion of grandeur because really they're not that great at all they're a slave to a spirit yeah this guy has a delusion of grandeur because he's a slave to a spirit he's a slave to a self-righteous religious spirit he thinks he's awesome but he's nothing that's a delusion of grandeur amen but when you really meet the Lord you don't have a delusion of grandeur you're humble you're loving you're kind you love him Hallelujah am mean you don't think you're something that you're not you know what he's made you but it doesn't make you like that right it makes you like this but with a thankful heart thank you Lord for saving me I'm just using the expression on the guy as opposed to the I can never get anywhere kind of a right is this is this all fine I believe amen so so we have we always want him to be our praise amen amen amen we want to contend for the faith once delivered for the Saints see it's very easy to be against something but what about being for something see it's very easy to criticize something is wrong that's drawing back cor and daythan were criticizing Moses and Aaron but they drew back they didn't push on with the promise you don't hear Caleb and Joshua criticizing Moses and Aaron no they pushed on with a full Assurance they had a full confidence we're going into the land God's given us the land every promise is over the Jordan we're going there amen every promise is in the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen every promise is Over Yonder and we have been called to possess every promise so it's easy to criticize where people are wrong and sure we make many mistakes we're human right humans make mistakes it's what they do amen but you see now it's easy to speak against something but what are we contending for am me what are you contending for in your life are you are you contending for just an easy life don't just contend for that we should know we should be contending for God living we should be contending for his word putting on flesh we should be contending that his promises are manifested that we don't just talk about it it's not just a family tradition you see Wesley you know he be his life became a tradition to the methodists sure they read his books well probably they don't read them anymore maybe they throw away his sermons but you know it was a tradition what he did and it can become a tradition what happened to brother bram's life let's not it be a tradition amen but let it be yes Lord you live there but Lord once more Lord live now amen you're the same God you were there but may you be alive now I mean sure maybe you because you're the same God so if you're the same God you do the same things and we believe the same word and we have the same faith and we have the same Holy Ghost amen so if we have those same things Lord send your power amen and prove that you're alive see we should be see we should be contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen so what are we contending for see this is just jumping around see but you see it's the way the devil wants to come I'll be all right see it'll be all right for you to join Church see that's not pushing on that's drawing back but don't you ever forgive Jones it'll be all right if you can bring in your see you can go you you don't have to give up you're smoking you're drinking you're lying you're stealing your fault finding you're backbiting I'll say your jealousy you don't have to give that up you don't have to give up your resentment and the poor me and the wise and no see the devil says bring that with you God says give it to me amen I'd rather give it to the Lord than carry it around see you don't have to give that up just join the church but Moses wasn't a compromiser he wanted complete deliverance he said we'll not leave one hoof behind we'll take everything that belongs to us when we go to Worship the Lord and that's the way the church ought to be we'll take righteousness this is what we're contending for we'll take righteousness we'll take Holiness we'll take the Holy Spirit we'll take a unified group when we go to go to the altar we'll be a real group we'll leave nothing behind we'll take everything there won't be one ho stay back here you know and people can pray and such a way till the devil will have to give in amen that's the way Moses and his group did they got over there and under the blood you notice until they got under the blood there was no total Deliverance am me but I'll say once they got under the blood there was total Deliverance amen they left Egypt when they got under the blood I mean they left Pharaoh behind they left the enemy behind they left their task Masters behind they left behind because they weren't bringing them with them they're saying you stay here we're going this way and it should be the same thing with you and I depression we're leaving you behind anxiety we're leaving you behind jealousy we're leaving you behind resentment we're leaving you behind we're not taking you with but we're taking Joy we're taking peace we're taking God moving amen we're taking the love and Liberty in the spirit we're taking Faith we're taking Revelation we're taking our children we're taking our loved ones amen we're taking everything you have God we're bringing it with amen and we will not stop until we get everything Hallelujah see we can pray until the devil has to give in amen I believe we can do it amen I believe we can have such a burden say oh God if you've promised it in your word I want it Lord I'm not going to rest I'm going to say well it's not their season who says it's not their season today is the day of salvation amen or it'll be another time who said it'll be another time why not today I mean why not today it can be today I I think today is a good day this is the day the Lord has made we will rejoice and be glad in it amen so I think we'll just take it we'll take healing we'll take everything we'll not let the devil keep anything back amen see this was Moses's burden and you see the father of Moses had a burden brother Brown dramatized it that Abraham after he was you know being a slave during the day came home whip marks and pain and all these things he go up and pray and call on God say Jehovah God where's that deliverer Lord you said we're going to leave Lord where's that promise being fulfilled Lord where is it Lord and his wife in your your jokab bed said Abraham can you let someone else pray he said but what if someone doesn't Amen in his little Jewish heart there's a Burning Flame am mean he didn't want to draw back and say well we're just slaves and I guess if God wants to do it he'll do it and if not he won't no he saw the promise that was handed down and something in him said that promise is for me in my house am mean I want that promise fulfilled in my life Hallelujah so he pressed in until God God said angel with a sword draw said your prayer has been heard God's going to answer you the deliverer is going to be born and was born in his own home Hallelujah and I think we should pray in such a way Satan be bound in the name of Jesus Christ God move him power Lord there's people among us who don't know you in the power of your Resurrection Lord there's people who watch these Services don't know you in the power of your Resurrection go get them Lord I mean get our way with loved ones come down to camp and may there be no enemy be to withstand amen the power of our Christ because he can't but Lord may we come with clean Hearts pure Minds on fire for you loving you cuz we don't want to draw back and just go through the motions we want to push on Amen and have a closer walk with God if you want it he'll give it if you don't want it you won't get it but if you want it you'll get it amen and God's timing so I want it so I want to get it amen I think it's how we should be hallelujah amen amen so we should contend for nothing less than the full word of God manifested in our lives we should cont contend for nothing less than God dwelling in all of our souls amen the abiding presence of God that's what we should be contending for amen he says now truly Brethren might deserve a lot of criticisms they've made many mistakes that's all right but brother I'd rather be found on the battlefield making mistakes then are then be a criticizer of the man who's trying to get Soul Sav to God what are you doing about it I think that's a very good question amen let's not be criticizers let's be energizers amen let's push the battle hallelujah amen he is the same yesterday today and forever now we never want to take God to be common I'm going to get to Abraham soon we'll get there now friends let let's hear him the Holy Spirit speaking in our midst showing diverse miracles signs and wonders let's not pass over it like it's a common happenings let's remember that it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever confirming his word I mean we must do it oh please do it take heed let every other thing be secondary even your home your husband your wife your children whatever it may be put it second place God first you say brother Braham over my children over anything Place God first let him be first see this is an hour of entertainment we had to entertain ourselves as children we didn't have something to play with we made up a game in our backyard we in our front yard we had bike tracks where we would make racing we would race our bikes we would play games but we but my parents weren't constantly there saying entertaining us we entertained ourselves that's right you say I'm bored you know boredom is actually a birthplace of great ideas I've just gone off in a tangent but here we are you say I'm bored don't be bored life is too interesting to be bored the reason people get bored is they don't have an imagination about what they could do people get bored in church they don't have a vision about what God could do in them amen but if we really say Lord your word you are so alive I may sound like a broken rickle but hey the needle will move eventually right but you see now if God is God let's serve him if God is God let's serve him with all of our hearts if God is God let's give our all if God is God let's burn every bridge if God is God let's forget about fear of failure let's not be afraid to step out and actually do something for him oh I may get turned down who cares I may get rejected John Wesley did a lot brother Bram did amen all the all the True Believers down Through the Ages had a taste of re rection cuz Christ was rejected and the same cup he drank we drink amen so let's push on if God is God let's not be on the fence the devil is the fence Builder amen let's not sit on the let's serve him let's love him with all that we are amen let's give all that we have amen amen hallelujah amen it's not just given to us we've got to accept it you see now the Apostle Paul as he wrote the book of Hebrews he wasn't writing it out of just intellectual idea he was writing it out of a real out of a experience amen and the reason he could say let's not draw back as he had plenty of opportunity to draw back he could have just lived a quiet life somewhere just gone through the motions you know just joined a church someplace never preached once you know just joined a body of people you know he could have after his s first discouraging missionary trip he could have quit being a missionary saying well I guess God doesn't want me to imagine going to a place imagine if we were you know Chile let's go preach in that church we get stoned outside that church we go to another place we're in jail you know how would that report me but you see that's how the Apostle Paul feed he went to one place he got thrown out of that City great trouble he went to the next city those who threw him out of the first city followed him to the next city you'd like Believers to follow you he had unbelievers following him he ended up in prison had had all kinds of trouble he didn't draw back he could have used that just to draw back and say well if God is really God he would have kept me from all this trouble no he knew that God is in the trouble God is greater than the trouble God is greater than the persecution God is greater than the rejection the pain the Mis understand the questions that don't seem answered God is greater than those things and so he pushed he pressed on he didn't draw back amen and because look at this how he he's standing there speaking to King Agrippa and he says whereupon oh King Agrippa I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision what a testimony to have he wasn't making that up he was not disobedient after he met met the Lord on the road to Damascus he was not disobedient to what he was told he had to do here we are friends we all have a role to play in the body of Christ are we fulfilling that role to 100% of our are we surrendered 100% that God can manifest what he's placed Us in the body to do are we or are we not I think we should be he say well people make fun of me who cares our reward doesn't come from people reward comes from Heaven amen our our see God is no man's deta right so so are we are we pulling back because of humanity or we pushing on because of God the Apostle Paul did not pull back because of humanity he had trouble and he even preached the people through Great Tribulation you'll enter into the kingdom of God and maybe they'd say Paul you don't know what you're talking about he' say okay I'm going to give you a testimony service of last week I was stoned that dragged my body out of the city somehow I they pray for me I got back up that's where I got the bruises from people I've experienced what I'm talking about Hallelujah but you see he lived in such a way because it so gripped him the God he read about the God he thought he knew was was alive but he wasn't the he wasn't the Pharisee no more of thinking I I'm the Pharisee of the Pharisees I believe he would have actually he wasn't just you know he he wasn't making that up when he said that he would have been the Pharisee the he would have been the who's who in the Bible school but he said I had to count that all but dang that I win Christ amen so he knew what it was like to be the Pharisee it's all about me but then he knew what it was like to realize who where God really is and give us life completely Amen to him so he was not disobedient un unto the heavenly vision I pray we're not disobedient to the heavenly vision pulling back because of family pressures of Life trouble misunderstandings pain whatever it is oh you don't know my upbringing God knows your upbringing God gave you your upbringing well I want I want a different one but he allowed you to have that one because he wanted to mold the character into you am mean that God can use your past amen for a victory amen hallelujah well I've missed out on so much on life God knows what that's all vine see that see now let's just jump here because I think we're running out of time now we're going to come to I'm just going to make a Quantum Leap and jump to Abraham because I want to speak about this for a while see now after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward now that after these things is after the battle with the Kings and he meets mesc brother Adam says it's after he wrestled it's it's when you after you wrestle it out with God and fully surrender then he serves you the communion I mean gives you his Spirit when you when you whip this guy out it's not the devil that see the devil's conquered you know that he was defeated on Calvary so public Enemy Number One in your life is you we are I am the one who gets in God's way I'm the one that frustrates him I'm the one that hinders his work I'm the one that stops him doing what he wants to do me me this guy if I can get this guy out of the way he can do things I know nothing about where maybe I've only read it but it becomes so alive where it's just a maybe a nice idea or wouldn't that be need if it happens it is no longer an imagination it becomes a reality if I can get this guy out of the way if I can reckon this man dead it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me all fear of failure would be gone all all popularity would be you worry about po that' be gone all cares of life would be put to the side and would push on like never before I'm talking about myself you see so Abraham after those things the Lord came to him and said I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward see so the Lord had already made him but now he's going to say look I'm your Shield keep walking with me Abraham I'm going to fulfill the word that I said to you that I will fulfill amen see Abraham didn't shrink back he pushed in he believed God he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief was giving praise unto God that he was more than able to do that which he had promised I mean so God is telling him I'm your Shield Hallelujah I want that kind of armor on the front top back I want to have the full armor of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost I want I don't want my reasoning to be my shield I don't want a comfort zone to be my shield I don't want to be a little cuddle hole hiding away no I want him to be my shield I mean that when the enemy comes against me I'm not hiding in some bunker somewhere pulling back but I'm pushing on see there's a saying that a cow dies a million times but a hero Never Dies amen and there's another saying that you know a quitter never wins but a winner never quits you know Abraham Lincoln would stand for public office about 11 times the 11th time he became president he didn't quit something in him was driving him to become president of the United States because we know he is part of the Emancipation the proclamation getting the slaves free he's all part of a great plan of God for a liberation of a people now if that's just a man in a just a political office how much more a people ordained by God am me to fulfill his word how much more people that are called by God kept by God they're walking with God I mean to fulfill his great Plan of Redemption in this end time how much more that there should be fire burning in our souls Lord I want more of you I want to see a soul lord can I be a witness even just a little bit to someone Lord can people see my life and see a difference not maybe by the clothes I wear but more than that maybe how I speak how I conduct myself Lord may they see you may they have a question mark what there's something about that person oh yes there's something about that person and they try to put you in a box are they Brethren no they're too happy are they this no they're this are they you know and they can't put you in in a box and so they have to ask you what do you believe what are you tell me where you're from tell me where you're going that's how we should be I say Lord help me I don't want to be known as a kiwi I want to be known as a Son of God amen amen hallelujah amen so he is thy Shield an exceeding great reward now brother Braham says this I've been through depression I don't know if you can read it there I've been through depression I've been through Prosperity I've seen it all together but I wouldn't turn loose the hand of Jesus Christ for all the money and the wealth that you could pile on the face of this Earth and everything else he's my friend when I'm broke he's my friend when I got plenty I love him when I'm hungry I love him when I'm filled I love him when I'm in sorrow I love him when I'm happy I love him because I love him because he first loved me amen hallelujah amen hallelujah when I was sick laying dying he was my friend when I'm feeling good tonight happy he's still my friend when I'm laying Yonder dying somewhere my chilly veins coming up my my arms like that he'll be my friend then yeah and when those brittle threads that I'm walking on braks and I plunge out into eternity he'll be my friend then when the angel when the ages roll on after 10,000 years we've sung our Jubilee songs he'll still be my friend then yes sir when there's no more moon no more sun no more Earth he'll still be my friend then as ages roll on oh how we ought to love him how we ought to give our all to him amen amen so this is how see this is how we be if we realize he's our friend in every circumstance our Focus will be on him and not upon ourselves hallelujah amen now Abraham was the kind of guy who couldn't go back it says in Hebrews now just in verse 15 he says truly if they had been mindful out of that country from which they came out of they might have had the opportunity to have returned now that word mindful means to exercise memory that is to rec by implic and then and then but it actually brings an implication of a punishment so to be mindful of you came out of is actually to keep thinking on it keep entertaining it this is what I once was and not in a way of thank God I'm not there anymore this is man I was something when I was back there that's a delusion of grandeur again see so we so we shouldn't be we should not meditate on what we came out of cuz the devil will twist it as an and make you look at it in the positive light and what does that bring it brings a punishment what would you rather have faith or unbelief both have both have a policy you brother talks about eternal life policy you know there's you know policies have have have fine print they have benefits let's just look at the two and now this list is not exhaustive but there' be many more than this what is unbelief bring anyone no hope everyone dies everyone will die where do you go no satisfaction there's no lasting satisfaction in sin yeah people jump from one thing to another to another but at the end there's no satisfaction there's no peace there's no lasting Joy there's no love there's no real identity that's right you get mind battle after mind battle there's no answer to the Mind battle you get more complexes you get more pain this is unbelief now who wants to sign up for this I'm trying to sell something no I'm not you know but if I was an honest unbelief salesman oh people will think you're cool but for a season yeah where's it going to be when you're lying on your bed at night do you have peace does he you know Michael Jackson overdosed on drugs he couldn't get he's just trying to get a wink of sleep he was the King of Pop but look where it led him I feel sorry for the man ala's presle the same way many have just overdosed on drugs because they're trying to get sleep they're trying to quiet that tormented Soul that's what unbelief does has it helped anyone what does faith do we could maybe make the list a lot more but I just want you to think about it because see the devil will try and get you to draw back try and make you Retreat stealthily look I'll give you something better this doesn't look this doesn't do anything for anyone and I've asked the question many times before those who came out of the world why didn't we just go back into the world why do we why do we become Believers if the world is so awesome if the world is so great well it's not great that's why we're here I'm glad we're not there I don't want to I don't I I don't want to go back to that stuff praise God but you see now now what does faith do see you you got to choose one see what does unbelief do give you a formal dead religion that doesn't help anyone what does faith do give you the love of God give you peace that passes all understanding amen gives you Joy gives you peace in your soul amen clears your mind gives you Clarity of thought amen calms your nerves amen comforts you when you're hurting amen amen rejoices with you when you're happy amen looks up guides you through life this is what faith does who wants it I know you've already got it but but who wants you we're going to look at the policies here amen it will save you when you're dying it'll stop you lying it'll send the Devils flying it's good enough for me Hallelujah it'll take you in a Rapture I think that's a good deal amen and there's no payment you got to give you just got to give your life but you know there there's no you don't earn it you got to accept it so I'd rather take I'd rather choose Faith than choose unbelief amen but if you choose unbelief it causes you to draw back if you choose Faith you push on Amen what does faith give you lifts Jesus out of History into your life I think that's a real good thing Hallelujah now he is thy shield and thy exceedingly great reward so here's Abraham he doesn't pull back he says I'm going to fulfill the word in your life and I'm your reward yeah sure there's other nations and all these people doing these things but they've just got a reward upon the Earth but look up Abraham look up Abraham I'm your Shield I'll be your friend in every situation Abraham and I'm your exceedingly great reward am mean he could look Beyond that's why he was a pilgrim and a stranger where you going Abraham looking for my reward Hallelujah where is it it's somewhere it's going to be here but it's somewhere how do you know it's there I met the king yeah I met the king he told me you've got a place in that City you're the father of the faith Abraham you've got a place there so I'm looking for it have you seen it people scratch their head saying you crazy man he wasn't a crazy man he had he he had the only one who had really sense in the whole world cuz he met the king of that City I me so he realized and see God always constantly comes out and confirms his word I'm with you I'm with you don't draw back don't quit don't pull within yourself and let someone else do the job no no no you push on that's why he confirms his word I'm with you in this I made a covenant with you I've given you an everlasting promise am mean so don't pull back this is not the season to pull back friends this is the season to push on let's get out of our comfort zone with God Amen let's push in like never before I'm just going to finish with that so let's let's not be like these guys let's look at him let's look at the author and finisher of our faith Amen Let see Darkness see how depression's bad e people are never happy when they feel sorry for themselves so why sit under that cloud yeah let the sunshine burn it up amen just say no no I'm not this is not my lot being being a Pharisee message believer is not my lot feeling sorry for myself I'll never get anywhere in unbelief is not my lot no because my focus is not on me it's on him amen if your focus is on his word amen then you'll push on into every promise Hallelujah let's not pull back amen but let's let's earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen amen praise the Lord maybe yeah I feel like I'm going to go in a different direction so let's just let's just finish it there I pray no I I'm I'm actually going to finish with this now he goes away this is the this is the Israelite worshiper taking the lamb okay because we can start off on fire and we can end up pull back right we we want to start on fire and keep on fire the devil wants us to pull back cuz he has a b idea of what you're capable of remember he faced God from Heaven all the way down to now he got defe he got kicked out of heaven amen he's been defeated all the way down Through the Ages he knows what the H what God is capable of he was there in the book of Acts he was there in brother braham's meetings he was kicked out service after service prayer L after prayer line and that same God that kicked him out there is the same God that lives in you and I so so he doesn't want us to be on fire he wants us to be to to pull back now he goes away this done he's done Jehovah's bidding so he goes away feeling Justified because he's answered answered Jehovah's request he's done what Jehovah said do then he feels that he's by faith he's took God at his word and now listen real close now he took God at his word he is sincere in doing what he did he did it sincerely by the word no matter who laughed at him see his heart was in it see if your heart is in it amen then you're not pulling back cuz you're sincerely Lord I want you more who's who knows what I mean amen amen he did it anyhow because it was God's requirement and now that was wonderful that he knowed he was justified he could feel that way because he met je the requirements of Jehovah that would be the word met the requirements of that of what the word of God required him to do for his justification now finally it was wonderful to begin with but finally it became a family tradition I'm sure you know what I mean the Jew would offer a sacrifice just because that well the family did it and well it was a tradition and when he walked up he said wait a minute I believe I've sinned I see that's all right well I'll get me a lamb and go up and there was just no Godly sorrow for a sin it was only a ritual just a ritualistic form of taking his animal for offering he never got nothing out of it because he never put nothing in it yet he was obeying the commission of God by his by his word but he didn't come in with the real meaning of his word he was obeying as far as being fundamentally he obeyed it but sincerely he didn't obey it therefore it was just a ritual following a tradition that is someone who has pulled back well I go to church because I go to church I come because it's expected of me well I got to be the head of my home so I need to pray because it's expected of me or I'm the wife so I'm a certain way or you know because it's expected of me we shouldn't do things because it's expected of us we should live him because we love him am mean we want him more of him we want to praise him because of out of a thankful heart am mean that when we come we realize we've sinned right we say Lord forgive me of my sins wash me in your blood see at first it can be a real heartfelt and it should be a Godly sorrow Lord I'm so wrong I'm so sorry Lord Wash Me cleanse me but it can turn into just a prayer well your heart's not in anymore sure it may be emotional but if your heart's not in what you're doing it's just a tradition friends let's not be like this I'm not saying we are but let's not be like this let's let's let's stay away from a tradition am mean of just going through the motions but let's push on and out of a real Godly sincerity and love for him Lord here I am I don't want to pull back I want to push on Lord I want to go beyond my comfort zone of my walk with you and I want more Lord I don't want to be
