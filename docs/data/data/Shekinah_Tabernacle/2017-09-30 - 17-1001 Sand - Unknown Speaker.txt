that you are Almighty God you are the way you are the truth your other life Lord we thank you for the anchor that our soul has and you Lord that we have an anchor that keeps the soul steadfast and sure well the billows roll and we just want to worship you this morning and give you thanks for all that you've done in our lives for calling each one of us and for being faithful Lord and times when we weren't faithful you are faithful Lord and times when we were weak you were strong Lord and we acknowledge that all our strength comes from you Lord that that at that point where our human ability and a human strength came to an end Lord when your strength started that's when we realized that that's the true victory has been Paul said it's no longer I that loveth the Christ that liveth of me and I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me so we thank you for your strength you think you for your love we think if your grace is one of your you'll it bless us this morning bless our pastor Immunization Papa you're getting emotional timers the air if it's the same as here or what but I just pray you bless them this morning no doubt there'd be meetings odd and things happening so I just want to pray continually so Murphy's ministry off another brothers and we just trusting for your undertaking the year Lord that their Saints will be blessed their souls will be one into the kingdom of God that they thought if there really that needs strength that we strengthened if the renew that need encouragement they'd be encouraged you neither need Lord chastisement they'd be chastised whenever your work would be there this morning we just confident that your spirit will achieve its purpose so we just commit ourselves to you and thank you Lord for your grace in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you this morning brother John's guitar string broke that you who notice that there's a lesson in that you know you need all the guitar you need all of the pieces and they're working for it all to sound nice and I think we you know we are like that as as believers in a local body internet and an international body too but in their local body we've all got our little part to play in the body you know when when one of them is not there when it goes it's not quite the same it just wasn't the same once a string broke you know when it wasn't there so I know you did you were doing all sorts of different he was trying to play on another fritz a sort of to compensate for it and hey we try and do the same you know when when one of the Saints out there we try and do something different to try and make it work but it's not it's never quite the same and so we all have our place to our part to play in the body of Christ I mean so don't forget that if you ever think you're insignificant just think of John's string it wasn't the same way it was gone amen thank you musicians my verse I've got one versus morning as Genesis 1 verse 1 them now I generally um don't I use an iPad all the time now from my Bible just because it's quicker to search the verses in there oh that broke so I'm down to my slides I've got my thumb and my phone but it's a simple vs. we all know this one in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth I mean God created the heaven in the earth you can have your seats this morning I've got a just an interesting thought that the Lord's laid on my heart this morning and I know brother bin would say you know take your liberty and and that could mean two things it could mean you know do and say whatever you want to do or it could mean just take your liberty just to work within the bounds that you've got and I prefer to go that way because the I'm not really like I'm not I'm not in charge of you people I'm just - I'm a brother I'm a friend you know I don't have when I was pastoring a church it was slightly different because I had a there was a responsibility via so say there was more of a burden on me but it's quite nice ministering under these circumstances because it's not quite the responsibility although I love your honor care and all that sort of thing there's not quite the responsibility do not I mean Christine so I take that liberty and sort of just I enjoy it's like when you work for someone you know that yet your responsibilities aren't the same as if your own the company it's just the way that it is so and I quite I just enjoy being a spare time ministry coming in when we're numb brother Ben needs me to come in and preach although the last time I was supposed to the spare tire was flat because I'd lost all the sermons I'd actually lost all of this well I try and get two or three ahead so that we and brother bin need someone I can just step up and do it but I like to do something just slightly different because I know brother bin would like that just to know something different than what we usually have and then it makes him look better which is well that's what my job is is to make him look good you know that's my job hey we really respect by the beam we enjoy his ministry we enjoy his labor of love that he does for us and I want to support that and I think ah reward for me and supporting that and all of you people as well and it's an honorable thing to support leadership and pastors in that it's very honorable so so I've got an interesting thought this morning called sand and I was just praying one night a while back and I think I was thinking about what maybe I could Minister on next and the thought came sand and it's kind of one of those sorts where you think man how can I get a sermon out of sand you know it's a seems like a very small subject to try and extract 45 minutes or an hour from but my brain working the way that it does it kind of just laws away at something and digs away at it and fishes things out and keeps on digging and digging and digging till he gets something out of it and his brother and he would say to the gates of the rock it was very interesting what he said about the sand the other day said you know that you got to dig down till you find the rock thanks for all the sand but now like a week excuse me people I'll just see if this guy's good okay so so now God God was a great creator when you created created not my chance but with a lot of thought involved all these different and and in a Natural Landmark since all these different things like mountains and rivers and things and then when he is relating himself or or try to make a point about something he often brings in things that we can see he'll bring in mountains and rivers and rocks and things like that they're they are human mind can look at and understand then he likens that to a principle he's trying to say and so he when we think of these things we have any times with you hear the word Mountain mentioned in Scripture lots and lots of times because it's quite a significant thing a mountain it's more than a flat plane or a little small hill at a mountain there's something about a mountain you've got mountains in who knows what this mountainous I'll give you one guess Everest there as Mount Everest 29,000 feet above sea level cruising altitude of a 747 that's a big mountain so that's Mount Everest but Psalm 36 verse 6 says though righteousness is like the great deep it's like the great mountains and though judgments are a great deep Oh Lord thou preserve us man and beast so God saying this is what my righteousness is like this mountain that's just advanced and sure so we can perceive as righteousness like that I've always thought of this verse here this is talking about a river proverbs 21 says the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord as the rivers of water he turneth it will this river he will and you mentioned the river turns this way then it turns that way and turns that way God saying I'm a charge of the king's hat and I and I I direct him the way that I want to direct him like this river and so we can look at this river I think well if that was my heart and the Lord wanted it to go that way then you would turn it that way and it would go this way so that's what our heart is like as well something that we can perceive rocks he talks often about rocks like judo and Jiu tirana me 33 says he is the rock his work is perfect for all his way as a judgment a God of truth and without iniquity just and right as here so God is like a rock that's a big rock amazing rock formations oh it's amazing what the Lord can make and how he can make all his creation make things as well he can make the elements just make different things and make it so amazing and so beautiful so now we have the issue of sand that you think how does he talk about sand I've got some pictures of different areas in the world that have sand it's quite an amazing substance really you've got you know we maybe think of beach sand but there are a lot of different places that have sand other than just the beach I think these are you've got a lot of desert sands blacks and whites and this well that's like a golden sand this is a white sand and the desert these are both top ones at the ends it's an amazing substance and there's a lot of it around once it's and then all these funny places I think that this road has sand like a sandy substance there yeah so I don't know what I've got next so if this is as interesting as it is I haven't gone over this a lot here we go this is these are very close-up pictures of sand like maybe 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter of sand so they look like peoples but they're actually small tiny grains of sand that's one from the Mongolia beautiful day it's a little quartz and stuff that's one meter one centimeter by 1 centimeter this one it's a more of a beach sand over here California it's got they would have small showers and things in it that the waves and everything over time have just ground down these little pieces of sand this this there's a printed sand from Egypt the one in the middle oh here we go is it Oh yep that's a patents and I think the wind from blowing the sand around has made it all pitted but um one up the top here that's a it looks orange but it's a pink sand from Utah have you seen that where as they're Americans have you seen it where's cherith oh no she can't hear me that's from Utah and the one down the bottom here is a that's a volcanic sand from Greece a black sand black sands looks quite awesome too so you've got all this when you zoom in close to the sanders it's an amazing substance very very amazing substance and I've just thought I'll look into the things that people you stand for and generally it's more bigger things like agriculture they use it too for a drainage and slow so the saw doesn't get so hard query how to push the reefs they fill sandbags up and make artificial reefs with it artificial islands I think a lot of the Abu Dhabi and all those Dubai and all those areas here are basically built on a lot of them are built on water so they've just made land from sand filled up then sandbags and things for beach nourishment I think one of the beaches and Wellington here Oriental Bay I think that was rock at some point they just brought in sand put that down there Brookes big things like that they put a lot of sand and bricks concrete glass glass has sent hydraulic fracturing to get the sand into get the oil out with the water in different substances water paint roads roads sandbag sandblasting this was an interesting one a thermal weapon base to use sand as a weapon back in the olden times the thermal weapon which means they heated up sand and I guess when guys are coming up to the wall they poured sand all over them hot sand I don't know if it would have been overly effective I mean they would have taken a long time to heat the snuff and you've got you get one shot of pouring it if the guys that have moves out the way all your if it's a but they used that for a while the thermal weapon and there was another interesting month is there's little creatures that don't have any and the cedar don't have any skeleton and they eat sand and it kind of gives them a bit of skeleton the name strange a the things the Lord makes he just wants to surprise us all the time and the more we look the more we find me one of the things we probably use the most other side from maybe glass and that is our in our computer chips the a lot of the chips are made from there's a lot of silicon in there which is which comes from the sand they use these a triumph I understand that has the most silicon and they use it to make computer chips strange what man does he can take something and make something else without out of it he's similar to God and that creates things but now going back to the Bible we're talking about sin there's a lot of examples where God talks about sand and I just want to run through some of those the first one was Abraham and we know the story of Abraham he was he was living in Iraq up there wandering around and then God met him and he gave him a promise and he said Abraham I want you to leave here and go to another place and he said the promise is that implicit I'll bless thee and in multiplying I'll multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and those seed shall possess the gates of his enemies so that's the first time God mentions sand to men saying I'm gonna bless you and I'm going to make your seed like a sand upon the seashore and as time went on Abraham would have told that promise to Isaac and then Isaac would have told that promise to Jacob and then we know the story of Jacob he left his he deceived his brother then he went up with us where his father-in-law was and then in a certain point in time he wanted to come back down but he had to meet up with Esau again his brother that had deceived and robbed them basically he ruined his life and so you can imagine that the hard the thoughts that are going through jacob's mind the pressure that and the days leading up and the night before he has to meet with Esau and he devises a plan where he thinks oh I'll send all these gifts first and I was in no camels and everything then I'll send my wife and children after that see he sends all these other people first to try and appease Esau so that finally when he comes hopefully he saw won't just decide to kill him because he still had become quite a powerful man by that stage he had soldiers and he was a very strong man and himself in and with us with a small army that he had so you can imagine the pressure that Jacob is under the night before his due to meet um Esau and he's praying to the Lord and he's realizing there's a promise for me and he recites back to God the promise that had been passed down to him that which was part of the best way which is part of everything and this is before he wrestled with the angel but Jacob said to God that you taught me you will surely do me good and make my seed like the sand upon the seashore you've recited that back to God which cannot be numbered for multitude so he's were psyching that back and thinking that's what you said of me I don't think I'm going to I think I'm going to survive this but he recited that back and then later on that night was when he wrestled with the angel and and when the morning came the angel said let me go and he said I won't let you go until you bless me and then God changed his name to Israel now this is a fascinating fascinating subject for mankind as the subject of Israel there was a man an atheist and he asked a Christian being smart - my thing of talking us before but he said prove me Christianity in two words and this man said the Jews and when you think about the significance of the Jews it proves God so I thought I did a little study on this I don't know if you can see these words Andy's at the back you can't see but this is a list of all the countries in the whole wide world all the countries that we have here you'll find your country of origin in there I think your point South Africa be maybe you've got career this career do you something oh I'd be sick maybe yes sorry South Korea South Korea North yep New Zealand if I hit that blown-up you could search you can look over all those countries and you you find me a country in the other the first the first commissioners it has to be named after a person a person's name then the second thing is you've got to that country also as well as being a person's name has to be essentially the people living in their country we're all descendants of that person you look through all these countries the closest I came was these ones over here like st. Kitts and st. Lucia and statements and they're named after a person's name but that's just because the the Spanish meet there and they had some saint that they thought was good so they called they took over this country that we'll call it st. Kitts you know but it's nothing to do with st. Kitts not his genealogy but well then this with an all these countries in the world here there's this little country down here called Israel yes a person's name and the people in that country can say I traced back to that person there's there are no other countries in the world like that because God said your seed will be like the sand upon the seashore for multitude if you ever doubt God just look at this and think why they why is this little country still sitting there after all these years because there's a promise that your seed will be like the sand upon the seashore and amongst all these other countries that's sitting there saying I'm not because God said you won't move you'll stay there you'll stand through all the time as long as the wheelchair you'll be there that proves God any atheist can look at us and say if they weren't there you could just regard the whole thing almost but Israel is there it's there praise the Lord because they see we like to stand up on the seashore I've got another one moving on Joseph I enjoy the story of Joseph because it's it's one of up and then down and then up so Joseph was a very blessed boy when he was born his father loved him and he would have had a lot of confidence and maybe he got the love of his father more than his brothers dead and his father was older by the in so his father was more lenient upon him and more maybe like a granddad than a dad you know whereas the older boys Reuben and Simeon I mean maybe they got the the harder end of the stick you know and they maybe got a few more punishments and things but here's Joseph being there as a mobile put it the son of his old age he was a bit more nicer to him and just hey come and Joseph sort of my life and look more like a grandfather didn't really create him as much and maybe didn't have to work as much as the older boys and he was very spiritual and I think he would have had a lot of confidence growing up Joseph would off and his brothers as a result of seeing their the dynamics play out his brothers just didn't like this guy hated them they were jealous of him that his father liked him more than them what they will perceive and then it got even worse to me and Joseph started having all these dreams you can imagine as brothers Joseph starts having these dreams and telling his brothers essentially the interpretation this you're all going to bow down to me you know if that's not if that's not kicking a man while he's down here's a really this boy that already been spoiled in saying oh and on top of that you're also going to bow down to me and worship me and then he turns out to his father and says oh my father mother you will as well actually talking about alienating himself from his family you know but hey God does strange things that we just have to go with what God said and then he got his coat of many colors and then he was he was happy and confident everything was going well and then he went out to meet his brothers to bring them something out in the field was his father's he can to bring them some food and things and his brothers thought this is a timely we can get rid of this guy because we just done with this little guy he's always I think even as presence made him angry so they caught him threw up they were going to kill him but the one of the brothers said don't kill him let's let's just keep him alive we'll sell him to these slave traders you know they these guys that were trading slaves now Egypt was a big country at that time the big enough that it was had a big commercial enterprise going on the economy was going well and other countries was were essentially catching people and exporting them to Egypt as slaves to build all the things they are building and the buildings and things like that so that that shows that Egypt was a thriving economy and where they were in the desert I don't know but along comes this slave train with all these slaves there was probably a lot of them all sort of making their way you can imagine from all around Egypt while making their way and bringing all these slaves and and so they must have waved this thing down and said hey we've got the slave he will sell them to you that'll be a way to get rid of this guy so they sold Joseph and brother Ben has talked about this quite often and I've always found it such a great point that here was Joseph he had all these promises and here he was on the slave train moving the opposite way to what would seem the promise for his life but as time went on he went there and he did well and he worked hard it would have been hell for him to learn the language and do things like that I mean then his next hit came when he got thrown in prison again he can imagine the thoughts that were going through Joseph's mind when he thinks it's all going quite well and then suddenly bang he's back in prison and I think he was in there for maybe seven or eight years a long time it wasn't just a few weeks and whoops we made a mistake you're out it was a long time for Joseph but he he trusted in God and then we know the story that about the the butler and and how Joseph eventually was to live and put out of prison because he interpreted Pharaoh's dream and Farah had a dream about the wheat and the cows are saying and and Joseph said this is the interpretation there's going to be seven years of FEM of of plenty and then seven years of famine and in fear I perceive this to be correct so he said okay Joseph see we need somebody to manage this whole enterprise for seven years look after it then to distribute the food for seven years and so Pharaoh gave Joseph the job to harvest all the the grain in the seven years and then store it up now that's where we get to the scripture here and Joseph the city is Albany stood before Pharaoh thirty king of Egypt and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went throughout all the land of Egypt this is after Pharaoh told him and in the seven years the earth brought forth by handfuls and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt and he laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about in every city verse 41 that says and Joseph gathered corn as a sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for it was without number I think at some point Joseph would have done a rough calculation and thought we need about this much grain so he started keeping track of how much he was harvesting mean the scripture says it got to a point where he thought I'm just going to give up trying to number how much of the stuff that I've got because I can't number it it's ginormous massive he gathered corn as a sand of the seashore now my little brain working how it does I kind of don't like to just leave it at that so look into it a little bit more yes have you gathered it like the sand of the seashore they must have in a lot now the population of Egypt this is a conservative estimate was about seven million some say ten some say twenty but I go conservative because then you could always increase the numbers the population of Egypt is about seven million at that time there were seven years of famine firstly I didn't allow for the first year because you'd think they would still be crops from the last year right which is true but then on the other end of the famine you've got even when it starts again you've got to go for another year before your next crop comes on so it was seven years I had six years but then I put it to seven so it's 2550 five days now this is a conservative estimate could you live on five ears of corn a day if you had to you if you had so you probably could you'd look like I don't mind at the end of it but you could let's just say five because if I see it 15 you're saying no not 15 let's just say five to be conservative right five now I've it even allowed for the livestock or anything like that there's just five years of corn seven million people that times five is eighty nine billion but also it says that people from all around the other countries came in and brought corn just like um Isaac and as and Jos sorry jacket minute Joseph's brethren came in and brought corn there were a lot of those people so I've only allowed about a million of those coming from all around because Egypt was the place to go so this 102 to be conservative is 102 billion ears of corn I'll just give you some perspective on that this is a thirty foot by 30 foot grain silo very big grain silo you see you know I've seen these things now this holds seven hundred and sixty eight thousand ears of corn now that's that's without the cob so if Joseph stored the stuff with a cob we're talking far more than what my estimates are but let's say he did take the the grain off the cob because this is this is shelled corn seem homeless sixty eight so so now if you do these calculations they need two hundred Joseph needs one hundred and thirty three thousand of these grain silos conservatively to store all his corn this is a massive operation this is a massive food storage program probably the biggest food storage program in existence of the world wellington city has seventy seven thousand Wellings Lower Hutt has 38 thousand and Upper Hutt has 16,000 dwellings all up there 131 thousand plus commercial buildings is about one hundred and thirty three thousand dwellings so essentially every single building in the Wellington it goes up to tower and all through the Hutt Valley would have been a grain silo you could walk through these things for days grain silos Joseph gathered corn like the sand on the seashore from multitude and he couldn't count it he gave us so much he bought the whole land of Egypt he bought the whole in because as people were getting hungrier and hungrier he just kept on buying everything he said and they had no money left he said rod I'll take your land I'll take your land he bought the whole country from all the Egyptians by the end of the famine Pharaoh owned the whole land outright himself amazing indeed but God doesn't think God wants to do something he does he can do something big you can do something small Joseph get the grain like the sand upon the seashore for multitude I've got another one here this is Gideon we know the story of Gideon he thinks he's insignificant yeah I'm a nobody and in the a Jew comes Tillman's he's getting a new mighty man of Valor and he didn't think that he was but God told Gideon I'm gonna use you to deliver your people so over the course of time Gideon gets an army together and he's going to fight the Amalekites and the I can't remember the name of the other army but because they were always robbing him this way when the angel came to him he was hiding away threshing his wheat and trying to keep it all hidden because it would always get stolen he was a him and his people were oppressed continually oppressed who knows what it's like to be oppressed you know sometimes you go through your life and times and your life were you just oppressed and you say Lord deliver me I'm oppressed and you are oppressed but God will deliver you and and Gideon Gideon was at a time in his life where he wasn't free and his people went free they were oppressed so so things happen and Gideon ends up getting an army and now he starts thinking with his mind the bigger the army the more chance I've got a shot of delivering my people from this from these Amalekites so being the prudence of men that maybe he was and thinking how that he should think as a soldier he starts gathering a big army for himself to go and defeat this enemy which is the normal thing that we would try and do in our mind get a big army you know so I've got ten thousand we get ten thousand preferably twelve thousand fifteen to beat them well we get better weaponry and he's going to meet the Amalekites and God says to get in you've got too many of these guys so we know the story he says that he divides them up he says you know on this tide you can all go home and then they get some of them leave then he gets to the brook and he says have the people drink in and have some people drink this way keep them if they drink this way let them go so from his army that you had I don't know the exact size that it was before he started but he ends up with 300 men after all this process is finished get it here's Gideon with us 300 men to deliver his people from the Amalekites okay so then we have the issue of the Midianites sorry Midianites and the Amalekites this is what they look like and the Midianites so Gideon turns up to a hill and he looks like looks across to spy out let's go and see the enemy and try and find their weakness let's get some intelligence on these guys okay so they look over at this it says in the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers from altitude and their camels will without number as the sand by the seaside for multitude males are going to look at the beach and just think if you wanted baby piece of sand as a as something that's going to attack them because that's what it was when they looked at it without number they were like the sand of the seaside for multitude probably as far as they could see with people and camels and horses and tents sometimes in our life we come up against this sort of stuff where it seems impossible where our enemies they like the sand upon the seashore that what's come against us is like the sand upon the seashore I want to show you sometimes rather Bram sees some of the things God does sometimes look ridiculous and another word will be pathetic like it it just looks so silly I want to compare these two because this is the same chapter so here's they look over at the Amalekites and the Midianites who were like the sand of the seashore for multitude and then Gideon's got a plan now let's just look at this naturally right because I I had to laugh when I thought about this in a natural sense so his 300 men are lined up you can imagine though he's put you're in charge of those hundred you're in charge of that when I before this he says alright Gideon says all right guys here's the plan we're going to split up into three companies and and you can imagine out of respect for Gideon they say okay yeah let's split up into three okay what do you take the center they take left leg we take right they're not going to say it because they respect Gideon but you know they're thinking you know if they're honest it's a lot Gideon what good is that really there's 300 of it look at the size of these guys there's 300 it's just a together doesn't it's gonna be it doesn't matter where we split up we'll stay here together kiss this and sometimes our response to an attack of the enemy sometimes look looks can look ridiculous like we might have something so strong against us and all we do is come up and pray pray for me brother it looks so pathetic but you know when God's in control it's not pathetic it was a plan God said split up into three companies what you made up the three companies so they split Lehman up into three companies if you know I would have seen them do this sort of just look at these guys it's a joke beyond a joke but God if God say something he will do it it doesn't matter if your if your enemies if the thing that's coming against yours like the sand upon the seashore he will deliver and what the plan was was they were all gonna split up the three companies around the hills one here one here one there and at a certain point in time they had it they had a torch a lamp in their hand a trumpet and they had a picture of water and they were going to break the picture that picture picture the picture and they were gonna blow the trumpet and they were going to say the sword of the Lord and of Gideon and they were going to blow the trumpet that was the plan and they stood in three companies around the enemy and they did that and the enemy just panic they didn't know what was going on and they they all ended up killing each other and just it was chaos these guys all they did was blew their trumpet smash the picture blew their trumpet the sword of the Lord and of Gideon and these guys were even so bold that when the Midianites and the Amalekites ran they pursued them with their 300 minutes because they thought they down to about 500,000 now think we've got a good chance that's what it's like with God if your enemies are like the sand of the seashore God can still deliver you from any situation amen this is another one open I can portray this across the way that it is in my mind it's quite simple but we know the story about the wise man that build his house upon the sand earth sorry the wrong way on the rock it's just seeing if you were listening and the foolish man built his house upon the sand okay and the the the one the wise men that built his house upon the sand the rock the foolish man upon the sand the waves came and the house on the sand because it didn't have any foundation that it was built on when the water came in it just washed all the sand away from underneath whose tried to make a sand castle at the beach when the tides coming in you would have done that when we were children you know we we build it and then the waves that tide is slowly coming and we think we've got a chance to keep the sand castle built a like we and the leadership and whoever is there comes out and he's he starts seeing the the sea coming in so he starts telling the your all about seven or eight years old built here built there we've got to build a wall here you know you're trying to make yours like that I'm building this thing and having my little brothers builders happen up but it's a futile attempt because there's the tides can again it just your sandcastle just gets washed away eventually and that's what happened to this house because it was built on sand when when the water came it just washed away and this this house fell I want to look into this for a little bit we know the scripture has used here a lot because it's a foundational scripture upon our upon how God works and deals with men and that's when he talked to Peter and said that thou art Peter because after Peter said to him thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he said thou art Peter and upon this rock I'll build my church now we understand and he says in the gates of hell shall not prevail against it we understand that that what he's saying is upon the revelation upon revelation I'll build my church it's it wasn't pompadour anything we understand uh sits upon revelation upon revelation that God gives which is himself showing to you that Jesus is the Christ and all the things he reveals okay it's it's now that's we can say that's truth because that's God's mind and God speaking directly to you truth and we can't actually perceive God or understand God unless he speaks to us we can try and learn God but we can't it's impossible to actually know God unless he speaks to you that's the way that it works unless he reveals himself to us I often think of it like a little um who knows that and I said maybe a little Santa Claus thing but you know the little Christmas some snowmen it's like a it's like a diamond it's got water in it and it's got the snowflakes and maybe it's just got a house in there and you sort of shake this thing up in there the snow these little white things they go all around it looks like a nice little snow storm in this house and things like that I've often thought you know we're like one of those except we have painted black over the top you know and sitting inside that thing no and it's sort of all just dark and we we can't do anything to perceive anything around us and I've often imagined that the revelation of God is like was like the Lord because he's life and outside of zero all this light but we're just dwelling in this little dome under all this darkness but the Lord just scrapes a little piece of that paint off the outside and a little bit of light shines in hey what's that now before they we could have tried to work out what was out there as much as we could but we would never even know what was out there who would never never perceive it because we can't we can't it's just the way that it is but God's revelation is like him scratching some often some light comes in and we can suddenly now that is what it is that is the light I don't have to think this anymore this is the light and the more that he scrapes off the more like we have in the more it just opens up to us and it is that is it I'm not making this up that's it it's God's revealed it to me okay that's revelation now that's what brother Graham says I've got a quote he sees what do they what do they say this today this is about revelation about revelation polished up suicide mental telepathy fortune-telling just exactly the same not worth enough real gospel sound teaching in their hearts and spiritual revelation because the entire Church of the Living God is built upon spiritual spiritual revealed truth from heaven that's the thing the church not built upon teachings not built upon theologies it's not built upon denominations but it's built upon this revelation of Jesus Christ to you that's what it's built on okay now that's that's the rock that we're talking about we're not talking about that's and that's the Jesus that we're talking about we're not talking about the Jesus someone else will present saying this is Jesus we're talking about the Jesus coming to you and there's a big difference okay now this is why brother Graham said to me everything that operates must come out of this Bible or it's not right now everyone will agree with that all Christians will agree with that right but but you've got to go on a bit further he says it has to come from here it can be proved in the Bible not just one place not just one place but it has to come all the way through the Bible I have to believe it it has to dovetail and tied together with every scripture or I don't believe it and then because Paul said if any angel if an angel from heaven come preaching any other gospel needn't be a curse so I believe the Bible now when you're talking about a rock what are you saying is efforts of the rock you're talking about then if if I look at this rock on that side I'm gonna say oh the rock is that now if later on I see it from the other side it's the same rock I'm seeing the same thing if I look inside the rock it's the same rock that's why brother Bram saying it's got to it's got to be all the way through I've got a sense this is the rock that I've found that this this thing that I've heard yes Rock because it lines up but with all the rest of the rock in there you understand what I mean it's not just an isolated thing on its own right it's the rock it's Revelation have I got this so then we come to the idea of rock and sand right when you think about this you think about little pieces of sand they're basically in a spiritual sense it basically just thousands of a collections of little ideas just little ideas that this idea that idea they don't do this one this one this one this one this one this one and there's billions of them out there and they just the ideas and the thing about these man's ideas and all these things are they don't have any connection to anything else is just a random idea on their own just a random idea on its own and you just get a whole lot of these just a random collection of ideas on their own it's all that it's all the stuffers as opposed to the rock it's one idea that's constant all the way through doesn't matter from here here people that say God has changed no oh he's got a new idea no no that's and you're talking about cuz because God is the same rock it's the same thing that's why Paul said I can't preach this because back here we talked about this I'm gonna preach about the rock you know I'm gonna send in brother Brown comes along and sees I can't change it it's all the way through it's the rock okay it's my father heard someone had talked to him that has been in Bible College and he said it was very confusing in the area see because one week someone will come along and say something and then the next week some come along and say something very different and then the next week they say something very different now these men that went there and this is modern thinking they thought it was intelligent to give the people this and give them that and give them that and give them all these things and let them make up their own mind about it you know in other words just give them a whole lot of sand and let them build their life on that right now now that's okay that thinking is okay when life is going good that'll work having all these different scattering of ideas in your mind and listen that maybe it's just maybe it's that maybe it's that even within a Christian sense that that'll be okay when there's no storm okay but you let a storm come in your life where the unseen comes and hits your life and it pounds at you and it pounds and pounds and you don't understand why you don't understand what's going on and things get hard and tough and you shakin around it's then that those ideas won't hold they they mean nothing when when the hardship of life comes and they mean nothing but when you're on a rock and the storms of life come and they hit you you can say Jesus never fails all things work together for good to those that love God you've got this rock and now you're being beaten and pounded but you can hold it'll hold things are happening you just don't know why was this going this way it's gonna hold you've got something in there now and the good times you're gonna be made fun of look at this guy you know but us when the storms of life hit that you want to be on this rock here rather than these intelligent ideas of sand you know all this random collection of ideas that really when you want to push a storm against that it won't hold that won't hold but I'll give you another principle here right you can liken it to lies and truth and this is a very interesting concept about about a lie and a truth Sanders like lies right let's go through the next one now the Bible says Jesus said of Satan you're a liar and you're the father of it you're just a liar but God is truth his word is a rock and that's where the scripture says is one Lord one faith one baptism there's just one thing and it's true it's not going to change it's the same thing all the way through right lies this is my final point on this how many lies by his here's a question what does 1 plus 1 equal okay how many truths can you give to that one right that's the answers to how many lies can you answer that with written down a few numbers here but you could answer it you could give as many Liars to that equation is what there are sand upon the seashore lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie because there's many as there are as meaning numbers you can say this admits the answer team the answers 12 the answers this the answers it you can give us many lies on a on a honest question but you can only give one truth see God didn't design this stuff just willy-nilly he's showing us to say look Satan is going to throw out all these lies lies lies omit like the sand upon the sea don't build your life upon that because the he can have a million lives for one one question but there is one truth his only one is only one truth it can't be that's why other religions can't dwell with Christianity castaño there's only one truth is only one Rock so I'm glad that we can look at what we believe look what we follow and we can see it go through the whole Bible and we can perceive I've found the rock this is the rock Paul when he preached he'd found the rock when I was I when they talked that was the rock Moses he found the rock we perceive this is the rock and how you sometimes get given ideas you hear them and you think something's not quite right about that probably because it's sand just put it back out in the beach don't build on that you're talking about the rock I've got two more now this is the Gospel according to Isaac this is just this is something I've looked into it it's that I'm not saying that's it is what it is but it doesn't matter if it is or it isn't so don't think that oh he's got this great revelation I just thought this was nice but it's so this might disclaimer before I read it to you because I don't usually do these sorts of things but that's just I just found this very interesting and I enjoyed this analogy for myself the outcome is correct so it doesn't matter but Jeremiah says fear ye not me saith the Lord will you not tremble at my presence which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree that it cannot pass it and though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not prevail they they roar yet they cannot pass over it God said I place the sand here and regardless of how much the waves roar and they beat and they try and come in waves you will not pass the sand and he said I have set the said as a bound for the sea by perpetual decree I don't understand what they were perpetual means so I demand won't either Hey perpetual it means never ceasing continuing forever a future time destined to be eternal perpetual so if he says perpetual decree that means I'm going to make this decree and it's going to last forever it's a perpetual decree sand you'll hold back the sea as long as you're there you'll hold back the sea period you're a perpetual decree okay so this is the Gospel according to Isaac don't forget I don't mean that in a light-hearted way that I just mean that because I don't usually do this so now we've got John in the book of Revelation and John John we know is a type of the bride and I read unto this well that's very interesting so John the Lord shown John many things I mean and then it says Johnny ends up sitting up standing on the sand of the seashore and he looks out over the sea and he sees a he sees a beast coming the the see now we know what that that beast does okay that's that's the Antichrist coming out okay and then later on it's it's easy essentially he turns around and he sees a he sees to another piece coming out of the land but I sort of in my little mind I thought that's kind of nice that Jonah's in a place where he's on the sand where God said send as a perpetual decree these waves let's see is never ever going to come to where you are it'll never pass you so here's this piece coming out of the sea but you know John's in a spot where this the sea is never going to be able to overtake him and I think that's the same with the bride this we're in a place where as much as this beast comes out and tries to throw everything accounted us there's a perpetual decree saying you'll not pass the bride is in a place where you're not pass you're not you'll never overcome it you you'll never go past my bounds which is I've sent the sand for abound John you stand there you'll never pass it and then he turns around he sees the the another piece coming out of the sea but then I had another scripture for that because afterwards the Lord comes down the mighty angel he stands upon the sea probably and he's mentioned this a few times and he stands upon the land some more but we're nicely pinched on the sand now this is just the Gospel according to Isaac but I thought it was an interesting it's truth nonetheless because this beast will never get never overcome us and God gets rid of all of those but not us the last one that I've got I've got a very interesting um some interesting quotes from brother Brennan here this is jumping into a sermon and he looked to them and said verily I say unto you if thou shalt say to this mountain be moved and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart this is important point now and the original it says this and the lexicon Greek lexicon quickly it's gone it says if you should say to this mountain be ye lifted up and thrown into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that it is being done you shall have what you say we are looking for things so spontaneous but what did he mean you look at that at the mountain and say be thou lifted up and thrown into the sea and then and then in your heart believe that what you have said is taking place okay who's got mountains in their life that they're dealing with at the moment we all have mountains in our life some of these things look like it is actually impossible for this thing to move sometimes it just gets to a point where maybe it's been here for so long we just get weary we think I don't know how this thing I've prayed against this thing for so many times and it just seems to me like it stays there it might be a it might be a relationship issue it might be a health issue in your life that you've got there might be a financial issue it might just be might just be something in you that that just always happens a certain way and you don't like it but you've tried so hard to not be like that maybe a something in your character that that's just you look back from father to grandfather you just see it all the way through and you think I've just got that and you just can't seem to shake it you can't seem to break it you know and and we can sometimes maybe in a convention or at a time of the Spirit move and we get so encouraged then we go out for a prayer and we know it does happen this way but I'm saying we get encouraged it and we we go for deliverance and we saw enthusiastic about it but yet the next day or the week later it seems like it's still there and and we can get discouraged brother Graham said here we're looking for things so spontaneous so spontaneous he said but what did he mean he's saying hang on Jesus didn't he didn't actually say that if you look in Twitty cd2 makes you say that we look at it as like when I go up it's all just gonna happen those mountains going to disappear sometimes it does but he's saying one of the problems are it's he didn't actually say it like that he said if you pray you say to this mountain wherever the mountain is in your life you can all do this this will help you and your faith to overcome that mountain if you say mountain be removed and be cast into the sea be removed and be cast into the sea and then in your heart believe that what you have said is is taking place what a brother Graham say maybe just one little grain of sand begin to move through the whole mountain little grain of sand rolled off the mountain now Satan's going to come along same to look how big the mountain there's one little grain of sand from you can say hang on hang on hang on so you're saying one grain of sand moves across the map moved off the mountain because you got to better get some tactics like you're a lawyer are you saying one grain of sand moved well it was only one no was it one or nothing it was one was one was it uh-huh so you're acknowledging that mountains moving is that what you're saying the mountains moving buts not moving very much no it's either moving or not moving is it moving it'll give you faith the mountains moving it's moving even if it's just one grain of sand every prayer makes it move hold on it's just moving you see as you might not be able to notice it but there's something in your heart to say that's being done next there might be two more grains three grains but that mountain is moving you should love what you say that's the faith many of us prayed for at night the next one say well there's no difference on it feeling different that's where we're failing that doesn't have to show one thing but if thou believest in your heart that what you say is being done you shall have what you say that's it if you believe that what you say is already taking place I don't have to feel like I'll see it I believe it this is the reason that it takes place that's just happening one grain of sand is moving but it's moving I've got brother belt like this analogy so I've got one more of the same quote just in a different meeting right because I just like it no matter what the circumstance Jesus said to mark 11:24 he said if thou shalt say to this mountain be plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say shall come to pass they all shall have what you say now let me quote the lexicon that's the original brick here's what reads thou shalt say to this mountain be lifted up and thrown into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have seen is coming is coming to pass you can have what you see when you see it mountain be moved and it still stands there you say well it didn't happen that's what we say can't see much you just didn't see that one grain of sand move that's all it happened you didn't actually perceive that oh it did happen it did happen when you see a mountain move maybe one little nothing he meant here insignificant grain of sand turn loose out of the hundreds of billions and billions of tons of sand one little grain moved one little grain moved but it's begin to take place hold that faith and watch that mountain disappear if you say to this mountain be thou removed to be cast into the sea and don't doubt but believe what you have said is coming to pass that mountain will disappear that's the truth of it who's headed in their life where if something has been so hard and you've prayed and then you've kind of forgotten about it then maybe you look back years later you think that things go on that mountain is gone every mountain you face is the same if you say to it be removed one grain at a time the end of the quote certainly the I should say and I heart disease moved from my child disease move from my body in the name of the Lord Jesus and don't yeah right there the good germs take on a new armor and a new weapon and the enemy begins to back up he's defeated because Christ and the drinking of his mirror Calvary defeated the devil every one of his powers and he stripped on him everything he had and it's nothing but a bluff you can go through with it he will do it if you say to this mountain don't forget if it's just one little grain of sand every time you pray every time you believe it's more grains of sand that mountain will be moved so next time you're at the beach or back in South Africa and the desert or wherever and you cease and you can ponder on these things ponder justly you can pick up a little grain of sand and think you know what you can think of God you can think of how great he is and how it was deliverance of his hand of of all these different things such a small little thing and yet God I think when he designed it he thought I'm gonna make this little this little tiny thing and just scattered along the beach and all I'll talk about it now and then praise the Lord let's um let's just um we'll stand this morning and we'll pray and then I want to sing um or the anteed way of your guitar here okay sit up well pray and then I think we will sing um on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand Emma let's just pray this morning Lord Jesus Lord we are so grateful to you Lord we're so grateful for your word we're so grateful for your promises and our life we're so grateful for your strength Lord and if there are people here Lord that are still struggling on their own Lord in terms of they haven't fully decided to let go and let you take full control of their life floor to pray that they would you'd probably M to do that Lord because resting and your strength is such an amazing thing Lord to realize that we don't have to do this all we have to do is come to you Lord and let the life of Jesus Christ live out through isolative you all of our strength and love the life that Paul said it's no longer I that loveth the Christ that liveth in me Lord for we know you're the you're the fountain of strength you're the fountain of life for the fountain of joy and Lord we just say Lord I'm so grateful I believe he's right here as Lord for your your revelation to us that you've revealed the truth to us that we can we're not following coming we devised fables we don't have to work hard to make it all work together with everything else but it's it's all through the Scriptures our saw plane we can see we can see your word we can see your truth we can see your hand all the way through the scriptures we can look back and think if I was with Isaiah I would enjoy his company files with Moses I would enjoy his company in his fellowship I would enjoy what he has to say if I was with the Ezekiel if I was worth Nehemiah all of these different ones if I was with Paul if I was with John Bosworth Martin Luther I would appreciate enjoy the fellowship because we we've been revealed the same truth the same rock we're just thinking Lord that we can build our life upon you I pray continue to bless us this week as we go out may we be faithful Lord may we be found faithful just doing what you want us to do may we be victorious in our walk may our prayer lives to be strong and and that we can overcome every circumstance by faith and may you encourage your hearts toward those of us that have mountains in our life that we are facing will maybe take courage that one grain at a time the mountains moving Lord and that just to hold on and believe that it is coming to pass so we just pray these things Lord and thank you for your grace towards us in Jesus name Amy I mean we have that song on Christ the solid rock I stand [Music] well
