think about it we spend a lot of our can you just turn the piano down a we bit we spend a lot of our um effort to stay keep our body warm you notice that we like to hover around 20 22° or something so you know when it's when it's cold we get heaters we do all this stuff to have our body warm otherwise if our body gets cold we it's not a very enjoyable experience and for a prolonged period of time it could be quite a fatal experience not being warm but our soul is the same you know you you've heard the saying about a cold-hearted person you know they they they but the spirit of God is warm it's I think it's a warm Spirit you know it's always related as as a fire you know and and the spirit of God warms our heart it warms our our soul and and our soul gets nice and warm and comfortable and we you know when you're warm you're like you're happy you can relax when you're cold you're not happy but but I'm glad that you know we're not cold-hearted people we're warm we're warm people when when when they would have the prayer line you know someone would come up and brother Brandon would say I can I can sense you're a Christian I feel a warm Spirit about you you know had notice that warm spirit and and that's what we want to bathe in this morning is the warmth of the Holy Ghost we want that warm Spirit to be in our heart and just to surround us and to to get us in a get us in a nice climate that we that we enjoy and we and that the word of God could come so so praise the Lord let's um let's stand this morning and pray that the warmth of the Holy Ghost would just come and move in our midst this morning Lord we thank you Lord that in this Lord what seems to be such a cold world Lord where so many hearts are cold Lord and they and they turn so brittle When Things become cold they go so brittle Lord like a a out out in the the frost here this morning Lord if it was a even a leaf Lord if it gets too cold it it may be pliable when it's warm but it could just snap with the cold Lord such a such an example of Lord how how when a man are a woman's heart gets so cold Lord and away from you they become so brittle and can break so easily Lord and not the way that we're supposed to be we're supposed to be in warmth Lord and pliable and flexible Lord and just when in the warmth of the Holy Ghost Lord so we just pray that the spirit of God would warm each heart and soul here this morning Lord we've we've done all these natural things to get our our natural body warm Lord but it's it's it's our spiritual soul lord we would' be better in a freezing place with the

from the grave like Lazarus your brand new power death could hold you can't you hear the voice of Jesus calling us out from the grave like [Applause] Lazarus rise up rise up I from the C like [Music] [Applause] amen I always like when the band does a song because um they the these the musicians here are quite good they they they put effort in they practice they when you're a musician you notice it you know you notice when there's supposed to be a little stop there's a little stop then the drama go does a little start again and it all kind of works but you know I've got this theory that anything you do you should do it well and then anything you do for the Lord you should do it very well you know put effort in you don't have to be the best but you just have to give your best you know and um we were going to do we've got a song you know we sort of seem to write a song each year for the camp we were going to do that today but um Tiana is away and she plays the piano for that one so we'll do that next weekend so we'll teach it to you next weekend okay yeah just to give you a little bit of suspense um your anticipation uh let's um stand this morning we're going to just sing you um just a few songs this morning the the um I just want to bring the chus up in here I'm fighting a battle you've already won no matter what comes my way I will overcome and this one here just so cuz the the wording could seem wrong but it's actually if you if you see it in the right context it's correct because it says I don't know what you're doing but I know what you've done an example for that would be like I'm fighting a battle you've already won an example to know that that's not spoken on unbelief it's more like when the children of Israel when God delivered them from Egypt they would deliver with a mighty hand and then they ended up at at at the Red Sea where it seemed like they were they were there was an ocean on this side there was a big uh hell on massive cliff on that side a cliff on that side and the only way out was the way they came in and that was where the Egyptians were coming through so they essentially had no way out and and they were they were done for if they just looked at their situation but they could have said but they could have but been in faith they could have said Lord I don't know what you're doing but I know what you've done I know you're delivering me there I don't know what's going on here but I'm fighting a battle you've already won and sometimes we get that in our life we we don't know what's going on but you know we have to have enough confidence Lord I don't understand any of this it seems like it's all just going to come apart and I'm going to be defeated and everything's just going to go wrong but I know what you've done delivered me from everything else you're going to deliver me from this one I don't know what you're doing but I know what you've done I'm fighting a battle you've already won amen there's a peace that out lost Darkness hope that's in the blood this future Grace that's mine today that Jesus Christ has won so I can face tomorrow for tomorrow's in your hands and all I need you will provide just like you always I'm fighting a battle you've already [Music] won no matter matter what comes my way I will overcome I don't know what you're do but I know what you've done I'm fighting a b you've already won there's Mercy in the way oh there's man for today and when it's gone I know you're not you're all my hope and sa and when the sea is Raging your spirit is my help you fix my eyes on Jesus Christ I'll say that he it is well oh I know that it is well I'm fighting a batt you've already won no matter what comes my way I will I don't know what you do but I know what you done I'm fighting a battle you've already won I'm fighting a battle I'm fighting a battle you've already won no matter what comes my way how will Lord I don't know what you [Music] do but I know what you done I'm fighting a b you're already

God bless you amen great to have you here praise the Lord Brother Andre as well God bless you amen welcome welcome great to have you here amen praise the lord it's just one announcement so the is being baptized after service today praise the Lord amen so it'll be about 12:30 down at the river we'll put the location on the um What's happen then we have lunch afterwards so we're in for a blessed day amen God bless you all amen so let's turn in the scripture to uh we're going to go to um I want to go to the Book of Esther and typical my slides change in order amen we want to we want to read here Esther uh 3 and one and then we're going to go to uh the book of Isaiah amen so amen well I hope everyone W thought out amen I can't feel my toes but it's all right I'm sure I'll get feeling eventually amen but praise the Lord I'm glad it's warm spiritually in here amen that's the main thing amen we're not a bunch of icicles spiritually amen so praise a lot so Esther 3 and one so after these things we know those things was Esther becoming Queen did King of hazus promote hmon the son of hameda the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed and reverence hmon for the king had so commanded concerning him but morai bowed not nor did him reverence then the king's servants which are in the king's gate said unto Mori why trans transgresses thou the king's commandment now it came to pass that when uh they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them that they told hmon to see where the mori's matters would stand for he told them that he was a Jew and and when hmon saw that Mori bowed not nor did him reverence then hmon was full of Wrath amen then we're going to go to uh the book of Isaiah we're going to go to chapter 14 and familiar pieces of scripture I know but I we just want to go over a few few of these things again today so Isaiah 14 and12 you know it's amazing how God I love it how God prophesies our end prophesies the devil's end too amen he ties up all things there's no loose uh Loose Ends amen but how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did US weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I'll Ascend into heaven I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation and the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall nrow look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed cities thereof and open not the house of his prisoners amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning amen let's pray together gracious father we thank you so much that we can come into your presence this morning as a people Lord not by anything we have achieved or done but by Your Precious Blood Lord we thank you for your all sufficient sacrifice which has made a way pray for us so dear God we want to Bow our hearts with reverence and Thanksgiving Lord as we approach you just asking dear God that once again you come and take over the service Lord may you rule in all of our hearts and Minds today dear God may you anoint your word to speaker and hearer and may you receive all honor glory and praise today Father we just want to commit the day into your hands we thank you for all that's taking place today may you just Lord be glorified everything said and done father be with those who couldn't make it today I pray You' be with them Father wherever they are Lord their sick and body or traveling where wherever they may be be their portion Lord we love you and we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning really appreciate the song service I believe it kind of just tied in really nicely to where we're going today but we see this here where um I just want to just point this out now I just if I had a title today I'd say uh Satan knows who he is God knows who he is but do you know who you are amen so it's very important we know who we are amen that because our um our identity gives us power gives us Authority now as we read here in Isaiah how how Lucifer had this grand grand scheme in his heart he says he'll he'll become like the most high he's going to exalt himself be worshiped as God be exalt himself above the sons of God but then the Lord would prophesy his end saying you're going to be brought down to the sides of the pit now it's interesting it says they shall they that see thee shall narrowly look upon the and consider thee so it's not saying all people will see him but it's they that see thee now it's so important that we that we see the devil for who he is amen because we know he's the God of this evil age and you know by deception and deceit he's coming and he's doing what he's doing but if we could really see him for what he is and consider him then we would have the same kind of we would be living out the scripture is this the man is this really this being that's exalted himself and proclaimed himself to be so great but yet he's fallen he's destroyed he's come to nothing now I believe that that that this scene that we see here is not just going to be before he's thrown to the great uh Lake of Fire but there's a people upon the Earth that have the revelation of who the devil is because they have the revelation of who God is and who they are in Christ am mean that they can actually look upon the enemy in all of his tricks all of his plans all of his schemes and consider him saying is this really this enemy that is that has caused such wreckage and destruction and you know come am uh among people and they can see him for what he is now this is the age where people can stand and see him for what he is brother R said when the seals come open it exposes Satan doesn't just reveal Christ because brother R says the opening of the seals reveals Christ right but it reveals who Satan is as well I mean so we we are not standing in this day with a book that's closed and we're wondering how powerful our enemy is his schemes are we know his schemes we know his agenda we know his plans amen and we know his plans for you and I just like he had plans for morai and for Esther hymon now I'm speaking just going to use it as a type but you see we we can stand here and we can see him for what he is now I pray that God would turn the light on Hallelujah because the devil loves to hide in secret he loves to hide in the what could be he loves to hide in the shadows he loves to hide in fear and the possibilities and you know he but but when the lights turn on it's like when you when you hear something and it's dark you don't know what it is if you know what that sound is you're not afraid but if you hear an uncertain sound you never heard it before Oh what could that be going on in the house but if you know it is you're not afraid you know sometimes when we'd move house i' say the girls you'd hear a a a a water pipe or S I'd say this is this that's the wind in the trees here this is this sound just try and calm them down saying you don't need to be worried about the sounds at night cuz this is what they are amen so it's the same thing with the devil he he loves to work in Shadow but when the lights turn on he's like cockroaches when the lights turn on or rats or mice they scatter as fast as they can because they get uncomfortable in the presence of light amen and when the light of the Gospel shine upon the Devil in his tricks amen he gets very uncomfortable and we want want him to be uncomfortable we want you to be super comfortable we want him to be very uncomfortable amen so I pray the light would just turn on because when the light turns on of the word we recognize who we are amen and when we recognize who we are we recognize we're not down beaten downtrodden slay no hopers no future no nothing we're not those kind of a people amen but our future is secure our future is good our future is dancing on streets of gold amen and then then also we recognize that we have dominion over every Power of Hell amen by the blood of Jesus Christ so the revelation of the word the the blood released it the Revelation gives it that's why we must pray for Revelation don't be caught up in the what could bees of life we're got to we're got to discern because many times we think it's just our own mind ruling us causing us trouble making us upset but that's not the case at all amen many times you see I'll just I'll just read this just I just lay a bit of a thing here oh here see see brother Ram says that now in a meeting group going on an evil spirit in the meeting that spirit is almost harmless until it can catch somebody that it can work through yeah so the Devil Himself is almost harmless until someone can open themselves up for him to work through if everyone is closed off see see if you want to kill the devil out of your life you kill his influence if you want to slay the devil kill his influence out of your life or let the word of God kill his influence you see if you're always double minded you're wondering you know which way to go if the word is right or the word is wrong that's the devil trying to influence you to step off the path so he's trying to rule your life well how do you kill that influence you say God Reveal Your word to me amen show yourself alive Lord I want Lord I've heard your alive but I want to see you live Lord your word has been proven and just go start listening to testimonies if you got nothing else and you'll be going to see God proved his word back there he's the same yesterday today and forever amen expose yourself listen to the message of the hour Jesus Christ comes to the present time amen and you will see the light turns on see because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God and with faith takes its position unbelief has to go away I mean so when Faith Comes in amen doubt goes out so the Dominion and the influence of Satan goes out when faith comes in amen and and how do you do that listen to the word of the hour listen to the message am mean get into the tapes whatever you do get into the Bible it will feed your soul give you strength but you see the devil's always trying to discredit your weapon amen if you've got confidence in your weapon you're go to battle and you won't be signing peace treaties and wondering if you can win if you know your weapon has already won the Warfare amen because weapon is the word of God the word of God conquered conquered Satan on the sea amen at lazarus's tomb there in the temple there on the cross down in Hell amen he conquered our weapon conquered him in every sphere that can be fought in amen and he's the same today but you see the devil wants us to always doubt can our weapon work in our situation sure it worked for them but what about you what is he trying to do he's trying to put Darkness into your life that you're wondering what's going on but may the light turn on that you can see him for what he is amen the Lord so he is almost he is almost harmless until he can work he can catch somebody that it can work through I pray that the devil can't work through our lives none of us amen he is he he's Bound by a chain of circumstance it's like a millennium in our lives the devil can't work nowhere he's got no one to work through amen amen this is what we're ordained for you're built for this amen where the devil sealed out God sealed in Hallelujah where the baptism of the Holy Ghost just so rules your life the word of God takes preeminence amen that the devil he can't do nothing with you he'll try every Booky trick in the book he'll try depression but the light turns on this isn't me I'm not just having a bad day there's a devil trying to drag me down I refuse to subc comeb to the thing Satan get out in the name of Jesus Christ well that Spirit of depression left then jealousy might try and come in well that person has this and you've got this and what about you and this person this family but then you realize no godliness when with contentment is great game God has made me thus this is my portion praise God I'm a Believer praise God I've got eternal life praise God that he's got my he's got my best interest in mind jealousy leaves amen amen you know you're going through a time of life maybe you're a teenager maybe going through through menopause whatever it is You' been to worry what's going to happen in my future where you going to realize God had my past he's got my present he's going to take care of me so that Spirit leaves you see so so God hallelujah see this weapon works this weapon works you know doubt comes in you know to me people question the word of God I say well you've come too late you should have you should have got you should have caught me before 2007 when I met the Lord in September 200 he changed my life people you people can't come say well this message is fake no it's not fake because I met the god that brother Brown preached I met the god of the Bible and I didn't have a church to say now you do this and do this and do I had know all I had as an example was the Bible and the message I was a drunk University student God found me in that condition amen so don't say well God can't save me he saved me but see that's the devil trying to rule that's right amen so we got to realize that that the enemy has no power when the light turns on the enemy has no power amen I pray God turn the light on am amen see he's almost harmless now see now I just keep reading this CU I like it now then then when it can work through it will certainly do damage because it's an evil spirit and the Holy Spirit is here trying to find somebody to work through I'm here Lord I'm here Lord and when it find somebody to work through it can do good see the two Spirits their motives objectives am me watch it watch how it is watch their Works watch their fruits then you can see what spirit is on you amen so what is your objective amen if your objective is to is to just you know discredit the word and discredit Christianity all these things that's not the Holy Ghost but if the spirit on you is Lord I want you to live I want you to have preeminence lord I Love You Lord with all my heart what is that that's the Holy Ghost within you amen amen hallelujah praise God you're motivated by Spirit if you have no Spirit you're dead and if you have a spirit it motivates your life and if your life Bears the fruit of a Christian it's a Christian Spirit now you may be filled amen amen you see so spirits that come so so trouble that come especially this age of uh you know uh what do you call it Mental Health crisis that we face it's because people are bombarded by Spirits yeah doesn't mean they necessarily possessed but they can be oppressed you can be a spirit a spirit can come attack you even with the Holy Ghost he'll come attack you the devil came and when did the devil attack Jesus after he is baptized after he has filled with the Holy Ghost see that's when the devil came and gave him his great big Temptations right so you see the enemy can come against you but there's a strong man in the house amen that will withstand him when the devil used to you know once upon a time he' turn up and just just just wreck your life come and trash the place who's ever seen I hope no one's been burgled here but you know Burgers come in and they trash the house they don't just neatly look for things and you know no no they throw open cupboards throw stuff on the floor that you you just you you you just get trashed right and the devil used to come in and trash our lives with all kinds of things of the world Amen but then one day but then but then the devil left us for a season amen and God took his opportunity cuz God had ordained That season just like shamgar Shamar season after season he would come and defeat it he had his Harvest he you he'd bring it in but then he living in defeat not knowing who he was see he knew who God could be he knew who the Philistines were who the devil was but he didn't know who he really was he knew here yes I'm a son of Abraham I'm a circumcised you I'm living in my inheritance but he did not know who he really was I mean but then one day he went to church one day he went to church amen the preacher was preaching you're a son of Abraham God gave you a covenant amen you're a special class of people amen there's a blood of bulls and goats which are God ordained for you amen God gave your father Abraham a promise and God's going to fulfill that promise and then then that day wasn't for his neighbor was for him amen he walked out those doors a transformed person saying I'm a son of Abraham Hallelujah so when that day when he heard the boots of the Philistines stomping Down The Stomping down the road it wasn't a defeat came over him and said well I guess it'll be like last time he said no no what is this enemy squatting on my land what are these trespassers doing they've got no right what are you going to do Shamar I'll take what I've got I'm going to kill every one of them amen so he took what he say I don't have no faith he took an ox goat Hallelujah David had a sling amen what's in your hand Moses had a Shepherd staff what's in your hand amen hallelujah should be the word of God's in your hand oh I don't have much Faith well you you had no faith to get saved you had no faith to give your life to the Lord that's plenty to start fighting with and God will just increase it as you walk with him amen so never think you are unable to do the job but you see shamgar came to a point where he realized who he was and he wasn't a victim anymore he was an overcomer he was ordained to be an overcomer amen so I pray go but what happened the light came on the light came on in his life and he saw he he narrowly looked upon those Philistines and considered them these men are uncircumcised God made no Covenant with them their trespassers see the devil's a squatter we're going to consider this guy he has no he he has no eternal life to give anyone hell was made for him he's just a squatter upon the earth I mean he's got nothing good to give anyone he's just got empty promises broken lives he produces that's all he does Amen he's a squatter he's a trespasser he's a he's a fired servant angels are servants right he got fired cuz he tried to live above his job description he was the CH anointed cherub that cover basically God said this is your job I've made you for he should have stayed in that position but he but Pride came in he elevated himself above his job description and God said you're fired right right he's fired so now we're fighting against a fired servant we aren't servants we are the sons and daughters of God we are his children amen you go to the royal family it doesn't matter if a Butler's been serving the royal family for 80 hundred whatever many years they will never become the son because they were never born of the king and queen right doesn't matter how long they've been here they know the protocol they can do all the things they don't have the authority of a son amen the devil has no he thinks he has the authority but he ain't got nothing right all he has is deception he has no Authority compared to you that's right he's he's a fired servant even even the archangels of God that never did fall when you begin to pray if they're talking to God they say shh my children are talking to me you can be in such a state you can be feel so low you can feel like how you even a believer how you even keeping on you begin to talk to God and he tells heaven to be quiet my daughter's talking to me amen they take priority over you cuz you're a servant but they're my children there's nothing like your children talking to you I mean there's nothing like your family talking it's it's it's a whole greater Dimension than just someone else you may love the other people but it's your family it's part of you you see them you know they're part of you you're part of them amen and when God looks down upon us now he's not looking at this guy uh Hallelujah he's looking at this guy I me but when he looks down upon us he SE see some self in flesh Hallelujah and so when we begin to pray amen they have to shut up cuz he's listening to us I put it that way amen so we we must consider this enemy and realize that it's more than just going back to that it's more than just having a bad day when a spirit's trying to oppress you you got to realize what it is now this is a very this is a time when mental health has gone through the roof it's amazing how the Apostle Paul would speak about these things says wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen so this spirit so so this is Timothy he's trying to encourage Timothy Timothy's gone through some hard roads he's been maybe he's been pardon me rejected maybe made fun of criticized persecuted and and and and and God is using the Apostle Paul to pour in some pour in some encouragement pouring some Revelation pouring some strength and we need this sometimes we go through battles we get discouraged we get knocked back and we wonder Lord am I really you know walking and you know we can we can question our own experience and this is why he's trying to stir Timothy up Timothy before these troubles ever came in your life God ordained you there was a gift and we know the gift actually did not come upon him because Paul put his hands upon him that's a sanctioning or a or a public testimony that that gift was in him cuz he said the faith that was in your grandmother L I'm persuaded is in you right so so Timothy was getting under a a a a attack and so God was God was using using the Apostle Paul to say look God is not this spirit this fear is not god-given we got to realize amen because God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind amen be thou therefore be be not that um thou there for ashamed of the testimony of your lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God who hath saved us and has called us with a holy and holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which has given us in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world but it is now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and ha brought life and immortality to light through the gospel amen amen this is what he's given so so there comes a time when we got to really realize what the enemy is doing there be many times people would come up before brother Braham in the prayer line you know the angels of the Lord would be there and they' be Discerning God would reveal to him what's going wrong and brother BR would say the whole purpose of this was Faith would rise that people would receive their healing or their Deliverance right it's a nervousness the only thing sir you think deep you cross Bridges before you get to them taking other things upon your heart and you're always planning something something that never happens and it's only it's only mentally nervous it's a mental nervousness that's right you've been that way for years but Jesus Christ is here to take it off of you amen there's a dark shadow follows you all the time you're conscious that something's near you like that all the time so here with someone they always troubled they deep thinking deep about things they'll be making plans those plans would never come to pass and you know they're always nervous and they always felt like something was following them but they didn't know what it was right and maybe he's well he's been this way for years so maybe he's thinking this is just me this is just my makeup and part of it being a deep thinker is a makeup of a person but the devil will use your makeup against you just like God wants to use it for his glory the devil wants to use it against you so here's someone who just thinks maybe he just thinks this is just how I am but he doesn't realize it's a spirit bothering him amen do you believe that God's going to take it from you now Satan leave this man come out of the man in the name of Jesus Christ go out of the man iure thee by the Living God that you torment him no more raise up your hand sir you're free for the first time since you was a child my what a long time to have this kind of a thing but he thought maybe it's just part of him but you see what happened the light turned on and then he saw this is not him this is the enemy trying to keep him down keep him troubl keep him upset keep him nervous keep him this way but God said no no this is not my ordained this is not how you're meant to be you're meant to have dominion over this thing you're meant to have peace and joy the love of God flowing through your life amen amen so this so so he says now Hallelujah see do you believe him right now see go sorry go on your road rejoicing at faith in God do you believe him right now go over this audience it seems to be a Milky hazes hanging there I'm not a fanatic I'm a Christian I believe that the Lord Jesus is right here now to make every person well amen amen here's another one from a different message there's a woman standing before me now uh do you have a uh uh it says do you have a nervousness it's a mental nervousness you're always upset the devil has tried to tell you that you've crossed a separating line many things just get so tore up and especially the evening and afternoon see so this comes a season time in the day where this flares up in her life isn't that right you get real nervous you Tire real quickly have to sit down can't stand up yes that's right it's a nervousness come here you believe God give me Authority if he can take make the blindest see do you believe uh he could he could Cast Away cast that away from you almighty God to hold her hands she's your child my sister have mercy on her Satan come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ leave the woman that's it lady will you do as I tell you go out of here just singing rejoicing and happy think nothing about it it's gone from you you're going to be well amen so these people thought this is just how they're built and you know afternoon evening where you just get tired this is why she's got to sit down and she you know you know she can't do things but it was a spirit bothering her amen but see when the light turned on she realized that for what it is and this is why God turned the light on in our life that we would see what's bothering me what's afflicting me is it just me or is it a spirit bothering me if it's a spirit then God gives you dominion over it right I hope this is okay today amen but you see now we've got to we got to discern the enemy in all of his tricks that's how we overcome amen we can really discern what he's doing now now this here as we come back to this now now morai he did not bow to hmon morai did not bow to hmon now to me this is more than just because he was a Jew but morai Mori was of The Tribe of Benjamin amen Esther was of The Tribe of Benjamin then because because Mori was her uncle now there was a prophecy that was given the now now hmon was an agot now this is significant because King AAG was the was the one that Saul did not kill when God told Saul to go kill the amalekites so an agagite is an amalaki now the first time that Israel ever came into battle against the against the amalekites was in Exodus chapter 17 where where uh where where amalik came and fought um with Israel and then Moses told Joshua he says look I'm going to go up on the mountain and you I'm going to raise up my hands and and and if my hands are raised you're going to win the victory amen and then so what happened is when moses' hands went down they begin to lose when his hands got risen up they begin to win now the the way they won was not their ability now I just want to see this this Victory started because a man's hands were raised I mean so that'd be so it wasn't how sharp their swords were how how how well they could fight as long as moses' hands were raised up they were winning amen so now now because when your hands are raised this is a sign of Victory right the first time hands were raised to win a victory was Moses and they'd be cutting they'd be fighting if they just looked up they would see on a hill a man with his hands raised and they and and they kept winning because what Moses was doing and then now when Samson was in the temple he what did he do he is blinded there in the temple of deeon he raised his hands he said Lord avenge my eyes I'm willing to die with my enemy and he pushed the pillars and won a great Victory why because it's a sign of surrender amen but those two victories pale nothing compared am mean to our Lord Jesus amen there was hanging between heavens and earth his hands were raised outstretched amen he conquered how death in the grave amen so as we're fighting in the valley we just got to look up on the hill and realize our Lord's going to be like this interceding for us acting on our behalf until all of God's children come home amen so if you haven't come home today come home come home to him this morning amen you going to realize it's not your ability in the battle it's the fact his hands are been raised am mean the victory is won because of what he is doing Hallelujah that's why we're fighting a battle you've already won I mean we may be hot and heavy the battle may be struggling in battle and real but no we've already won it cuz he's won it amen so as you're taking the word of God Amen you're fighting the enemy with the word of God you're quoting the scripture I mean you're you're listening to songs that build Faith listening to messages that build Faith amen and you're training for the battle realize he's already won the battle amen but you got to you've got to train see uh I think it's I think you know you know um I we come to this actually let's just drop down to this so you know and because we got to walk purposely I know the Olympics are on this is not why this is but you see Paul would say this no you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain we don't run this race to to get a participation award at the end we're running to win we're running this Christian Life to win right and every man that striveth for Mastery is temper in all things that they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we and Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly it's not thinking will it work how's it going to happen no I'm certain my destination is secure am am mean so fight I not as one that beateth the a now this this this word fight actually means to box that's what this word boxes you know and and and and to beat the air basically means he's going to fight that he's going to land punches right you don't want to go into the ring and just start swinging and you don't hit uhuh did you hit him with that uppercut oh no but that airet hour later you know you know you don't see so so so it's like with the word of God our Christian walk we don't want to be swinging without purpose no right we want to realize there's purpose in reading the word you say well I don't really get anything out of it what do you get out of social media I just I just realized a while ago I thought well I might as well read this and not remember anything then read social media remember and and remember nothing what feeds my soul Facebook ain't feeding my soul or Instagram or whatever you're doing you know you see right so we want to we want to be praying with purpose we're going to be walking with purpose why do we go why you say it's just another Monday tomorrow there's purpose in that day amen right we're not just occupying time we're not just filling up space and going through the motions no every day has a purpose right so say Lord I want to live your purpose in this day I want to walk with you am mean not not not I want to run not uncertainly but but certain amen I want to I want to do everything with purpose well what's your purpose Lord I want to draw closer to you I want to see your presence move in my life in a greater way I want to see Revival strike every heart I want to see your promises fulfilled Lord I want to see my children filled with the Holy Ghost Lord I want to see my way with loved ones come home Lord see it should be purpose Lord hallelujah not just talking to you Lord just to you know you say well I don't know how to pray pray him then if you don't know how to pray or how to ask for things just give him glory amen amen amen and then you'll start then he'll put on your heart what to pray for because you get into that channel of inspiration hallelujah amen so so we want to run this race with purpose now as I said about I said about um uh Mori going back to this he he did not bow because of purpose and it wasn't because of Pride it wasn't just because he was a Jew but there was prophecy he was living in because after this when they prevailed here it says and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua so rehearse it in the years of uh ears of the Next Generation for I will uly put out the remembrance of amch from under heaven and Moses built an altar and called the name of Jehovah Nissi for he said because the Lord has sworn that that the Lord will have war with AMC from generation to generation now keep the spiritual in mind when I'm talking about this cuz we don't wrestle against flesh and blood right we wrestle against principalities wickedness evilness and high places right so God to me here God is saying that he's going to fight the devil from generation to generation he's going to utterly blot out Satan from under heaven right he's going to not even be ashes on the field he's going to be nothing when everything's said and done there's going to be no existence of him there's going to be no Memorial of him there's no grave of him he's going to be nothing he's not even going to be Vapor nothing he's going to be absolutely nothing when it's all done why cuz he's going to be absolutely blotted from under Heaven amen right but he's going to fight from generation to generation now now as I said Mori was a Mori was the of The Tribe of Benjamin now that was the same tribe that Saul was from and Saul did not fulfill the word of God by taking out the amalekites like he should have right so just because someone someone that was forly in you know someone previous in the family failed at fulfilling all the word of God doesn't mean you have to amen I believe God if there's great failures in the past God will raise up people from that same family to fulfill this to fulfill the word to break the cycle maybe Generations past our families went into idolatry they one time walking with God they went into darkness God will use that same family line this is just me I don't know I might be wrong but God will raise up someone where the devil says but look what your forbears did but God will raise you up to say I'm not built of that cuz I'm a New Creation in Christ Jesus amen that no God is going to use me to break the cycle amen maybe you've always been in uh uh reverent to religion you know you know you our forbears they didn't care about God they weren't interested or maybe they're just religious people but then God turned on the light in your life am mean God began to live in your life what happened he's breaking that cycle of what they could not do you're now doing amen so he was of the but you see now Mori this is just me would have realized oh hmon is an agite so he could consider him for who he really was he wasn't just a Persian or wasn't just someone else no he was an agery it was very significant that that morai knew who his enemy was you see that's what I'm saying it's very it's very important we know who our enemy is see because because Mori was a man of God when he found out that hmon was an agot he' say ah God said he's going to fight a um amalec from generation to generation and now this battle's falling on my lap amen but I'm living in Prophecy now that I'm not going to be defeated amen that Victory is going to come amen because God's prophesied it amen that's why it's so important friends we realize where we're going I mean that that that is proph we're living under prophecy where you will be changed in a moment and twinkling of an amen cuz this word has transforming power see it's no it's no haphazard thing you've come into this message it's not it's not just a random occurrence of events that have come no God has ordained it that you'd hear a word that will transform your body that will restore you back to the original faith of the fathers amen that when you read the book of Acts you see your own life in there cuz the same God that lived back then is the same God that lives in you now amen so so it's not a haphazard thing you see so when we realize no we're part of the Rapture I me cuz we're part of God then we realize we're living under prophecy where we're not ordained to go into the Great Tribulation amen glory to God hallelujah amen so now Mori could could stand there and say I'm not bowing cuz my God has spoken about you just like we read Isaiah my God has spoken about you devil and you're going to come to the sides of the pit you said you're going up and you're going down and I'm going up amen he said you're going down God the devil said you're going down but God said you're going up hallelujah amen so he could stand there now morai could not go on before the king but Esther could Esther was part of this prophecy hope you give me that Liberty this morning all right but you see now there came a point where where Esther morai had to speak to Esther to get her to to to possess the position she was now living in see we got to realize who are see they all knew who the king was the king says this it happens he makes a law it cannot be reversed the King has Absolute Power King of has awar us can do whatever he wants whenever he wants however he wants and no one can stop it you see just like our lord Jesus he can do whatever he wants whatever he wants however he wants amen it'll be his word of course but nothing can stop him the devil can't stop him amen so we can realize yes the Lord is all powerful but now God is put us in a position to draw out from God his attributes right enem is to be delivered to be to be a Healer to be a redeemer to be a savior all those things are in him to be a protector a shield a comforter a guide but he God has put us in a position by the blood of Jesus Christ so we can draw from God what we have need of Amen but we have to do it amen amen so you see now ether ether was in the position where where she could do that Mori couldn't now they're living under the they're living under the um sentence of death we know here where where um you know hmon got the law written that you know that the Jews are going to be killed on the 13th day of Adar and all those things they're living under a death sentence but but Esther Esther had already found favor in the S side of the king amen you know you found great favor in the sight of God we found abundant favor I really wish we could look past this realm the these five senses and you could see your spiritual State you can rarely see your spiritual state am me where you passed from Death unto life there's no there's therefore no there's no condemnation that to them which you're in Christ Jesus right that you're actually safe as safe can be I mean there's nothing between your soul and your savior you're seal to the day of your Redemption amen I wish we could really see that then all the you know then all the battles I think would just we' just charge in we'd have a greater confidence I know in whom I have believed amen he is my king my shield my rock and I can trust him no matter what goes on but you see now as Mori said to Esther you've got to go before the king but Esther replied all the king's servants and the people of the um of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come into the king into the inner Court who is not called there is one law of his to put um to put him to death except thou except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but I have not been called to come in unto the king these 30 days and now notice now now all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces and it's either men or women but Esther was part of the king she was in a different category she wasn't a servant she wasn't a person of the Kingdom anymore she was part of the king you see so that law was actually overridden by the grace of God Amen now then then Mori would say for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall um then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for a Time such as this see you're here for a reason then Esther B them B them return to Mori this answer go gather together all the Jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days day or uh night or day and I also my maidens will Fast likewise and so will I go in unto the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish so Mori went his way and did according to all that Esther had commanded him now her approach I mean her approach to go to the King was with reverence she didn't just burst in there and say hey King o hubby listen this is gone on no she approached him the right way right even though she was the queen even though she was part of him she still approached him with reverence and respect you see and and there is great power and reverence amen just like the Bible says that wives should reverence their husband that's what husbands need love and you respect and reverence that's what they need women wives need love husbands need reverence and respect see if you just have those two things in your mind as you treat one another you just see your relationships Bloom amen that's what I was trying to cap off from last Sunday but you see she did not come in just just any old way she said no we're going to fast and pray I'm going to go with sincerity amen because I'm not going in according to the law the Lord say uh the law says I can be killed so I'm going to go in but if I perish I perish then on the third day Esther put on her royal apparel stood in the inner Court of the King's house over against the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal throne and the Royal house over against the Gate of the house and it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court she obtained favor in his sight amen so the king's favor which she had already found favor when when she was made Queen in the first place amen but then but she obtained favor in his sight so so the King extended his Royal scepter out to Esther amen and we know that the law condemned us but Grace was extended in Jesus Christ unto us amen and what so why because we obtain favor in his sight Hallelujah and then the king began to ask what is your request he says what thou Queen Esther so he's he's speaking to her according to her position amen what is your request amen it shall be given to the even half of the Kingdom now that doesn't mean necessarily the kingdom would be divided but but she's joint ears with him I'll make you a joint ear amen and we are May joint ears with Christ by the blood of Jesus Christ amen so she came in with reverence amen because she realized that well she knew she could speak to the king and get what she needed for the Deliverance of her people are you following me today I mean we're going to realize we have there's great I'm I I may sound like a broken record but hey I'll tell that devil to shut up we have great Authority in our position brother Braham says when the bride when the church realizes what she is then the Rapture will go when we really realize not in here but in here we're part of this word and we're part of our King am me you can't divide the two of us anymore like husband and wife they become one right God and his brother become one Hallelujah why there's there's an you know the blood makes an atonement right which is an atement we become one by the blood of Jesus Christ amen there's an at onement that takes place you can't find a se you can't find a gap that's right Hallelujah you one husband and wife become one Christ and his bride become one there you cannot divide them Hallelujah why cuz there's an atment has taken place amen and if you're not under the blood becometh one with God by the blood amen so she went in there she asked them to come to a feast amen and we know that they you know then they had a banquet of wine they enjoyed it that night the king couldn't sleep and you know he asked for the palace records to come open and you know the you know the um pardon me the Scribe was reading where where morai saved the King's life and we know that everything reversed there when the book came open am mean then they had another banquet of wine the king asked what is your request Esther and the Queen said and then the queen began to pour our her heart out to the king and you see that's why it's so important amen we worship God we worship God Amen we worship Him in song we worship him when the word Goes Forth we worship him in our everyday life our life is a worship to God what does it do that moves the heart of the king you know churches are actually a banquet of wines Revelation stimulation by revelation of the word I people get happy they get loose they get relaxed as the word Goes Forth as the ano anointing pours out what's happening you're drinking spiritual wine and when God begins to see us respond to him it moves his heart what is your request what do you have need of what do you have need of in 2024 amen we say this spirit's been troubling me this wicked man hmon who wants to destroy me destroy my family destroy everyone I me it's this one and then what does that do that causes the wrath of God to be poured out against your enemy hallelujah it's more than a story friends a reality who's ever had a time of real righteous ignation you have a right to get mad at the Devil you don't get mad at people you get mad at the Spirit you have a right to get real mad amen at that Spirit when the devil tries to come in and take you or whatever you you get mad at him say Satan how dare you squatter get out in the name of Jesus Christ he say I tried that you just keep you just keep going cuz the devil try to say no I have a right here no you have no right here he doesn't just quit no he'll call your he'll call what you what he thinks is your BL but where if you really got something in you he has to leave amen praise the Lord amen remember when Christian I were first married we came back from Papa New Guinea God did wonderful things there and she you know ended up in hospital with seizures every so often she'd be normal then she'd just start shaking become unresponsive right side or left side whichever side was shaking you know and then she come normal again and so in me I'm like and and we were just newly WS but in me you know because the Bible says him that seeketh shall find him that knocketh it shall be open so when this is all going on and she's in hospital I was back where we were staying I was praying Lord him that seeketh shall find is this a long trial is a short trial I don't know but you are the answer to this problem Lord am mean she's not meant to be in this condition am mean and I got to I don't know how but I got a breakthrough in prayer I knew God's going to answer now Hallelujah don't you love don't you love it when you pray through amen when you really your peace comes you know God's going to answer the prayer amen the next time went into the hospital she said you know there's a dark cloud always comes over my vision it feels like I'm going to be jump off a cliff or be pushed off a cliff and this Cloud comes over my vision and then and you know and then I start shaking and then she said it's coming on me now we prayed rebuked the thing I think that afternoon she was out of the hospital amen why because no because remember prayer Works prayer works it's not empty words amen we're going to have a real anchor in our heart we can go before our King whenever we need to amen and he hears our prayers you say well the answer seems to be a long time away that's irrelevant am me as long as you break through and you feel that a peace comes you say God you're going to answer this Hallelujah he may not even tell you exactly how he's going to do it but he's going to do it then you can go on confidence God and then then what do you do you praise him because the answer's been given Hallelujah Abraham spent 25 years when when when Isaac became a revelation Hallelujah to Abraham hallelujah hallelujah he his life turned into a praise is this okay amen because because it was because Revelation declares it so though though you don't see it though you don't feel it though that none of the five senses declare it so Revelation says it's here it's now it's present and so he could be rejoicing thanking God that Isaac was on his way because it became a revelation amen then he stayed in a spiritual atmosphere cuz Sarah had to get the same Revelation it's amazing before Genesis 18 cuz we're um um as family prayer we're reading through Genesis chapter night you know praying and singing and things and you know um but God God tells God tells Abraham before Genesis 18 Genesis 18 is when God comes down visits Abraham and Sarah you know discerns the laughter and Sarah's heart and God tells them according to time of life you're going to have the promised son before that visitation God tells Abraham within a year you're going to have the child that's right hallelujah amen amen so now he had such an expectation Lord the clock's ticking and you can't lie Hallelujah you can't lie Lord why it became such a revelation to him so what he do he had a spiritual atmosphere around him and no doubt he would have seen for 25 years the response of Sarah to the promise cuz after a while things can get a bit redundant when you don't see things happening and it can actually become annoying let's be honest we're people right but then because it anchored in his heart he was praising God and creating a spiritual atmosphere because he knew Lord Lord she's part of the promise now she's going to come and receive faith that it can be conceived in her amen cuz she's part of the promis I think if we did that it would be real good yeah that's right hallelujah amen are having a hard week praise God I'm not saying you don't do this but you know if we could just focus on the promise of God and come in reverently before the king amen I think all would be well Hallelujah now when God manifests himself you see so she Drew out she Drew out of king of hazaras judgment and deliverance amen deliverance from herself and her people and judgment upon hmon see because within him was to be judged but her faith drew that out of him now Peter Peter would be fishing one day you know it's amazing you know a child of God see I just like this Jesus says you know they fishing all night they weren't catching anything and then Jesus said have you caught any fish he says now nothing cast your net on the other side let down your knet again and maybe Peter's thinking what I've tried that but something in him said do it he says nevertheless at Thy word Lord I do it puts his net down the net becomes full of fish amen then they pull the fish up now other fishermen they were looking probably marveling at all the fish but you see it brought a response out of Peter saying Lord depart from me I'm a sinful man Hallelujah so so he got he got Mercy because God did a god did the miraculous others were maybe marveling at fish but he was saying Lord depart from me I'm a sinful man I'm not worthy to be in your presence Lord so his reverence and humility in that moment amen brought him forgiveness hallelujah amen because he went down he went down a sinful man but then the Lord said I'm going to make you more than that I'm going to make you I'm going to make you a fisher of man amen cuz why he bowed down with reverence and humility and he got Mercy out of God hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord how are we doing for time time's running away now Ruth we know the story of Ruth this what I'm talking about today I know I've said other things but it's the power of reverence see you recognize who the devil is you know what he is sure he's a squatter he's a bluff and all these things but he's a real enemy he's more than a thought he's a spirit that wants to destroy you right you recognize who he is you know who God is but then but who who are you and your approach to God will get what you need out of God Amen that's why we can never be blaz when we approach the Lord we can't be kiwi how's it you know no no no we're going to come reverently he's the king of creation we're talking about here he's the Lord Of Glory that we're approaching amen and so Ruth Ruth we know in the Book of Ruth she would she was a moabitas you know there was there was a family that came from Israel they came out from bethleem they they they went to Moab you know and Ruth married one of the sons and but of course you know the um Ruth's husband brother-in-law and father-in-law they all passed away and then Ruth's um mother-in-law noomi said look I'm going back to Israel now I hear there's grain you know the famine is over so so she went back Ruth went all the way and said I'm following you wherever you go I'll go will you die I'll die and all these things but then there came a place where where where Ruth was was um um she was she was gleaning in in boaz's field now Boaz we know was a mighty man of wealth you know he owned the field that she was in and she was a near Kinsman to to Naomi and there was a law in the Old Testament of the law of the kinsman redeemer where where um if someone had fallen into debt you know they couldn't pay a debt they had to sell themselves as a slave or whatever that someone who is related to them who had to be a near Kinsman they had to be a relation and they had to have the money to pay off the debt and they had to be willing to pay off the debt that so that's the law of a Kinsman and if they could do those things they could buy their family out of slavery restore their restore their land now Boaz was a near Kinsman to to Naomi and Ruth So within him was the ability to restore all that Naomi lost right and within him by marriage was the ability to bring Ruth into the covenants of Israel because the law said that no Moab no moabit could come into the congregation of Israel that's what the law said right so the law said Ruth you can't come in but Grace overshadowed the law and brought and brought Ruth in amen so now n me instructed instructed Ruth say Ruth Boaz your near Kinsman is going to be willowing barley at the threshing floor he's going to sleep there go find where he lay uncover his feet and lay down there and then he will he will tell you what to do now go wash yourself put on some clean clothes y don't just go after you've been in the field all day go on with reverence and humility don't lay down at his head don't even lay down at his side lay down at his feet cuz she's going to approach with reverence and humility to draw from Boaz what she needs right amen so she went and lay down there and then and then and then at midnight he woke up this is verse eight here I'm just power you just jumping through this a bit amen and and you know he turned and saw that she was laying there and he asked the question who are you and her her first thing that she said is I am Ruth thy handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman so you're you're related to me through Naomi Now cover me with your skirt so what I am cover me over that's why that's why brother Ram said find where our lord Jesus who is Boaz right Bo a type of Christ find where he lay where' he lay down at Calvary lay down at his feet amen because when we come to him at Calvary say Lord cover me in your blood Hallelujah cover me in myy skirt cover my old life cover my first birth yeah cuz she's saying look I'm a m but cover me with your skirt and why is that because you are a near Kinsman to me see she didn't come and have Pasley they didn't have just a conversation around the around the coffee table whatever she came in reverence and humility and said Lord cover me amen cover my identity cover my first birth and then what happened is because in him was the ability to restore right in him was the ability to change her from a moabit to an Israelite amen amen in her in him was to change her from a widdow with nothing to a mighty woman of wealth why because she would marry the Mighty Man of wealth am mean so now here here she goes she does this and then she and then she has given six measures of Bley from from from Boaz I mean goes back to goes back to her her her mother-in-law I'm I'm just skipping over some things to save time and then and then Noah um Nomi says now now I don't have it here but Naomi says to Ruth rest now yeah because he will not rest until this is all fulfilled he will not rest so what happened is she going to him caused him to act on her behalf so Ruth going to Boaz caus him to stand up in his position as kinsman redeemer that she could be restored now the Bible says draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you right and it's not just oh I feel close to God it's not just that it's Lord I have needs you are the answer to all my needs Lord there's attributes in you that I need to see expressed in in my life maybe you don't even know him as Savior lay at his feet he'll he'll Express that salvation to you maybe you don't know him as healer lay at his feet he'll Express his healing virtue to you maybe you know maybe you don't know him as husband his Redeemer lay down on his feet he'll redeem you he'll restore you he'll make you at one with him like he did like Boaz did with Ruth amen hallelujah amen now what Avail now I'm just going to make a quick segue then we're going to then we're going to stop trust you don't mind now the reason the reason that Ruth and Esther could go on and do these things she they realized that they had the not just the ability but it would work I believe that you know I I don't think Esther went before the king cuz she thought I'm just going to see what happens she realized she she was carrying a secret she was one with him right that she could get out of the king what she needed what what her people needed Ruth was the same way now the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much right I just want to just emphasize this this is my conclusion to this whole matter see we come into the presence of God with reverence and humility right but we realize that our prayers Avail he's made us righteous by his blood amen our prayers Prayer Changes Things amen okay so it availeth much now it's interesting this word availeth because in the Bible it's only used four times and one is used in the Book of Esther and it's actually hmon telling his wife that oh because because he's boasting to his wife I'm the Prime Minister I've got all this wealth and all these things all my fame but but but he says to her but this avails me nothing because morai lives that's one time this this word's used the other times are here the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much but then it's also used in Galatians for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love now ath means it has power it has ability has strength right so circumcision or uncircumcision that that gives you no power or or strength or ability in Christ it's faith that worketh by love and then he would say in in in chapter six for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision aileth anything nor uncircumcision ision but a new creature amen so he's saying the new birth being transformed because remember we receive the Holy Ghost because we are Sons it says in Galatians right so when when God gives us his holy spirit we realize who our father is right we realize now who we are we are Sons and Daughters of God and then if we if we see those things by Revelation then we'll see who the devil is cuz the devil once ruled us but now we're ordained to rule him when he was ruling us he was never meant to in the first first place right but but he's but Paul is telling the Galatians look it's not keeping the law circumcision uncircumcision Traditions whatever know what avails is that you are a new creature what avails or gives you strength is faith that works by love amen and he says as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the Israel of God Amen the Israel what is it the princes of God the called out of God am mean so me so so if you walk according to this rule what's that being a son or daughter of God availeth much then peace will be upon you I'm his child I'm never out of his care he may correct me he'll bring me back he'll do whatever but I'm his child he can't lose me what does that mean you sit back and watch the world go by no you press the battle amen amen Because Why You Got Confidence I'm his child if I'm his child I'm part of him he can't lose me I am ordained to win prise the Lord amen praise the Lord and then what do you do you find yourself identified with the word of God Amen I'm just going to finish with these two quotes here oh do you find yourself identified with as true disciples amen I trust you find identified with Ruth and Esther amen that's where you want to be true to him true to his word stayed up in the face of critics I mean amen is that where you find yourself identified tonight thank the Lord amen letting the Life of Christ flow through them yes sir they had been Sanctified by is coming and a sinful man upon confession and sanctification had cleansed them and their hearts were so centered to God until Christ poured himself into them and reflected his presence to the world in the face of critics they stood like he did they stood true to the word even till one said thou almost persuade me to be a Christian see one of us the critics can you identify yourself with Peter on the day of Pentecost can you identify yourself there in Acts 2 where people say today the Holy Ghost was only given to the 12 disciples can you identify yourself with Peter when he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call the same Holy Ghost did you identify yourself there with him on that day I stand with you Peter yes sir upon your fundamental teachings of the scripture I stand there I want my life to reflect the scripture just like yours did there when 3,000 were pricked in their hearts amen I trust you identify yourself in the word of God praise the Lord now in closing I just want to say this if you can see yourself if the light turns on right when the light turns on you see you see the word and its truth right you fulfill the word it's your everything and you see who God is God is his word maybe the musician can come right God is his word right so when you see he is his word and you want to be identified with his word then you can see I'm probably saying that too much but then you can see who the devil really is and then you can withstand him so I pray May the light turn on in every heart we're going through a very murky gray dismal world right there's lots of deception lots of trouble all these things but God said I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee right he said I'm a present help in time of trouble this is a time of trouble he said he said I'm your Shepherd a Shepherd doesn't leave a sheep in the Bible sense he doesn't leave a sheep he's always with them and he leads them okay so as long as we stay we say Lord I know you're my shepherd you cannot fail that's right right if he can't fail and if I'm with him then I can't fail no matter what the enemy tries to put against me am mean my shepherd will point out the enemy to me right that I can and all I need to do is stay close to him and he will defeat the enemy amen amen so let's um let's stand this morning amen let's sing that song Let's sing
