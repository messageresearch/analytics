seats so i'm just going to go through actually a very different um topic today i'm going to talk about the sacred stands of god and um so next youth meeting i'd actually like you brothers to speak i mean i'm talking about the royal we as in you you know what i mean i mean so a couple of you speak maybe special or a testimony from this side of the side of the aisle you know so that'd be good amen so we'll put that together um second timothy 1 and 12. but if anyone has you have any questions some other topics you want to go through of course i haven't exhausted everything you know from what i've been talking about but um yeah please let me know so second timothy 1 and 12 saying here [Music] for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i known whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer this afternoon gracious lord jesus there is none like you how true that is lord if we could lord if we had a million lifetimes we would never able to find one like you because there's no one that can compare to you or god no i'm not even close and i want to thank you lord in your great mercy you lord came down into time lord to reveal yourself to us and thank you your spirit is still working in the earth lord revealing yourself to whom you will i just want to thank you for that dear god thank you we can walk with you we can know you lord in this hour and i just pray lord as we have the service this afternoon i pray you'll be very real be be very present among us oh god may you grant it lord jesus i want to talk to some talk about something that's very dear to my heart lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you may have your seats this afternoon so i want to talk about uh brother brown makes a statement about uh meeting the lord on the sacred sands because there's in this day we live in there are many opinions and voices and religions and philosophies that are out there that will challenge your faith you know it's not just the devil challenging your faith well you know in terms of about being sick and different things but it's more you know he's going to challenge what you believe and the only way to stand in this day is actually you know the author you know him because if someone can explain you into the message someone can explain you out and you know and just being raised in church is not enough you must know him i know this is not foreign to anyone but it's very vitally essential you know so i want to um brother bam says this i don't know if you can read it but he says unbelief does not hinder god he says in the last days what is going to take to stand as a scriptural trained church on the line for there's going to be carnal impersonations rise even among believers there's going to be cattle impersonations whether we like it or not within every church i'm not pointing even looking at anyone when i say this but these believers make believers and unbelievers in every group um so that's the cardinal impersonation right so can't impersonations rise the bible said as janice and generous withstood moses so will these men of reprobate mind concerning the truth and jesus was the truth thy word is the truth because in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the word of god is more powerful than a two-edged sword cutting to ascend of the bone and discern of the thoughts of the heart we realize that we're in that day to where anything can look so real but yet if it's off the scripture leave it alone no matter what kind of a sensation what results you find out of it if it isn't scripture stay away from it stay with the word he says yeah so he says here that this is the only thing that's going to stand in this day as a scriptural trained church now when i'm going to talk about a scriptural trained church i'm not on on one hand and we'll get into it it's vital that you are trained in the scripture that you know the word in here but to be scripturally trained you need to know how was a church trained originally now on the i don't have a picture of it but on the day of pentecost that's how god trained his church he came and dwelt in the church brotherham talks about an inside teacher and an outside teacher so the inside teacher is the holy ghost in your life he'll teach you the word but then there's the outside teacher the five-fold ministry which teaches you the word as well right but it takes the inside teacher to take that word and bring it into your soul and make it live so that's how the church was originally trained wasn't going through a bunch of theology but meeting the author of the book meeting the lord himself now it's because there'll be people will come along in every part of your life that will challenge you on what you believe you know i had to sit through lectures about evolution at at university i pray you had to endure some as well you know and they weren't teaching it as a theory it was a fact and they were very strong on what they believed and all the professors are very strong it's evolution there's nothing there's no god there's nothing it's just even the comments after class during class you know they were very much this way and so if i didn't know the author their their arguments looks very real looks very plausible it makes sense from their scientific understanding but what i love about this scientific understanding it's only a part of the science because the laws of chemistry actually forbid life ever forming i could go into that another time but the laws of chemistry see where they start is they start from a single cell being and then it evolved into me eventually you know humans and you know chimpanzees and so on but they're not willing to go what happened before that single cell being came into formation and they're trying to explain it by how chemistry works but the laws of chemistry forbid it happening but they never go into that because they say well it just takes billions of years no what they think it's just they have to believe it to be so so they have a faith as well right but the basic laws of chemistry forbid it happening but but the thing is if i didn't know the author it could sway me or if i didn't know the author the christians on campus could have said well there's three gods and look i'll show you some scripture to show it's true and you know so there's even that but if you know in whom you have believed all the reasoning of the devil could not take you from who you believe because you've met the author and it's very vital that you know him this is essential in this day i mean even even if you take practical things about finding who to marry all those courtship all the things we've talked about if you don't know whom you have believed you can be swayed to do all different kinds of things but if you know him and if he leads your life then you'll you're on a good road right so so it's very important that we're a scriptural trained church and it's a vital as well that when you listen to the who listens to the message anyone here regularly your daily diet you should be able to find what brother and preachers in the scripture right you've got because what the message did it revealed jesus christ in the scripture it's not another bible we don't have another he revealed what the absolute says right from genesis to revelation so you should it actually behooves you to check if i'm telling you the truth do you know if it's true what i say does anyone go check me up you should you should you know yeah it's actually your own obligation to your own soul to make sure if i'm off the word or on the word and if i'm off i want to know right so it's your obligation is that really true does he did he really say that and is it really in the scripture you know so amen yeah i mean that shouldn't shock you i mean you know wish no we should check because remember this is this is our eternal destination we're talking about right it's not just you know but if you if you've been like brother brown would say about now this is moses so this is where brother brahman speaks about being on the sacred stands of meeting god moses met god in the pillar of fire in the burning bush he met the god of creation once he met once he met the lord no one could explain it away from he was there it happened it changed his life he had an experience no one talked him into it so no one can talk him out of it right no matter what obstacle he came against whatever trouble he faced in life he knew he had an experience with god on the sacred sands and it's the same thing with you and i because the same god that met moses became jesus christ right so the same god that spoke to moses out of the burning bush is the same god that speaks to us he's not a different god he's the same one does anyone know that's true you can take that through the bible i'm saying check me out have your eye on me is this guy telling you the truth or not so he met but the thing is moses could stand there in spite of all opposition and he knew god would take care of him you know when cor and dathan came against him he said well whoever is swallowed up by the earth basically is you know god will prove whose side who's on and god swallowed core and nathan up with all those people and god was with him every step of his journey and he'll be the same with us he'll be every step of our journey as well but you've got to meet him on the sacred sands that's why the apostle paul could say i known whom i have believed because he met the same god that moses met he met the same one right so he knew in whom he had believed so and you read through the apostle paul's life he had a lot of opposition it wasn't an easy road for him but he knew where he was going he knew and who he who he have believed and no one could explain it from him this is essential right this is essential because if you know him then you're going to heaven essentially i mean it's pretty it's pretty simple christianity's not complicated you know if you know the author and he's washed all your sins away which he has you're on your way to heaven so you've got to know in whom you have believed now he says here in time tested faith brother sister there's a secret place that every believer should go on the backside of the desert on those sacred sands and no doctor of theology no greek or hebrew scholar no school or seminary they might twist you all up in those kind of things but if you've ever met god on those sacred sands satan can't put his feet on them sans you know you met god something real what was it you talked to god yourself you had an experience because these kind of people they're smart they have all their theories you go read into it it will tangle you but if you've met god on those sacred sounds like moses did those things will never actually pull you off the road they may trouble you a bit but if you know and whom you have believed you go back to that source amen you can you can stand the test right but if you haven't met him then you will be pulled off the track right so this is very vital now do i have like let's just okay i don't know if you can read this but i just want to maybe segue and then go back to what i'm talking about now this is this is a paper from 2000 and i believe it's 17 and it talks about gut microbiota's effect on mental health so what's talking about is the link between the health of your gut and your brain and what they've what they've found is the health of your gut affects your mood right okay so i'll just read the abstract the bi-directional communication between the nervous system and gut microbiota referred to as the gut brain access has been of significant interest in recent years so what it means is basically they found out that your brain talks to your gut and your gut talks to your brain that's what that means increasing evidence has associated gut microbiota so what this is is what's growing in your gut okay to both gastrointestinal and extra gastrointestinal diseases so so what's going on in here will affect your gut health and then even beyond your gut diaspiasis and inflammation of the gut have been linked to several mental illnesses including anxiety depression which are prevalent in society today probiotics have the ability to restore normal antimicrobial balance and therefore have a potential role in the treatment and prevention of anxiety and depression and it says this review aims to discuss the development of gut microbiota the linkage of uh dies biases to anxiety and depression and possible applications of probiotics to reduce symptoms now what affects your gut it's what you eat right so what you eat affects your gut so if you're eating so this is just in the natural but but it's got a spiritual application because because if you naturally if your if your thinking is affected by what you eat naturally then so spiritually your thinking is affected by what you eat spiritually right so even they've found out things like um um what do you call it uh autism asperger's different spectrums of those kind of mental health areas it's assured as can be treated by improving gut health so now here's a question what are you feeding on because if you're feeding on just like in the natural if you're feeding just on junk food it will affect your mood because it affects the health of your gut and therefore it affects your brain so so they found that mental illnesses are linked to anxiety and depression are linked into the health of the gut right so if you're feeding on the wrong things then you will be thinking the wrong way you actually be thinking in a bad way we should be so anxiety always stressed and worried about everything and depression that's just from having bad gut health how much more spiritually if you're not feeding on the right things right if you're not actually feeding on the word because when you read the scriptures when you hear the message it should tell you you're an overcomer that god's grace is sufficient that we're made in his image we're going to go on a rapture you know we the devil's under our feet you know isn't well that's what i hear what you know when i hear it you know but but that guy so what does that do it changes my thinking that my thinking becomes positive i can make it right i'm gonna make it jesus already made it for me because he died of me on calvary i'm gonna make it because he made it i'm gonna overcome because he overcame right that's that's how my thinking is by based on what i eat but if i'm eating the things of the world if i'm caught up in the news or whatever media stuff then my thinking becomes negative and that's where worry can happen and what's going to happen in the future what's going to happen to this country what's going to happen to this world and the environment and different issues and stuff but it's because you feed on the wrong thing right but if you feed on the right thing then you become physically strong there's even says here that probiotics have the ability to restore the natural microbial balance right so eating something healthy or something healthy will actually bring you into the right balance that's why it's so important you've got to feed on the message feed on the bible right there's plenty of good ministries online feed on them right because it actually makes you think clearly it doesn't make you think carnally like the world it makes you think spiritually and brother brahm says that the holy ghost feeds on the word so if you want the whole who knows of the holy ghost brother ram says it's like when you when you're first born into the kingdom the holy ghost is in you like the size of a button who's heard him say that right but then eventually it goes from just being the size of a button and it begins to grow until it grows until it fills your whole being right but in order for something to grow like if i starved my children if i didn't feed them they're not going to grow if i don't feed myself i'm not going to grow either i'm going to die right so the same now we know the holy ghost can't die but if you want him to grow and take over your life more who wants more overcoming power who wants things that used to toss you about don't toss you about no more well the best way to overcome things is to feed on the word feed on the lord and the holy ghost in your life will grow and expand and then and then he will actually fight the battle in your life right so so but this is a big field of science i think it's quite interesting but um it's not my field but anyway um but your gut health is associated with mental health and that's what the devil the devil always try and cut brother and says you try and cut your prayer life and if he's cut your prayer life he says he's got you right so it's very he said he was asked a question how do you become a better stronger christian read your bible and pray every day who makes time for that good thing good for you you know but but that's how we should be because you know if you look at the olympics that's on at the moment they don't casually just eat whatever's in the fridge right they have a goal they want to win a medal they want to actually they want to get the gold they just don't want to turn up they want to win so down to every meal they eat and when they eat it and how much and so on that's that that's actually measured and everything for them it's not just a casual i feel like mcdonald's today i'll go have mcdonald's or i feel like pizza hut or i don't feel like my broccoli so i'm not going to eat that no no they eat what they're given because they know it does them good because they know they're actually built to win a gold right and and if we actually have it if we've met if we have met the lord on the on on the sacred sands we know the lord has made us to overcome right so he knows so so the lord has made us actually stand on the podium right in that in that first place so if he's made us that if that's our goal then really we should think you know our life actually every day has a purpose okay we're not just filling in time here hey you guys aren't i trust you don't feel that way sometimes we feel that way but in reality every day is important every day we should be working what towards the goal of what we want to be more like the lord so he says i believe christian i mean i believe friends that no man has right to profess christianity as a christian until he's found such a retreat they they may come a time when men who are worldly trained not godly scent might be able to explain all the supernatural away from the bible and they've done that they might be able to satisfy the carnal mind but that that doesn't know god that the days of miracles are past there's no such a thing as the holy ghost but if a man ever has had an experience where you met god all the theologians in the world could never take that experience away from you you meet god face to face and you know what you're talking about i mean like moses said that sacred stands in the backside of the desert when a man ever meets god upon them sacred sands of that secret place the retreat no devil in hell can ever take him take that away from him for he knows he's talked face to face with god they can explain anything they want to but you were there when it happened and you know what you speak of amen amen this is yeah i mean i mean this should be i trust don't look at your failures your or your successes moses had failures right but look at have you met the lord have you met the lord on the backside of the desert really have you really been in his presence he's talked to you you've talked back to him and he's changed your life hallelujah this is i mean this is how we should be you know we go from hearing about the lord then you meet him what he says in your what he says in his word he'll do he does for us you know that's why i read that scripture this morning in romans 5 where it says the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us i was standing the lord was dealing with me i was in a spot where i mean i'll probably share this too many times but i did everything the world could give me i did it movies music girls drinking drugs sometimes everything i was a typical uni student i was lost in the world but then i heard this message and the lord began to deal with me even i always believed that jesus was god but i realized i had never met him before and i began to listen to messages like because i didn't have a church to go to there were churches in christchurch but i had no idea any of them but you know i just found on the internet the message so i just picked sermon tiles begin to listen and some were like the seal of god and why so many fail to keep the victory and hidden life of christ i listen to these ones and the lord spoke to me and i realized i did not know him that's a good place to be because if you know you're lost you can be found right so it's a very good place to be if you know if you need help you know there's one that can help you right but if you but if you think you're fine but you're not fine that's a bad place to be so anyway so i began to listen and i was so convicted i was just in my room i was flatting with friends that had no idea i had any kind of christian kind of inkling at all and i'd sit with headphones in my room scared they'd come in and bust me listening to these sermons and you know but i was so convicted i'd just be crying and but the thing is i didn't know what to do i knew i actually at before then i was baptized correctly but that was just uh you know but i never went to church never had any kind of you know well any any real church anyway but you know but then the lord i just said to the lord i said lord take everything from my life that's contrary to your word that you can come and dwell in me and he then he took the drinking he took the music he took all these things from me he took the desire out of me so it wasn't me having to clean my life up and that's the thing sometimes we think we have to do something we just have to surrender and he does the work and then i was actually and this is why it's so important you gotta think about what do you think about during the day because if you think ab you know the reality of it is if you begin to meditate upon the lord and his goodness he begins to draw near he begins to draw near and you can be in your house you can be driving you can be at work can be anywhere and the spirit of god can come just so real right down it feels like you're just gonna jump out of your skin and i was i was washing dishes i was i was working in a student hostel kitchen part-time when i was at uni i was just thinking about the lord and i was actually the chef was a temp chef there and we were talking about how bad the world was getting i don't know why we were on that conversation but um but then i began to think about the lord and and then the lord's love filled my heart and it wasn't a painful thing was like a presence just filled my heart and it was so awesome and and and but i realized at the moment how much i love him because how much he loved me because he dived me on calvary before that people say god loves you and god is love and what does that mean oh no yeah i thought what does that mean but then when when that experience happened it changed my whole life changed my whole life and there were other you know and then the bible became a personal book you know i was reading first or second peter which i already read and it was peter was writing to me in 2007 and it's still that same kind of a book you know different things happened but but there was but i believe i met the lord on the sacred sands right and no one can take that from me because i was there when it happened and actually changed my life so this is why this is very dear to me because i i was i had no church i i had the bible that i was reading when i was sober and i had the message that i was listening to sometimes and the lord through those two things found me and i was lost man i was so lost and so to me now if if if the lord can meet me i think he can meet anyone you know you can you can step onto those sacred sands as well and you can ha and if you have i trust you rejoicing you know but if you haven't i just really want to encourage you he's here to meet you know he's a living god he's not he's not an idea or theory and no no devil in hell no one with their reasoning or their arguments can ever take it from you and when the devil comes along and his argument seems so right there's something in he says no it's so wrong and he protects you from those things so what's the time so i'm gonna that's actually all i want to talk to you about this afternoon but i pray that if you don't have a hunger and thirst to meet him i i just had a hunger because i knew i didn't know him but i knew he could be met and i didn't i still don't know how to pray but i just you just mean it from your heart lord i want to meet you i want to know because i wanted to know my sins i believed my sins were forgiven but i wanted to know they are forgiven you know because he gives a stability in your life you know he doesn't like to leave questions hanging over you because the devil uses questions against you he might tries to make you second guess your salvation but the lord doesn't allow those things to hang there if you seek the lord say lord i want to know you know and in his time he keeps seeking remember it's him that him that knocketh him that knocketh it shall be opened him that seeketh will find so i just i i wanted to know and i was simple enough i think i still am that if if god says you can meet him then you can meet him right and if he changes people's lives he changes people's lives and i believed it was for me and i was a rotten i was a rotten sinner i was a rotten sinner but the lord doesn't look at where we are he looks at our desire that's and he put that desire in us and and that's what he looks at that's all he cares about he doesn't hold your past against you what you're going through your battles your failures whatever he doesn't hold those things against you all he looks is what is their desire and he puts that desire on us and he want and he says all that come to me i know why is cast out i know i love that because i came to him and he didn't cast me out hallelujah and sometimes i think man why'd you bother lord but he doesn't change his mind amen that's the reason today they don't have the experience what's the reason they can't say they're all saying who is this what is this where does this come from they don't have the answer why because all they know is a theology that some church has made not to know theology is life no to know not to know the bible is life but to know him is life to know him as your personal savior as the one who has filled you with his presence you were there when it happened there's nobody can take it away from you there's no one can explain it away for you when that experience happens to you you know who he is to me he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i mean so to know him is life and that's why we actually gather to know him right that's why we gather that people would meet him and just walk in joy and peace for the rest of their days so i'm gonna leave it there but honestly how's your spiritual gut health i trust it's healthy i trust your emotions are balanced spiritually that you're not living on spiritual junk food because even everything we we we watch and do and see it has a spirit with it right i can this can open up a portal to hell or it can open up a portal to glory on this device and what comes out of here will it will affect me here and it'll affect how i think in here right so and honestly people you know some people think there's no fun in being a christian to me this is the most fun i ever had in my life i had a lot of fun too in the world i wasn't some you know but this is way more fun to know him and once you meet him i like the only regret i ever had is i didn't meet him earlier that's my only regret but when you meet him he's just a satisfying portion so i encourage you listen to the message read your bible and pray every day that's the secret because that's your source of strength right amen i'm going to leave it there but how is your spiritual gut health you say well it's pretty bad well there we have a spiritual probiotic called a gospel right that will restore all the balance of everything healthy okay it's worth it though friends you meet him on those sacred sands it doesn't matter what happens in life you can always go back to that moment hallelujah it gives you strength amen let's um i'll turn that off let's stand shall we this afternoon but he's here to be met seek him with all your faith whatever you do i mean i want to pray and then we'll sing a couple of songs but i really want to ask the question is anyone here who hasn't met him you want to meet him today you want to have a hunger in your heart to walk with him if you want to raise your hand say lord i want more of you amen god bless you with your hands raised let's pray gracious heavenly father lord i'm so thankful that when you meet someone lord they they know that they've come in contact with the supernatural almighty god and you always point us back into your scripture lord jesus you're the god of your word and i just want to pray father lord i know that the same one that came down on the day of pentecost you are the same god today lord you haven't changed lord you met your children in that upper room and no pressure from the sadducees pharisees herodians from the greeks scholars the stoics or whatever the different philosophies of the day none of them could explain that away because they meet you on those sacred sands and lord that experience of meeting you lord it held them lord that experience you had with the apostle paul held him oh god no matter what trouble he went through what strife he had to endure he said i've known whom i have believed and am persuaded he's able to keep that which i've committed to him against that day and we know that that he committed to him was his own soul he was persuaded oh god because he had that meeting with you and lord jesus i know you're the same god right now this afternoon lord you don't change my god i want to thank you for that lord i just pray father lord this the lord lord it's very dear uh experience to my heart lord but you found me lord you lord you took me onto those sacred sands that day and you've just got sweeter and richer as the days have gone by from that
