word that would Minister to us encourage us and draw us closer to you we just pray declare yourself in our midst and bless us we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated well it's good to be here and it's good to fellowship and as the scripture says forsake not the assembling of yourselves as you see the day approaching you know we are living in in a very very interesting time and we need to encourage one another I'm one of them I press on what about you yeah come on you know we have to sometimes drag people along but we need to encourage one another amen and you know you can share testimonies to the glory of God they are uplifting you can also tell stories which drag people down did you hear about this one and that have you know all the failures but let's talk about the positive things that's right let's never uh leave uh lose sight of where we're going I like to read you a scripture in Hebrews 12 I've got a few scriptures here but Hebrews 12 uh verses 1 and two it says here wherefore seeing we have also we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before usall looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and sit down at the right hand of the Throne of God the race that race that is set before us we all have a race to run we all in that race and we all have started the race because Jesus is the author and finisher of our faith he takes us all the way through and we need to keep our eyes on him to finish that race and we want to run the race to win you know we want all want to be winners you know we want to arrive together at the Finish Line you know he's the author and finisher of our faith we will go with him all the way and that's what I tried to highlight tonight we go with Jesus Christ all the way all the way amen not just part of the way all the way we making part of all of our Lives not just part of our Lives amen and you know find so many times people making part I never forget this situation years ago somebody took me along he said oh we go and see this Christian lady I have to go and drop something off and and then we went there and I saw this woman and I nearly fell over didn't look Christian at all I mean I wasn't trying to judge anybody but you know it was a solo mother dressed very sexy painted up flirting with the neighbors and trying to get favors everywhere and he said this Christian lady and then he saw the shock in my eyes and he looks at me he said she accepted him the Lord as Savior but not as Lord well how can you accept the Lord as Savior and not as Lord you know he's all how can I marry a wife just for her cooking or just for her this or the other you know it's all or nothing and I was so puzzled how can you even even uh tell people you can receive them as your savior and as you Lord he is Lord and the Lord will take us to the to the end we go all the way with the Lord Jesus Christ he says I will never leave you nor forsake you so we all have different Journeys and I've I've well I've walked with the Lord over 43 years now and uh I've experienced many many things I just witnessed to somebody yesterday and said look 43 years ago I had a supernatural experience when Christ came into my life everything changed and ever since I've been battling religious Spirits you know that try to disagree with the word of God or or whatever you know it is a journey and we have to battle on and press on to the end all the way we go with the Lord when things go tough some people drop out have you ever heard somebody say are you still a Christian yeah what a stupid question I say come on if you're a CHR Chris you're always a Christian you stay a Christian how can you be anything different see all the way Jesus went all the way he went all the way through life through Temptations through Battles Through um rejection through everything through to Calvary all the way to Calvary he didn't stop in a garden of geiman that's right Lord if there's any other way there was no other way amen and he went all the way to the Cross just imagine him stopping just before calling a Le Legion of a angels and and be it done no he went all the way all the way to Calvary you see John 174 says where Jesus said I have glorified thee on the Earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do we all have a work to do amen we want to be at the end we don't want to say w wow I have undone business no I have all we go all the way with the Lord you know it's actually an exciting life many times in life you get troubled I mean uh we're in this flesh we live in this world we have a an enemy and um we are troubled but we never give up we push on all the way amen many years ago when I was um I was married about two three years and um I went to potic for another year fulltime so the income was very very restricted and I was a bit misled by the people about student allowance and all these things I got $135 a week and the rent was $140 in those days so I had no money I didn't know how to do it or what to do I was so desperate and so worked up and not just I'm just try to say that when you go through a trial you don't always get sympathy from other people they you did a stupid thing or you should have thought about it before or you you know I was there and had criticism from all sorts of places and I was you you would say on my own now the Lord was with me I remember never forget that I was standing in the lounge so desperate so upset and I said to my wife I don't know how it's going to happen I don't know what but I only know he never lets me down we go all the way with Christ and you know he blessed us in a tremendous way way we could never have imagined you know I gave up my part-time job at the library because I got so much money given to us and that year I went to politic I had so much money I had enough to buy a house after wow so that's how the Lord can change things but you see the challenge came if if you give up because of a problem you never experience the blessing of God if you if you stop halfway you never get there we've had a girl come to church once she used to go to church was brought up in church and then um she wanted to get married so she came back to church give it a go again three months four months no husband ah given up and left church again you see that's not the believer that is not the believer but these things do happen we get these challenges and things we all go through but there's two groups I would say we all you can say when you compare with Israel they all came out of Egypt all came out of Egypt but not all entered into the promised land there was Caleb and Joshua from their generation you see they did not go all the way with the promise of God and I think I mean these things are written for us for an example that we learned from it never give up halfway if things go go difficult just Rejoice we should never lose sight of our destination Hallelujah always look we're waiting for the coming of the Lord don't know about you but I wait for the coming of the Lord I wait for the dead in Christ to rise and to see them and be caught up together and meet the Lord in the air Amen brother I want to get there I don't want to be sidetracked by trouble and things of this world and you see there are the two categories really we have followers but then we have real Believers and I believe we the real Believers the two categories are found throughout the Bible you know that right to the end time he had Israel is like the church the followers Caleb and Joshua is like the Believers knowledge sight feelings and circumstances versus faith in the promise of God now when we have the promise of God it's yeah and amen to doubt it makes God a liar you know we don't want to doubt what he says we just want to hang on have you ever been in a situation where say you were sick or something and and in agony and pain and and you pray and you're still in pain and said Lord what's wrong what's wrong with my faith I've had that you know six years ago when what had a back injury I was in such Agony with back pains no painkiller no nothing helped nothing helped I was going up the wall Lord what's wrong with my faith I put prayer cloths on me and I even had a rock from Brother bram's grave would you believe I laid everything on me possible you know trying to get Faith and said Lord what's wrong with my faith you know and uh I want to be healed it's a natural thing I was in such Agony and I know the Lord is my healer so I did not lose sight of that despite the pain you know uh I couldn't go get to a doctor but I went to a Physio and obviously they didn't know what was wrong with my back oh they squeezed it and squashed it and did it all sorts of things and guess what after the treatment I was paralyzed in my leg I was a they were in shock and organized a specialist for me straight away I was limping around and dragging my leg behind being being paralyzed and and then I hadit this doctor's appointment and I prayed I said Lord if you want me to go through the doctor speak through the doctor you know I didn't see instant healing but I said use the doctor speak to me through the doctor I'm just talking about old away I went to the doctor and he sent me for an MRI scan had another meeting with the doctor and he said Mr rug I've never seen the back as bad as yours well that's not the voice of God that's not what I expected you know speak through the doctor but I didn't hear Christ speaking through the doctor honestly I didn't I was hanging in there and and then uh asked about being paralyzed he said look uh you have a small small chance to come right but no guarantee uh with an operation usually after 3 months it's permanent if you've been paralyzed anyway that didn't sound like God speaking through the doctor either right but I was hanging in there eventually had had at the day of the operation I went there you know had to fast and do the things and then put on a nighty you know and then they wield me in to the operating theater here comes the anist pulls down the mask and tells me what he's going to do and I might have a sore throat after and all that and then comes the doctor pets me on the shoulder and says how you feeling you know before they put you out you know and I said oh a lot better and he he said oh touch my knee said do you have feelings there and I thought yeah maybe you know I said yeah he said can you walk to get off the bed walking up and down there like this I walked you know and then a very unusual atmosphere in that room doctor didn't talk the other guy waited he turned his head and here comes what I was waiting for speak through the doctor at the operating theater last moment doctor said if I were you I would cancel this operation Wow have you ever heard of such a thing after going through all these things in you there in the operating theater wow I said I cancel and I knew that it was God's speaking to me but guess what I had to hang on there to the end all the way all the way it didn't just happen when I first prayed I I've seen or experienced times when it instantly happened but you know I had to wait and have faith all the way I went out and the nurses said oh what are you doing what have you been doing I said praying and then rang my wife she burst into tears you know and I went home happy as being healed I wasn't you know I was still paralyzed three days later I woke up completely healed a week after that I played a tennis tournament amen praise the Lord all the way all the way Hallelujah and we want to go all the way with Christ you know no give up when we when we go through something when things not going well we hang in there we go all the way and we will see the glory of God yes sir so i' like to encourage you no matter what circumstances you're in or whatever go all the way press on Praise on you see don't go by knowledge or sight or feelings or circumstances go by faith in the promise of God Amen you know the followers of Moses they all came out of Egypt they all came out of Egypt they struggled with various situations and things on the way but they failed to enter the promised land because they did not go all the way with the word the word that came the promise was out of Egypt and into the promised land you see that was the word they did not go all the way you know sometimes you read scriptures and you you nail it down but you fail to read the one next to it I had this experience just a while ago I was doing Outreach in church there outside the church I had a table out and next thing a woman came and she's she talked about things I said yeah the churching is in the back oh can I have a look opened the door and she saw the church saw the pulpit in her back she said wow didn't know there was a church here she said if I would come to a church and see a woman in the Pulpit I turn straight right around and walk out that's what she said but you know she had completely shaved ha she didn't read the next scripture you know it's just a r woman shouldn't be uh having authority to preach yeah but but she didn't read woman should have long hair you know they don't go all the way it's all of the word we don't want to get a a a a pet little scripture and ignore the rest we want to go all the way take all counsel of God anyway Israel versus Joshua and Caleb one looks to the so-call fs the other looks to the promise you know one so one look at the So-Cal facts they're Giants in the land they're bigger than we are and and all these things they fail to see the facts yes it's a land which flows with milk and honey and all these things they look at the problem rather than the promise and but Caleb and Joshua they said we can take it the Lord promised it amen and you see that's the brink people come to quite often come to the brink and instead of entering in pressing in into receiving the Holy Ghost that's really what it is into the rest they just stopped there yeah we believe we came out we done all these things we seen the glory of God we seen the r sea opening we seen Miracles we felt his presence but they failed to enter yeah because they don't go all the way you know the promise is right into the baptism of Holy Ghost the promise is right to the coming of the Lord we're not giving up halfway amen so let's press on until we have and are filled with that peace that passes all understanding that's what the Bible says you know when people are nervous or worried or lose the peace that's not what we should have you see the Devil comes to Rob and steal destroy to kill but Jesus came to give us life and life more abundantly so what do we accept his promise or the negative side we always need to make this choice now I go all the way with the word of the Lord all the way so if the peace of God that pass our understanding is not here I said Lord what's wrong I want that peace you know and I don't want to carry on with that their peace they pass all understanding and I also want to have perfect love you know the the quote nothing will enter except perfect love so that's what we want 1 John 4:18 says there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear has torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love so what what do we want we want old the way to get that love that perfect love so fear goes away we we don't want to entertain fear it's not humility to be fearful it's it's actually unbelief there's another scripture Colossians 3:15 and let the peace of God rule in your hearts yeah to which you're also called in one body and be thankful let it rule in your heart amen go all the way with him now in the scripture you you see many example many examples I just want to give you one or two from people who have um been challenged on the way and had to decide to go all the way you look at jono in the Bible he when when he was we know the story when he was thrown over board and all these things and swallowed by a big fish or a wh he said johnah 2:7 and 8 said when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee in thine Holy Temple they that observe vanities forsake their own Mercy that's quite something isn't it and I give you a quote in that Jonah said there are lying vanities he said once more will I look to your Holy Temple told God because when Solomon dedicated that Temple he said If thy people be in trouble anywhere and look to this holy place and pray then you'll hear from him heaven and he believed Jonah believed that God heard Solomon's Prayer yeah and he started saying I'll not look at this whales belly I'll not think about my backsliding condition I'm looking toward your Holy Temple and make confession isn't that wonderful you know we can't find ourselves in a miserable State sometimes or have failed some people and if you look at that you get worse and worse and you feel condemned and you feel worse and worse but we're not looking to that we look to Christ look to Christ I just mentioned to Brother Andy before you know looking to Christ is like Bible says come with boldness before the throne of grace with boldness and how do you come with boldness if you've been a good boy for the whole week been in church three times witnessed to the neighbor done a good deed to an old lady given some money to a poor bigger and you come before the throne of grace like the Pharisee Lord I pay my TI and I I do all these things and I'm not like them no that's not the way you can't come like that yeah if you had the miserable week you lost the plot somewhere you done something wrong and then you feel condemned you had wrong thoughts and you feel condemned I can't really come before the Lord I'm I'm not good enough you come with boldness he spite because you come on the basis of the blood of Jesus Christ nothing else Hallelujah nothing else you come upon the basis of the blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't matter how how good you are how bad you are that's not the basis you come to godj through Christ and remember that next time when the devil tried to stop you from going all the way hey I come with boldness because the blood of Jesus Christ cleansed me from all sin all sin he carried all of my sins past present future I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God you know you go that way claim the blood claim what God accepted the Holy Temple the prayer of Solomon God accepted that and he had to just be reminded of that I turn toward that Holy Temple looking to God of course and he was delivered you know it's there's another one you know Paul the Apostle Paul he got Shipwrecked we know that I I I read that story from acts 22 acts 27 from Verse 18 to 20 and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lightened the ship and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship and when neither Sun nor stars in many days appeared must have been horrible and no small temples lie on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away all hope was taken away you know most of these people on the ship would have thought that's it we're dying no hope but not so with Paul why did Paul have hope or not fear have you ever thought about that one why did he not fear oh he was a Believer no he had the word the promise of God Amen acts 2311 says and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as thou has testified of me in Jerusalem M so must thou bear witness also at Rome that was before he went on the boat he had the word God said I'll have you as a witness in Rome so no devil in hell could stop him amen nothing could stop it but he had to hang on to what God actually told him go all the way oh temp doesn't matter storm shipwreck doesn't matter all the way I'll go going to be a witness in Rome that's thus sayith the Lord that's what it what it was you see that gave him confidence even in the greatest storm to be rejoicing and to have not just hope but have faith I'll be there I will be there no matter what and no storm is too big for for us in that sense he said I will never leave you no forsake you amen he he takes us all the way there amen see the situation was H hopeless and it looked like certain death and everybody lost hope except Paul because he had that word that promise that he will be a witness in Rome there's one more I like to share the story of David and Goliath I don't go through the whole lot we know the story but I want to make a point first Samuel was 17 verse 32 says and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine so David believed the promises of God he believed in the victory he believed in the power of God Amen and if you do that you sometimes are on your own he the whole crowd was in fear and Saul himself said to David thou are not able to go against the philistin you know no can't be done to fight with him for thou are but a youth and he a man of war from his youth oh God what a discouragement you know when you want to go all the way you come across all this discouragement and unbelief and nonsense you know I came to New Zealand in 1975 I decided in 1974 I want to travel the world and I was telling my mates and friends I'm going over the other side of the world going to go to New Zealand oh you can't do that everybody said you can't do that you can't speak English you haven't got a job over there you can't leave your apartment here and you can't leave that good job you've got you can't do that everybody said you can't and I thought no I can't I go all the way I came all the way here and I tell what wasn't easy all the time but all the way all the way discouragements come people try to drag it out even well-meaning people friends and sometimes here the the king of Israel so you know H now you can't do it and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep he gives a testimony I've experienced God before and there came a lion and the bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smot him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by by his beard and smote him and slew him can imagine fighting with a lion on the beard thy servants slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them amen seeing he has defied the armies of the Living God we are the Church of the Living God so um amen that David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the poor of the lion and out of the poor of the beer he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go the Lord be with thee and Saul armed David with his armor he put on a helmet of brass and his on his head and also armed him with a coat of M and David GED his sword upon his armor and aside to go for he had not proofed it and David said un soul I cannot go with these for I have not proved them you know there's quite a quite a lesson in that you know those things the normal army use that but if we are walking by faith not the Living God we don't need to understand everything that's happening if the Lord's with us who can be against us you see that is what it comes to and David put it off him and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had even in his even in his grip and his sling was in his hand and Drew near to the Philistine and the Philistine came on and Drew near uh unto David and the man that bear The Shield went before him and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him for he was but a youth and Rudy and of fear countenance and the Philistines said unto David am I a dog that thou comest to me with stars and the Philistine cursed David by his gods by his Gods the gods of the Philistine isn't that incredible by his Gods it same was Jezebel and her Gods you know came against Elijah by his Gods I just read in a paper this morning in in Turkey I think it was one of the members of parliament was swearing about Israel and so my God Allah will judge them and the very moment he said it he dropped the heart attack that's in the newspaper by the way he's God he's God it's not the god the Almighty we serve and the Philistines said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field then said David to the Philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts praise God the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied you see Israel looked at the facts so cold but David looked to the Lord and the promises and the power of God see and he wanted to go all the way it didn't want to stop because of a giant have you ever faced Giants in your life they come in various forms and ways trouble but we don't stop there we go all the way we fight those things he can say who are we tonight followers or Believers Israel or David as I said we all Fai Giants problems in life we all have different ones we all face these things do we run do we compromise or do we believe now I tell you something interesting David chose him five smooth Stones okay can I I brought you five smooth Stones just to make a point I like you to to just see how smooth they are just see how wonderfully smooth the stones are not a sharp edge on them not the chip on them smooth you know how they got smooth tumbled in the water years and years being thrown around having the sharp ages taken off and sometimes we feel a bit like that don't we amen but when we are smooth the rough ages have been taken off we are fit to slay Giants amen that's the point we are fit to slay Giants amen and when we go through the tumbler don't think it's something bad it's something good because you're going to slay a giant you see that's that's the point I'm trying to make but you don't get smooth just by quoting scriptures you don't get smooth by that you get smoothed by overcoming the problems you're facing overcoming the situations you're in that builds character in you and you get smooth and then you're fit for the sling to kill the Giants amen amen amen you see in order to get smooth you have to get through the tumbler of life's challenges and overcome them go all the way don't give up when when things go hard you know sometimes people go through uh difficult times when they're married two different people have to become one can be quite quite hard you know for some and uh it's it's like um how can I put it two become one you don't have to be the same you don't have to have the same Hobbies you don't have to say you know my wife doesn't like motorbikes she doesn't like boats she doesn't like the things I may like and I don't like sewing and I don't like homework and I don't like doing dishes you know I'm just saying we are very very different but we are not one because we have the same Hobbies some I see people you know was traveling through New Zealand husband and wife push biking you know that's the last thing I would ever want to push by along the road you know both had that Hobby and they both have have little Cal muscles like this and you know it's h they unite on the Hobbies but our Unity is love and you may see things slightly different to to what I see and you know why we see things differently sometimes upbringing whatever Church you go to influence maturity you you learn things I I do things differently than I would have done 20 years ago I once pulled somebody out of a bed and said I don't want an evil spirit in my house you know I mean I wouldn't do that nowadays you know I've calmed down but maturity changes things you see maturity changes things doesn't mean if you're young and I'm older that uh and see things differently or do things differently doesn't mean we can't be United amen we don't need to go the same church we need to have the same Holy Spirit that's it it's same with the love in a marriage if you have love you don't need to see everything alike you love each other and that's that's the unity we want you see so I don't know why I'm saying these things but uh anyway Shar sharp ages will be knocked off and you in the hand of God will be fit to slay any joint any joint we don't come in our own strength that's right we don't come in our own power we come in the power of the Lord the ho Holy Spirit your words and your prayers will be effective did you know that let's send a slingshot of prayer against whatever problem we are facing be a believer know the power of God and trust him against all the odds now I like to finish with a quote because it's it's so important that we go all all the way with these things not take part of it look I want I just want to tell you another incident I know a friend I knew he was in the Army he was a Christian and they used to mock him and they had to sit in one day and the chaplain the army chaplain was preaching bu and they knew him and then he read Romans 3 oh I think I find it Romans I I read it out otherwise I might say it's wrong you know the um the believer he believed that his sins were forgiven that the he was sinless because he was a Believer and the the the Chaplan said Romans 3 uh 23 says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God now what do you say to this he said to that man singled him out who believed that he was you know and then he didn't know what to say for a moment but then he remembered his mother said to him somebody challenges you with a scripture just ask what is the next one saying so he said what's the next scripture saying verse 24 being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus praise God you see that's where we need to go all the way not just take part of the word amen you know all the way with the word and I I read you this uh quote which uh may have heard it before he says if took these precious sheep of God he's talking to the devil these ladies they caused them to B their hair and wear makeup and look like things that the Bible condemns and you thought you had them but I come with a simple little slingshot of prayer and bringing them back tonight you can't hold them any longer you've lost the battle he's talking to the devil straight these precious men standing here Lambs of God turn them loose we adure thee in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I place place them uh Place between this habits and tempers and immorals and whatsoever it may be our place the blood of Jesus Christ by faith between them and that thing again you not catch them anymore they're in the father's pasture they are his children keep from them in the name of Jesus Christ I adure Thee there is not a devil in hell can touch you if you believe that you are covered by the blood blood isn't that wonderful am it's isn't that what it is people get captured sometimes or hindered from going all the way with the Lord you you hear this testimony of Might things happening and and how people experience the power of God and and you you oh wonderful testimony and you can send it around to people to read but you go all the way with God and you experience the same thing thing yeah you have that in your own life you go and trust him all the way I just want to finish just with one more scripture to give you another um what do you call it um hint of what we facing nowadays you see we want to go all the way with our faith until the coming of the Lord but we live in a time which is very very difficult around us here the Bible says in Timothy uh 2 Timothy 3 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come perilous difficult times troubl times for men shall be lovers of their own selves there's all around us selfish people lovers of themselves we don't want to get caught up in that covertness boasts proud you know when to read these things out those are spirits that give that manifestation and if we have these things in our lives anywhere we need to get rid of it comes from the wrong Source we want to go all the way with Christ yes boasts proud Blasphemous disobedient to parents what that's taught at school unthankful Unholy without natural affections it's all around truth Breakers say something not doing it false accusers Inc continent Fierce despises of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness talking about it but denying the power there of from such turn away you see if you hang around with that kind of people it drags you down to that level it drags you down to that level I tell you I finish with a story I do finish with a story you know one of my sons um gone a bit worldly and uh he picked up a girl at a party you know and friendly and all these things uh top it off he got a pregnant and and um one day I ring him up I was driving the car I ring him up on the speaker phone and I said to him you know when you are unequally yolked either she drags you down to her level or you bring her up to your level and I said I haven't seen you in church anymore since you out with this woman guess who's winning little did I know he was on speaker phone too and she was sitting next to him but I tell you another thing blessed is he who is not offended in me she wasn't offended and they got married they have two children now and about 6 months ago she had an experience in the Lord her testimony is the the Lord revealed himself to me she didn't even believe in God the Holy Spirit came and she was baptized and you know how that works all the way all the way with Christ and you know we don't need to to try to uh beautify the word it is pure the way it is if it hurts it hurts so bad yeah blessed is he who is not offended in me and she wasn't offended she's a lovely woman you know and we never pushed her didn't say oh should shouldn't wear those pants and you shouldn't wear this you know she she was wearing shorts and this and a dozen earrings and you know and the while ago she asked my wife she said do you think it's wrong to wear earrings and she said look the Lord will show you you know so she obviously prayed and the morning she went wakes up all infected she took them all out you know the Lord leads you on she goes all the way with the Lord we don't have to push them we have to encourage themen to go all the way but it is he is the way and he leads the way if we say you should do this now and you should do that now we may mess up the program it's God it's a a relationship between you and God God he knows you better than you know yourself he knows what level you're at he knows what you understand and he knows what he can cope with trust him all the way with every problem you have right to the end and look the time we live in the last days we we we know and things can change just in a moment yesterday we had a little hurricane coming through a tornado and some in people were injured and think just suddenly appeared and suddenly things can change suddenly disas suddenly here California went down or suddenly something happens yeah and it's a bit late we want to go all the way with him right now make that commitment said Lord I want to go all the way with you let's just pray Heavenly Father we just want to thank you for the meditation upon your word for seeing those servants who went all the way with you had confidence in your promise in your word and and believed in and went all the way despite the circumstances and tonight we we want to declare we go all the way with you Lord Jesus whichever way you have us to go we know you lead us to that place to be ready at our coming Lord and I just pray for each one of us whatever we battle through that you would raise raise our faith and that we can overcome and become one of like the smooth Stones Lord and I just thank you for being in our midst and for for ministering to us and blessing us I just ask please bless everyone here in
