says it's not going to happen I sing that song since I've heard that song I sing that song every time that Slicker comes to try and make me down I'll sing that song till the day I take the Rapture it's something in that song that just reminds me of who I really am and what God did for me not my ability but his grace his grace amen it is Sunday it is Sunday we miss brother Ben already we see the glowing girls you still repres Sting the glory family um we miss him always as it's our pastor and Brother Andy I miss the amens already the body is so close we miss everyone if they're not here brother full try that's Gathering and sister Belinda you know they're just not here you miss them you feel them so Brother full we still love you we miss you and uh just just keep fighting you're a you're a soldier you're a warrior God has made you usus and in we praying for you each one of us are praying for you in sincerity so uh let us just bow our heads first while the music softly plays and we just first say Lord Jesus what else where can we go but to you that have the words of eternal life amen Lord people have religion people can believe whatever they believe father but when they have experience with you it changes everything Lord this morning we pray that we'll have experience with you Lord this morning we pray Lord that will come on the scene as never before Lord I can see already your hand as I just was driving here we listen to this song I always put it on Lord and when I started preparing this message I had a scripture and when I opened this little book I said to sister bronwin last week I said thank you for that little book you gave me because every time I open a scripture and I know I was going to preach and I start making my notes that scripture is on the same page and it is again the same you don't fail Lord you hide in Simplicity hallu you are so everywhere Lord but we fail to see because we don't look but father today come our way knock on our door speak to us Lord Lord May every believer here and even if they don't believe Lord open their heart for you today Lord so that you can come and Minister unto us today Lord for we are needy people as is a rough time we're living in Lord but a glorious time but if you don't come today Lord there's life and there's death and Lord but if you don't come Lord and we can't apply the blood over our lentil Lord and Lord we can't seal our children Lord and we can't seal our house Lord the death angel will strike tonight Lord he will come Lord but may we have the blood on that lentil Lord May what happens this morning set us on such a way for the rest of the year for the rest of our lives let us not leave here not being changed not getting CL closer to you Lord Jesus that is my heart's desire remove me completely out the way Lord I know you have everything in your hand Lord you speak now and Lord I pray if there's any contrary spirit that is against your word or against your spirit Lord May that leave in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ right now Lord May the blind see May the lame walk oh Lord Jesus come our way this morning more than ever come our way we're a needy people I pray you'll take the rest of the service for your glory and your kingdom in Jesus Christ's name our Lord and savior we pray amen amen thank you musicians I don't always get emotional but today is just very dear to my heart what the Lord has done for me it was a a time I was sitting at a desk I'll give you some background and Satan came and he said to me very clear he said to me you're not going to make it say you're going to fail and this heaviness this very heavy Spirit came into the room and you sat on me heavy you know what I did I started singing that song that brother Isaac just sang and immediately that Spirit left but see we kind of always look at the obvious we always look at the seen But I challenge you today to look at the Unseen I challenge you today to get rid of this thinking here and let it get into hereu cuz remember what brother Bley said at Camp he says if the thinking is here and the thinking is wrong and you let it go into your heart it will manifest but if the thinking here is from God and the Heart Is Telling You there's something that needs to change then that let that come out let that be your control tower so whatever I'm saying or whatever I'm preaching if you don't want to take it just put it on the shelf for a while and say Lord reveal it unto me and he's faithful and true he will do it amen so we're going to go into um Matthew 11 that is our scripture for today I always got these lovely sticky notes I love the sticky notes brother kben says it brings out my eyes um and I thought Brothers I'm sorry I I had to shave because with that mustache nobody could take me serious so I thought you know what I'll just lose that mustache you know so I'm sorry I think one for the team but U yeah I thought the message today is is of a serious nature but it's a it's a beautiful message if you can take it and make it your own you will be blessed today I believe cuz I was blessed last night and this morning I woke up very early and I said Lord just put it together and he supernaturally just put it all together so I know the Lord is dealing can you receive it can you be awake enough and long enough in the service to receive it amen so we give you a little bit of backgr ground but we're just going to read that scripture first and then we're going to go into it Matthew 11 and then we're going to start there at verse 28 but I'm going to give you some background first so just hold that scripture we're going to let you stand just for a we while Book of Matthew there we go 11:28 okay so here's the here's the book okay here's the verse come to me all you are weary and heavy that have heavy burdens and I will give you rest okay here's my scripture say at the time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed him unto babes even so father for it seeth good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any any man the father save the son and he to whosoever the son will reveal him remember as much as we want in a human ability to do something God needs to step on the scene God needs to do the work God needs to reveal and then he says come to me all ye that labor and are heavy ladened and I will give you rest now brother Andy preached upon this Wednesday night and I said to Brother Andy you took my sermon again because God is De and God wants us is's is's paying a picture he's talking to us we should listen god brother Bly said if God repeats himself somebody ain't listening because if a dad has to repeat himself that mean that son is still not listen or that daughter to what he said the first time so that might mean that we need to start falling in line with what God is trying to tell us right here he says take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I meek and lonely heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden lie let's just pray again Lord Jesus we've opened your word and we ask Lord that you would now step forth Lord the word itself the bread Lord may it fall now upon our laps Lord may we start eating that bread of life Lord Jesus and Lord I pray that you will just take everything now Lord into your control for the glory of our name of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and for your kingdom amen you may have your beats now just before this scripture we we've got this character John and John he he was to introduce the Messiah he was the messenger that was going to introduce the Messiah who was the the the face the one that was um crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord that's right okay so we know that we know that's in Malachi 3 but now here John just before this to give some background John is in a he's in a place where he asked Jesus a question and he says in in Matthew 11 and the first vers and it came to pass when Jesus made the end of um commanding his 12 disciples he departed then to teach and to preach in the cities now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two disciples and he said unto him art thou that should come he that should come or do we look for another but I want to I want to bring some context here so remember John introduced the Messiah John baptized the Lord Jesus Christ so if we go there all take your Bibles so but it's a bit of reading John um 129 and and as Jesus is now coming there to be to be baptized he walks to John but John sees him and he says the next day if everybody is there the next day John see of Jesus coming unto him and he say Behold the Lamb of God we take away the sin of the world this is he who I said will come after me a man which I preferred before me for he was before me so John Bears record that Jesus is Jesus yeah but now he's sitting in prison a Believer and he's doubting because he sends a messenger and he says is said him or do we look for another so he somewhere Supernatural things happen and with the disciples and everyone but now all of a sudden he doubts he's sitting in prison the circumstances started dictating the way he believes his circumstances around him in the place where he finds himself is starting now to dictate what he believes yeah I hope you can follow us think about this his place where he's sinting is now influencing his faith all right where are we sitting the most wretched blind miserable age there is we're sitting right in the middle of it but what is happening God is making a way God is making a way so let's go on then we go to Matthew 313 while we're there and this is still John so John is just he's he's real confused that doesn't mean he's not a believer that doesn't mean he's not saved that doesn't mean he doesn't know who Jesus is he's just in the place where he's he's not in the right State and he's been dictated by his circumstance now that little box that brother Bly spoke about and I don't know why the Lord sent me to say this this morning cuz this just came in this morning but here we go so Matthew 3 and: 13 the baptism of the beloved Son it says then cometh Jesus from G Galilee to the Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbid him saying I in need to be baptized of thee and cometh thou to me and Jesus answered to him say suffer it to be so now for this is um for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and then he suffered him so Jesus comes to John and says John don't worry you have to wash the lamb you you have to prepare me yeah so so this all happens and then when we get to Matthew 11 John starts doubting because of his circumstance now see there's a three-part being that we are we Body Spirit Soul who knows that that's right okay so children your body has five senses hands up what are they we'll go one one at a time Liam we've got taste do you know feel feel s sight smell and hearing so these five senses helps us in what realm which one natural natural realm the coral realm this one so when somebody throws you with a ball you dodge it hey when you walk into your Mom's Kitchen you smell the food you're like I'm hungry you you've been hungry since since the morning but when you smell that food you're really hungry okay when your dad goes o you can hear it okay so those things help us they they help us in this realm but it's the only place where they really help us they have nothing to do with God's realm okay they have nothing to they are just made you human you've got that you need that to survive okay now we've got a spirit realm who knows about that there's some senses in there I wonder if we can pick up some senses there there's five senses that we we know which one is one AB Faith no not that one we've got conscience reasoning memory imin imagination and affection so those are the the things that help us get along so that's the one where your dad shouts at you he doesn't strangle you at the same time okay because you look at it and go oh maybe it's the first time they do it the reasoning comes in I shouldn't be so hard affection takes over he remembers all the good things that you do so those things are just to help us gel to get along amen without them we will be in a very bad place okay so this is just the basis I'm not preaching yet this is just me relaxing give me a chance it's it's dating looking at all of you looking at me trust me tough crowd um but there's another part of you it's your soul now AB say again what is in your soul what was that word you used Faith what else is in the soul is the control tower of man love that that's that's all attributes of it but Revelation comes into the soul that's good the holy the Holy Ghost is in your soul the predestinated seed of God is in your soul so that's something you have no control over but you have control over I'll tell you why if God made you a man I'm going to address it while we're here guess what you are you're a man as much as you deny it as much as you think you're a lamp post or a door bell or whatever you want to be God made you a man that's what you are and when he gave you a soul and he put his predestinated seed within you you have it you can deny it as much as you like God put it there God will see it into the end because we forget how big God really is we think that if I have a rough time here on Earth and things don't always go my way all of a sudden I lose my salvation all of a sudden I'm I I'm in in band with the devil and and now I'm a a a renegade and no no the soul belongs to God you're the keeper your body and your senses all is the keeper of that Soul so what you let in is what's going to come out but the soul belongs to him or it belongs to Satan there's only two seeds so you identify with who you want to today we've got three Believers we're going to take a little bit of a subject one was saved by grace unmerited Grace one wanted a way out and one wanted a way in and they're all sitting right in our church today brother Bean can't say it but I can and they're all believers they all believe in God the devil's believe in God they fear and tremble they all believe in God but one wants a way out one wants a way in and one just found Grace he didn't even know what he wanted but he found Grace so let's jump into it before we get in there goes Psalm 91 so we just get a little bit of a a a softer a softer feel to this amen help me Lord so there's this secret place that the Lord has for us my my title for the sermon today is place of rest there's a secret place where you can hide so make this just you there's a secret place where thoughts can leave you there's a secret place where Clarity can come back into your mind there's a secret place where you can commune with God so as same disclaimer Brother Andy said if I look at you I don't mean you I just look at you because you're in front of me and I can't preach that way it will look bit wrong so if I look at you just a point of reference don't take anything like that you speak to God but see there's a secret place and the secret place there is for you and God your mind can't go there I want to explain to you your mind don't go there your thoughts don't go there nothing goes but the presence of you and God because sometimes you will experience the presence of God not even feeling nothing you'll be sitting in your room and you'll just be thinking nothing and the Lord comes down and if he's never done it for you he will because God is always around you you just looking with the wrong eyes okay so your your head knowledge makes you stubborn your head knowledge puts you away from God your head knowledge is where the battle is and so many the theologians and so many um um pastors and all those things get it so mixed up because they try to understand God here but the control tower is here and the secret place is in Christ so here's the end of the sermon so more quickly there's only one place you need to be in Christ that's Amen in the message uh-uh message introduces you to Christ where should you be in Christ if you don't find yourself in Christ then I pray today that you would ask the Lord to bring you into Christ to baptize you with his holy spirit so that you may receive it and that you might get rest for your soul because that rest is something when all the waves are shaking it ain't moving you Psalm 91 he says he that dwelleth in the sacred Place secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty amen and he said of and he say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the nois and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou thrust he truth shall be thy shield and thy buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night or for the arrow that Firth by day fear is a liar nor the pestilence that walketh in the darkness nor the destruction that wasteth at noon day a thousand will fall by thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee so God very boldly says you you don't need to worry I got this you you ladyo and dwellers that that that walk in this age is so wretched don't worry you're supposed to be different I I got you I've made a promise here I could keep David I can keep you you know it doesn't matter and and then this is going to go into what I'm going to do now but let's go on he says Only With Thine Eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou H has made the Lord which is thy Refuge even the most high thy habitation there was a conscious decision made by your soul on your behalf that is going to start talking to you is called this thing called conscience and every time when you get something wrong or you starting to do something that is not in the will of God it says why you know you know you know I had a dog okay his name was Macky we called him AA cuz he was man he could operate I'm going to read the last leave that up the moment my dad walked into the gate he knew the dog did something wrong cuz the dog's ears will be flat and his tail will be between his legs and he'll be like oh dear oh dear I hope he doesn't see me so my dad don't know what he's done but he knows he's done something now dad's I don't know if you but have you ever walked into your house and you see your son's face and you're like what have you done it's like what I didn't do anything the fact that you react like that is what have you done it will come out the truth will always come out but you're like I know you he knows you and that's why he gave you that that beautiful predestinated seed within you as as small as it can be that little voice goes oi don't do this and the battle is on because now for the next 5 seconds before you either be awesome or you be in trouble that is your choice but it's your choice you have to make it but he says make me your habitation and he says and there shall no evil before thee neither shall a play come nigh thy dwelling so if you can put your whole heart in Jesus Christ if you can make your day start with the Lord Jesus Christ if you start it off right on a good step the rest of your day no EV evil shall be thee and didn't say it will come and tempt you it says it won't be thee it won't overtake you because Isaac saying it today as well we're Overcomers so evil will come but evil will leave fear will come but fear will leave but the thing is he give you enough to get against that but you have to start your day in his habitation within the Holy Spirit seen seen young people start their day with Twitter and WhatsApp and and every status update they can do why why why not start it with reading your Bible I didn't say read the whole Bible I said just start by reading scripture and then start thinking about that it's Sunday I feel I can preach really long today amen I I do feel I do feel like if you can start your day with God okay how can you fail amen if you go in the morning I wake up and then I roll out a bed like this cuz you know when you and I put my feet down on the ground and I sit on my bed and I raise my hands like this and I go I said bless the Lord oh my soul glory to to you unto you Lord Jesus Lord I love you it's all I say I love you so much then I wake up and I walk and I going to do my Bible study brush my teeth do all those things but my very first thought that when I wake up is Lord I am not worthy but you made me worthy my very first thought is Lord today I love you for my children yes my Lord see if we create that atmosphere around us how can we fail when you walk in this world because your foundation already is on the Rock but you wake up and you wonder I wonder what post I missed and I wonder what this sister is saying and O does somebody like my Instagram and you're already on the wrong foot you will not survive the day you can't because you started it wrong sorry is what it is so let's jump into it go to Mark chapter 10 now we go into our three subjects awesome testimonies in this word remember this is not stories I'll always say this this is for Real Life testimonies this is people like you and me that had a promise and God just fulfilled the promise in them the reason you think it's a story is because you think you're living in a fairy tale and you know what God will shake heavens and earth but he will get you out of your fairy tale because we re live in a real world with a real enemy and a real God Amen don't ever think the story this is a story this is a testimony your name is written in this word and every testimony David's life the three Believers Cedric M and abedo Daniel all the prophets of all somewhere in your in your walk with the Lord you will identify with one of those events because that's why God says nothing on this Earth is new nothing nothing Under the Sun is new nothing is a surprise to God okay amen amen so we go there to Mark 10 I love the Lord amen okay here we go let's go to Mark 10 this this guy he he haded um and we go there to verse 17 amen this is the man I decided to start with the one that wa wanted a way out okay let's read Because I'll preach around the reading and when Jesus gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I'll inherit eternal life so I want you to see he kneeled okay he worshiped the Lord you don't bow your your your knee to someone just because remember brother brandom said he says I only bow to one man to God so this this believer comes to the Lord Jesus and very sincerely he kneels and he says good Master good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life very sincere good question okay and Jesus said to him why callest thou me good there is none good but that is God he says Thou knowest the Commandments do them not uh don't do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not be false witness defraud not honor thy father and thy mother amen thank you I was just waiting for honor thy father and thy mother cuz it's got a promise attach to it and he answered and said to him master I have observed all these from my youth I'm in the message hey come on yeah come on bring it home I'm in the message I know the Seven Seals I know they were all revealed to me I know what Revelation is I know the mystery of Christ reveal I know where I'm standing in the lady of cnh I know I know I know I'm happy I come to church my mom drags me here and my dad drags me but I'm here I'm a Believer the moment the song first song sing I start falling asleep the moment the preaching starts going I try to think about everything else but that I'm I'm a Believer I don't steal ish I don't lie sometimes come on this is a Believer he goes to Jesus and he says to him I've not done any of this and Jesus testifies he says yep that's that's right you haven't done any of this we read on he says then says Jesus beholding him he loved him and he said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatever thou Hast give it to the poor then thou shall have treasure in heaven and come to me take up your cross and follow me but there's one thing I want you to do just let that go cuz you still want to do it in your own ability yes so see this guy wanted way out because if he couldn't keep the law in his own ability if he couldn't make it into Heaven by his own ability the way so this is this is what people do denominational Christians and I and I'll say it in a in a nicest way they cut God to fit their life they don't they don't get cut to fit God's life they want God as a Leisure they want God when they need him they want God when they sick they want God when other people are sick they want to name use the name of Jesus they want to use it all over the show but they don't want to take his name in baptism they want to speak the name of Jesus they want to use the name of Jesus they want to profess the name of Jesus but I still want to wear what I want to wear I still want to cut what I want to cut because the thing is the motive in their heart is I don't want to be like him I want him to fit me but that's wrong yes Lord that is that is absolutely wrong and I say it with everything in me it is abomination in the sight of God because God has mercy and he has great but he comes this guy's way and he sees to that re Young Ruler I know where your heart is your heart is not keeping my law your heart is not having a relationship with me your heart is having me fit your lifestyle so why don't you get rid of your lifestyle and follow me why don't you give up what you want and fit my profile and see how old will bless you and what does he do go on next verse say say and he was sad in that saying and he went away grieved for he had many possessions so we were still looking at his way not God what can I do for you and I will surrender everything to be in your presence God you fit my way he's a believer I know it's strong brother Ben maybe can't say these things because he's a pastor and he loves all of you very very much but brother brandham said the ministers Don't Preach these things anymore and the people are falling away because they're being lied to God don't fit your lifestyle he didn't call you to be a lady oia and walk lady oia with you he called you to get out of the place you stay in your tradition you will stay here you will not go in a Rapture that is the honest truth let no man lie to you amen hallelujah God is looking for a bride he's looking for someone that can surrender everything it's hard but once you've done it you're in that secret place once you've done it he lifts you up into a place where even if all these questions and things and murmurings happen you just go because it's anchored within you there is more than just rules and regulations the Lord if you're still looking in rules and regulations you're still in the body State you're still in the carnal mind it says to be spiritually minded is life to be Carly minded is death so if you realing in the carnal mind and you're fighting a carnal battle you're going to stay on a carnal Earth amen but Jesus loved him Jesus looked at him and he saw his heart was really a good heart but he knew there was something he could not let go but he's coming your way he says can you let that go today or are you looking for a way out Hallelujah okay let's go to the next one Mark 5 stay in The Book of Mark we don't fit God our way I Tred to I try to make God fit my way I try to make God make sense don't make sense God don't make sense to the carnal mind he's so Supernatural that he will he'll Bowl you over every time Hallelujah because he doesn't deal with a carinal mind he deals with a soul the soul belongs to him the soul is where he ministers to the carnal mind is the battle place that's fine the soul is where he comes to and he's put something in all of you you're Believers that's why you're here no matter what the devil say it's like all brother and M's just fighting with me now just take it back to God and say Lord is that me is that me and if it's me take it out amen take it out I don't want nothing to do with it Hallelujah I don't care if they see rules let me see you amen because when I was and here's my testimony when I was in the world and I had one question to ask God one question one why should I wear long pants one I had I had everything I can cut my hair I don't mind I can I'm a man I can do I can but why I grew up in these things I was happy I grew up in a country which is hot I grew up in a country when who has been in South Africa raise your hand you guys get 23° and you start sweating we're like 40° no wind blowing sun beaming down now I come into this country it's called I'm playing Cricket with a jersey on people look at me like you're crazy it's a warm sunny day the wind's not even blowing I go to bed with a full Blazer on and they're like what are you doing I'm like I'm getting cold but my reasoning was I want God to fit my pattern because I grew up this way that's my culture that's how we always done it I'm I still believe you God I can still see you work I can still see you do but God says no I want you to to change that for me are you willing so I don't go to brother Ben straight away stomp on his door open up say brother Ben you better tell me why I shouldn't wear shorts and if you can't convince me I won't do it cuz my pastor in South Africa said that's wrong this guy Noah I stopped right there the word struck me it says how much of your nakedness do you want to reveal that's what the word says when they built the steps of Ascension they said they build it in such a way that when the priest walked up there they couldn't see their nakedness their undergarments wow so I said Lord that's a good scripture I said but can you reveal that to me because as much as it's written in this word if you don't reveal it to me I cannot change it because it's still then just me and it's not you that was my prayer and I went one day with brother Edan and we were on the beach and because was a make believer back then I uh and I'll say it was honest opinion cuz I was reserved I still held back I didn't sell out so I had my shorts on and then I had my tracksuit over it so we're going to go swim so Here Comes The Showdown we get to the beach I park my youth there and Ed Parks his and he jumps out and he says we're swimming and I'm like we're swimming but now God's going to say what are you going to do with it this so I said cool first one in let's go I strip off my clothes and I feel completely naked I still have my shorts on but I feel naked like nothing so I ran into the ocean as fast as I can because what all of a sudden God revealed something to me he didn't reveal how I saw myself he revealed to me how he saw me so I run into the ocean and now I'm swimming in the ocean I get like this deep because I don't to reveal anything to no one now my conscience is starting to talk to me now my conscience is saying remember you asked him that question now inside the heart the control tower takes over now now he's starting to deal with me but now I don't refuse him I sit in that water I pray Ed is swimming he's like a polar bear he's just going water's ice cold I'm just sitting in there and I'm sweating as much as I am in that water because now the battle became in aran's foreground and I said Lord please reveal this to me and I looked around me and the water was murky and I felt unsafe real unsafe and as clear as clear as they said if you keep my Commandments I will take care of you where are you I'm thinking I'm out of my depth here cuz there's sharks in here and these things and I don't feel so safe I said it like a sleep he was going on Polar be style he was just swimming and enjoying himself not aware of anything I was in the biggest battle I've ever fought since I came into this message because God got real I walked out to the car very fast you know you know those walks you walk out the beach and the waves hit you a bit and then all of a sudden you're like yeah and you get there you get there to the car and I'm there behind the car and I'm like drwing myself off and Shantel goes are you all right and I put on my pants he goes are you all right I'm like yeah yeah I'm fine said but the Lord just revealed to me something and the evening we we had a chat about it but see the moment the word came to me I didn't go and reject it I don't try to fight it I just said Lord show me amen I think he's big enough he's an almighty God that can lead Israel out of Egypt keep them fed their shoes not worn I think he can take care of your reasoning can you give your reasoning to himen amen amen hallelujah okay Mark chapter 5 let's crack on a man with an unclean Spirit oh boy who knows the story devil possessed brother basically if you think about it let's make it more home a guy that's sitting in church knowing he's doing wrong knowing 100% knowing he's doing wrong unclean spirit Legion didn't have 1,000 demons in him brother Bram said he 2,000 demons in him I'll prove it by scripture how you take a Dem is you look where you shouldn't look you eat what you shouldn't eat you seek what you shouldn't seek it will find you temptation is out there looking for you you don't need to look for it but open yourself to it you will take a demon amen people you don't believe in demons have you ever seen someone cast out a demon have you ever seen it if you haven't seen it don't B it they're real I had my son 5 years old tell me there's a spirit behind me that just walked out the door Satan just walked out the door what does he know about it he was sick we prayed over him and the next day he tells me we're sitting at the table and he looks behind me goes dad there's a black Spirit behind you there's like a back Shadow behind you and it's walking out the door and I'm like I said okay tell me what you see cuz now I want to see if you made it up or not he goes no it was a shadow of the man no eyes just a shadow looked like a man it just appeared there but it it went out the door is it that Satan that left I said okay Lord when Chantel was in in South Africa in the house ran would be 3 years old hey three four years old 3 years old he'll look past his mom he'll go mom there's a man standing at the door she looks around no one at the door what's that there's everybody believes in ghosts everybody can see the manifestation of devils and demons and and all tattooed bodies and piercings and all these things happen to people but when you preach it they don't believe it when you say you're taking a devil because you're opening yourself up for it they don't believe that but they can see a manifest all over the show but they don't believe it can hit them because I'm a believer I'm a churchgoing message believer can't touch me can't touch me can't touch me no no attention span of a goldfish if it's more than 30 seconds yep no no it's not entertainment what are you led by yeah demon Spirits now before we read that cuz this ties in with this least you might like me this is God's picture of all of you before time began Le you got four children eh correct 1 2 3 5 did we do it right 1 2 3 4 5 yep you got it Jay you're the taller one sorry Davey it's true okay so there's his children now sin comes cuz remember they've got a testimony in our church of Davey Davey you're the shorter one okay so sin comes and it cuts Mr Davy away from the Lee family now the reason the parents aren't there is they're the one of the family at the back so you're all not jealous okay so they cut out Mr Davey Davey gets all full of himself takes a couple of demon Spirits drinks way too many V energy drinks and all of a sudden just gets casted there he is on the floor now the Lee family looks empty but that's not all so one of the other brothers and sisters here from church they they kind of believe hey you know what I might leave as well because if David leaves and he drinks all the V he can then maybe I want to bit of Freedom too I'm going to go too and I do this and this just bear with me that's why I failed um playing with clay in school I always ate it never really played with it it salty hey so another brother decides hey it's not good enough for Davey because I'm looking at him I'm not looking at him go too there he goes sister goes oo I like cutting my hair and I like wearing pants and I like why doing all these things and this message just boring I don't want to look like that one so I'm going to rebel and I'm going to I hope this eats home this is God not the Le family the shirt just had Lee on it and it was the only shirt that that I had since the Lees gave it to me I think you guys did give it to us wasn't it now did you buy it man you guys got trademark hey thank you I hope they're paying you royalties he that's a beautiful name God bless the Lee family so this sister she just goes now remember this I was going to preach it anyways I had my wife do this shirt for me so the artist is definitely Shantel not me or else you would have had a bunch of stick men and they all look exactly the same on no they won't cuz I don't have consistency in my drawing but yeah now we go gone she's gone too now we as the church we stay behind and here is all the ones that left and it leaves holes who wants to try this on David come cuz you're you're a Lee put on this shirt over your shirt and just wear it for me for a while would show everyone how it looks now remember turn around look a bit patchy hey just keep it on for now please they're not lost they're not lost they cut from the same shirt they've got the Holy Ghost within them they're just rebellious they're not listening so they go by the wayside so God will deal with them one will find Grace one will find a way out or try to and one will find a way back keep that in mind amen a man with an unclean spirit and it came to the other side of the sea into a country of the the um Gans and when they was out of the ship immediately they met a man out of the tombs and a man with an unclean Spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs now let me tell you this isn't it strange Satan always finds himself in dead beats dead places where there's no life no life in tombs in places where there's no God where it's all evil and bad he he dwells there and he wants to take you there cuz he can't dwell where there's life he can't dwell where the water is running now he has to isolate you and remove you from life M he has to cut you out and toss you to the dogs that's how he works that's the only way he works he wants to make sure that you are different than the Believers and he wants to trick your mind to make you believe that you are different let's go on his dwelling who was found among the tombs and no man could bind him not with chains so this this demon that's upon this this Legion of demons that's upon this brother is strong demons are strong you think you can take down a demon in your own ability don't do that you are on very dangerous ground those demons are very strong but our God is stronger so don't don't forget your enemy The Devil he's like a roaring lion but he ain't the lion okay so now here look at this he says because you have been um often Bound in in fets and chains and the chain has been plucked aund by him and the fet is broken in pieces neither could any man tame him the more the brothers speak to the guy the more he goes off the rails the more the sisters pray for him the more he goes off the rails the more you say come back to church man there we miss you the further he runs away he's just stubborn he's possessed with Devils he's opened his heart to devils and they sting on him and they manifesting and as much as the people love him and want to bring him back to God he's running he's just running but see he came to a moment where he saw something he saw someone that was different because his view came off the world his view came off his situation and here he goes he says and all and day at night he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying cutting himself with stones tormented by all these Dem demons and always night and day it was in the mountains where he tombs caring cutting himself but when he saw Jesus AAR off he ran and worshiped him yeah even the Devils worship our lord Jesus all that is breath all that is in heaven and earth and under the Earth shall worship Him amen shall testify because he's God Almighty and he falls to his feet and says and he cried with a loud voice and um as he have do what have we to do with thee Jesus thou son of the most high God I Adar thee by God that thou tormented me not wow this devil all of a sudden was so big Legion was so strong the Army couldn't bound him the men in the town couldn't handle him he was the mean Mac he was the Big Daddy he was so possessed with the spirit that when Brothers come he'll just push them away already he had a family brother Brandon picks this up he says this man had had a family this man was a dad but he took so many spirits and they possessed him that he left everything and he went and and went to a dead Place cut off from Life cut off by himself isn't it strange that when people leave this message they always want to be by themselves don't want a fellowship you call a youth meeting they ain't coming you say hey let's have a prayer night they don't want to come you say hey we all just going to go to the park and kick ball they're the last ones there but when you say hey we're going to go play some games and do some cards man they're all there cuz it's now fun but when there's something serious around the word there that demon Spirit don't want to go there it wants to sit in a dead place in a tomb what is possessing you can you identify may God make it real what is leading you today is it leading you towards God or is it leading you away from God where is your heart where's your affection see God has Grace for you I say it today God has Grace for youall he has Mercy he's put a seed in that Legion and he knew he was going to go get him he knew it and here comes Legion and he cried with a loud voice and he says what have I done with thee Jesus thou son of the most high I Deary by God to me me not for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean Spirit wasn't a big event he didn't take a AK-47 and start shooting the demons spoke the word One Moment in the presence of God could change your life it changed mine I'm a witness brother brandham talks about this banner boy that they had and they were swimming he says and while they swimming you know before they get to the the swimming and it's coming to Springtime he says they'll have this banner boy and what this banner boy will do is he will be the the last one the last time in is the first one the next time in to tell them if the water is cold or hot he says but I never had I never had to be the banner boy I was always the first one in he says because all these kids had nice clothes on and everything that they had to take off and the button shirts he says only had overall and it was done with a piece of twine and all he did is he just ripped a piece of twine dropped overall and he was in the water he says but when he jumped in the water there was two signs when you lift one hand up the water's cold come in slowly boys the water's cold okay he says bunny lifted both hands up they know it's all fine the water is good I testify that the water is good come in now I testify today with both hands up the gospel is good come in come in it is nice in here the water is great the the the battles might be hard the Rapids might be strong but the order is fine it will sustain you Hallelujah you will have a ball once you're in I promise you I've never had Joy so much in my life than in this gospel hallelujah praise the Lord oh man I don't have to stress who wants to to come and and punch my lights out or I don't have to stress am I walking on on eggshells enough so I'm cool for the ladies I don't have to be cuz you're young men your battle is real you still need to get a wife Ben just got one he got Revelation okay okay brother Ben got Revelation how tired are you Ben cuz you look tired okay we spoke about Ben on the way here I'm going to go there it's Sunday hang in there it's luck not evening she can't fall asleep yet so Ben when you were by yourself single and you were swimming and fishing and hunting and all those things how much time did you have to sleep heaps can you stand up and say to all the young men just say stand up and say how much time did you have time guys okay c a TI that hey Ben how's you [Laughter] sleep but hold on but hold on would you trade it for anything no no so don't throw away what you have you young boys you still need to you know present and look for a girl and B did that he fought real hard he was you know untameable but he he made the love of his life and his heart got soft and mushy and all of a sudden B that's so strong he still strong but when love calls him he's like yes there what can I do for you I'm tired yeah but just once more you're tired too I'll do it okay because his hard as been changed okay so just just take it in this context God ain't fighting with you he just wants to say hey I want to have that relationship with you have you been single long enough have you been single in your own stuck in your own ways for long enough or do you want to get married that's what he did to Legion he went to Legion and the poor fellow was so out of his mind that the Devils worship Jesus Christ not even him hope you realize that Jesus cast out the Devils he says and he asked them what is thy name and they answered saying my name is Legion for we are many we watch YouTube and Twitter and and all this other stuff I don't even know it I'm so out of devices these days and when I didn't do that I was on the news and I just eat all that and then when somebody says that I eat all that and everything that I can take possibly I took in here not in here in here and now all of a sudden it's manifesting and now all of a sudden I'm doing things it's out of my character cuz I used to be a good church boy when my daddy and mommy still gave me a p but now all of a sudden now I'm bigger and more grown up and I can make my own choices now I just let Satan rule my members so I got many Devils many and they're tormenting him because remember it's nobody in their right mind want to be in this state have you ever been in a graveyard oh man come on it freaks me out if you put the lights down you you walk through a graveyard it's a icky place man it's like there could be dead people here well there is dead people there yeah but what if they wake up well they will wake up one day if they're Saints if they're dead and far removed from God they'll stay in that grave but see the thing is when I was still in the world under that influence you would not catch me in one of those places it's it's not a nice place to be you're not very comfortable there the gospel makes you very comfortable sometimes too comfortable but it's a good place to be because it is security against your enemy it's your Fortress okay we're g sorry and he besought him that he would not send them away out of a country now there was n unto them in the mountains a great herd of swine a great herd have you ever seen a lot of pigs the most I've ever seen is like four or five in a pig remember it with brother F that's pretty much the most Pig I'm going to tell you how many pigs there was let's go on he says now and the Devils besought him saying say send us to the swine and we'll enter into them and Jesus okay and for for with Jesus gave them leave wow hey sorry Lord Jesus sorry can you just put us in the pigs and and not cast us away just just put us in pigs the devil knows who Christ is they fear and tremble they didn't fight back with him he was one they were 2,000 and all of us said please just send us to the swine one man with that Authority sitting within your heart sitting right here what can you do you can cast out some serious Devils cuz it's not you it's the same God that cast these the demons out is within you but see demons we think it's people possessed foaming at the mouth running around no it's lust it's jealousy it's depression all those Spirits it's cancer it's anything that's contrary to the word of God and his promises that's a demon you can cast it out but first meet him and he gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and evented into the swine and a herd ran over the Steep Place into the sea they were about 2,000 not a thousand 2,000 demons cannot conquer our god what can you do if you surrender to that God see but see Legion comes now and it says when the people came back let's just go a little bit on and they came back to Jesus and they see the one that was possessed with devil verse 15 and Legion sitting there clothed in his right mind isn't it strange when devil is stacking you you he always wants to take stuff off of you yeah he wants to take your hair off he want to take your clothes off he wants to make it as short as skimpy as he can puts as much patches as you as he can he wants to dirty you up he wants to corrupt you so bad that you look like the image of Satan he he doesn't build you up he brings you down wake up amen he would strip you of everything if he can because he wants you to dwell on the earth with him but see Legion found Grace that man was not looking for God but God was looking for that predestinated seed so look here further on we go there to verse 19 he says how B Jesus suffered him not so Jesus climbs back on the boat this man's running to the boat says Lord I just want to go with you I just want to go with you he says no go home and tell th friends tell them how great things the Lord has done for thee cuz he had compassion on thee so he could be a follower of Jesus the Rich Young Ruler didn't want to be this guy he was happy with his riches but this guy after he has been delivered said Lord what do I know I'll just follow you and he goes you don't need to follow me just go testify you don't need to be a preacher you don't need to be a deacon you don't need to be just testify what I've done for you today amen you don't need to be a office Bearer to be important for Christ you need to be a mom and a dad and a real brother in a time of need so when your bro is doing something wrong you stand in the Gap go hey no stop am that's being in your position see he didn't say to this guy now go preach the gospel and spread it wi he says just testify testify what I've done for you today so he was he was not even in on the lookout for God but God came his way amen now we're going to go to the one that wants a weigh in Luke 15 let's go cuz I don't want to wrap this up Hallelujah I'll I'll bring us something of a Side Story here while we're busy with that L um Luke 15 Matthew Mark Luke are you guys feeling I'm a bit too rough today am I are you all good sorry I just got a little bit to get off my my Fork it's a lot of ha don't worry it came my way too now Moses I just want to bring you a little bit of a parallel Moses where children because we want to have a have a children Moses was one so okay we had the one believer here we go Davey come back okay God found the one believer who was the first believer who can tell me he was a Rich Young Ruler okay but the Rich Young Ruler he kind of he kind of wanted a way out but God still went his way at Grace and I believe he might not be the bride of Christ now I'm just saying it in a nice way but he would still be there because the Lord knew that he wanted eternal life he turned it down though but God went his way anyways like the woman at the well all those ones it's who response to the word but Davy that one got returned okay so when you walked away from the Lord did you think you'll ever come back no never ever that wasn't crossing your mind at all okay where are you now I've returned amen wait wait hold on we've got another one this sister that was so uh possessed tormented guess what Legion got cast out because she heard she got pricked and she said Lord forgive meall cast this un clean Spirits out of me right now am guess what the Lord did poor old swine you know the swine was more cleverer than most people today cuz when they took a spirit they they made themselves going very very small they ran into the ocean where did you come from Sister there you go so that sister she was back I need one morea there and we all the family rejoiced and we did and we're going to hallelujah thank you DAV you can sit but there's one missing now God said if I lose 99 you've got 900 of 100 sheep and I lose one what will I do9 I leave the 99 so we have one still missing but see this one really wants a way back something is already working on both sides once a way back but God is going to send a bit of a trial to get this person to a point where they want to come come back because remember God is not a cookie cutter God one found Grace one wanted a way out but one will come in he says because all the father has given me shall come to me okay so Luke 15 who knows the story so Jesus actually speaks about three things in in the Luke 15 he says a lost sheep a lost coin and a lost son so who knows the story about the prodical son we all know this can you tell me what happened okay so the prodical son goes to his dad he says Dad I'm not going to read it but it's in scripture write that down do it as homework he goes to the dad he says Dad just give me give me my money all that you were going to give me anyways give that money Dave you can give my shirt back please give me give me my money I want to go live it up no don't worry I'm going to go live it up so he did the moment he got out of his dad's house man he was living it up Arman stui he was parting and drinking and just doing all kinds of things having a ball of his life go read that I hope you you read it this time with an open heart and he got into this country but the people weren't his people and he started visiting and fellowshipping with them all and having cool drinks with them all and doing all the cool stuff that he cool kids do today and you know maybe I'm not cool enough started forgetting who he is money started going cuz his inheritance just went spent it all end up at a place no job no friends no hope here's what God did God send the famine in that country you think it was bad no God can make it worse for you but see inside of that is a predestinated seed inside of that heart not that head that heart God is dealing with that young man and he finds himself in a pig pen man pigs is a theme hey some of them run to ocean this guy just finds him EA that slop and he looks at this food and he gets he gets to himself he starts realizing the way I'm acting the things I'm doing and what I'm saying is hurting people I can't carry on like this I said man if I can only go back to Dad David and I can just talk to my dad at least I know if he makes me a servant he still treats me better in church all the Believers treat you better than your best friend in the world I'm going to say it again I want you guys to real you young people listen to what I say this is the truth your Believers in the church that loves God will treat you better than your best friend in the world because their interest is to see you get to God and have a relationship with God our interest is here not to push you down and preach you to border our our whole um place of being here is to worship God alone but I'm going to tell you something I'm going to worship him first before I'm going to look at you but when I do see you struggle don't you think it burns inside me as well when you see somebody going and is tired like Ben today comes up and you can see man he is really tired he had a rough time don't you think I feel same but sometimes the things don't work out the way you scripted in your head but don't change your heart towards the people of God because their prayers carry you through amen that Dad was praying for his son every night every morning every day every hour every minute it would say Lord when's my son coming back I don't I'm not even in his position hallelujah thank the Lord I'm not but there is people that is and they praying and they praying and they praying but guess what God's going to send a fam famine their way he's going to make them desperate he's going to get them to a point where they senses come back to them and then he's going to bring them back amen so don't stop praying don't stop interceding Church of God don't stop don't stop whatever we do to judge don't stop to think about oh but this or that don't think about those things don't reason let God do the work if you can if you want to further the kingdom of God in this Wellington and this shic church if you want to do it you stay sincerely at him I don't need to know who's going through a rough time you don't need to come and gossip to me and say what's going on with Brothers s and so I've got an almighty God I can put that burden in my heart to preach it I don't want to know anything because the moment you say anything about the brother and sister you're putting a veil over them I hope you heard that the moment you come and say oh pray for sister this and this and pray for that one is that is wrong because what happens is you're trying to do this work you're trying to redeem someone back to God it's not your job your job is to pray if you see it and you got the burden you get down on your knees I promise you God is big enough to make us all know who's going through a hard time I don't need to know that because what happens is when brother Ben and this is maybe brother Ben I do apologize for this but it's coming now you don't need to tell brother Ben what's going on with another family in this church you don't because if he gets behind this pulpit and he wants to pray preach against the L Spirit you already told him that now if he preaches it you'll go oh see but sister some so I told him that so he knew so it cuts off God out of this service I'm not saying keep it all quiet I'm saying don't give those things to your pastor there's deacons that's their job so you want to bring someone before God bring him before God and if that doesn't work or speak to the deacons our pastor don't need to know it because he needs to come and stand here before this church and preach whatever God put on his heart and you just take it but the moment you said it the moment you spoke it you cut the grace of God off because now it's not God working it's man working and it will never work and it will always fall we cannot do that church if you really have a burden for someone there's two deacons I've seen them fight some big fights in this church I was one fighting as well brother Ed God gave them enough wisdom to keep me in line he will do the same for you leave brother Ben and Sister Christine out of these things it's not their place brother Ben is to get the spiritual fruit from God come to this pulpit and pro be their friends talk to them share your burden to them of yourself that's fine but they have nothing to do with order and conduct and all those things we got policemen okay they can keep me in order I promise that they can keep you in order he disclaimer okay remember I speak English in self-defense so if anything this sounds harsh just remember I love brother Ben 100% but I want brother B to tell me off when he wants to tell me off because then I know God is doing the work through him amen so I ain't telling brother B anything in my life except that God is good and he's dealing with me but with them I go Pro Ed it's been a rough one because that's my Channel please can you do that if you fellowship with him and brother B ask you a question you'll be honest you're answering that's different that's leading by the Lord don't run and phone and do all those things and use the deacons that wasn't in my notes but I thought I'll just put it in on anyways so the lost son comes back to his dad dad wakes up the morning and and looks on the horizon and it's old dusty road and he sees something coming and he's like w still bit far away Lord but could that be my son because it kind of looks like him I've been praying now for a couple of years but I look and it Lord please let that be mine there was many of people Cross by but this one just looks different says Lord I Just Praise my son Hallelujah I'm going to praise you it's my son and he started coming closer and his head was hung and he didn't know where to hide gets to his dad his dead I stuffed up all that you gave me I lost every little bit of it gone I wasted it I sinned I lived bad I smoked I drank look at the tattoos on Me stuffed up forgive me that go goes hold on go get that fatted go grabs his son he puts his ring on his finger he hugs him he says welcome home you're home the other son don't understand what just happened you might not understand why rank cner would walk through the doors and get saved by God but he's home he he he made it back home safe he didn't die in that pig pen he got to his senses he came back home you dads are speak today to you no matter what your sons go through and I'm talking about the son specifically that's my burden you receive them back receive them back in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ CU remember you will get tested and you must get tested because if you get tested God knows your rest child and if he never goes through a test all your fathers if your son don't go through a test he's just another clone just a clone he's do a chip off the old block but the moment he finds his identity in Christ and he comes back amen then it's different Hallelujah but sometimes they have to go just squander it out in the world I got a huge burden for these young ones they got what a massive battle now I'll talk about Moses he's living in Pharaoh's Palace Pharaoh every morning looks over comes to a big window looks at all the slaves man I got a great Kingdom I got a lot of slaves but these slaves there are a lot of them so he starts calling them little Moses by God's hand divine intervention brings him to Pharaoh's daughter raises Pharaoh raises him as a son he's the next Air to the throne he's got riches he's got women he's got popularity he's like the Leonel Messi and the Ronaldo of all he's got everything he looks at those Hebrews and he says they're all slaves one day Moses walks up to that window and he looks out and he sees those people and he says my people I I want to be with them he looks behind him and he's got all the riches of the world he's got everything on tap but he looks at his people and he decides you know what I'm going to go down and visit that people hallelujah and he goes down and he gets to the first place and he's been there many a times but today God was dealing with his heart he wanted a way in he didn't want a way out and he gets there and he sees one slave being beaten and he beats up the guy buries him in sand next day goes to his own people and he's starting to talk to two brothers fighting and they go oh you just killed the Egyptian yesterday who you now he runs for his life see now things got hard for Moses real hard and he takes his family and he runs away and he hides 40 years God was dealing 40 years God was dealing because he had a plan for him to return but see sometimes they have to go through the trials to become one of us listen they have to go through the trials to become one of us God was still dealing with Moses God had such plans for Moses that Moses didn't know about Moses couldn't even speak he still made a way for Aaron to come and speak to him God came to Moses and got to Moses when God wanted to deal with Moses it might not look like that devil is moving but God has a Time In A Line in the Sand where he will deal with that person and if he deals with it it's a perfect finished work that's it get your hands off get your knees on then we win it amen amen so when we see things go wrong remember Moses back linen God made him a prophet the prodical son as lost as could be God brought him back what is anything to a hard for God Amen and we'll close with what brother Isaac started with because I had it in my notes John 6 please go there and brother Isaac and musicians you can come up but I want to finish there now I get very passionate about these things and I know sometimes I say a lot of things but I mean it with all my heart get your hands off of God's work and let God work because we only get in his way amen we go there to verse 35 brother Isaac what made you read the script what made you tell the scripture just just felt it hey oh the Lord's good so I was standing there and I was just saying Lord I got all my notes I always do it I've got all my notes here just please confirm that this is you okay and here it comes John 6:35 can you put that up he says and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst next verse says but I say unto you that ye also have seen me and not believed not I'll go back to my word he says but I say unto you that you have also seen me and believe not but all that the father has given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will no wise cast out so you got a choice believer you can come running like Legion you can go test your strength in the world like the prodical son and get burned and have scars or you can just come to him right now you say Lord whatever I have take it right now unbelief doubt depression anything that is contrary to the word of God you have a choice where you can surrender it and you can live an overcoming life Hallelujah and Isaac started with the scripture he says because I have Waters of life and I will give it you in an abundance I'll give you all that water just come and drink just give up just for long enough so God can deal with you just long enough don't stay in Pride don't stay in the world just for long enough let him deal with you hallelujah amen and this is the Father which have sent me and of all that have given to me I should not lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day that's not my words as his words amen may the Lord just bless let's just stand up and just quickly pray and I'll ask brother Isaac to close the the service for us if everybody just bows their heads close their eyes now this last believer Brother David come here put that on standing just next to me [Music] please so the Lee family got restored turn around all that was lost was brought back there wasn't a sea missing [Music] because God does a finished work and when you come from God you go back to God and all these children came back to God because they were cut from the same cloth they just didn't know it thank you brother David keep that shirt on is anything to hard for God he's restored it fully not broken not wasted not desolate can you receive that let's bow our heads be reverent now bow your heads kids close your eyes if anybody I'll close my eyes as well close your eyes if anybody needs a touch from the Lord today that came to that point that either is running away or so possessed in such a place that they don't know what to do or even like the prodical son want to go try the world and fail miserably because that's what happens because God will make it hard if there's anyone like this here I pray that you raise your hand so our lord Jesus just knows the uplifted hand is what testifies to Heaven and Earth and underneath the word Earth in the seen the Unseen realm it is a open declaration that Lord Jesus come my way restore un to me the joy of my salvation help me Lord to sit back in my position if there's anyone there lift up your hands defy gravity today lift up your hands I got my hands lifted and say Lord see the hands that's lifted today keep your eyes closed Lord Jesus you did it for Legion Lord Jesus you did it for the woman at the well Lord Jesus you did it for the prodical son Lord the Rich Young Ruler didn't want anything father but you still went his way oh father I pray that you'll give us a heart of Flesh tonight today as we he Lord I pray that every hand that's raised Lord Jesus do you see them they're your children Lord they belong on your cloth they belong on your skirt Lord they were cut from you my lord predestinated lord I pray that you will go to them right now and Minister unto them father let the Unseen happen in this place right now Lord Lord may you take over now father may your spirit move among them Lord may it convict them may it tell them Lord that this is not said out of anger father but it's said out of love father because you loved us you looked at the Rich Young Ruler with love you saw him and you loved him Lord with his sins with no sins Legion had so many demons Lord but yet you found Grace you returned him to his family oh Father fully restored him by his senses clothed he went back to his wife and kids and he said he came down the road there to his kids and as he walking to the gate he's been out for months they like Daddy Mommy where where's Daddy and here comes a man clothed in his right man walking back to his house and his wife looks out the kitchen and she sees him coming back and she runs to him and the kids run to him and they grab him and they say Dad you're back what happened he said I met the Lord Jesus a man of Galilee stepped on the shores Hallelujah and everything inside me knew he was God and he knew there was only one way to get rid of all of this filth and and all of this lasciviousness I fell at his feet and I said have mercy Hallelujah and he had mercy and he cast out every single Spirit out of me I'm a changed man Hallelujah and the people rejoiced with him and they shouted and praised and said glory be to God and if that's the god you serve that could change my dad then that's the God that I would serve because he'll never leave me nor forsake me and the family got in a union again Lord Jesus because you done the fin finished work Hallelujah Lord and that testimony stands still today I'm a witness the water is fine Hall I was that man that was possessed by Devils running around looking for all kinds of things Lord but one day I fell at your feet and I said take my life make it yours Lord I surrendered everything my thoughts Hallelujah everything my doubts my reservations Lord every preconceived idea that I had about this message Lord about you Lord about this Bible I just played it down I said father who do I go to because you alone have the words of eternal life and then you changed me and you said take my name and I took your name and my wife took your name and my children took your name Lord and you restored us back again yes battles are still there Lord but you have done the work the Great greater work Lord so I pray for those ones Lord today come their way please in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ right now Lord may they surrender all may they not go through what I went through May they surrender all now in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray you can put your hands down just keep your heads down just let the music play but just calm down and don't make it emot thing think upon these things let God Minister unto you let he talk to you now take time we've got a whole Sunday but take this time now and let God speak to your heart right now don't push him away whatever you do don't push him away think about these things
