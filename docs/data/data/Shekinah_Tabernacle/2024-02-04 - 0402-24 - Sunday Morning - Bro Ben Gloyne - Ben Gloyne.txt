me as on the day of Pentecost fire fall on me oh amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen you may be seated I just keep getting these words let the um let someone share a testimony like this obvious someone's got a testimony and so this is your opportunity to to take courage and share what the Lord has done for you or testify what faith is saying according to the promise someone's got a testimony today so here is an opportunity to share Sister Louise have we got some fire in here it really hit home to me how the Lord cares about the small things and I honestly I was sitting there marking in my diary um like the dates pay payday dates and dates when I was going to be paying my wrench and all that kind of thing I thought man it would be really handy if I just had a red pen CU I had a blue pen it was like I need to differentiate these things so I that was the thought I thought I might go and have a look through the drawers and my stuff that's in storage up being in Christine's so I seriously I walked probably about 10 steps toward the garage I stood in the garage doorway I looked to my left and there was a red pen so I just thank the Lord for being the god that sees the Small Things our small needs amen and our big needs and yeah provides so praise the Lord God bless you all um my walk with the Lord has definitely been very interesting and overwhelming for the last three or four months there is so many testimonies and all the glory to the Lord just the other day I was um this is got a couple but yeah I was paying in the house and it it just was so windy and it started to rain and I just said to the Lord it would just be so nice Lord if I could just get this one window and this entrance done and the rain just disappeared for about 2 hours and then it came on down and the other um testimon I just want to thank the Lord for is um just with doing up both his houses and working I've had no work come in for quite a while and just all of a sudden I said to the Lord L I just need some work to come in I don't know how I don't know where but I need some work and three jobs have just come in so I just want to give the Lord all the praise and glory and and thank the Lord for continuing to be with my wife and baby healing them and looking after them amen amen amen amen do you want to come up robins's a spirit that drives me on Amen the Lord um I there's a spirit of anxiety that comes over me in certain circumstances and this morning it happens again it affects my body and I just said Lord I just need this gone devil you don't have a part in my day in my Sunday especially in any day of the week that I want to go and worship you you've got no part in it and so I struggled to come every time he dragged me back dragged me back and I just say Lord just take this Affliction from me I I don't need it I don't want it just get gone I need the Lord here devil you've got no place I drove here I wasn't Afflicted on the way praise the Lord that would have been a bit dire and I came here I walked in the door welcome and then Andy says any testimonies and I say Just Praise the Lord here thank [Applause] you so um this testimony actually happened a while ago not that not that long ago was for Noel's birthday and she was telling us how much she wanted to go to Rainbow end and um she was so excited she said oh my parents might say yes and then me and anley also got so excited so so we're just like oh we need to pray for this so we can actually go so we did and all of us kept on praying a lot of times and we actually thought we weren't going to go cuz um Shannon and Isaac said oh how but like um a couple of days before Noah's birthday like like a few days before um Shan and Isaac needed to go pick something up from Oakland and so um so we were able to go and we were so excited and everything and also um we prayed for it not to rain for it not to be packed we prayed for a lot of things so we could have like an awesome time and every single one of our things God answered them and made it happen yeah and on the way back Isaac told me and no and wasn't there she was at her grandparents house but um on the way back Isaac told told us that that God will do this for us for the right things if we ask for something for the right things he'll always answer our prayers every time [Applause] God cares about even having fun it's not all serious he wants you to have fun so you can pray to have fun too amen anybody else want to share sister ma praise the Lord thank you sorry I'm not too good at um public speaking but I just have a very big testimony yesterday um when we were coming from work from Fielding we almost had a had on collision with another car and it was a I don't know how to explain it but we were driving down and the other car on the other side was trying to overtake this truck and we saw it last minute and we don't know how we managed to get get out of this we don't know um I was driving and I think God just took over and I swayed the car left emergency break and the car behind me they were tailgating us as well but they managed to break too and the car just missed us so um we just want to thank God I don't know what we would have been saying today so all the glory belongs to God the Lord amen amen hallelujah hallelujah God bless you um it's it's um sometimes it's the little things that don't seem anything that actually are the big things I I have always had the desire to watch I'm a fun person to like watching I I learn a lot by watching not reading but then uh this this Welcome To Earth I've always wanted to watch it I know it was very expensive but somehow God made the girl to come over to my place and they we watched through this day anyway and God knew there's something that um in nature cuz he created nature and he speaks to us through nature so there was just this part that he was uh they showing how water in the waterfalls it when you look at with your own eyes it looks really magnificent but when you slow it down and you see the small particles of water dropping down it's mindblowing in itself and just to show how God created those small bubbles having air in them but then it may look like just flash of water falling down first Struck it it's like waves of just current going down and with time the rocks that are there they seem nothing but it's those rocks are shaped with the water that flows there over a period of years and years to be what they are sometimes we may feel like there's nothing happening in our lives it's like we are a standstill but nothing ever stops God is always at work and that just really so the whole of last year for me I was feeling like I was at a stand still and there's another brother who said that but when I watched that it's it's really just like wow you see the Rocks they're so beautifully done but it took years for the shaping of the waterfall to make them the way they are that it you look at it and you're like wow right now when we look at ourselves we like you cannot see anything but just time is of the Lord so that's just that's what I wanted to share sometimes you might feel like there's nothing happening but for sure there's something thank you [Applause] s God bless you everyone um awesome to be back um was a Sunday school today and everyone's back which is cool so we did a planning day today with the children so just like to just share testimony and just to also to pray that the Lord will provide for the upcoming year the children gave a whole list of things that's in their heart that they want to know about things that they are interested in that they want to see more of in the word and things like that so they've got a spiritual desire and then on the other side of the board they wrote all the natural things that they would love to do in the upcoming year so if we could pray that the Lord will provide spiritually which I believe he will speak into their hearts and molding and shaping them but also provide the natural side these children want to go overseas they want to go to the snow they want to go to the sky diving to theu they want to go overnight camping they have a whole board full of everything they want to do in this upcoming year so pray that the Lord will provide according to his will in the upcoming [Applause] year last testimony okay praise the Lord

everything I believe will be fine amen so amen let's go to Luke chapter 19 today see if I can just orientate myself a little bit here uh Luke 19 I just uh want to continue on with our you know zakus uh we kind of got him down the tree but we're going to put him back up the tree again and get him down again amen and then so um um so yeah so we're here in Luke 19 and verse one sorry I don't have a slideshow um again this morning I I need to get back into that habit again so Luke 19 from verses 1 down to uh verse 10 and then we're going to read a couple of verses from John 12 says and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho and behold there was a man named zakus which was a chief among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see Jesus who he was and could not for the Press because he was little of stature and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zakus make haste and come down for today I must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be a to be guested with a man that is a sinner and zakus stood and said unto the Lord behold Lord half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I will restore him fourfold and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for as much as he also is a son son of Abraham for the son of man has come to seek and save that which was lost amen and then we're going to go to uh John 12 and we're going to read verses uh 20 down to 26 here um so yeah John 12: 20- 26 and and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast now this is the Feast of Pentecost I mean sorry the Feast of Passover the name came therefore to Philip and which was of uh besider of galile and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus I think that's a real good desire to have Philip cometh and tell Andrew and again Andrew and and Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered answered them saying the hour has come that the son of man must be glor should be glorified verely verely I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep shall keep it unto life eternal any If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer of course we got to remember the Youth Camp again amen but if you have a need just want to slip your hand up to the Lord and say Lord remember me in prayer amen God bless you gracious father we thank you so much we can bow our heads once again in your presence and Lord Lord as we've just read the uh zakus had a desire to see you for who you were and the Greek said sir we would see Jesus and Lord that's why I believe we've come this morning that's what we want to speak about this morning Lord that we would see you so may you grant it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ and father we want to especially remember the Youth Camp that's going on in Ragin Lord I pray that Lord you would continue to bless the camp May pour your spirit out Lord may you touch every heart Lord fill everyone there with your Holy Ghost oh God set the captives free Lord Jesus May Sinners weep their way to Calvary may you have a may you have preeminence in that camp and we thank you for it Lord blessed by the hour and the church there for hosting it and Lord we just want to ask Lord as every hand that's been raised has a desire and a need behind it I pray you'd meet those needs according to your riches and Glory may you guide our steps Lord may we just love you more and more every day we thank you so much for your mercy for your blood just pray you cover us in your blood protect us Lord and may you be with those who are not here today Lord Jesus I pray you be the portion Lord we're so thankful you're mindful of us Lord wherever we are so Lord may you touch them as well and keep them in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to take if I could take that as a as a title of sir we would see Jesus now I think it's the Most Blessed desire that anyone could ever have in their entire life as they want to see Jesus Christ and now we know that when when when zakus you you it always struck me there you know we read there in Luke 19 where it says that he would he he sought to see Jesus who he was so to me zakus was looking he his desire was to see more than just a Man From Galilee we know Jesus the Bible would say there was when we saw him there'd be nothing of him that we desire him so he wasn't some big six foot something blond haad you know kind of an athlete kind of a guy he was a short man looked like anyone else but he wanted to look Beyond his natural appearance and see him for who he really was and I believe anyone who's really sincere and really really has that same desire they want to see Jesus and we know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change he changes his form but who he really is is still the same and that's why we can say the god of the Old Testament is the god of the new Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so we can the same desire that zakus had and those Greeks have we can have that same desire and they saw him for who he was now you think of zakus it's amazing that Jesus would say on on on on on you in the beatitude you say blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God and the name zakus actually means pure but if you look at zakus and how he became Rich he was a chief Publican he was a tax collector I doubt very much he was a pure kind of a guy amen but you know he would you know he would pull a lot of shady deals in his life he would be you know because that's the reason when he came down out of the tree and I'm jumping ahead of myself but when he came down out of the tree he said Lord if I have if I have done any wrong to anyone I'm going to give half my goods to the poor and if I've taken anything by false accusation from anyone I'm going to restore fourfold so there would have been days when he would have had a real bad motive in his heart he would have dragged people before his uh tax collector chair you know there's a saying how Tax Collectors are all dodgy guys it must have come from somewhere you know that that that mistrust and resentment must have come from somewhere more than just people parting with their money or having to but you know zakus I think he had that kind of a kind of a way about him but you see he had a desire that he would see Jes Jesus now everyone I I believe who's really in their right mind has a Longing To See God you know more and remember zakus and the Greeks they weren't looking for an argument they weren't looking for a new code of ethics or an influencer on social media or some life hacks they were looking they weren't looking for a list of doctrines they weren't looking for a church they were looking for God they were looking for Jesus Christ himself and to me I think that's the Most Blessed thing to have is that we would have that same kind of desire now we know God is in nature God is in many things God is in his creation you know if you just look at if you look at if you really study nature you'll see God and you know brother Bram would tell the story when he wanted to go squirrel hunting he was actually squirrel hunting at the time with uh brother Banks woods and brother Banks was going to take him on this place that brother BR had never had never hunted on before but as they're driving up to the house there's an old man old woman owned this owned this uh property it was a private property but brother Banks knew the family and you know brother Braham was told by Brother Banks okay so so don't get out of the car when I get out of the car and talk to this man because he's an Infidel he doesn't like preachers he you know you he wants nothing to do with them so you just stay in the car and I'll talk to him and then so brother Banks gets out and and brother Banks knew him and you know they were talking back and forth and they were discussing different things and you know he asked brother Banks asked you know oh can you know can I um can I go hunting on your place go scroll hunting and and um and you know the old man said sure thing and you know but then brother uh Bank said oh you know my pastor's here with me can he can he come hunting with me and you know this old man said you know Banks Woods have you got so low down you got to pack a preacher with you everywhere you go and brother Braham thought that's about the time he should get out of the car now now he got out of the car he had half a you a week of Beed on him he had squirrel blood over his overalls you know he didn't look like a preacher but you know this old man looked at him and you know this old man didn't didn't think much of preachers he thought there's nothing you know really to do it's just a you an argument or something and you know and then you know they begin to talk about nature and you know there was a there was an apple tree that that man or his father planted in that yard and you know this man was now an old man and you know he would our brother B asked you know can I have one of those apples and and the old man said sure the yellow jackets are eating them you might as well have one too so he so he picked it up and now the time of season you know the time of year that they were hunting was it was just before Autumn but Autumn hadn't come in yet the first chill hadn't come into the country yet but yet this this apple tree and different trees around it had started to lose their leaves and so brother Brown began to ask man you know what what causes what causes this tree to lose its you know you you know the leaves fall off cuz the life of the tree is going out of the leaves into the sap and into the root so when it really freezes it doesn't kill the tree and and and brother brah asked this man this question and you know this old man says oh it's just it's just nature it's just you know it's just the seasons and things but then brother Ram said to him but but you see you see there's no um but there's been no cold chill yet what is telling this what is telling this tree that Winter's coming or Autumn's coming You' your life has got to go down to the roots that you don't die and this man you know kind of said you oh yeah it's just it's just nature it's always happened all these things and you know brother BR made a statement it sounded a bit ridiculous but you know but he said you know well what if you just get a bucket of water put it on a post you know that water's not going to run down to the bottom and run back up again when it comes to be Springtime there's got to be a Divine intelligence that tells the tree that wi winter is coming Autumn is sitting on and you know this man would say you know there is one one preacher that I'd like to see because we have neighbors over this way and you know you know you know the woman was dying she had cancer we'd go help her you know with the bed sheet and things she couldn't even get to the bathroom anymore my wife would go clean her house and different things and it was a few weeks ago and we just heard an awful record coming from the house it sounded like the Salvation Army was up there all the shouting and screaming and carrying on and you know we thought well well she's passed away so you know the next morning you know we better head up there and you know help help her husband get the body down to the the mor and different things but you know the thing is when we got into the house we found her she wasn't bed ridden she wasn't even remotely sick she cooked us apple pie and she was eating and she was like she was perfectly normal and well and and and and and this just didn't make sense to us cuz she was riddle with cancer she was meant to die and they would tell us that what happened was that the night before when all that screaming and shouting was going on is because the sister of that woman had come from a meeting and a preacher called her out and told her her name told her what was going on in her life told her she had a handkerchief and her in her in her bag and to take that handkerchief and lay it on her sister that was with cancer and she'd get well and that's what happened last night and so when the can um when the handkerchief was put on that woman am mean she she her health was restored that cancer was gone she was healthy strong and well again and then so this old man said you know I'd like to I'd like to uh meet that preacher and brother and see see he was preaching to me this Infidel was preaching to him and then you know brother BR said okay this is what we'll do we'll go H scrw hunting on your place and during that time you tell me what intelligence tells the sap of that tree to go down on the roots when it's when it's Autumn time and I'll tell you the same intelligence that told me that that woman's condition even the handkerchief was in her sister's purse all those things and I'll tell you who who God really is and see that man his eyes came open Hallelujah because he saw God he saw Jesus see he saw more than just nature and and and and and and natural things he saw more than an argument he saw reality and brother Braham led him to Christ and a year later you know brother brah went back hunting on the place again and and his wife who was now a widow didn't recognize him and actually told him to get away but you know brother Braham said to him but you know um but but your husband told me a year ago that you know we could come hunt here and and she said oh are you brother brandom and you know he said I'm she said that you know after you led my husband to the Lord a year ago he loved the Lord with all of his heart but he's gone on to be with the Lord now but you see he looked beyond it's beyond an argument amen see it's not Doctrine we hold to that's Jesus is more than a collection of ideas it's more than it's more he's more than a Doctrine he's a person he's a being he made you whether you realize it or not he made the planet that you live on he made this universe but yet he is so great he can come down and reveal himself to you and I that if we have a sincere heart we can see him amen so I trust you have the same kind of Desire see zakus brother brah he dramatizes a bit and he tells us that his wife Rebecca became a Believer became a believer in Jesus Christ and now zakus he was he was the chief he was the richest Publican in Jericho the richest tax collector that's a big deal but he but he started to see a change in his wife she became a different person after she attended those meetings and and he knew the scribes the Pharisees he knew the religious order of um Jericho but there was nothing in him that really he said it's just a bunch of hypocrisy there's nothing to it see he was looking at religion he didn't see the God that was meant to be represented in that religion he did not see am mean the god of Moses living in those people and so he just thought there's nothing to it but he saw the change in his wife and then that began to stir him up and now he he heard that that Jesus was actually going to come into Jericho and so what he did is he got up early that morning you know he was he was he was convicted he was all stood up and you know he you know decided to put his best clothes on that morning and he you know you know his wife was still tucked in bed saw him get up you know pretended to still be asleep and you know he got up got dressed into his best best clothes and he went out the door she began to say Thank You Lord you're working on him Hallelujah and then what happened is you know he would you know because he was short in stature he heard the Cry of the you know Jesus coming in into the City and he couldn't get through the Press of the people even though he you know tried to use his Prestige don't you know who I am you know Make Way for zakus you know but no one cared about him in that kind of environment you know God makes us all the same we got to realize that we can't come to God based on who we think we are I mean no but we want to see Jesus we want to come with a pure heart and then so now he would come and he couldn't because of the press he is a short man he couldn't see God you he couldn't see the Lord Jesus there so brother R says he actually pulled some a couple of garbage cans up against the tree to try and get up it because he couldn't get up to get that first limb of that sycamore tree and he tried his first attempt he slipped and he fell in the garbage can you know wiped himself off because he was worried that people would see him for you know being acting foolish but thing is he had something in his heart I must to see her I must see this man for who he is I mean I'm not coming to see him just to Discount him Something's Happened to my wife I want to see what this man has done to her am mean so so so he put the garbage cans dragg them back by the tree got on them somehow got up on the first limb the second limb but then he thought well you know I probably look a bit foolish people see me up here so he got real up high in that tree so no one could see him yeah so he and he opened the branches just a little bit and he was watching and he heard the noise of the crowd coming through he heard the hosas and the glories to God and he heard no doubt blind Bas who was now seeing Bas crying I can see I can see and but then he'd hear the Pharisees and the scribes saying get out get out of our city you're not welcome here don't listen to this man false prophet false prophet you know cancel culture On The Run trying to cancel Jesus you can't cancel Jesus amen you can try but you can't cancel Jesus amen but then you know finally Jesus walking along now we know Jesus was led by Vision he didn't haphazardly just see a tree moving and see zakus up there he knew he was there see Jesus knows where we are amen and he'll cause a meeting to take place that we can see him if you want to see him and so here comes here comes zakus I mean Here Comes Jesus now he it says he stands there he looks up and he says zakus come down and maybe zakus thought now how does he know who I am number one how did he know where I was number two how does he know where I am and how does he know my name God knows everything about you Hallelujah whether you realize it or not he knows more about you than you know about you amen but his but zakus because he wanted to see him for who he was see if we really want to see God God will really show us who he is amen amen so he really wanted to see him for who he was and then so zakus came down now as I said uh in the beginning zakus means pure but I doubt very much he started off as a as a pure individual but you see there's something happens when you really come into the presence of God with a pure heart you can't be the same right you cannot be the same you see zakus wanted to see Jesus for who he was he wasn't looking just on the outward appearance he wanted to see what is this man that's changed my wife what is this man and then when he looked at him he said Lord capital L O R D Supreme one not just Lord as an assur this is this is the same like the woman that was caught in adultery when Jesus is finished writing in the sand he says which of you have no have no sin Let Him cast the first stone and then from the oldest to the youngest all of her accusers dropped their stones and walked away cuz are convicted in their hearts of all the sins they had done and and and and you know and then he's there she's there and he just asked Heroman where are your accusers and she says there's none Lord so she realized this is more than just a religious leader that she was brought in front of this was God himself and zakus had that same Revelation this is God lord I will give half my goods to the poor and if I've done anything wrong to anyone I will restore them fourfold amen see so so when when he came into the Lord's presence it changed him it changed them amen these Greeks had that same kind of Desire now we would all love to be 2,000 odd years ago when Jesus was walking here on the days of his flesh wouldn't we wouldn't that be amazing wouldn't it be amazing to be in the boat he calms the storm wouldn't it be amazing to see a multiply the multiply the bread wouldn't it be amazing to be by lazarus's tomb and he comes out 4 days later you all those that'd be incredible but do you know that we we actually are more blessed today because that was God with the people we need God with us but he never the Lord Jesus never intended us just to have him have him with us he wanted to be in us because in order to see Jesus you have to see more than just his natural form because remember the scribes and Pharisees they saw Jesus they saw him they saw him in their synagogue man with a withered hand he just say stretch it forth he was healed they saw him do many incredible things yet they hated him and they wanted to destroy him yeah they weren't really seeing Jesus though they saw Jesus you know what I mean they saw his natural form they heard the same words that everyone else heard but something in them could not uh surrender to him they did not have a pure heart because when the scribes and Pharisees it's amazing when you look at here's the Lord Of Glory who Moses prophesied of all the prophets prophesied of coming the one that gave the LA on M sin was now made flesh here he was revealing himself but yet they wanted to argue with him is it lawful to do this why don't your disciples why don't they wash their hands before they eat why don't they do this why you know all these little nitpicking nonsense things that they be so they wanted to see Jesus just to prove him wrong they wanted to see Jesus to justify their own life and condition you see and we never want to come to the Lord to try and justify our own condition we need a teachable spirit amen we need to be Lord you're right I'm wrong in other words Lord your word is right and I am wrong compared to your word Lord if I think I'm right and I think your word is wrong take that Spirit from me amen CU it's one big sign you've got the Holy Ghost is you realize the word is supreme and you need to change if you are contrary to that word amen because what that is the spirit of Truth coming in and revealing revealing himself to you amen amen so they had a so so zakus had a desire now we would love to be back there but really in truth it's actually more blessed to be in day right now hallelujah amen so we know he is though the same yesterday today and forever now just just bear with me you know I pray the Lord would just bless us in some way am me cuz I want to see Jesus I don't just want to see him sure you can go back years ago when you first met him and all those things those testimonies you should never lose sight of but I just don't want to see him then I want to see him every day I mean I want to continue walking with him remember this is a relationship remember this message came to restore a true spiritual relationship between God and man that's the purpose of the message that that's the main thing amen that God would dwell in man once again and God and man would walk together as one that's the whole purpose of it amen so you see God God does not change amen that's one thing he cannot do is change he can change his form but who he really is is still the same now we know that's one thing see see brother baham says an unchangeable God working in an unexpected unexpectable way stay with the word God is infinite God is the infinite one who cannot change he's unchangeable the unchangeable God the same one that fell on the day of Pentecost and filled all the house with a rushing Mighty Wind and clothing tongues of fire sat upon them they were all filled with the Holy Ghost that's the same God that we look to see today it depends what you're looking for the infinite God I am and I change not he doesn't change he can't change see everything he was back then he is the same today amen amen he hasn't changed one IOD to just his form because remember the next time the physical body of Jesus Christ touches the Earth is when he comes back for the Jews we meet him in the air amen we will physically meet the Lord in the air we will physically see him these bodies will change we be caught up with dead in Christ and we'll meet him in the air but the next time he physically stands upon the Earth is when he comes back for the juice amen so we got to realize now that his spirit is here now now if you really want to see Jesus today you've got to see him as his word hallelujah it's absolutely fundamental you see him as his word that you don't get caught up in an imaginary idea of like the chosen or some drama of Jesus right but you see him as his word those things have their place right but that's not that should never be your absolute amen but you've got to see him in his word because he is his word as it says in John in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God then verse 14 the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we behold his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen so he is still his word today amen he is not changed he is still and that it's so vitally important that we see him in his word now brother B says in this message to see Jesus he says and so that's the way it is tonight those who desire to see God must come with a perfect heart what is that per what is that Perfect Heart Lord I want to see you I want to have a meeting with you I want to see you for who you are with all strange feelings set aside with all malice towards your neighbor set aside with all malice towards other churches other individuals and forms of worship you must come with that perfect Hearts could I see you Lord Jesus now I'm going to take all my superstitions away I'm going to seek tonight to see the Lord Jesus now I hope that's your intention every one of you and I believe that if you come with that kind of an intention that God is under obligation to reveal himself to you do you believe that this morning morning I mean don't you believe that the God is under obligation to reveal himself to you here tonight and I think it's so important when we approach God in any day that we don't that we say Lord line me up with you I remember when the Lord started dealing with me I I see just Lord take everything out of my life that's contrary to your word that you can dwell in me I didn't know what to do what not to do I didn't have a church to go to I just have the message in the Bible but I let God because I wanted to see him I heard he's alive he's the same yesterday today and forever the tomb is empty so I can meet him that was that was just me I thought I can meet this Lord Jes I want to meet him right so so I said Lord you just changed me to line up with you see we don't want God to change to line up with us he'll never do it cuz he can't change right we need to be changed to line up with him and that's why if we're really pure in heart we'll say Lord change me whatever's in my life that stops you get it out of me Lord I open my life to you Lord Jesus your word promises that I can see you I can experience you I can know you in the power of your resurrection that when I read the book of Acts I can when I read Paul's writings how he's how he says he's been Afflicted but not cast down and all trouble and all these things his experiences that you can step into those words because you've experienced the same kind of things I mean you can relate to the Apostle Paul you can relate to those in the book of Acts because the same spirit that was in them is in you amen you've seen the same Miracles you've seen God's leadership the same way because that same spirit that was in them is in you amen I trust that's the you know the desire of our hearts that we would Lord I want to see you today amen see we got to I think we just got to go back to Lord I want to walk with you people go churches have go gone off on tangents people have gone off on tangents because they they they forget the main thing is to be identified with the word to walk with him in Simplicity amen that all that matters is Lord I live to live for you because of what you have done for me I'm not trying to earn anything I'm just so thankful you mean everything that's why I've been trying to just like preach on praise and different things if we just keep him the focus of Our Lives that no matter what goes on in life he will give us Grace to go through it you know I had a um you know the Bible says that old men will dream dreams in the end time I guess I'm old cuz I'm Dreaming again but you see I had a dream I had a couple this week but I'll I'll just share a bit of one maybe I'll share the bit of but anyway I had this dream where where where I was back in my old Primary School in gizman W Beach School best primary school I reckon ever the girls don't believe that but I'll take them there one day but it won't be how it was when I was there that was the Golden Era anyway we were there and you know I was I was I was going to start running around the track or running around the field I started going for a run and so it was a dream it wasn't a nightmare you know but you I was having a dream anyway so I started running and I actually caught up to was like middle of the day I know some kind of time and I and and I caught up to this other brother I thought man he must be able to just to run cuz he's been running for a long time and he's kind of kind of puffing away and you know I just kind of pass up to you pass by and make a joke and keep going and but I found myself running on my knees so I'm not on my feet I'm running on my knees but the thing is it was effortless I was like I was gliding along didn't feel any strain didn't feel any problems and it really shows if you want to run this Christian race you got to run it in prayerfully you got to you got to run it in prayer amen that's how you walk the Christian walk prayerfully amen cuz remember prayer Keeps Us in communion with God you say but I have the Holy Ghost you to stand communion with the Holy Ghost in you you can't wander off in your carnal desires you need God to guide you every day and the only way to do that is Lord because remember part of the Lord's Prayer is not my um my thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven what Earth is he talking about he's talking about us he's not just talking about this plan he's actually talking about you because remember the kingdom of God is within you right so he's saying May thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven so in other words Lord change my thinking that it matches your thinking change my desires that they are your desires change my will that it's your will that that's what prayer should be prayer should be praise as we talked about last Sunday but prayer should be a surrender Lord change me to match you Hallelujah that's what God's looking for see he's looking for character Lord and his character in a people amen so you know so I found that you was just I was on my knees but just it was like I was gliding along and then I actually you don't have a dog e you don't have a dog okay maybe this be no okay anyway I came up to Reuben found myself by Reuben's crying cuz his dog had just died you know maybe don't get a dog I don't know but this is just a dream now okay but but there's Ruben here's cry sad and and and who wouldn't be sad if their dog died you know and you but I was just consoling him you know just from the scripture just from the message you know brother Braham you know his horse and his dog R beyond the curtain of time all that ever loved you and you loved will be there and his horse and dog will be there so don't worry this is not the end you this like life remember this is just a small part compared to Eternity this is a blip on the radar not even that just this Earthly Journey you know we've got far more to enjoy and look forward to amen than just this waiting room or this developing room that we're in of character right so I was just consoling with those things and I kept running along and then there's some brothers there and you know and and I was talking about you know how would you know we often think about how we would um how would we we react if we were like Daniel and he knows that if he keeps pray is going to be thrown in a lion's den or how would we be if we're Shadrach mesach and Abednego and we know if we don't bow we're going to be thrown into the you know thrown to the furnace and you know how would we react when great great great trials and things come our way and I just said you know what God gives Grace for every time you know you don't need to really think about how you're going to be you just walk prayerfully with God and then when Trouble Comes Your Way God will anoint you in the trouble you know I don't know if David ever had dreams of killing Giants but he found himself fighting a giant you know and really no doubt when he would have looked back at that he you know naturally he would have thought man that was crazy here's this man who's 11 foot or whatever I'm just a little youth you know how on Earth did I naturally this was impossible but God anointed me in the trial who's ever had that kind of thing when you look back you thought man how did that ever happen and because God stepped on the scene took over your life and did what he wanted to do amen so you know I think we've got to run this race more prayerfully than ever and that just doesn't does mean you're on your knees in your closet but prayerfully going through the day amen I Love You Lord you're so wonderful Lord hallelujah you talk to him have a conversation as you're going through the day who does that Hallelujah I pray I do it more I want to do it more right but you just have that prayerful attitude then as you run this race it will become easier because it's not your strength it's his strength amen it's not your ability no it's his divine grace hallelujah amen so if you want to if you really want to see Jesus amen come prayerfully with to him hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord now he says now where were we yes that's the intention now that we want to God is uh under obligation to reveal himself to you I mean if you come with the right kind of intention now if you come with that intention tonight let's find out who Jesus of Nazareth is and if we find out what he was in days gone by then we'll know what he is today is that right we know that uh what he was in the days that was we know what he will be today now if we could imagine uh if we could have an image of seeing him in that day with somebody described him to us and he was a tall or thin man heavy man whatever it was we'd be looking at for that type of man but the Bible doesn't say that a stature he was there's no beauty of him that we would desire him I suppose he wasn't a great big handsome tall man because the scripture said there's no beauty that we would desire him well then if the scripture says that we couldn't look for that type of man but the scripture doesn't exactly give a statue but the scripture does reveal him what he is in his power and in his manifest manifestation what he is now if we can read in the scripture and find out what he was then why we know what he is now is that right whatever he was then he is yet tonight for the scripture says he's the same yesterday today and forever is that right amen so if we look into the word we can see who he really is now this is not an intellectual exercise right we're not doing a class project of trying to you know answer a test here but if we can see him in his word I mean then God see if God reveals to you the scripture then God will manifest that scripture in your life when it goes who's ever had the um experience you you can read the same chapter again and again and again but in that time of need you read that it jumps out it grips you who's had that kind of experience see you see that is now that's now you really seeing Jesus cuz you're seeing him in his word amen you're not looking for you know because he is his word that's how you see him is by seeing him in his word see the apostle Paul would say in 2 Corinthians he says he says wherefore henceforth we know no man after the flesh he says though you have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth now we know him no more so in other words you have known Christ after the flesh because remember when when Paul was writing these things many of the apostles were still alive many eyewitnesses were still alive but he saying you don't know him that way anymore you cannot know him after the flesh anymore but you know him how do you know him now by by Revelation amen by divine revelation that's why it's it would be incredible to to to have an eyewitness account but to to walk by Revelation is far more powerful I mean that's why the Apostle Paul you know he wasn't there when Jesus was in the days of his ministry that you know he wasn't a disciple then but he met him on the road to Damascus what God revealed he saw Jesus amen and then he saw him in his word the same could you imagine the same Scrolls that he would study from his youth you know the Old Testament you know he he would have stayed those back and forward and back and forward but then after he met the Lord on the road to Damascus it was like he was reading a new book amen hallelujah it was a totally different Isaiah was a totally different book amen Leviticus or Jeremiah or any of those books were totally different why because he saw Jesus now in his wordu amen he made him as the pillar of fire and because the but but then but then he saw him in his word amen and that's the most important thing that we know the Lord Jesus by divine revelation amen see when the word is revealed when a promise or a scripture is Made Alive to you it grips you and then then you'll see it come to pass amen and when you see that scripture come to pass you are seeing Jesus amen amen because he is his word made manifest he is his word living amen like when you see Jesus when when when he came after his temptation in the wilderness there he goes into the synagogue and he's pass the scroll of Isaiah to read and he reads the prophecy from Isaiah 61 he actually found that place in the book so so he opened the scroll until he found that portion of scripture he says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sight of the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and then he closed the book and he gave it to the minister and sat down and all the eyes of the people in the synagogue were fasted on him he said this day is this scripture fulfilled so in other words what you just see what you see in my life is a manifestation of that prophecy that it's no longer prophecy it's now reality amen that's why he said this day is this scripture fulfilled so now he was saying so so what he was saying is what you read about in Isaiah you're now seeing what is he he is the word made manifest amen so in other words what he just read he is living out in front of their eyes amen and so that was the people who could spiritually see could look past the man and see yes his life does fulfill that prophecy yes I've seen him Open the Eyes of the blind I've seen him loose the captives I've seen him comfort those I've seen them bind the Brokenhearted I've seen him do these things and those who could really see him who are looking at a pure in heart would say yes he is fulfilling that prophecy amen and it was the same today as it was then because Jesus Christ is still his word see that prophecy of Isaiah there that Jesus read you know that same anointing is here today I mean because Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever amen so see his anointing still heals the Brokenhearted amen he still preaches Deliverance to the captives am mean that's why we can say by the authority of God's word if you want to be free you can be free am mean cuz he's come to set the captives free I mean to set us free from mind battles complexes troubles unbelief whatever it is he's come to set the captives free and the recing of the sight the blind amen that is would be applied to our eyes spiritually that we could see him in his word am mean and set at Liberty them that are bruised amen the anointing of God that's why he said Lord I want to see you cuz when you see when you see him in his word then these promises can come alive you say I'm bruised in my spirit I've been hurt look at search for him in his word amen my heart is broken I've been hurt search for him in his word amen and he'll bring that healing virtue will come into you amen I you know I can't see lord I can't see you search for him in his word amen you may be walking in the worst fog you've ever walked in spiritually search for him in his word and he'll be a light to your path amen remember he has a lamp to our feet amen so if you search for him in his word he will guide you through those things amen praise the Lord isn't that right why because he is his word amen you see zakus wasn't looking at another religious man he was looking at God in flesh amen the Hallelujah it should be the same thing with you and I he saw the Prophecies of the Messiah living and it changed him amen those see it's the same thing today he is the same yesterday today and forever amen so when God in his infinite grace allows us to see him in his word the Bible becomes alive Hallelujah I trust I trust that's your heart's desire Lord I'm not a Christian because of an argument I'm not a Christian because it's a nice idea I'm a Christian because you've revealed Ral yourself in your word to me I mean you this this is no longer inkc on paper it's alive in my heart am mean The God Who wrote the Bible now lives in me and and makes this live amen amen see if you'll see him in his word in your and then the Y sorry if he reveals himself to you that his Word is Alive amen then that word that he quickens or reveals to you he will produce what it promised to do hallelujah it's like for example acts 238 if you can see the path of Salvation is to repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin then you'll receive the Holy Ghost sure as anything amen if it's Quicken to you it's not just going through a motion cuz someone told you to do it but if you really see this is the path of Salvation amen then God God will change your heart I remember when I first you know first was listening to the message and brother BR preaching on Redemption and completeness and en joy and you know the Seal of God and things I just been I was baptized when I was 18 that's all I knew to do is Quicken to me that I need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and I was a sinner I was making home brew and I was gaming and doing all kinds of things I but but I opened my Bible to Acts chapter 2 I said Lord I don't know what repentance is he said if I repent and baptized this way I've been baptized right I don't know what repentance is but you said if I repent and be baptized you'll give me the Holy Ghost so show me what repentances Lord I don't know Hallelujah and he did he did why you just come you say Lord I need to know you well see seek for him in his word um I may be a broken record but you know I think it's very important you know there's all kind of self-help all kinds of ideas all kind of recommendations all kind of advice why don't we go to the great Fountain of true advice why don't we go to the counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father well how do you do that in prayer in his word say Lord reveal me in here and Reveal Your your show me amen there's got to be see you'll find a Bible character in your situation God will lead you to someone you may someone in Kings or second I don't know somewhere but you'll be reading it and the Lord will say this is you amen and you'll see what they did you do the same thing and you'll get out he'll guide you through the trial amen amen hallelujah amen it's like if you you know you know if the Lord reveals to you that brother Brand's Ministry is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 uh uh 45 and 6 AM mean and you see yourself from that promise what is that promise behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and she he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children of the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse I but but but if God reveals himself in that scripture and puts you in that scripture he will turn your heart right back to original faith in the word again amen that's right amen where you'll have a genuine faith that the Bible is the word of God and it is all true amen so that's why it's so important that we come to God with a pure heart amen amen now zakus as I said soorry if I feel like I'm going around the Miller bit but I said zakus means pure but he wasn't that way before he met the Lord now it's very so I doubt very much that zakus had any kind of Integrity pulling Shady deals to you know feather's Nest you see we have to have integrity in this day amen amen now Integrity is a a a firm adherence to a code of especially moral or uh artistic values I mean it's an unimpaired Condition it's a quality or state of being complete or undivided now Webster would say the true meaning of integrity it ties in with honesty Integrity implies trustworthiness and incorruptibility uh to a degree that one is incapable of being false to a trust responsibility or pledge uh Pardon Me Property it implies tried and proven honesty or Integrity see real Integrity is shown when no one else is around amen that you can be true and honest with Integrity if you're in a crowd or you by yourself and no one will know about it you see Integrity the Integrity it says in Proverbs 11 the Integrity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of transgress shall destroy them says in Proverbs 191 better is the poor that walketh in his Integrity than he that is perverse in his lips and is a full Proverbs 207 the just man walketh in his Integrity his children are blessed after him amen so if you want children to be blessed walk in your integrity amen amen you see before before zakus met the Lord his attitude towards God was bad because brother Braham says that he says the way I treat you that's my attit ude towards God so so his attitude towards people was was selfish it was wrong ien but but but then when he came to the presence of the Lord his attitude came right why because his attitude towards God was right Amen brother bramwood would would tell us that you know if there's ever someone that's going to be a real Christian let's be one of them that people who will never read a Bible will look at your life and say that's a real Christian walking down the street amen be a um yeah be be a real Christian now the reason I say these things about zakus is because that's the things he said when he came down and saw the Lord that half of my goods I'll give to the poor and if I take anything from any man by false accusation I will restore him fourfold so obviously that's he had done all those things but when he saw Jesus for who he really was it changed him amen he didn't see a religion in front of him he saw God in flesh amen now now it's it's kind of funny well unusual when you think about just the the face Valley of it when when when the Greeks desired to see Jesus and then finally they're in the presence of this one that they had heard so much about remember John chapter 12 is obviously just after John chapter 11 John chapter 11 um Lazarus comes out of the Grave a man had been in the dead for 4 days had come back to life corruption had you know his body had been restored he'd come back so there's a lot going on Amen and and these Greeks were come up to Jerusalem for the Feast of Passover and they had a desire that that they would see the Lord so finally there in front of him but then the Lord makes a statement verely verely i s you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit and he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal now that hating his life in this world doesn't mean that you hate your life and life is dumb and I hate being alive and you know like a depressed way that's not what he's saying about he's he's saying that he's saying that compared to eternal life compared to Walking with God your life is secondary right you don't love this world's vain riches and things more than loving the Lord amen but he's saying that a corn of wheat had to fall into a ground and die he's basically saying to the Greeks this is how you really see me see you have come to see me but this is how you really see me if you go through a death burial and a resurrection because a corn of wheat falls to the ground so it dies but then comes forth so it dies it goes into the ground the seed does but it comes forth in the springtime brings forth much fruit fruits was that a death a burial and a resurrection amen and that's the only way that when you that's the only way you'll really see him as when you die I'm not talking about naturally of course we'll see everyone will see him one day right because every knee will bow and and and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord right but the only way but we want to see him now we need to see him now not just then it's too late now some people say well I'll I'll I'll I'll sort it out with the big man when I get upstairs no you got to sort it out downstairs you got to sort it out downstairs first that's why he died on Calvary if you to be ready now right because it's too late upstairs it's done amen Mercy's now not up there right amen so that's why yeah let's let's get our accounts cleared amen amen the only thing that's written and read on our account is pardoned by the blood of Jesus Christ amen see you see you'll see him when you die when you come to Calvary and are crucified to yourself then you'll see Jesus we would see him see that's the but but you see the thing is many people they try to hold on to some Creed or trying to you know obey some rituals and I say even even as message people people are very quick to just hold on to being part of the group you know I had another dream I wasn't going to tell it but I'll tell it I was at a youth camp but it wasn't a youth camp but it was a youth camp wasn't you know and there were and then everyone was standing in a circle I was one of the Campers or a helper I don't know but I was there and and and everyone was standing in a big circle and brother Tim PR was preaching and he was preaching about how how we must receive our full inheritance amen we can't just be justified by faith or even just Sanctified but we've got to receive the fullness of the Holy Ghost more than anointed but God's going to come and dwell in your soul and change your life that's how you really see Jesus you get him on the inside you'll see him on the outside you'll see him in nature you'll see him everywhere but you got to get your full inheritance see Jesus died that he had dwell in you once again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he'll change your nature that's your full inheritance cuz every promise lays in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he's there but strange thing is is that everyone else wasn't really you know and he was saying who will come Stand By Me and receive their full inheritance and he had kind of cuz he' preach back and forth but the circle would move and there'd always be a gap between him and the campers so when he'd move this way the people the young people would move this way and we' move this way you know n none of them wanted to stand next to him and yeah and and I thought this is ridiculous I want my full inheritance you know so I went up to him and he had these like an armband it's just a representation just a teaching thing because you got to have a token right and the token is the Holy Ghost but you know but no one would come receive I said I want it and he and he and he put that band around my arm cuz I want my full inheritance right so I don't just want to be part of the group I want really Why We Gather amen and then and then there were all these young people there that playing all these instruments and there was and there was one particular person there W say who but but their but their instrument matched their outfit the color of their outfit was the color of their instrument and they're trying so hard to be noticed and I thought it's fine to want to be noticed but who do you want to notice you really shouldn't be our you know our faith saying Lord here I am Notice Me Lord this is why I'm here not to be part of the group not try and be popular but I want to be one with you Lord Jesus see but you see the thing is this is why we want to see Jesus we want our full inheritance amen that God would come and dwell in US you say I've been in the message for years some some people have been in the message for years but they don't know him see and this is the biggest danger we can be part of a group and just be blessed and have a happy time but not see him in our lives not see him change us amen not see him change our Natures that when we look back we say Lord you have made me more like you whatever I've been through Lord I'm more like you now than I was then sure I've had troubles and scars and hurts and pains but I've been I've been through things but Lord I'm more like you I'm more like your word Lord I see the fruits of the spirit I see a joy I see a teachable spirit see that's the big difference between the spirit of ear and the spirit of Truth the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Truth and if you really want to see him that Spirit of Truth truth will come into you and you'll be teachable to his word right see a person can have the spirit of error but they won't come subject to the word of God Amen but see this is should be our big desire Lord I want every promise you have for me amen I want to see you in every promise I don't just want to see you as being forgiven that's wonderful you we've all got to know that we're forgiven we've all got to know that his blood was shed for you and I it's not just a Sunday School Story it's not just an Easter season it's a reality amen with the blood of Jesus Christ becomes a reality amen so you see him there that's wonderful then you see him cleanse your life that's wonderful but Lord I want to see you more than that I want to see you living my life Lord that my nature is not my natural family nature sure we have a temperament we have a certain nature about us that God doesn't necessarily change but we want to be different to our family strain we want to be different Amen to to to our sisters or to our brothers maybe who are unsaved whatever Lord change our nature that it matches your nature Lord Lord I want you so much on the inside you know like brother Bram tells a story of that boy who was at Sunday school and I trust our kids are like this he goes to a he just had his eye I want to see God so he goes to his mother mama I want to see Jesus and she just maybe Wasing dishes feels embarrassed doesn't know how to answer the question CU you know some questions can be real curveballs from our par our children but they should never be right they should don't don't be afraid to answer anything give them the right answer but you know the right age appropriateness but don't be afraid anyway maybe she was scrubbing dishes but you she said well ask your Sunday school teacher Tred to just pass the question away and you know so so he goes to a Sunday school teacher I want to see Jesus and then the Sunday school teacher says oh go ask the pastor about that goes to the pastor oh I want to see Jesus and maybe the pastor says well you just believe by faith and he's around you and you know but there's no reality to it but then he's out fishing with an old man and and and and and there was rain in it cleared and there was a rainbow formed there over the river and then the young boy just just just watching the old man he's rowing the boat and he sees tears just coming down his face and then the young boy goes to him and says I I want to see Jesus I want to see Jesus Lord and then the old man said you know what son about 50 years ago I met him and now when I everywhere I see I see Jesus amen I see him everywhere you see you get him on the inside you see him everywhere you'll see him in his creation you'll see him in his word amen you'll see him in the message you'll see him in yourself amen you'll see him in your brother and sister amen you'll see him everywhere amen because remember when we come into His presence the same things he did back then he'll do today hallelujah amen so he will still heal he will still deliver he will convict people of sin amen he will set the captives free amen the love of God will be shed abroad in our hearts amen when we when we really when he when we really come into His presence amen God will do what he wants to do hallelujah amen blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God that's why we've got to come to God with a pure heart amen amen see what kind of if we've seen him I believe I've seen him I trust you've seen him too and you continue to see him and amen what kind of atmosphere should we carry we should carry his atmosphere what type of an atmosphere brother said should we live in in a consoling soothing healing atmosphere we should live in with our hearts constantly in prayer with a deep love for every person we come in contact with that should be us amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord now we must come to the Lord with a pure heart but we can see him he's still alive today maybe I'm just going to wrap up there because I got a whole another thought but I'll just maybe leave it alone actually I'll just mention it real quick don't let anything rob you from seeing him don't let anything rob you don't let tradition see people say the days of Miracles has passed God don't move anymore we can't have Revival anymore we're in 2024 you know God only was here when the prophet was here the pillar of fire isn't here anymore those things are lies that's right oh you can't really have a book of Acts experience that's a lie oh you can't you just got to work through your problem that eventually you'll get over it no God can deliver like this amen sure there's counseling and things but the conclusion of counseling should be prayer and God coming down and sitting the setting someone free oh no no God doesn't do that anymore derer is a thing you know God you know we just yeah yeah brother Braham yeah God was there but he's not here anymore you know what that is brother brah Likens it to a beaver we don't have beavers in this country but beavers build dams right they will cut down certain trees and logs and it's very methodical they know what they're doing they'll cut down certain trees certain saplings different things and they'll try and they'll try and Dam a a creek or a river whatever it is cuz they want to live in that damn and you see this is what the enemy will try and do is he'll he'll try and cut down hurts and pains and resentment and misunderstandings and you'll try and get that to come into your life and build a dam yeah that we come into because a beaver builds a dam because it's a place of safety it's a place of protection it's a safe place in the Beaver Dam Predators can't get in there the elements can't get in it's safe and the devil wants us to get into a place where we just live in a safety zone like Brother Andy was preaching about right but you see now we can't let the devil make us into a dam where we can't see Jesus amen well we've got to be willing to say Lord cut all those things out of my life Lord am me because we don't have we don't have Beaver preachers today that build up dams and say You' going to live with that problem that's just how things have got to be and you know the waters can't flow anymore God doesn't live that way anymore you see because if anyone does that to you they're like the scribes and Pharisees saying basically you can't see Jesus you can't experience him the same his word isn't true anymore that's a beaver that's a beaver now in some environments they're reintroducing beavers C the environment needs it but spiritually we don't need beavers we don't need Beaver spirits to come in they've going to be blown out of the water you to blow up a damn amen because remember beavers don't make dams by accident they are methodical and so the enemy will search for logs of unforgiveness misunderstanding resentment anxiety fear disappointment selfish motives and they'll try and build a damn in your spirit that you can't see Jesus anymore but I tell you friends God is here to bust every Beaver Dam am mean he's here there is still a bom and Gilead amen we can still Touch the Hem of His Garment by faith and be made whole amen there is still healing virtue from Calvary there's salvation the pool of Salvation the fountain from emanuel's veins is flowing deep and wide amen God can still do the exceeding abundantly we can still see Jesus in his word his promises are just as true today as they were when they first spoken or written down amen so we can live in a way that the Waters of life always flow yep hallelujah amen that we you know you say well can I still see him is this just a bunch of words no I tell you I'm going to finish with this you go to God with a with a sincere heart Hallelujah right you go them with a pure heart say Lord this man just stood here this morning says I can see you I want to see you Lord I want to see you and if you're really not with a skeptical mind with a pure heart really wanting to know he'll show himself to you Hallelujah if you go with this why I always encourage people read your Bible and pray listen to the message get into that word and let it change you and mold you amen let him speak to you he wants a relationship see the Greek's desire was because Jesus had a desire to meet those Greeks zakus had the desire to see Jesus for who he was cuz God put that desire in his heart right he didn't go under that tree haply he knew zakus was there and he knows what tree you're hiding in this morning amen if you're hiding in a tree trying to see who Jesus really is come down come down say Lord here I AMU Lord come into my house Lord have fellowship with me Lord am see zakus maybe he left with a stirred up critical nature that morning but he came home that afternoon happy the Master's coming to our house amen Rebecca this is this is this is the one you've been telling me about I've seen him for who he is am mean he knew me my he knew me by name and he wants to come in and fellowship with me and that's why it speaks about this age If any man hear my voice let him open the door I'll come in and he'll s with me and I with him amen so hear his voice today that's why listen to the word come open the door of your heart let him come in and you'll see him aren't you glad you can see him today and you glad it's not arguments we live by
