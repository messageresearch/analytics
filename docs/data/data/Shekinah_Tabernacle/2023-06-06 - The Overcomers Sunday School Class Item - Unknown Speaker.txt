========================================

foreign good morning I'm Jehoshaphat king of Judah as you all know three enemy Nations the mobites amunites and the menu Knights recently joined forces to attack our nation and in response I commanded the army of Judah to confront their combined armies in the desert rule the reason I call this press conference is to announce the result of that confrontation two words we won your majesty do you have the casualty figures from both sides yes every single soldier from all three enemies died there was not one single Survivor and the casualties from the Emmy of Judah zero are you saying that none of us soldiers were killed not one how many wounded none are you saying that every one of our soldiers came out of the battle against three armies without a scratch well there are a few complaints about straight backs why the strained Backs from spending three days carrying out all the enemies weapons and supplies after the war was over it took your army three days to carry away all the spores of the war ning but it was three armies and they were all heavily armored your army Masters your army must have employed a secret weapon in this battle actually we had four secret weapons but one of those weapons include the new catapults invented by the Europeans I'm sorry I don't know what a catapult is it was an intercontinental ballistic missile that did it wasn't it never heard of it did you hire a Persian malicious destroy or people not one enemies not one Persian militia well what's he get weapons did you use first we fasted you say you fasted you stopped eating yes I will think that depriving your men of food will have the opposite effect we didn't fasten the day of battle we fasted before we win before the Lord got in prayer what good did that do by fasting we consecrated our bodies to the Lord and our minds became clear so we could hear the direction of God but these amazing attacks Judah before Israel had a confrontation with these same three nations joined the Exodus during the days of Moses let's get back to the secret weapons besides fasting what secret weapons did your army employ well of course we prayed and asked God for God for a victory no I'm talking about secret weapons make no mistake about it fasting a prayer are secret weapons okay let me put it in another way other than fasting and prayer what secret weapons that you use we humbled ourselves and magnified the Lord and he came down and spoke amongst us he spoke amongst you I will I will remind you that we are God's chosen people without side we don't stand a chance so without God bringing Vision through the word of his Prophet we were not a good chance we believed his profit and prospered because of it what was the word that God gave you jezeal the son of Zechariah the prophet told us that our prayers and repentance were received by the Lord and the battle against the three combined armies were now in God's own hand and we only need the standstill and see our salvation let's get back to the secret weapons besides fasting prayer and worshiping the Lord what secret weapons did your army employ we sang I'm sorry could you repeat that we sang well what kind of song did you sing give thanks unto Lord for his Mercy endures forever and as we sang God's ambushment against the enemy so all four of your secret weapons were not weapons at all I beg you pardon though all the weapons of the army that Judah needed to defeat these three armies can we talk about the weapons and tactics how did you kill all those soldiers we didn't you didn't not um as no we didn't but they are dead as did as Egyptian Army who drowned in the Red Sea but your army didn't kill any of them not one how did they die then he God did it he's our ultimate secret weapon do you have any idea how he killed all those soldiers he turned them against each other though they were all dead when we arrived all we had to do is collect The Spoils of War and you credit this the Lord listen I want you to write this down you're gonna hear this repeated over and over again for thousands of years in the future if God is for us who can be against us what would your advice be for someone who is facing a similar
