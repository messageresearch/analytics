errors and we ask you to have mercy father for you are a perfect and a pure God you ask these things further tonight committing them into your hands in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen God bless you believers I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen I greet you all once again tonight in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah that sounded much better or did you need me to did you want me to smile first to break to break the ice huh so let us open our Bibles while we stand thank you so much brothers and sisters for the music we thank the Lord for healing brother Jimmy and then he can play Hallelujah he says saving God he's a healing God what Miracle do you want what other Miracle do we want tell if you just tell him then okay Lord I want you to create another earth that is a miracle the Lord healed our brother so that he can play for the Lord amen while we're standing we are going to read a we are going to read Malachi is that the one chapter three verse 6. Malachi chapter 3 verse 6. tonight is a prayer meeting so I like how brother Ed puts it it will just be a seminate tonight I'll try to make it a Sim on it because I didn't prepare a lot but it's all going to depend on the Lord how he directs you and me let's read that scripture so that we can see that for I am the Lord I change not therefore ye sons of Jacobs are not consumed the key the key sentence or verse that I would like us to focus on there is the one that says I change not for I am the Lord your God I change not right and the subject let's enjoy the comfort of our seat please sorry don't want to be like brother Dave okay and he forgot to tell people to sit down because it's not an easy thing to stand before the Believers and speak about things that can put you in big trouble to stand before people and talk you've got to be able to be sure that you put yourself away in a fight and not bring preconceived ideas and just speak the word and be available and then you'll be available I am available then the Lord will do the rest of the work amen are you coming without any preconceived so am I tonight Hallelujah so tonight we are going to speak about a little not little but we'll speak about this subject and changing God but now this unchanging God we want to look at him from the ankle of him changing my life into a into his divine nature remember God does not change we read it we read that God is an unchanging God many things change I don't know about you but for me sister Deb I don't want to depend on something that changes I don't know much about you but can you can you really depend on something that changes I I don't want to depend on or to rely on something that changes because something that changes tomorrow it will change sorry I'll be sipping sipping this medicine this is hot water lemon and and a baptism of honey I found two lovely sisters there in the kitchen by Sister Joe and they made me this concoction I just found them at the right time and they were my two nurses and I'm not sick I just happened to get some allergy and then I reacted so my chest is a bit misbehaving playing up so the Two Sisters God bless you Sister person line sister Jenny they made it they stopped everything they were doing to to look after me so please don't mind I hope you don't mind it I'll be sipping this water instead of brother Cuban's one but thanks brother and God bless you my precious brother right let's come back this God who does not change is something or is someone that we must depend upon why because he's an unchanging God the prophet says okay let's let before we go to the prophet let's go to uh yeah let's go to Second Peter let's go to Second Peter chapter one it's a bit long and today we may not have time to go around I know I owe the children I owe you I know but we will do it some other time eh and and give you a chance to read but tonight let's just read it to save time so that we can just be together and just enjoy this sermon it's a very long sermon but the prophet took so long preaching that message I took it from the stage of the perfect man and also the one of the unchangeable God those two sermons if you read them they are very long and it's a study the other one the stage of a perfect man I wanted to talk about the stature of a perfect God and for us to see because that's what was what we want to be actually he wants to make a stage of a perfect man in us because he's he's got a Stager he's a perfect God he's got a certain stage and he wants to bring us so that's what I wanted to talk about so we'll we'll touch a bit more into it into it tonight and let's read that second Peter who can see it second Peter Simon Peter VII and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through righteous righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ I just underline to them who who's them is you and me writing to you and me this gospel this chapter is writing to you listen to to what he's saying to to them who have obtained do you know what is to obtain to obtain is to get when I say you you have obtained a good report or you have obtained the ownership of this mic it means that this mic belongs to you you you got the full ownership and unconditional you have obtained the permission to own this mic from the Sounders they gave it to you you have obtained a payment no one will take it from you because you have obtained their ownership we can use it you can borrow us you can do what you want but when you come and take your mic it's yours because you got the ownership you have obtained the payment the ownership of it is yours so what is saying that to them that have obtained like Precious faith you have already obtained it you with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ Our Lord according to his divine power everything about him about him is divine his divine power have given the divine power have given unto us all things all a-l-l amen all he has given who let's be together talk to me he has given us me and you he has given us right what did he give us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness man this is deep through the knowledge through the knowledge right sorry I should be reading from the Bible my slide I know it misbehaves okay I've got it underlined according to his divine power had given unto us all that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us unto glory and virtue right to us he has given us all pertaining life and just just absorb it well the prophet when he reads this spoken word I mean this this he says let me pause here I want it to soak in real deep I want you to hear it well the meaning of this is something that you must understand and hear what it means it must so you know when you soak something on my on my washing machine there's a button you press there and it says soak if you press that one you must know you're going to wait three hours the moment you press that because the machine is going to soak that thing that you are washing and it's gonna wash it thoroughly so so I understand this verse to soak in what he say that he has given you all all you have been given Hallelujah now let's jump quickly to verse 4. whereby I give an unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this listen to this that by this by this you must be partakers of the divine nature so this is heavy brothers and sisters this is not light this is not like when I say hey Andy let me take you out for let's go buy beggars this is not that this is deep it means you are Kings and Queens have you ever seen a king a king and a queen who hasn't realized or don't don't have the revelation of who they are they'll misuse that will use it in a wrong way sister known because they haven't received they haven't they are kings and queens yes they are born and they've got a title but they haven't realized who they are then they live regularly they do as as as no King will behave they behave that way because the heaven so you have been given that to be partakers a partaker is someone who is a participant someone who is part of of what particles of what of the divine nature of God remember we are we here on this Earth we are born in a different nature I forgot to to greet the people in video land that may the Lord bless them and the Holy Spirit just speak to them also and that you might be partakers of the divine nature having the the divine nature of who of God that you can be part that Divine Nation your nature can change and you have a divine nature of God we are getting somewhere you'll see where I'm getting having escaped the corruption that is in the world not having preparing to escape not going to escape having escaped already so it sounds to me Oppa that everything it sounds like is a done dealer it sounds to me that whatever happens doesn't matter whatever the devil can try to do is not an issue anymore because I am already given a a a some approval to be an old I've already obtained I have already a partaker I have already been given heavy I've already escaped you'll see as we go along and beside this giving all now now listen to this now we have escaped the corruption that this world that in this world through lust you see the corruption of this world it's got its own lustful spirits and an enticing Spirits they are there whoever you have already escaped them don't listen to the devil accusing you and blaming you have already escaped so don't take you know I hear people saying I don't take a no for an answer you know that statement brother When someone tells you I don't take a no so so what answer must I give you now if if the true answer is no what what must I tell you because the answer is no what am I I take no for an answer that's what my wife does with the boys she wants an answer but but I mean she's giving them an answer but only one answer so if you hear someone asking you sister and I say telling you something and telling you something and say oh am I right or am I right what do you say you say yes you are right isn't it because because he's not giving you any option am I right or am I right you are right right so so here that the devil must not intimidate you I want to awaken you to know that you are partakers of the divine nature and it's not something that you have done it's not something that you have qualified it's not something that we can credit to you is something that you must know and have a true revelation of his of of what is it then everything is behind you yes things will happen in your life but you are already a partaker of the divine nature of God and verse 5 it says and beside this giving all diligence now these are the vishus these vesus is a long sermon if we can start off the stage of a perfectness but you know them it says beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to your knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godiness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity which is love this is a sermon but but package alone just this verse is a full two-hour sermon alone we will talk about this some other time or we'll pass it through the end to preach it this one is a powerful sermon about the stage of a perfect man but I want to show you something for for if these things be in you that we have just read now if they be in you and abound they make you that he shall neither be barren no unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ do you know when we say someone is barren if if a tree is Barren which means Tiana it cannot give us fruits that sea can't give us fruits my girl it's like that one that the Lord cursed he didn't have truth what's the use of it see if he's not giving giving us any fruits we must cut it we are feeding it with manure we is taking space in our yard wind tight brings their leaves and everything but no fruits why why do we have that kind of a fruit and we call it it's a palm tree this is a plum tree you must prune it in Spring Water it it looks beautiful but fruits no fruits where's the fruits the Lord's cursed it if you find that there's a little type of a branch in your life that doesn't want to bring fruits what must you do to it pruning not cut it too deep too too help yourself just prune it to the devil it goes to the fire springtime then you will see fruits and flowers will come ah time for pruning that's where we are now so if you have this virtues that I've read you will neither be Barren you'll be fruitful you will never be Barren nor unfaithful right unfruitful sorry with the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but but listen to this man but he that lacketh these things this is very serious he that lucky these things blind and cannot see a far off do you know Isaac and the Bible says he he saw her from afar or as he was walking in going to meet her Elias I was bringing him and he saw them afar off so if you don't have these things you can't see your Isaac you can't see no you you only see here you think you can see far the devil deceives you that you can see far because of these eyes but you do not see Alpha not seeing a far off it means not seeing Beyond this flesh amen are we together tonight I'm not I'm trying not to preach just to go slow and teach and then we will finish I promise you we want to see Alpha off isn't it Josh we want to be able to see beyond the so-called enemy the so-called bully we want to see beyond the so-called economy of this world we want to see beyond are far off if you can only see this world up to this world then your your what do you call it your daily limit is too too small it must be increased do you know a daily limit how many of you know a daily limit sorry excuse me a daily limit and a monthly limit you children who don't know because I know if any is going to ask me is when you've got a bank card and you've got money in there the bank keeps your money they give you a limit of how much you can use or withdraw a day in a month your money imagine your money and a monthly and a daily limit so a child of God you you've got a card that has got no daily limit your check is already signed yes stamped it's only for you to write an amount I like that you might imagine if you find a husband like that and it is our husband we found him we found him we found a husband who says honey man I love I love this husband he says hey and he looks at you how are you today you say fine are you sure the check is already prepared it's not taken from the checkbook and still right no no he was thinking about you all the cross of Calvary was busy thinking about you suffering has been writing a check for you writing it and suffering anyway they were doing all sorts of things I can see him they take him along the Villa De la Rosa Road they take him there and he's pulling that he was thinking about and then busy writing a check huh and he came down he came down and brother Brendan brought him and told him about me this Isaac and then when he meet me thank you it gives you the check is that a 10 to you my love the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ to you there's a place there on the check is called some they said it's not one line it's two lies you know why it's two lines heaps of money so that line is the only line on the checkbook those who knows what the checkbook is that has got two lines or three maybe because there's people who are trillionaires there's people I've learned this week that that they say there's a a million that that is called what what did we call it reptilian huh what was it huh just speak louder you are more than sectillions you the more than sectillionaires the economy of this world the GDP of the entire world the economy of the entire world is not more than 3 trillion the GDP of all countries rich and poor together is not more than 5 trillion US dollars is less than that now you are that trillion until they just say is that what that one greatly gladly but the number is so huge you can't count heaven and finish it that's what we you are not counted even according to the value of this world yo the moment you think about your you the bride and you associate you with the economy of this world that's too cheap it's too cheap to compare yourself and what you are worth with the economy of this world but yet you live here and yet the world does not know who the Arabian shoulders with ah this is not to make you proud I'm just trying to conscientize you to realize who you that your economy there's no expression to write it and what you are worth tonight that is why it's important for me and for you to know who we are and to understand the contents of this book and the mean and what it means to me and to you and why God speak the way he speaks to us nothing will ever disturb us but I want us to to understand that if we don't have those things if we lack the Bible does not even say if you don't have them it says if you lack but he that lacks because there's people who has these things but they don't know God there's people who are who are knowledgeable man they know Theology and about God the mother even the Devil Himself he knows the scriptures so powerfully AMA the devil imagine devil no scriptures more than a Believer so there's people who are so humble so nice people you think you can just take them and just plug them in heaven they are so nice people but but but but but they are not these ones that God is talking about so why me do you realize now who you actually are do you realize what you are worth huh so now let's look at it like this now wherefore okay let me read that verse again but he that like these things is blind and cannot see afar off and had forgotten that he was passed from his old sins who don't want to forget Lord we really don't want to forget we are still reading Peter we are finishing it now wherefore the Radha Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election to make your calling and your election what make sure every day when you wake up one of your main missions is to be make your election sure to make sure that Lord today I want to get closer to you thank you Lord then the rest of the other programs can come afterwards but every day Lord make me to be aware of who I am today every day right let's leave Peter let's jump to this prayer that blessed me so much that brother Brandon prayed he said just a moment for prayer our heavenly father it is a grain a grand privilege listen to listen to the attitude of the Prophet praying to God he says our heavenly father it is a grand you know something that is Grand where we come there in our country even though I always give examples about South Africa when a young man gives another one says hey how's it brother can tell you he say how's it say a grand you responded Grand meaning shop meaning cool I'm all right grand grand it means that now the prophet is addressing God like this he says it is a grand privilege that we have we that we have took what the prophet speaks English here that we have to coming into presence into presence in this attitude of worship and praise to thee that's a statement we are coming to you it is a grand privilege for us to be in your presence Lord and then we are coming here with a heart and into your presence and in this attitude of worship and praise and and and know that we can call thee our father just the knowledge of knowing that we can call you our father you will see why I'm reading this prayer right you will see it just now and being being Bond of thy spirit we are thy children he's addressing God and with the privilege of asking that we will a privilege of asking anything that you will and and faith will bring it to pass we thank thee for this he's telling God we thank thee this man is addressing God Almighty the creator of heaven and earth when you address a king you don't just talk you talk with hearing yourself what you are saying when we pray we shouldn't be hasty hasty we shouldn't we must address God because we are addressing a king when you when you go to right now they take you there too let's let's leave England for today and they take you there too which countries are the key or let's say they take you to United Arab Emirates one of the Army is the Emirates and you go to the Sheikh the king of Dubai they say you are going to meet him or you go to Spain Spain there's Kings and you go there and you are meeting a king royalty they even train you how you're going to talk they tell you what you're going to say how you're going how you're going to walk and when the king passes what you are going to do right and and recite must you be and we said your wife must be sister brother they train you and because they say it's a privilege go and meet have a have a privilege of sitting with the King if you go to Nigeria there's Kings there is Kings when you go to the king you don't just go by yourself and walk no no there are processes and and the people who must go in there for you in our culture with this there's different levels of seniority protocol hey but our King has given us no protocol except his weight you and me can have full access to go and meet him and be addressed by the key so how should we be addressing him in our private space in our family prayer in our devotion prayer in our whatever our daily way of living how should we be addressing him we should be doing things that brings honor to the king are we together because he's the king that's why the prophet is addressing him like this he said most holy and righteous God we would ask tonight that you'd you'd speak to those Lord who are needy those that need salvation of their souls and for those that are sick in in a disparate conditions to the shut-ins Lord the shut-ins those are you know those that are in the hospitals and are they are hospitalized and cannot get to the meeting oh thou great I am it's like a poem it's like he's giving it's like he's enjoying to talk to address the king he's telling God who he is do you think God can answer him in the middle of the of the other places he said oh thou Great I Am I just love this kind of a prayer and go to their bed size tonight and touch their sick bodies that they might be able to come from the hospitals to safety forgive us of our sins we as we forgive those that sin against us that we might we might have thy favor in in our midst tonight and speak to us through thy weight thy ways is the truth make it known unto us Lord make thy way to live among us for we ask in the name of thy child to the Lord Jesus Christ I just when I when when you pray like this the Lord immediately says Gabriel don't worry don't worry Gabriel I I'm going to personally answer imagine after you go in that royalty many of us let's say Shekinah have gone to meet King Charles or let's say King Charles has come to visit us here I can tell you if King Charles come here I don't know about you but I know what is the person that will do [Laughter] sorry sorry Mama but what I'm trying to say if King Charles can come here they say one brother Ben and brother Pedro comes back on the 25th of April is announced and the past and the deacons come and stand here and they announced that we are having a visit of King King Charles will be in New Zealand and on the Sunday morning he'll be coming to Shekinah Tabernacle my brother I don't know what suit brother is going away I don't know assistant I don't know I don't know which one which shoes my wife will buy me I don't know what dresses the sisters will go and buy and I don't know how to send the sound desk will look If Prince not Prince King Charles a man who is going to die who does not even know when he's going to die I don't know what Bella will look like what dress I don't but I can only imagine that it will be fantastic we can we will even change the entrance I don't know how to tell you but if the kid comes here the king from this Earth now if the king says to Gabriel Gabriel all the Angels wait my son my daughter is addressing me wait I'm going to meet her tonight at her house I'm going to go there personally and I'll make sure that she dreams about me that she's healed that she's protected that she's comforted as brother Isaac was telling me ah that she's healed and I reassure my daughter how will you feel about that his mind blowing hey yeah it's mind-blowing that the mind can contain it so I was just so blessed by this kind of a prayer I wanted to put it at the beginning after I read this but I said let me make it part of the same one and it can just encourage us how we address this King don't address the king sleeping hey and you're talking to the king it is better for you my brother to sleep and then wake up fresh and talk to the king because if King Charles come here and the king of Spain come here man we will do Miracles eh only now I'm studying my introduction ok this verse that we've read in Malachi chapter three it is a verse that come that comes after this verse of verse 5. God sounded angry he sounded upset you know when you address your son David you will see one day when you address your son that you love so much that you can die for and he's doing maybe something let's not say stupid just something silly or something that annoys you know some people can say ha this guy no no no no they don't know what is inside you what what that boy means to you they don't know but this verse that we've read that that God reminded them that I am the Lord and I change not it was before it was before this verse I mean it was it came after this verse this one says and I will come near to you to judgment and I will be swift witness against the sorcerers and you know what is a sorcerer I think your sorcerer is close to a wheelchair in in my old English Shakespeare in English we call it a suit say you know it's a suit Sayer sorceras people who do so sorry and against adulterers an evil spirit is that one and we must condemn it and against false swears and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the Widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right and not man God sounds like if he come across those ones he's reminding us that hey time changes right time changes people change it changes change or changes change weather change economies change everything changed only him he doesn't change and he wants to take you and make you to be unchangeable he wants to make you like him me and you Debbie God wants to make us unchangeable he doesn't want us to be affected by weather by economy by moods by anger by money by jobs by Shoes by what what by cars but everything he doesn't want us to those things to affect us he does not even want us to be affected by brother and Paul's weakness or whatever is talking in the front he wants us to Fly Above hi that's what he wants about you and when you are there you are you are becoming like an unchanging God because nothing really touches you of this world including the Devil Himself whether he's angry excited you know those demons get excited when we curse them out when we kick them on the teeth out they get excited you know but that doesn't shake you so he is reminding them that remember everything that God has ever done to anyone he will do it again today can't means that the contact that I want to bring this I I wrote here that the prophet says um there are many things that are practically uh practically all things change that's what the prophet says time people and everything right but now even when time is normal God's still the same why oops my slide ran away is loading says loading but we can read there now why does God wants to change me and you why who can tell me because God what there's many many answers but the point that I just listed here is just it's not exhaustive right he wants me to be like him he he wants to restore me to actually how I was before because he saw me he chose me before the foundation and I was like him and I'm like him actually I'm like God you are the Bible the prophet told us that you are God you are an amateur God you are don't you believe it you are God and how does a god behave how does a boy a god a god creates a God heals when when you work for a company they must realize you must one day announce that they say listen you're the most privileged people you're the most privileged company I've ever come across they say why say because I'm working for you they say what what do you mean the young man because I'm a son of God and do you know that I your company can be prosperous or can be destroyed because I'm here they're blessed they better look after you day [Laughter] is that you are made after God's image and he who is born by God is is God that don't you know that the child of a dog is a dog the child of a an elephant is an elephant and the child of a a rhino a child of a human have you ever seen a human bearing a dog so a child of God it may not believe it but that's what you are [Laughter] now listen to this listen listen to this one um I said he wants to change us into his divine nature right today we're just gonna be sort of like teaching and we'll finish on time but I don't want you to lose me because teaching has got a problem Brother Andy teaching when you are not preaching you're just teaching and people tend to oh then they lose you along the way because you go slow you want the matter to soak in and to pause and to think about it and to process it and to identify with the teachings for that kind of a problem but I don't want you to lose me all right and I lost my slide this one let's read what the prophet says there from the stage of a perfect man that's the way when we ask for something and he doesn't give us he doesn't give it unto us that doesn't shake us a bit yeah when your wife gives you food and you find that she didn't cook it that way you actually don't like it now do you stop loving it hey Landy I don't even want to find you here huh just because you cooked that food you I mean you love it too much you love it too much even if your husband don't approve certain things Ah that's not how you judge him I'm teaching you young guys who are going to be married we are already married so we are managing it but you who are going to be married you must know are we not managing product we are doing well we are doing well very well [Laughter] but I'm also reading to us who are married that excuse me that it does not even Shake us where was I sorry then like the same things if you had another one the other one gets head too if you make the other one happy the other one gets happy too so the prophet here I think is talking about like in a relationship type of a thing have you heard about a man and a woman who becomes like they become like the same thing they become like the same thing and I've got a testimony for that I've got I've got proof I I can tell you now if Matt can sit on on the couch and start to think about coffee you may find that person Allah was thinking of making him coffee it happened to me it happens doesn't it happen sister it never happened to you it happens because they are one so if if there's many times where I sit and and I'm just thinking of something and I just see my wife coming to bring it how did she know that I'm looking for that if because you are one thing not in flesh or even in spirit and that is how Christ the Bible says before you even ask before you even ask me I will answer you I will already give you because the Lord knows we and the Lord are one we are connected can buy flowers where can I get nice flowers and her husband is already thinking about it because they are what that's us and Christ forget about all the other couples that I've mentioned think about this couple the bride in Jesus Christ our thoughts must be um brother and I'm looking for a wait ers that's the way am I if you want a way to go to Brother Andy there must be harmonious with the thoughts of God when when God when the Lord thinks this way we also think that way ah have you seen a formation of airplanes when they when they do information how they go you know I've never understood how it works I thought I'll ask brother Daniel one day Daniel a you know this information it's like those Pilots they're thinking the same thing I was told that sometimes some other airplanes don't have a pilot they're just they're just remote control but they say Harmony you know you just see them going this way when they attend they go together that's our thoughts and Christ's thoughts us is like Jimmy and and Stephanie exactly like that you see even the way they are sitting that's how us and Christ sit sorry to put you on the spot [Laughter] but it's like a young couple sitting on the marriage supper table the world has just begun our world have just started that's what is it has our real real life hasn't started when you get there my brother my sister and you are giving you a rope and and they say welcome home and they tell you your life your life has just started feel that one you want you wanna you you don't worry you'll have enough voice to cry but Reuben welcome home my son your life has just begun is over it's over it's finished done and dusted so it is worth it for us to even die for it if needs be to even die for it because death to us Paul taught us about death he said ah to live is Christ but to die it's even again didn't he teach us oppa he taught us now I was trying to show you about that Harmony they he I'm reading there he got to come believing that he's got to come believing that God is a rewarder to those that diligently seek him that's the word I wanted to emphasize right now we have to come to him in a diligent way don't ask God something and then tomorrow you for God did you really mean it the god everything that God does he's serious about it God doesn't have time when he's doing something and he says no I was just joking God has got no time for such he's a wonderful God he's a nice humorous God but he's serious he he he he he he can make you your seriousness to be serious he can make you genuinely genuine because everything that you talk to God that you talk to God about sorry I shouldn't have come to I shouldn't have come to church I should have stayed home and then brother Ed plucks me there and you see then I could pray from me but don't worry I've got no back no don't be threatened I've got no back in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ no back the point is this God when he does everything he does it seriously therefore young men young woman you children young people adults everything that we do to God myself I must mean it I must be serious I must mean business with God he mustn't talk to God like he said he's a he's a thing this is our husband man and we can only understand but we can understand this relationship when it gets more revealed to us and how can it get revealed if we don't diligently ask for more revelation huh so that's what we need to do let's let's work towards finishing I might not I might not over emphasize this now literally virtues won't achieve God's change they can't our natural abilities and the way that we are born they say this boy he's this little boy he's such a nice boy even his grandfather was like that that cannot achieve nothing for David even if he's taking after his grandfather and great-grandfather and they are so kind and nice kind-hearted that cannot take him into heaven not a bit huh no no natural issues now I want to say this that there are some people who have a portion of these virtues knowledge and wisdom and patience and so forth but they don't profess to be Christians can you see that the way you need to put your jackass now spiritual jackets that the natural phenomena of those things it's not what you are talking about we are talking about the spiritual part the the fruits of the spirits of the spirit that's what we are talking about those things when they start to come they'll they'll bring and bear fruits virtue of God will bear the fruits of God faith of God will bear the fruits of the wisdom of God will bear the fruits of that's what I mean but the wisdom of my nature how I was born I'm just taking after my father about the cubas he's a hard worker and I have him to be a hard worker you slap up and he's like that and I just happen to be like that that's why that's why Arman is also told horses for the soul that cannot help you to be nice and good because you are taking after your father brother that may not help but what will help is to go beyond that one to have that natural one and the spiritual one the one of your real father that wisdom is the one that I'm talking about that we come to you Jaden and talk to you and God gives you the descendant to tell me you know this one I was praying about it because that's the gift of wisdom that God gave you and you just we say what I never thought about it that's the gift because that kind of a gift bring fruits of the spirit then we'll know that this boy has got a gift of wisdom and that's what we want to see here that our virtues our virtues that we are talking about will not just be for professing to be Christians Hallelujah are we Amen in that okay we already spoke about the sheep and the dogs that they don't they don't don't manufacture sheep they're just sheep we want to come to a point where we don't manufacture to be Christians we don't we don't work hard for you well it's just we are we are on autopilot we are just Christians we we we we just the rivers of love of Life the rivers of blessings the rivers of they just come out we will get there we are seeking towards working towards the mark of the High Calling to get their brothers and sisters and we must not forget when we talk to God to be serious about what we are asking for and to be sincere if we don't feel the level of sincerity ask God he'll give it to you and ask him sincerely he'll give it there's nothing that is difficult for him another aspect in closing is the one of the word seed you know the weight of God is a seat he says sit you know when you plant a seed and then that's it you give you some water and it says the prophet says that and it sits under the right temperature and it sits under the right conditions and the Sun the sunlight come and is under the right conditions that seat will start to grow and it will eventually bring the fruits so that's exactly how the word of God is when the word of God comes when you eat it when you read it when you listen to it listen for it to to be inside the ground of your heart so that because it is the correct seat I can tell who is the right seed so that it can grow don't just listen to it as if you are listening to a radio or to burn hair you know Ben hair watching it tomorrow what was his name you forgot huh and then you you you you must listen to someone that after 20 years that someone still resonate with you it has done an impact in your life that someone that made you repent how many can remember them there's someone that stuck with you I said I'm not pleasing life for God I was supposed just to be teaching but I just can't help it that that sermon that just blew your mind that that's someone that you had and it just it just you just can't forget it there's one someone that I never forget there's many but there's one for New Zealand that I never forget his one brother Ben was preaching about breaking the cycles of generations and I found that it was a series it was a series he was going through and I just came in the middle of that series my first or second service here man I always ask him is it possible to preach it again [Laughter] because it just got stuck with me I I just saw the Bible and what he read I think he read in the book of Deuteronomy or somewhere in the Old Testament it just it just it just did something to me that same one and I knew that it was not him it was the Lord now the way it is a seat allow it don't let the weight to fall on the ground prepare the ground so that it can sit on the right ground the seat which is the weight and it will grow it will germinate it will bring because you are creating the right temperature we are created the ground you are open-minded you are saying Lord pour in my heart your weight then he will pour and the seed will come you will be amazed ah this up I never used to do this am I able I never knew that I can lay someone's and pray for them and they get well you sisters if if the husband is not there don't don't shy away etana to lay hands on Mommy and pray for her and she gets healed because there are the fruits fruits those are the fruits that I'm talking about the gifts and just lay your mom hands in sealed and we hold on them and you will see soon enough you will be having the stature of a perfect God you'll have it you'll be you'll be like him full fully fleshed God on Earth you'll be like that lastly I want us to to read here that sometimes and I don't want this to happen to you but sometimes what prevents progress is is the guy I'm watching on the mirror problem this guy that's the one that I need to manage not my wife or my husband no no no no I must manage this guy in front of them if I can just manage the guy in front of the mirror because more often than not he is the problem and you know what he says he will tell you that he's not the problem he will show you he's quick to think to show you the problem is the next person if they didn't do that I mean I'm not hard on them no no I'm not I'm just thinking that if they didn't do they do this way I wouldn't have done this the problem is not me that's what he says this one in the in front of the mirror we are too besides you all I'm just trying I'm just trying to show you that you are wrong ah but the man in the mirror never looked at himself he never even said hey honey can you help me to look to can you just help me to to to I'm failing to do self-introspection can you just come and help me to self-introspect in this area in this area in this area I am not sure you see if you do that man you're impressing the Lord because you are already allowing the word to criticize you you are allowing you are opening yourself you are making yourself a vulnerable and that God helps those kind of people God helps people who loses themselves and he cashes them and he helps them if you lose yourself you make yourself vulnerable before God not anywhere don't misunderstand me a young girl don't make yourself vulnerable to a day no no I mean before God right Lose Yourself young man let me lose myself sorry I like calling people's names just when you go to God am I you lose yourself and then God you take over and then God you you do things that you have never ever thought that you will do you you dream dreams that are holy that are beneficial to the church you'll sing in such a way that we say ah what happened to that Organo jail because he Lo he just lose herself in the Lord and God took over her life if we lose ourselves Malachi I I want to be specific I like a personal gospel I like a gospel that is personalized so by now I'm sure you know me you don't take offense please I'm I wish it was not broadcasted but I like to be you know that we can individualize this thing and then when you are there you must say and you pradampo and preach it to me because I'm taking this for myself that the man in front of the mirror more often than not he is the problem I'm not saying is every problem but more 98 of the time if I solve him and use all of your men in the in your mirror life is we've got no problems we'll be able to worship to Fellowship to serve God fully and will be within the stature of a perfect God and we go home are we together so that's the greatest enemy our God is William Branham he says here he's the one that's got took his he gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it when he does that he shows God right out of the picture but when I get rid of that guy in front of the mirror when I get to the place that he's out of the way do you think God will talk through me if I don't get out of the way I just come here and I think that I know you I can tell you your problems you David I can sort you out I can help no no no no the god there's no good there's no good I must learn to to pray I can read the Bible but the moment I cannot set myself aside with my Wicked thoughts I don't even qualify to stand here I must put everything aside and said Lord I am blank I wish my eyes was closed and I didn't even see who's in church then I just preached that's that's the attitude that a minister should come and talk the word of God not with preconceived ideas amen so that's sorry that that punch was for the ministers not for you eh it was for us it's all about about it tonight I kept to my weight and that I promise you I will finish on time because it's prayer meeting tonight so we are going to sing if the musicians can come our lovely musicians can come and then we are going to sing a song I I

have got a need that you'd like to mention that maybe you didn't have the time to write and maybe you want to mention it before the Lord and let's just be reverent before God let's just have a positive forever and attitude as we approach him and then the way that we come is the way that he's gonna answer us the way that we approach him is the way he's going to answer us and he already knows
