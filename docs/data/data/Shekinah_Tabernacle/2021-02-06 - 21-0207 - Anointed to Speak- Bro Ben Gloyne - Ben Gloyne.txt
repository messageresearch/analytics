[Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] in the tech industry by the filming industry we have a little problem that we call an air gap when we diagnose a problem when something's not working we diagnose we say oh it looks like you have an air gap here you know that means it means it's not plugged in so there's something that's not plugged into something else and there's an ear gap this was just a mute it's what this wasn't an ear gap though i mean so um it's good to be here this morning to have an opportunity to worship the lord to be with saints [Music] of like precious faith and souls that [Music] have a special [Music] that are special in the mind of god that have been sitting in his mind for a very very long time since before the world began each one

journeys that we've all taken in our life it hasn't been just an accident even the things and the decisions that we make that we think we're just maybe a flippant decision oh like brother ben said oh i just moved down to christchurch to study there because my friend said come here and study you know but he had to go down there for certain things to unfold and things to happen a certain way you know we're led by the lord all the time and we don't even realize that the different things and the decisions we make so we thank god that that's the god that we serve he's a master builder he all he

tell you know everything that we have in the gospel now all of this is because someone came and told that's right someone made an effort somewhere a person made an effort and they surrendered to the

you lord you know even before we ask oh god you know everything about us and we're so thankful that you do lord i pray you'd meet every need lord in in divine presence this morning may have your way among us oh god and let's pray you just take preeminence of the service take it under your control for your glory lord in jesus christ's name we ask amen amen thank you brother isaac thank you musicians amen good morning everyone god bless you amen great to hear have everyone here this morning amen praise the lord let's um let's just go to the scripture today i'd like to welcome all the visitors and trust you feel at home i remember all home folk around here amen um let's just go to acts chapter one i'm gonna read a couple of scriptures here then we're gonna go to first john two um i to follow follow along and behind what brother james preached on sunday i mean on on on wednesday about a cold press bride but the other power the spoken word and um yeah i mean so we're in acts one and six he says then they therefore will come together they asked him saying lord will thou this time restore again the kingdom of israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times nor the seasons which the father has put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth now that word power in the greek is dunamis which where we get the word dynamite from you're going to receive this kind of power hallelujah and um then we're going to go to first john i was actually reading this scripture here when um in the service on wednesday before brother james started preaching and um verse 20 stood out to me what was going to read from verse 18 says little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that we are we know sorry that it is the last time they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would have no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they are not of us but ye have an unction from the holy one and you know all things i have not written unto you because you know not the truth but because you know it and that no lie is of the truth amen may the lord bless the reading of his word you may have your cease this morning and i want to if i could title us i want to speak about being anointed to speak we're living in a day where there's many spirits around the world and they're and they're speaking forth you see it in the political realm you said in the social realm there's a lot of spirits they're speaking a lot of words but there's also a time for the bride of christ to speak now this word as uh this word ancient here in verse 20 it's a it's a it's it's a compound word it's an unusual kind of word with not one that we use much these days it says but you have an ancient from the holy one and you know all things now the word unction it means and it's it's an an action of it anointing someone with an oil or an ointment but it's also a fervent manner of expression apparently arising from deep emotions so these are you know so so so so it's a compound word where there's an anointing that's involved but there's actually a voice that goes forth because of that anointing and i say that we have an unction amen it's not just you know christianity's not just people working out how to follow god but god comes down lives in those people's lives and his word puts on flesh in their lives so you know today we live in a day where where the bride is anointed to speak and we're not here to speak our own words and our own thoughts but we're here to speak god is actually here to speak his word and his thoughts but he has no other lips but your lips he has no other voice but your voice amen you know we know we have the bible but you know that this bible that's in printful must put on flesh and you and i and it must be lived you know as the prophet said that what jeffersonville needs tonight and i'll say what wellington needs this morning is thousands of lived voices i mean was not just speaking about a god that lived 2 000 years ago but that same god lives in you and i and our voice becomes i mean our life becomes a lived voice hallelujah where god himself lives now we've been in jude with power from on high as as jesus would say in luke 12 you know you shall be i mean sorry this is this is the latter part of luke but then yo brother james brought out the scripture that you shall um you know don't think of what to say you shall take no thought of how or the thing you shall answer or what you shall say for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to say so it's not going to be you speaking when the pressure comes on it's not going to be you that's going to be responding it's going to be the god in you that's going to be doing the responding he's the one that's going to be doing the speaking hallelujah but you know it really comes from what's within you know the scripture tells us in in proverbs 18 a man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled death and life from the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof so you know there's a lot of power in this little member here you can speak death or you can speak life you can speak victory or you can speak defeat it all depends what you are led to to to speak hallelujah now this now this is not the power of positive speaking this is not mind over matter but the apostles did not apply mind over matter to overcome the challenges of their day they did not use mind over matter to overcome the scribes and the pharisees and all the religious pressure they had and everything no it was god anointing them to speak amen but if they confess if you confess if you have a negative testimony your life will become negative because there's power in your words i mean there's power everyone has power in their words right we you know you can see it even if you can look at old footage of if you look at war documentaries you know hitler would release a word and it transformed the world in a bad way it led to a global war but he was anointed there was power in his words he's just there's just a demon power anointing a man and he did what he did we know it's it was in scripture it was fulfilled but those words had power it stirred up a people and if that kind of if a fallen spirit a demon power could anoint a man to speak in such a way and stir up a people how much more god himself anointing a people releasing a word upon the bride of christ and stir them up how much more that in the positive side hallelujah and we know that this message we have received has power in it hallelujah amen now jesus would say for a good tree bringeth forth uh not corrupt fruit neither does a crop tree bring forth good fruit for every tree is known by his own fruit four of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh so it's really what we harden our hearts is what we value that's the treasure it's either a good treasure or an evil treasure but it's a treasure it depends on the value you put upon it you know if something is evil and you see it as evil you're not going to store it in your heart you want to shun that thing but if you view it as good don't be evil you're going to store it in your heart but whatever's in your heart is going to be so spoken forth you can't help but speak of the things that's in you now this word abundance it means a surplus or a super abundance it is that which is left over that which is left over and above so it's actually abundance is greater than the allotted portion that you need are we together here i mean so and and it's also an abundance is is in which one delights and of that which fills the heart so then it fills it but also overflows that's the abundance has got to go somewhere you know you pour water or somewhere you know just like you take uh you know the hot river if you keep filling up the hot river it's going to flow somewhere it'll either go out to see it or burst the banks it's got to go because there's a abundance of water in the river it's the same thing with you and i there should be an abundance of the spirit of god of the word of god in our lives hallelujah that should just be flowing all over the place amen amen now we've been commissioned in this day we know that the seventh angel has come the message has come the book the bible has come open we have you know you know the mysteries have been revealed but that wasn't the end of the prophecy for for we know uh yes in revelations 10 now and the voice which i heard from from heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open on the hand of the angel which standeth upon the scene upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter why because the word's got to purge out everything that that you know that's contrary to it but it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey it's it's very sweet to speak about the goodness of god and you know his plan of redemption what he's done for you and i it's very sweet but when the word cuts and you know the lord says you've got to you've got to surrender that to me you've got to give up your pride give up your self ability give up trying to be a big shock give up you know your unforgiveness resentment gossip you got to give that all up that's when the belly gets better because it's going to be a purging hallelujah and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings now we know historically speaking after after john received the series of revelations which we call the book of revelation on the isle of patmos he went back to the um he went back to ephesus and he pastored the church and then he passed on he was the only apostle to die a natural death all the others were martyred so you know he didn't fulfill this in his in in in his own humanity to prophesy before many people's nations tongues and kings and we also know the book of revelation that john you know you know the book of revelation being a book of symbols being a book of prophecy is that john himself is a symbol in the book right he is actually a representation of something and we know from from reading the end of revelations 3 which is the end of the church ages to revelations 4 1 what happens you know in revelations 4 1 as john says i heard a voice the same voice up in heaven there's an open door in heaven said come up hither i'll show you things that come so that he was actually taken from this dimension into the heavenly realm hallelujah so what does that represent that represents the rapture of the bride of christ at the end of the seventh age hallelujah so one man and a vision represents a whole body of people amen so so here he is he's commanded to take this little book and eat it up and then prophesy again it's actually you are actually this is a symbol of you in the book right the bride of christ amen you have to become one with the word and then you must speak it forth again hallelujah so now because we know to prophesy it means to speak under it's yeah it means to foretell events to speak under inspiration or to exercise the prophetic office so it speaks of speaking under inspiration now i just want to put this all on our own lap because many people say oh you've got to prophesy again you have to be a prophet no just to speak under inspiration amen that is prophesying again so you can be led by the holy ghost to speak something under inspiration that can change someone's life amen that you can speak saying to your children wisdom whatever be and it'll end you know undo whatever the devil is trying to do in their lives or or your brother and sister whoever it might be you can be inspired who believes in being inspired shouldn't our lives be inspired i mean we're not here just to go through a motion of a human ability but our lives should be inspired by god amen how we raise our children should be inspired by the word how we treat our spouses should be inspired by the word how we treat one another should be inspired by the word how we treat those in the world we want to see saved inspired by the word we should be living under inspiration how we do our jobs everything we do in life should be inspired by the word of god amen should be under inspiration we should be living under an influence hey the world is under an influence we should be under an influence but our influence should be a heavily influenced amen now jesus would say here many therefore if his disciples when i heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured it he said unto them does this offend you what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up to where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so the words that jesus was speaking carried a spirit and they were and it was the spirit of god that was being carried in those words he would say to the scribes and pharisees later he said you can't hear my word because you have no place in you for my word so there has to be a betting ground in a person's soul that they can receive the word of god as as as the scripture says to him that have an heir let him hear what the spirit says to the church so you know the people who are ordained to eternal life are actually built to hear the word of god not just in their ears but in their in their hearts if i put it that way i mean so so the words that he speaks now as he says now i'm probably running a lot of things together but you know when god says something it's not just going to fall to the ground and nothing's going to happen he says in the scripture my word shall not return unto me void but it will produce that which i sent it to do i mean so so what he sent it to do it will produce it so when he said in the beginning let there be the sun moon and the stars he didn't get a watermelon that may be a ridiculous illustration but he got sun moon and stars what he got in his mind and what he spoke forth was produced exactly what he wanted it to be it means it's the same thing with his word now what he speaks it will produce it so if he said he's going to have a bride without spiral wrinkle made in his image she's going to be there i mean there's going to be a people upon the earth that are made in his image i mean because they have a they have a place to receive his word hallelujah but now when you receive the word of the lord it doesn't just sit there dormant it actually puts on flesh hallelujah in our character and what we do i say lord help us when i say our character lord keep changing me to be more like you every day but it should also be it comes into us you could say to be spoken forth hallelujah when you know when moses let's just let's just jump down to this when moses was there in egypt and he met the burning bush everything he lacked of was in that burning bush everything here he lacked he knew he was called to deliver the people of israel but he couldn't do it in his own ability he miserably failed but then when he met the pillar of fire in the burning bush he received what he needed amen to to he he actually became anointed to speak now you think about you think about uh moses for a second it's amazing how god will take a people that are born in sin shaped an iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's just putting a few scriptures together they're actually under the influence of the devil because the bible says in ephesians 2 we all walked according to the prince of the power of the earth our lives were all led by him but then god rich in mercy quickness made us alive by his spirit and now we're in a new kingdom but you know but that's amazing how god will take a people that are born lost and and once upon a time our lives spoke cursing our lives actually glorified the devil whether you were aware of it or not the things we did the things we thought about the things you know the things we gave our lives to we're actually giving glory to satan maybe i'll just speak for myself for a bit that was my old life i gave glory to him the things i spoke about the things i did i was actually worshiping demon power right but then god would take a sinner such as i he would wash us in the blood transform us change our nature i mean that that same mouth now that was once once once made or inspired to speak cursing now speaks blessing it was once speaking death it now speaks life hallelujah why because you're anointed to speak one way but then another anointing came now we speak another way hallelujah so so here is moses now moses was made to be the deliverer of israel but he was raised in pharaoh's house and he was and and pharaoh had an ambition in his mind for moses that moses was there to further his kingdom just like the devil has an ambition for your your lives that you're going to further his kingdom in some some degree but god has other plans god had other plans for moses i mean so moses was built you think about it he was raised in pharaoh's palace he could have been the next pharaoh he would afford him wars he had been a mighty general because the royalty in those days led the armies so he was groomed he was trained he was molded to further uh you know the kingdom of egypt but then when he met the pillar of fire in the burning bush that same one that was there furthering the kingdom of egypt went back into egypt and he tore egypt down i mean that god's children would go free hallelujah it's the same thing with you and i i mean we are here to tear satan's kingdom down now i'm not talking about physically overthrowing governments that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about where where the children of god are inspired by god and they speak a word to a people where once a person had had the devil on the throne of their heart right was ruling but then that devil gets thrown off that kingdom of satan gets cast out and the kingdom of heaven gets established in the heart of people hallelujah isn't that our job go into all the world and preach the gospel wherever you find the devil cast them out hallelujah amen that's our job well i'm not a preacher no your life can do the same thing remember it's not just it's not just song leaders it's not just ministers that do these things all of us are commissioned to do it jesus says in mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe who's a believer today hallelujah those signs should be following your life amen amen even even paul would speak in first corinthians 6 or i don't have a way to blank that know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revelers nor extortion shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you but ye are washed who's washed today but ye are sanctified but yeah justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god so that you know that's quite a listening list of people who want to want to hear it but he says you were like that once upon him some were such as you but you've been sanctified you've been washed i mean you've been justified by the by the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god hallelujah amen i'm so glad he does the work amen hallelujah now we'll read this and this is the way this is from here ye him and this is the way it is this afternoon if our nature becomes converted from the things of the world to the nature of the holy spirit god will take his stand he will abide on us inspired believers taking in the inspired word those two together brings the results amen it brings the word to life the inspiration that's on your heart puts the word to living why because he's changed our nature to agree with his nature i mean once upon a time our nature was opposite we were once his enemies the scripture tells us but he does such a work by the power of the blood you know i probably say it every sunday but i love to talk about what the cross does not just talk about the cross but what was it seen to do i mean jesus died that he would he would cleanse the people of their sins and he would transform them live in them i mean that that they would be living temples of the living god hello there's no longer them the apostle paul would say it's no longer i that liveth but christ that liveth in me hallelujah so the actions of paul was not the actions of paul it was actions of the holy ghost and paul hallelujah amen peter would say knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation now why is this for the prophecy came not an old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost this is why it's not a private interpretation because moses interpretation wasn't his interpretation that was god's interpretation because the lord said now give them these laws thus saith the lord you shall do this and this and this it wasn't moses saying this is how it should be this is god saying how it should be just like paul when he would write or any of the prophets it wasn't their thoughts and their you know their way of well i better write this to them and they're going to hear this no it was god inspiring they were moved hallelujah by the holy ghost so it wasn't the yeah it wasn't their will that brought the word it was god's will that brought the word hallelujah and i believe our lives should be moved as well i mean the word should come through us i mean the words you put on flesh through us because we're moved by the holy ghost hallelujah amen all scripture is given i know this is probably fundamental but all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works now this word inspiration it actually means about uh uh you know from the greek to be divinely breathed in holy so so to be inspired you've received something there's been actually the breath of god has breathed over your life the word of god has been breathed into you hallelujah that's why well i'm inspired what something's been divinely breathed in and not speaking out hallelujah now you know jesus said all things are possible to them that believe remember we're anointed to speak we can't limit god yeah we know with god all things are possible and everyone says amen absolutely but jesus challenged us and said but if thou cannest believe all things are possible to him that believeth now here is a man with his child this is this is the background of the story here's a man with a child that had epilepsy and he had taken him to the apostles but the apostles couldn't cast him out and you know and then and then and then jesus comes down and and this is the scene that jesus comes into and then you know this man says but if thou can just do anything have compassion on us and help us and jesus said unto him if thou canist believe all things are possible to him him that believes all things are possible not some things all all all encompasses everything all things are possible and straight away the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord i believe help thou my unbelief so the so the father came with a real need and he knew it could be done that's why he brought him to the to the disciples but then but then when the master came himself jesus says well if you believe all things are possible basically your son can be healed so but the father recognized the state said lord i do believe but help my unbelief take my unbelief away that my child will be made whole hallelujah then when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto them thou dumb and death spirit our charges come out of him and enter into him no more and the spirit cried and rent him saw and came out of him as he was as one dead and so much that many said he is dead so that spirit came out but i but what i want to draw from here is jesus says if thou cannest believe all things are possible to him that believes do we have believers today are we believers today i mean so so in other words there is nothing impossible with you now i'm not talking about human ability now i'm talking about god's ability in you but there's nothing impossible do you know that man is all-powerful you know man is all-powerful we are not limited in brother power says this he says amen cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the garden of eden amen what did adam have in the garden all power tree move here he'll do this he could just rearrange the place by the power of the spoken word because he was god over the earth that was his god-given position he did not make himself that he was made that just like the bride of christ we are not made amen well i might get this mixed up like i mixed up words but you know we are made to be the bride of christ he the lord says you're the bride you're my wife you have certain you you know you know you have privileges that the rest of world knows nothing about your joint here with me hallelujah all that i am you'll become so it's not us trying to make ourselves something if he says i'm something that well i'll just take that you know mary mary said to gabriel when gabriel said you're going to have the promised son you're going to have emanuel she just said let it be unto me according to that word basically i accept what you've told me yes that happened she didn't say well i'm going to do it and here's how it's going to be no let it be unto me according to my work that's how it should be with us he says cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like the garden of eden that's what the blood does that's what the cross achieves amen i was going to choke it but i'm going to say it man is omnipotent that means all powerful you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent did not he say in mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass and you can have what you've said he says what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together two omnipotent something's got to shake something whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that he promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met here he stands oh isn't he wonderful hallelujah that's how it is when man and god come together amen and we have confidence that he said it in his word if god said it that's done hallelujah i believe it that settles it let's just move on it creates a power and that's not a power of unbelief it's a power of faith and it will produce things that though they are not they will be hallelujah amen so man is omnipotent all powerful i'm looking at a bunch of all-powerful people hallelujah someone fully surrendered to god is all-powerful amen moses was fully surrendered to god when he walked into egypt he said let my people go and pharaoh said i'll not let them go so moses just said well i'm going to plague your kingdom till you let them go hallelujah he already had the prophecy that they were going to go hallelujah same thing with you and i repent and be baptized name the lord jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises to you and to your children those that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call and we've already got the prophecy hallelujah amen amen so we can walk in confidence god said it it's going to happen but now he's got to put our faith in action amen hallelujah moses put his faith in action flags came trouble came to egypt hallelujah but eid pharaoh had to let them go now i come here where is where is josh is he here today area there is there okay he said to me yesterday i can't remember what we're talking about but he said he said these words speak your outcome i think you heard it from somewhere but you know it's a powerful thing speak remember life and death is in the power of the tongue so you've got to speak your outcome he did now he didn't say speak your income like a lot of people they want a prosperity and they say i'm going to have a mansion i'm going to have a million dollars in the no it's not about speaking your income speak your outcome hallelujah we want to talk about spiritual outcome now moses you say well that sounds pretty far-fetched no no moses would be standing by a red sea and the children of israel were in dire straits because they saw pharaoh and his armies coming and it looked like it's going to be the biggest massacre there's ever been and they were all upset they were troubled and moses had an unction remember anointed to speak moses received an action where he would say to say to israel he says fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of god now notice he had not heard that the sea was going to open at this stage he just said fear not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show you today for the egyptians who you see today you shall see them again no more forever for the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace whatever he was he was anointed to speak this is gonna be the outcome it looks really bad but this is gonna help this is what's gonna happen hallelujah it's gonna be the same thing with you and i we're gonna speak faith hallelujah the family circle will be unbroken we're going to walk out of here victorious we're not leaving one hoof behind i mean everyone's going to come hallelujah hallelujah believe on the lord jesus christ and thy and thy house shall be saved hallelujah and you know the rest of the story god said to him why cry to me speak and move forward lift up your staff and the reds he parted they went over the egyptians tried to follow them they all drowned and then the israelites had a real jubilee pentecostal meeting on the other side hallelujah but it's because moses received an unction he spoke david was anointed to be king he was a shepherd boy to begin with but god saw him as king yes you know it's incredible really if we could just really you know sometimes you see little children you think what's the potential in them you know in the world you know sporting scouts will look at people at young age you know i remember when i started um uh school or was it boarding school all the not that i started in in the year is it year 11 these days that's what they call it third form back in my day i didn't do ncea i was the last year to do the bursary anyway you know the third formers or the year 11s they were put through all these different sports exercises for a day and all the so they did rowing machines that had running they did all kinds of stuff because all the coaches were looking what's in these children that they can harness what's in them that when they hit the final year of school they'll be maybe national champions they were looking for potential now that's just in a natural realm how much more a supernatural realm i mean the potential that's in a believer hallelujah amen so here's david he's anointed to be king on the outward he looks like well he's just a shepherd boy but he has been anointed amen to be king over israel and he would he would take some food he was under the obedience of his father and he'd take some food to the battle and you know you know we're where the philistines are on one side and you know israel was on the other side and you know goliath would come out and make his boats for 40 days and you know but there came a time where where the words of goliath fell in the wrong ears and they fell into the ears of a man who had an unction he was anointed by the holy ghost i mean that anointing was going to speak forth and then so david would would would testify you know you know the different ones in the camp he would have to overcome the pressure of his older brother telling him he's just naughty wanted to see the battle he had to overcome family pressure but he he just stuck to his guns and said who is this uncircumcised philistine why basically you stuck here you should be putting the sword in their neck and you should be delivered you know we should have won this by now because we are the armies of the living god and this guy's just some uncircumcised philistine and you know he would he would talk about these things and eventually he was taken into the presence of saul who was really built for the job but he was a backslidden king in a backslidden condition wasn't willing to go fight no more and you know david was allowed to go face this champion now it's amazing when you know i don't know what was well goliath no no doubt he thought what an insult here i am the champion of the philistines and they send out a shepherd boy with a stick and a you know you know to try and kill me but you know so goliath made his boasts he he would say i'm going to feed you to the dogs or what am i about a dog he says i'm just going to feed your carcass to you know but then david received an unction he's going to speak an outcome he said thou come this to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom now has defied he said this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand i will smite them will take thy head from me he didn't even have a sword hallelujah and i will give the carcasses of the host of the philistines this day into the fowls of the air so basically say he said i will give hallelu the carcasses of the host of the philistines so basically he said basically i'll kill you i'm going to kill all them that are behind you i'm going to take out the whole thing what he was under an action amen because our god is mighty in battle amen he is mighty in battle he's not afraid of a challenge i mean the devil may do a lot of things but god doesn't get intimidated he says okay devil if you're going to do what you're going to do i'm going to do what i'm going to do and you know the outcome of what you're going to do you're going to be defeated you're going to be made humiliated and i'm going to be victorious hallelujah so he would he would say so so he came under an unction and he spoke his outcome what is what happened he cut off glass head amen and and and israel rallied and they won a great victory hallelujah why because he was under an action amen we've got to be at under an action as well where do we move by the holy ghost more than just our natural mind trying to work things out amen but he's been lord speak hallelujah show us show us the direction we should take amen hallelujah there's an adoption he said woman hear my words the hour is coming in hours he's speaking of jesus speaking to the woman at the well when the father seeketh those that will worship him in spirit and the truth thy word is uh is the truth and every man pardoning that'll read the bible and believe every word the bible says and will follow its instructions and will receive the same holy ghost that they received the same way they received it same results they received it same power they got when they received it they they received power we're packing some more than dynamite hallelujah when they when they um you know we're packing the most powerful thing in the world oh you know the president of the united states has what they call the was it the football or something yeah the briefcase with all the you know activation codes for all the nuclear missiles we've got more than that you're packing more than what he's got you say well he can destroy the whole world of a touch of a button what about you and i not that we're looking for death we're looking for life hallelujah but we have we have the power within us to change the eternal destination of a soul hallelujah that's an incredible amen amen hallelujah amen and follow same result and he knows who he knows who his mama and papa was you know who your mama and papa glory he knows he was washed he knows he's washing the blood of jesus christ born of the spirit filled with god's unction he knows where he's standing sure he's in canaan which is the promised land he knows where he come from that's the way it is with a real christian ask them have you received the holy ghost since you believed amen brother amen hallelujah amen amen well we're filled with god's unction i trust what i'm saying speaking this morning remember it's not out of our grasp this is not pie in the sky theory oh this is reality this is what this is what the cross was said to achieve god would dwell in a people and he'd manifest his word through that people hallelujah amen the almighty god that brought again jesus um again the lord jesus from the dead and has presented him to us after 1900 years as the infallible god of heaven we thank thee for this and for his presence with us today by day in our daily walk and we are so happy to know that in this hour of confusion when the world don't know what to do they're digging holes in the ground and they're fortifying themselves in concrete but oh god they cannot hide from the wrath of god there's only one remedy lord and we're so glad we accepted it you're glad you accepted that that day and when you accepted the blood of jesus christ that day when i see the blood i'll pass over you oh how glad we are for that all sufficient protection tonight of the blood of the lamb of god the high priest standing in glory tonight making intercessions upon our profession we are so happy to have him with us tonight the great speaker the great holy spirit the great action giver the great life-giver hell we have him right now hallelujah why we're two or three gathered in my name there i am in the earth hello are you thankful you know that's why i said what's the potential of a church meeting oh we're gonna sing songs for about half an hour maybe a couple of specials maybe some prayer requests and the preacher will get up and do what he does who have some closing serve is that what church is about shall we do those things to create an atmosphere but really what do we what do we gather to do i mean that god will come down and give an unction amen when we are in our seat we praise god it's not us praising us him praising through us when we sing we sing in the spirit when we praise we praise in the spirit we preach we preach in the spirit and when we clap our hands we when we play our 10-stringed instrument right here i mean we clap in the spirit when we dance we dance in the spirit why it's all god doing it hallelujah amen you say well there's nothing really to that i know you can create an atmosphere around you that god just comes down you know god loves to worship he he loves to be worshipped but he loves to worship hallelujah you know when there's an atmosphere that's created god just says i've got to step into the atmosphere why because he inhabits the praises of his people he comes and dwells in our praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to god now this may be a bit of a segue but well this is the age we live in and unto the angel of the church and ladies here write these things sayeth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i work that thou were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i'll spew the out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods they have need of nothing knows not that thou art wretched miserable and poor and blind and naked now this covers the whole world you take any any country in the world it doesn't matter what economic status we're all rich increased with goods compared to say 50 years ago or 100 years ago you know i remember standing in papua new guinea i was in a little bible um study there in a pentecostal church and they read the scripture out they said look we are rich and increased with goods now to to the first world they aren't but to themselves they are because now they have power they got running water they got cell phones they got internet they got all these things cars and things they didn't have those things not that long ago but they're saying we're rich increase with goods amen and we and because the whole world is rich and increased with goods but notice the complaint he says because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth now this is very important uh to to understand now this is this is from the ladder i see in church ages a bit of a bible study and we're going to look at this carefully it says this ladies and church age group is lukewarm this look warmness demise a penalty from god the penalty is that they will be spewed out of his mouth here is where we don't want to go astray as a lot of folks do they very unwisely say that god can spew out of his mouth and that proves there is no such thing as the truth of the doctrine or the perseverance of the saints i want to correct your thinking right now this verse does not get is not given to an individual that's given to the church he's talking to the church furthermore if you will just keep the word in mind you'll recall nowhere does it say that that we are in the mouth of god we are engraved on his palms we are carried in his bosom way back in the unknown ages before time we were in his mind we are in his sheepfold and his pastures but never his mouth but what hold on but what is in the mouth of the lord the word is in his mouth matthew 4 4 but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god the word is supposed to be in our mouths too amen what does faith say what does faith say the word is neither even in thy mouth amen now we know that the church is his body amen it is here taking his place what will be in the mouth of the church the word first peter 4 and 11 if any man speak let him speak is the oracles the word of god second peter 1 21 for prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost then what is wrong with these people of the last day they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it i'm gonna prove that right now hallelujah the baptists have their creation dogmas based on the word and you can't shake them they say the apostolic days of miracles are over and there's no baptism with the holy ghost subsequent to believing the methodists say based on the word there is no water baptism sprinkling is not baptism and that sanctification is the baptism with the holy ghost the church of christ majors in regenerational baptism and in too many cases they go down dry sinners and come up wet ones yet they claim their doctrine is word-based go right down the line and come to the pentecostals do they have the word give them the word test and see they'll sell out the word for a sensation just about every time if you can produce a manifestation like oil and blood and tongues and other signs whether in the word or not or whether properly interpreted from the word the majority will fall for it but what has happened to the word the word has been put aside so god says i'm going against you all i will spew out of my mouth this is the end for seven out of seven ages i've seen nothing but men are steaming their own word above mine and you can bring this into our own ranks as well when we esteem our own word above the scripture yes same problem amen so at the end of this age i'm spewing out of my mouth it's all over i'm going to speak all right yes i'm here in the midst of the church the amen of god the faithful and true witness will reveal himself and it will be by my prophet oh yes it is so revelations 10 7 and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets there it is he is sending a vindicated prophet he's sending a prophet after almost 2 000 years he is sending someone who is so far from organization education and the world of religion that is john the baptist and elijah of old he will hear only from god and he will have thus saith the lord and speak for god he'll be god's mouthpiece and he as declared in malachi 4 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last days and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with them and that they will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works hallelujah do you see it a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became living epistles reader known of all men for their generation when the methodists failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the ages until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age they're saying there will be living epistles again there will be a people who are living epistles what's living epistles that's when the word lives hallelujah yes sir he says the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it's its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her we have received an unction hello yes it is for it says in the last days i mean so in the last chapter of revelations verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will head direct from god as at pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first stage now that word repudiated means to be judge wrong but they weren't wrong hallelujah so now the world will once more hear direct from god is at pentecost why because we've been restored back that same book of acts church we've been restored back to it not all the problems and the fussing and the fighting but god living in a people manifesting his word for the day hallelujah now he has cried out in this last age you have the word you have more bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking into pieces we never want to be in that state where we sit around we just chop chop up the word and what about this you know because remember we should never be examining the word from an intellectual standpoint saying what can i see it should be lord speak to me through your word amen you know if anyone's ever done any psych yeah you know science experiments as as as i work in that realm you know you are with your mind working out things and you're coming to conclusions based on what you know we shouldn't look at the bible that way we should look at the scripture lord speak to me remember in here is the character of christ from genesis to revelation what are we called to put on in this day his nature his word so it should be lord wherever i read in your scripture change my character to match your character change my thoughts to match your thoughts may i be more like you as i read your word amen amen i would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold and rejected i could stand that uh if you were white hot to know it's truth and live it i praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it i in return must refuse to on you i will spew you out for you nauseate me and he's on the outside of his church today he says if any yeah if anyone here might he's behold i stand at the door and knock and that's you know many people take that as an evangelistic call saying god's knocking on your heart just open the door and for a sense that's true but he's actually on the outside of the church world trying to get back in but he's been being replaced by man's ideas and men debating and hacking the word apart creeds and dogmas as opposed to them letting god come in and live we want him to come in and live don't we that his word would have preeminence in our lives hallelujah because when it's him living it's no longer our ability it's no longer us trying to be a christian remember true christianity is him being the christian in you amen yo that's really how it is it's not us trying to be the christian you we die out to ourselves we allow ourselves as a living sacrifice he comes down and consumes the sacrifice he comes in and liver comes and lives in us now brother brown's relating this story here he says the other day over in a little place i was having a meeting over here in in uh topeka kansas there was a boy a young preacher one of my first sponsors brother roy sitting here remembers the place and this was a great place and there was uh this minister had got under a roof or a place the side wall mashed him down beneath that the little fella was going to die his liver was bursted his spleen was knocked out of place tons fell on him i sat at the breakfast talking to the wife i said why if you know if jesus was here you know what he'd do i said when he spot when he sponsored me pardon me i believe that word he is sponsoring christ and i said that's a trick of the devil if jesus was here hit your layers holy hands upon him and the boy would get well i don't care if his liver's bursted he'd get well because jesus would walk in there knowing exactly who he was he noticed calling the scripture was right by me vindicating in him that he knowed who he was and not a shadow of doubt he'd lay his hands upon him and say son be well walk out of there and i'd say there isn't enough devils in hell to kill that boy then i said he'd get well but if but but if i said you see honey he was jesus the holy hands of god i said i'm a sinner i'm born sexual birth my father and mother were both sinners and i'm just and no good nothing and i said you know what if the lord would give me a vision and send me down there then that would be different i said i'd go down lay my hands on him he'd come out of that bed if he gave me a vision then i got to thinking after all if it was the vision what was it it's the same dirty hands on omaha same man praying for him same dirty hands now i got to thinking after all if it was a vision what was it if it's the same dirty hands on him same man praying same dirty hands but then i begin to think i'm a representative i'm i'm his representative then god doesn't see me that blood of that righteous one lays up there upon the altar and maketh intercessions for me he is my sufficiency here's my prayer here's my life i said the only thing that would make me put his put my hands on him with faith because i had faith in the vision and without the vision the same faith would do the same thing so i can reckon myself nothing but reckon him my all in all he is my life he is my commissioner no denomination sent me he sent me hallelujah i go on his name i'll lay my hands upon him walk down there laid hands on that boy and that night he was in the meeting solid well amen because many times we put a you know we put ourselves in the same bracket if jesus just came and did it it'd be fine but then we have to come to a conclusion i'm his representative he called me remember if god put me in man can't put me out hallelujah if the lord brought me into the body of christ man can't kick me out of the body of christ if he called me man can't uncall me hallelujah isn't that right i mean so we're gonna we're gonna come to that place where we just say he's my he's my righteousness i'm not my own righteousness he's my sufficiency amen he is my all in all and it may be the same hands but now god can use those hands hallelujah vision or no because it says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's our standing orders amen he says even faith without the vision it would be fine and and he went down and prayed for me got up in his fine solid well you're following me we've received an action hallelujah we're anointed to speak yes now i'm just going to finish with this quote i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here remember were the disciples efficient sufficiently impressed they saw this was god and flesh with them yes this one can do anything calm the storm bring lazarus back from the dead after four days in the grave do anything he wanted to heal is god now that same one that was in the body jesus is in the believer you believe that the same holy ghost that was in him without measures now in you hallelujah we are his body upon the earth and we know the word is living it's not just ink on paper so i wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word now mitz let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in first john 5 14 we are told this is the confidence we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he and and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we have desired of him now we ask what is the will of god there's only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god lamentations 3 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the law commandeth not there it is if if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it is in his name there it is again jesus the name is the word the will you can't separate god and the word they are one now when this word he has left behind on printed pages is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life he said his word was life john 6 63 the be part of the verse now that's exactly what he is john 14 6 i am the way the truth and the life romans 8 9 be part of it if any man have not the spirit of christ is none of his there it is he is spirit in his life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what jesus is hears the word so when a spirit born to me this is more than a quote when a spirit born spiritual man in faith takes the word into his heart and place it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man hallelujah when a spirit-born spirit-filled man takes a word in faith apart you know into his heart and plays it upon his lips wise the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man i mean when the disciples were there in the book of acts was it them speaking it says no then stephen was filled with the holy ghost and he preached or different ones you know it was god speaking through them they received an unction hallelujah and with that action they overcame hallelujah it wasn't them trying in their minds work out how to you know win the argument things no god just spoke through them it should be the same thing with you and i just let god speak let god be god as brother um paul said how this is how we should be amen why because we are anointed to speak we've have received an unction in this day i trust you have
