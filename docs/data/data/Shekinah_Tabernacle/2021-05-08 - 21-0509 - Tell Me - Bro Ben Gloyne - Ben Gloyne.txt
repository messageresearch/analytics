========================================

[Music] so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] um [Music] 10 years old and he brother ian had a framing shop in gisborne and and me and my his son luke were little mates you know we'd be kicking around and we had a job of getting these little clips and putting them on the back of a frame you know on a picture frame there's a small clip that you can use to hang the frame on the wall it was um our job to pull out a clip and put it on the back of whichever size of the the backing board was going in a certain size frame you know so there were piles of frames and we would go click click click and we would joke around that when we go to sleep that night all we're going to hear is click click but i think we got paid did we get paid brother i can't remember we probably got lunch or something [Music] but they were good times they were really fun times we had there so um yeah but we also sister esther milan as he speaking of it so where is esther she's there good morning sister good to have you here [Applause] and we have got i've seen you before bro but have you been here before i've seen you somewhere [Music] andy i've seen you before somewhere bro i don't know where but brother andy is here welcome amen oh yeah [Music] brother karma good good to have you here bro [Applause] brother kubin said we may have seating issues this morning you know because he was sort of doing the number of the guests that were coming in that and he's squeezing people in i've always thought that's a good problem to have people have said oh we need to get a bigger church you know to make sure there's enough seating but i've always thought no let's make it so there's not quite enough so then there's a bit of pressure to get to church early and get a seat you know and if you don't get a seat you've got to go out the back and you know i turned up a bit late the reason why is because in our christian walk we always have to be grateful you know if we are grateful in our attitude towards what the lord's done for us we won't get complacent you know it's very easy to get to be on to become ungrateful it's like the bible says the full soul loathes the honeycomb you know like when you're so full you you someone you offer you're offered something nice and you're like oh man i just can't be bothered that's that's not interesting to me at all but it says to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet not like we're hungry souls but you know we should be hungry for the lord all the time and and just a little warsaw from the lord is like wow this is so good you know and our attitude is if our attitudes like that will always be the spirit of god will always be moving amongst us if that's our attitude so there's something like a seating issue will create that bit of a i want to get there so yeah that's good um so you let's let's stand this morning oh and we've got um we've got pedro and ilana down the back welcome [Applause] [Music] i'm going to ask actually brother pedro if he would come and open and pray for us this morning amen god bless you all let's pray heavenly father might think oh lord we go to your presence god once more god to give you thanks for everything that you have done for us and we have come here today god to glorify your name and we have come with expectations god that you are

god bless you pastor william god bless you pastor joanna god bless you welcome welcome amen great to have you thank you musicians amen praise the lord great to have everyone here this morning i trust you all feel at home and welcome and hallelujah we're gonna have church today amen if you could turn with me uh if you got your bibles handy we're just gonna go to um luke chapter 16. amen hey man great to have deborah home god bless you welcome i don't know if you're welcome but yeah good to see you amen dear um luke 16 then we're going to read verse 13 down to 15 then we're going to go to the uh i'm going to go to acts 8 i mean luke 16 13 to 15 to begin with amen says here no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon and the pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things and they derided him and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god amen we're going to go to acts 26 read um from acts 26 8 down to verse 19 here i mean so acts 26 and 8 says so this is this is paul speaking to king agrippa speaking of his uh experience on the road to damascus says why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that god should raise the dead i really thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth which thing i also did in jerusalem and many of the saints did i shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death i gave my voice against them and i punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them i persecuted them even under strange cities whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me with them which journeyed with me and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecuteth thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and i said who art thou lord he said i am jesus whom now persecuteth but rise and stand upon my feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things in which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me whereupon oh king agrippa i was not disobedient under the heavenly vision amen let's just bow heads in a word of prayer let's commit our lives unto the lord this morning gracious heavenly father we want to thank you lord we knowing that the same god that lord you're the same one that met the apostle paul on the road to damascus lord is the same god we have met lord we want to thank you you are alive today and i just want to pray lord as we have read from your word we know anyone who can read lord can read your word but lord it takes you the great divine author to step forth and make it live and that's why we gather this morning as you come and take your word anchored into our hearts it would manifest itself for your glory lord we pray you take the service under your divine control lord may you just have preeminence in every life and lord when we leave these doors after the service is done may we be transformed change renewed lord fill with the holy spirit lord may the lost be found oh god the sick be healed lord jesus lord may those who are tormented have peace father may you grant it in jesus christ's name we ask amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning i'd like to take the opposite of uh of yesterday last last sunday where we're looking in the scripture and and and from this account we read in luke how you know the lord jesus speaking there he was the fountain of eternal life and he and his big hearts cry was come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and i will give you rest but the scribes and pharisees they had crafted their own religion their own idea of god and they basically said to him what we believe is god and you're not god and they turn down eternal life so i titled it you know don't tell me but so so this morning i'd like to take the opposite i like to talk about tell me i mean because you know we don't want to hold on to our traditions hold on to our beliefs if they're contrary to the word we need to get rid of those things and hold on to the word and the word only i mean so so we're going to look into a people who who instead of they said don't tell me and they were lost they said tell me amen and they went into glory because you know really at the end of the day we want to believe like a believer we want to believe like a saint we want to repent like a saint we want to be filled with the holy ghost like a saint we want to see god live like a saint amen we want to die like a saint we want to go to heaven like a saint that's what we want to do amen amen so you know we're not here just to go through a religious motion this morning but we're here to be come in contact with almighty god hallelujah i feel his presence is in the building amen right now so it's amazing the apostle paul you know every believer has a past and every every believer's past is not a good past it may be very bad in some eyes it may be not so bad in others eyes but you know it's amazing the apostle paul where where he would you know the things he would write about they weren't theory to him it was a revelation it was an experience and when he would he you know when he would begin to write to the ephesians in ephesians chapter 2 and he would begin to tell them how how we have been quickened by the holy ghost we've been made alive in christ how they went from dead traditions they were once walking according to the prince of the power of the year they are once dead and trespasses and sins but now they're alive in christ this wasn't theory to him he did not just sit there in some ivory tower and think of some nice thing to tell the church he lived that out you know many times we think of people who dead and and sins maybe they're drunks maybe they're drug addicts maybe you know you know they're into all kind of vices of the world but the apostle paul was in the same kind of darkness you know sin is sin it all has the same payment it all receives the same wages wages of sin is death right it doesn't matter what man quantifies it by sin is sin it doesn't matter how bad it looks how good it looks you get all paid the same at the end of the day amen but i don't want to have the devil for my boss i don't want to have unbelief for my boss i want god to be my boss because if he's my boss he'll pay me right and that payment is eternal life holy it's a rapture amen that's that's what we're looking for amen today so when he said you we've been quickened who are dead in trespasses and sins when in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience he knew what it was like to walk according to this world he was a very well-liked man he was very well thought of in his in his in his religious circles he would say he was the pharisee of the pharisees it was it took a lot of human effort to be a pharisee a lot of rules they had to keep a lot of religious duties they had to maintain so he was very well thought of he walked according to the course of this world but he was walking he realized according to the prince of the power of the year which is actually the devil and his angels he was being led amen by demon power but he came to a place in his life where he realized where he met the god he believed he was serving what a shock it would have been he thought he was serving great jehovah he thought he was doing god a service by finding all these fanatic christians who believe some you know this man was the messiah but he was nothing but beelzebub they were told and you know they stole his body and uh you know making all these wild claims they just got off the deep end some funny sect had risen up they thought you know he thought but you know he thought he was doing god a great service i'm going to find these people i'm going to stop this cancer spreading upon the earth and i'm going to put an end to this thing and you know he was very devout he did a very good job if we could look into the unseen realm if we could go back 2 000 years ago and look at the apostle paul in the flesh outwardly he would look like a devout man but if we could look into the unseen realm amen his his soul was as black as hell amen he was being led by a religious spirit that was his that was his lot but down on the inside of the inside of him i mean was a predestinated seed i'm so thankful it doesn't matter what our first birth produces you know there was a lot of things stacked up against the apostle paul amen but he was predestinated by god it didn't matter what he was doing god didn't change his mind about him he was ordained to be the first church age messenger he was ordained to write the new new testament you know lay that yo put your place grace and the law the right way and all those different things you know he was ordained for the job so so it doesn't matter this morning where you are right now you can play the part but what's on the inside of you i mean you know but you know we can be as lost as lost can be yeah the apostle paul was lost as lost can be he didn't look lost he looked very found and in his mind before he met the lord he would have thought i i know exactly who i am i'm of the tribe of benjamin i'm a circumcised jew i'm a pharisee you know look at look at all the things i've done but when he stepped into the presence of god he was so stunned he said lord who are you you know he believed that the god of moses you know he was serving that god but he found out he wasn't serving god at all he was serving some church and that's the worst thing we could ever do is serve some religion forget it we're here to serve jesus christ the word and that's the one we should serve and obey amen because he's our god you know brother brown poses the question did your church die for you did your denomination die for you who died for you jesus died for you the word you should serve him amen you know he was a very devout man concerning zeal persecuting the church this is his own this is his own testimony before he met the lord this is in uh philippians 3 concerning the church pers i mean concerning zeal sorry persecuting the church touching the righteous which is the of the law blameless so he was someone can be very religious very christian even kind of person but then if their nature has not been changed they're still walking with the devil you know you don't just kind of merge into this thing you've got to meet him you've got to meet the lord and he's here to be met he's not a nice idea he's a reality he's a person hallelujah but he had to come to a place that all those things but what things were gained to me those i counted lost for christ so he said yet doubtless i count all things for loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ so he took all of his religion and his tradition and his four best religion and everything and he said well i'm just going to count this but dung that i might win christ he didn't justify himself but i've been a good jew and this so therefore your god will wink at my ignorance and he'll you know no he counted all but dung and we have to count our old life done you know it's amazing the things that people people can have uh very good memories of what they used to be and that's a dangerous thing because if they have a good memory of what they used to be really still in their heart to do it and they've really just come under just the influence of god but they haven't surrendered it to god and you'll find that thing that they still have fond memories of will pull them right back into it but if they counted it but done i mean god chops them free hallelujah and that thing won't drag them back no more because they've been got a hold by god hallelujah amen so we should never i'm glad i'm not a sinner anymore i'm glad i'm not some drunk i wanted to be a professor of chemistry i'm glad i'm not on that road nothing no but nothing wrong with if you want to do that but you know the lord told me you're worshiping your education i let go of it i still finished my studies but it wasn't my all in all what's your all in all today should be the lord amen shouldn't be your past whatever struggle's going on how god's greater than those things hallelujah now can you imagine let's just go into the apostle paul's life again he would have been real happy with himself when those finely crafted written letters were were were authorized by the high priests maybe his seal was put upon them they are rolled up and they're placed into his hands he said saul now you've got authority i'm commissioning you to go and find the christians wherever they are these people and put them into prison and no doubt he would have held that letter because now he's got all of his authority all of that authority's been placed in his hand the power oh my i've got authority now and he would have been so excited because really that demon power was driving him yeah it's amazing how people get so angry against the truth he didn't just sit there and say well it's just another sect like pharisees or sadducees or herodians but there's something consumed in him i've got to stop this thing much like people today but all see before he met the lord it was a church sending him it was the high priest sending him and so he had all this behind him he thought no doubt you know what an incredible thing i've got the authority of the of the high council in jerusalem they have commissioned me to go do this job but then he came to a place where he met the lord on the road to damascus and he realized that the ones commissioning him to do the job was the wrong one to commission with you know the authority he had was just man-made authority it wasn't god-given authority and now he traded he traded being commissioned and sent and given authority from a man on earth he traded all that to be commissioned by god to be sent by god now it wasn't the high priest there in jerusalem backing him up and now god the the real high priest was now backing him up hallelujah what what an incredible assurance that would have been to swap a natural leadership and a natural backing up to a supernatural leadership and a supernatural backing up we can have the same kind of thing happen to us i mean you know god has sent you two you know we're not just here just to fill up you we're not just here to go through the motions we've been commissioned by almighty god go into all the world and preach the gospel cast out the devil wherever you find them i mean that this word would put on flesh it's not you know you know when you know when god sends a people he doesn't equip them just with an argument you think the apostle paul he's a very scholarly kind of man he's a very devout man he studied many long hours to get to his position but he would come to a place where he would tell the thessalonians now if i can find this here he said for our gospel came not unto you and word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake see told them this is not just an argument i'm bringing you i'm not just bringing you a collection of words that maybe tickle your ears i but this gospel that we have comes in power and that root word of that power and greek is where we get the word dynamite from it's going to be an explosion go on the bits of the devil are going to go flying all over the place when someone pushes the igniter down hallelujah power and in in the holy ghost and in much assurance so now he had someone to back him up that would actually come down and vindicate what was being said it wasn't just idle words coming forth but now god would prove what this man is saying this is my gospel it's not his idea it's not someone else's idea he says i didn't get this by learning i've got to buy revelation from jesus christ hallelujah and it should be the same thing with you and i there should be a life of the word backing up your life it should be more than just living and playing the part but god himself should back you up in everyday life amen if you're surrendered to him and he's living through you he should back up your life i believe that hallelujah because we should be able to say the same things the gospel that i preach you say well you're not a preacher but you hear deliver sermon live a sermon before you preach a sermon your life should be a living bible hallelujah so there's got to be the holy ghost backing you up i believe in the supernatural gospel we're being restored back to a supernatural gospel but this word is put on flesh hallelujah you know brother branham when he went to india he was met by the christian denominations there he says when i landed he said this he said what is the gospel you say it's the word not only paul said the gospel came not through word only but through the power and the manifestation of the word by the holy ghost to teach the words like reading a newspaper when i landed in india the methodist bishop and many of them came out to meet me they said brother branham we've heard of these things we've preached we preach the word we know more about theology perhaps and all you americans put together because the bible is an eastern book and that's right said but we want to see someone anointed with the holy spirit that can make it live again that's it we want somebody who can produce what the bible says it will do we otherwise we want to see faith that was once delivered to the saints there you are now jesus didn't go along like a totem pole jesus said one day passing through a group of people healed a man laying on a palate walked away and left the audience why they didn't ask him probably questioned him about him packing this on a sabbath day so forth he said verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what the father doeth what he shows the son the son does just what the father says in other words i can't do nothing till the father shows me a vision that i do what the father tells me to do that was the faith that was the faith that was delivered to the saints amen and then he would be interviewed by all the major religions in india that the hindus the sikhs the jains the buddhists there and they all had their time telling telling the prophet how little christianity was and how jesus was just you know there's no power in him and then he just said to them gentlemen you've all spent your time telling me how how how little my god is we're having church tomorrow you're welcome to come they all turned up i mean the prophet was standing there they're about to have a prayer line he saw a vision of a blind man that was going to receive his sight right in the right right being prayed for in front of them all and because he had that vision he had confidence and a man came up who was a sun worshiper he he spent all of his time staring at the sun and it made his eyes totally white because he thought he'd get some kind of i don't know whatever some kind of religious thing from looking at the sun and made him blind and then so brother brown addressed all the audience he said we can see this man's blind that's not you know you don't need any special thing to see that but now if your god is god if your god is god there was there was imams there muslims there you know buddhist sikhs jains all of them they're hindu priests he said if your god is god if you really worship the creator god come and pray for this man and that he'll receive his sight silence he said now to show you jesus christ is god hallelujah he started praying for the man the reason he could do that he said i felt like mount carmel on i mean i mean i mean elijah mount carmel harlow because there's a challenge going on you know god will back up his word god will back you up if you have a challenge comes against you other because it's not just the prophet's stories it's our stories too that same god is alive today hallelujah and so he prayed for the man his eyes were healed he went out there screaming shouting hallelujah beca and and brother abraham said to them if this man's eyes are healed you ought to give your life to jesus christ right now hallelujah why because people want to see the gospel in action they don't just want to hear an argument we've had 2 000 years of argument but what about a god living what about a god that's come out of history what about a guy that's put on flesh and a people what about a people that don't just talk about a message and quotes and put them together in arguments and different things what about the god that lives i mean manifest those quotes through a people takes the scripture makes it live that's what people are looking for people are looking for reality not an argument but reality hallelujah because it's just like the man who was born blind they couldn't say anything because the man was standing right there after jesus healed him hallelujah and we have testimonies in this room of a living god harlow that he is not dead he's not a history amy but he's a living god we've come in contact amen with the burning bush himself yeah what i love hallelujah is that there comes a place you know only certain things can quicken seed certain seed the apostle paul he had been at the feet of gamalia he'd learned incredible things according to the pharisee tradition that didn't awaken who he was i mean he'd been into the temple if i could put it that way that didn't quicken who he was god had moved on he had seen the passover lamb slain that didn't awaken him to who he was i mean because it couldn't quicken what was on the inside of him but then when he was on the road to damascus hey his mind was a certain way but god just overrode what he his plans you know you know god overrides the devil's plans hallelujah he actually intercepts you the devil has certain plans for your life or different people's life god just steps in and says oh no devil you can come this far but no more you can't go any further than this and he just overrides the devil's plans he cancels the devil's plans hallelujah and then so the devil's plans was paul or saul you're going to go to damascus you're going to be real successful destroying this thing and then you're going to move on that was the devil's plans but god said no no no you've got you think you're going to damascus for this but you're going to come and meet me i've got a i've got a divine appointment with you on the road about this spot on this hill hallelujah that was god's plans and the devil's plans got cancelled hallelujah because he came into the contact with the only thing that could awaken him that could quicken that seed on the inside of the inside of him was a god who gave that predestinated seed hallelujah now moses moses was the same kind of guy hallelujah he was raised in pharaoh's palace he had been in the presence of pharaoh he could have been the next pharaoh amen he he basically had his foot on the throne he was being groomed for the job we're gonna be careful what grooms us we don't want the world to groom us we don't want the world to condition our thinking i mean we don't want to be conditioned with this unbelieving spirit of the h i mean that just wants an instant answer all the time that can't wait upon the lord we don't want to be conditioned with that i mean we want to be conditioned by the holy ghost himself i mean he was conditioned a certain way his mother told him you know you're you're going to be the serpent bruiser you're going to be the deliverer you are the one god's going to use to bring our people out of out of egypt just like was told to to abraham that his seed was going to sojourn in a strange land 400 years we're going to bring them out with a mighty hand i mean they knew that someone was going to be ordained to do that job hallelujah it won't just make god come down and they do nothing no god was going to raise up somebody to bring a deliverance hallelujah and then so even his mother told him these things because by faith they had moses they saw him as a proper child they knew they knew that he was going to be the one to do the job but that even that didn't quicken him it it arose and you know it awakened a desire in his heart but he needed the one who gave the promise the one that gave the prophecy to fulfill the prophecy to come to him personally and make it known to him actually i have commissioned you to do the job i remember the thing is even in his own human desire all he ended up doing was killing one egyptian and then running away that was his success he had all the military knowledge he had all the science knowledge even the religious knowledge of you know of the egyptians but even with all that and he was the man who was ordained to do the job but he had to step into the presence of the one who gave the promise he had to step into his presence amen hallelujah now if i just find where i am i kind of think if i print my notes i can find where i am but it doesn't seem to be working anymore amen he says brother brahm says and hear his voice moses had been a military man and he thought that the way he was trained as being a military man that he could just kill them egyptians off with his hand just as good as god of what god did did you ever think of that everyone condemns moses for killing one man and he come back down there with with anointing of the holy ghost and killed the whole thing nobody said nothing about it he slew all of pharaoh's army but god was in it god wasn't in the first one you know we've got to be careful that god's in our first one and our second one and when moses just chucked full of church theology he was to be the next pharaoh we find him still not knowing god but one morning on the back side of the desert an old man of 80 years old his whiskers hanging way down low he had seen a burning bush and he turned aside to see what was going on and when he got near the bush he heard a voice god had to quiet him quieten him for forty years before he could ever speak to him and we don't have and we won't stay quiet 10 minutes so god can speak to us with all the rumble and bumble we have of this day and yet moses after 40 years stood there in the presence of that bush and that one voice that called him he knew more about god in five minutes after that than all the 80 years of training had taught him it made a different man out of him why because that burning bush quickened a life it made him come to life to actually do what he was ordained to do hallelujah now that same god has come down in this end time remember jehovah of the old testament is jesus christ of the new right same god amen hallelujah so that same one who is there with moses is the same god with us today that's why paul when he looked up saw that bright shining light says who are you lord that word lord means supreme one because he wouldn't just call anything lord because he's a scriptural hebrew believer so when he saw that light something in his mind said i've i've read about this somewhere and then after that experience he spent three years down in arabia searching the scripture to see who it actually met so he took his experience and matched it with the word of god and that's what we have to do i don't want to make my experience match you know i want my experience to match god's bible i mean that that way i will know my experience is scriptural because i can take it back into the word and that's the main thing the holy ghost will always point us back into the word and will never point us to a creed he'll never point us to a church or some idea of man it can never do that i mean but the holy ghost himself will point us back into his word because the holy ghost inspired people to write this word he is the author of this book hallelujah so and and and that's why now that's why the apostle paul he was so you say flabbergasted by that experience but he began to find out that this one this jesus was the god of his fathers hallelujah amen now when god when god quickens us he wants he makes us alive to the promise of of our day he doesn't make us alive to our past he kills our past the blood of jesus christ annihilates our past i mean it's not something that god just has in a cupboard to bring out and hold against you when you be naughty that's not how god operates no but the blood of jesus christ cleanse us from all sin i mean actually annihilates our past hallelujah that that now just like when moses crossed the red sea they could look back and they could see their tormentors their their oppressors their slave masters were dead in the red sea so their past the things that tormented them became drowned it's the same thing when we can when we pass through the blood of jesus christ and we can look back and see those tormenting spirits we can see that unbelieving spirit those generational curses we can see all those things that were beating us down make us think we'll never make it we can never overcome we can never we can never conquer we can look back and see it dead when miriam turned back an 80 year old woman and shot dead harlow she took up a tambourine and she began to worship and praise god she began to thank god because the reality of it struck her soul that one that was whipping me the other day he's floating face down in the sea oh he's dead he can't torment me no more i'm on my way to canaan's fair land hallelujah it caused a real worship although you know how pentecostal worship's the oldest worship there ever is it's not a new thing it didn't come in and it didn't come at azusa street in 1906. this has been before the foundation of the world i mean because job was asked where were you when the sons of god the morning stars shatter for joy holy but now it's just being inspired expressed in flesh now it's just come down into flesh it's not now in the mind of god anymore but now it's been manifested in flesh amen when john saw the lamb take the book hallelujah when he saw the lamb step forth claimed the inheritance of adam's fallen race i mean he began to shout i mean the silence was ended the crying was over the despair was gone i mean he wasn't weeping and crying no more oh yo he wasn't crying because he didn't find himself worthy that's not what it means he was crying because he saw no one was worthy sure there were angels that had never fallen they could have been worthy but they weren't a kinsmen to you and i they weren't a man otherwise he saw no man all the prophets were there because it's symbolic of all the redeemed through the ages so moses was there joseph was there all the righteous all the way down through were there but they we're all born lost doesn't matter how righteous we are we're all born by sexual desire all born with a fallen nature but one came and he wasn't born that way he was our kinsmen but he wasn't born by sexual nature he was created in the womb of mary hallelujah he became our kinsmen and then an angel said to john don't weep no more john the season of weeping has come to an end you don't need to cry and lament no more you don't have to be worried is this whole thing in jeopardy or not but the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed and he looked and he saw stepping forth was a bleeding bloody lamb holy that it overcome wrestled with and overcome hallelujah and then he began to rejoice and then now the lamb took the book and brother ram says it's the most sublime act in all all of scripture because that book is a symbol of you hallelujah he says the same as as as boaz claiming ruth taking her as his bride hallelujah and then so so so now the time of crying has come to an end he saw the lamb open the book hallelujah and brother braham says that john must have got next to himself because he saw beyond the curtain of time himself john saw john up in eternity and he began to rejoice realizing i've made it hallelujah i'm in my theoph and he's already over there oh that my eternal body is already over there if this body be dissolved we have one waiting in the heavens we already have it waiting in the heavens it's not maybe it's there it's waiting but it's calling you and i i mean that's why when the word came your way you surrendered to it god filled you with the holy ghost because you have a body waiting in the heavens and to me if we could just keep that before us amen all problems should just vanish away all trouble should go you say i'm on a big trial but you've you're going to make it i mean you're going to make it you've got eternal representation in heaven amen the blood has already purchased your ability to go into that body hallelujah i think they should just make all oh i've got a big complex don't worry about it little by little you'll take the land i was listening yeah i was reading the scripture the other day god told the children of israel i'll give it to you little by little i mean to you across jordan but there'll be a day too you'll take jericho and then day three you'll take this and day four you're gonna take this place and yeah little by little so you say i've got a lot of problems in my life don't worry little by little i never had a good dad you know i never had a good relationship with my father he hated me just just walking little by little you'll see god is a real father he loves you he cares for you he worries about you you're precious in the sight i never had a good relation with my mom little by little hallelujah i have never had any friends little by little complex i got this addiction i've tried to find a place to belong little by little you'll see where you belong i mean you don't belong in the world we don't belong in drugs or the pub or wherever where i used to be i found one day i belong in the word of god i mean that my identity is being a christian not because i have decided because god has declared it hallelujah amen so don't worry about complexes don't worry about giants caleb and joshua said they're just bred for us that was his report sure they're big sure they're intimidating sure they may have big cities and whatever but they just had their bread they're going to be our daily food what's your daily food what are you going to have for breakfast tomorrow i'm going to eat up my complex i'm going to eat up my problem i'm going to eat up my problems whatever personality things i'm going to eat it up what about lunch we're going to serve the same thing it may be dressed up a different way maybe roast this way baby cereal this day whatever but hey we're just going to eat it all up it's actually my you know it's amazing trials bring character trials bring strength if you didn't have any opposition how could you get strong i mean it's like a boxer in the ring you know when they're training they get someone exactly like their opponent hallelujah because they want to beat their opponent on the on that day because it's only those few rounds in the ring on the day matter hallelujah and they train against they they get someone who's exactly like their opponent and they begin to train but it makes them stronger maybe they're not very good with a left hook but their opponent is with the right or whatever and and so so they get blindsided all the time but eventually after the frustration leaves they'll see actually this is for my good this trial is actually strengthening me it's building character in me it's making me walk you know the devil studies watches you how you work with the word and he exploits that weakness so if you're real loose and don't even read your bible he'll exploit it if you're only looking through a certain way through the scripture he'll exploit that if you just have a very legalistic kind of way of looking at the scripture he'll exploit that he'll raise something up in your family it'll make you eat eat dirt basically eat your words you know he'll do that because he'll exploit that wing if you're very liberal you know with your walk then god looks i mean i mean the devil will exploit that too but it builds character challenge we need challenge we need trials therefore our good they are more precious to us than gold hallelujah and the price of gold has gone up recently so the price so the value we put on our trials we should put a greater value on them because god has allowed it because he wants to build a strength hallelujah for us to overcome the next challenge can you imagine the faith that was just built in the children of israel when they're about to cross jordan how we're going to cross this river it's springtime it's flooding time if god was really god he would have brought us here in the wintertime or or summertime when the river's real low but god brings us to places that seem impossible and they had no boats they weren't they weren't maritime kind of people i mean but so god is going to show you now this is not it's not going to be you crossing the river i'm going to make a way across the river and then so the so the levites they carried the ark which represented the word amen and they carried it and the waters parted and they crossed over on dry ground which shows me now if the word is carried over the heart of a levite over a minister i mean that word ministered will produce an a a way across something that is uncrossable why because faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god that's why it's very important don't sit there like a chair enter in this is for you and i it's for me you know i come to church i say lord speak to me but you're standing here now but lord you can still minister to me even if it comes out of here hallelujah and so so their faith would have increased saying well you know as as god was with moses so he's now with joshua and their faith would have raised because now they're crossed in an impossible way but now they've come to jericho they think how how on earth can we take it and joshua looks around he's trying to see any weak points in the wall or whatever he sees there's no way it can be done and he's looking there he's meditating on the lord in the morning and a man comes with a sword drawn and he chat and he draws his own sword saying you for us are against us because why because joshua's on a war footing are we on a war footing today amen but then but then that man says i'm not for you or against you but i've come as the captain of the host of the lord so now god had come down to take over the whole campaign so he says i'm not for you against you i've come to take over this whole battle and then they took jericho in a supernatural way how would have increased faith hallelujah because little by little you'll take the land but little by little your faith will raise to meet the challenge that's about to come hallelujah amen amen so trials are good for us you say yo we need adversity hallelujah amen now so god quickens us to who we are to his word he's not here to make alive our pastor our complexes all those things you keep walking with the lord he'll take care of everything he's very good at it if he can put this planet here with life on it in a perfect part of the galaxy to actually look at all the stars and everything and put life here and the seasons work you know if we're here next year we'll go through a different set of seasons and we'll still be here hallelujah he's very good yo nature the only problem with nature is when man interrupts it right so you know god is very good at his business you know they can they know when comets come back around it could be hundreds of years like hayley's comet different ones because god knows the orbit of that comet because he said it you're going to go that far a few hundred years around this way then you come back around hallelujah if god can set the stars in the in the heavens and they're all in motion they're not static they're all in motion and they all come back around at the same time can he not look after you and i hallelujah amen but you see we must have the word quicken that will make it live but you see now god must be the christian in us now if we go to the book of ezekiel and chapter 36 we're just going to we're just going to read this here because remember this is what i've been talking about is the effects of saying tell me tell me it's not you won't don't tell me god it's actually tell me god become my head change my life mold me shape me into the image of your word not to the image of a church but the image of the word so in ezekiel 36 the lord has this promise here and and we're going from verse 24. he says for i'll take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land amen so there's going to be a gathering taken place we know this is not to a g geographical even though it talks about a natural country here but you know this is not talking about a geographical location for the christian right but that land that is ours is the word of god we have come back to the land of the word hallelujah it's flying with milk and honey hallelujah there's all good things in this land there's healing in this land there's peace in this land there's love in this land there's a statue of the perfect man in this land there's faith amen there's overcoming power there's healing there's a rapture in this land hallelujah they're speaking in tongues prophecy all the gifts of the spirit they're all in the land we've come to live on this land then i'll sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean what are we washed by the water of the word amen you'll be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you hey i had a lot of idols i was an idol house hollywood idol sports idols drinking games everything idols education idols whatever they're all in here i had to be cleansed from them he said a new heart will i also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i'll take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you in heart of flesh so he has to change our hearts from a heart of stone to a heart of flesh to even accept that the word is true but we can't just stop there right we're going to go all the way in amen it wasn't just that they left egypt they had to go into the promised land hallelujah so so god has to change our stony hearts to a heart of flesh we'd even receive that the word is true he has to change our human spirit because many times we can't even live with ourselves maybe i'll just say i couldn't even live with myself so he had to change my spirit amen we get a new spirit we quit our drinking you know we quit our gambling we put our running around with women all different kind of things like that i mean and you had a new spirit he does that but now you know he says why we couldn't even live with yourself with the spirit you did have you couldn't live with your neighbor you couldn't associate with the next man on the next corner you couldn't associate with these christians why you would have had an or you had an awful spirit so he has to give you a new spirit i'll give you a new heart and you spirit now watch and i'll put my spirit in you there's the difference i'll put my spirit in you now this is the next verse and i'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them so now it's not just coming up to a place and getting a new spirit so i've been set free from the world that's an incredible work of god now my heart is a heart of flesh i can actually receive the word as true that's an incredible work of god but don't just stay there you got to keep going until he puts his spirit within you and that will cause you to walk in his statutes which is his word so it's actually god comes in this is what happens when you say i will amen tell me god tell me to cause the surrender that god now comes in and he his spirit within us causes us to walk according to his word and and you shall keep my judgments and do them so it's not us trying to you know address you know little williams nine months old to try and dress him can be a mission you know he put him on the changing table he's already trying to turn over and get on his hands and feet and she got to pin him down like well you know and you know it can be a real mission and that's like us many times you know and you know if he gets a bit older he'll try and dress himself and that will be a mission too and many times that's us trying to be a christian we try and put the word on to make it fit us and we're wrestling and god's trying to you know he just says just just just give up just surrender your whole heart to me just give yourself to me that's what he's trying to do he's trying to dress us in the robe of his righteousness but we're wriggling and we're trying to do it ourselves and you know we just start crying get upset i can't live this and i failed again i've got this trouble and you know but there comes a time where you give up hallelujah you know sometimes i look at william i say we can do this the easy way oh the hard way and the hard ways for me you know sometimes it's the easy way but you know that's what but that's how it needs to be is when his spirit comes within us then he causes us to walk in a statute and to keep his judgments and do them hallelujah that's the result now of someone who says tell me amen brother braham says and why is it so hard why is it so that many christians find it hard to live a christian life he says now we got all kinds of everything for coming and we haven't got it till you get it but brother you haven't got it until there is the spirit of god comes from heaven and changes your life and makes the fruits of your life a different person by their fruit you shall know them that's the reason you have so much ups and downs you get a new spirit you quit your drinking you get a new spirit you quit your lying you get a new spirit you can do almost anything with that new spirit but that isn't what god's talking about a new spirit he said i'll give you now watch i'll give you a new heart and a new spirit why he'd have to give you a new spirit to live for him while you couldn't even live with yourself with the spirit you did have you couldn't live with your neighbor you couldn't associate with the man next door on the corner you can associate with these christians why you had an awful spirit so he has to give you a new spirit i'll give you a new heart and a new spirit now watch and i'll put my spirit in you that's the difference i put my spirit in you hallelujah amen so we're living in an hour where there's a people in the earth and i'm just going to kind of wrap this up short and sharp here we are i know we've got rapture chairs but you know we're not going to sit there till the rapture you know i trust you appreciate the news anyway you know we're living in an hour where god has put on flesh again in a people hallelujah it's gone from argument into reality amen where there is a people that are quickened by the holy ghost that the word lives in them again amen the holy ghost will always point to the word it will never point to creed of denomination amen always point to the word he died to confirm that word and make that word a positive he all he died so he could himself into that word he's the quickening life that makes the word live again that was his purpose of dying that he could still project himself through his church and make every word through every age act exactly the way it's supposed to act he is the dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors so forth here's the dynamics that works that and it's worked by dynamic power which is called it's like fire that fires off the gas like a spark plug making a spark here's the fire in that combustion chamber that when the word or the gas is poured over into that combustion chamber he's the one that sets her of fire he is the one that confirms it he is the power of the resurrection he is god he is the fire that's what he is hallelujah he is a consuming fire hallelujah now if he manifested the word because he was the word he didn't come just with a debate he said if you can't believe me believe the very works for they testify of me so if he came in that way and there was a supernatural vindication of who he was amen and if we are part of him right by the atonement atonement means at one minute he's made us one with him so now it's no longer us that lives but christ lives in us would then not we have that same manifestation of a spirit living through us amen amen we are living in that hour where i yeah maybe i'm just getting old but i just keep repeating myself you know but a people who say tell me lord have the manifestation of that towel right they actually have a life a testimony of proof that what god has told them it is living hallelujah moses met the pillar of fire there in the burning bush eighty-year-old man sticking his hand went down into egypt he said pharaoh let my people go god sent him down there and god went in him to do the job and the thing is he did it one man invasion took a people out of a nation hallelujah the apostle paul met that same god and wherever he went sure there's a lot of trouble you know there'll always be trouble where the truth is the devil loves to upset us right you know we get upset our families get upset tension comes in trouble we should just realize hey that's all part of the job that's all in the job description we should expect trouble hardly because the devil wants to upset us get us all tense and tight and stressed and worried that we take our eyes off god and onto natural things amen so so we should be very uh prepared for such things but he you know it's amazing the apostle paul chained to a roman soldier wrote most of the bible in a dungeon he received mighty revelations from god in a dungeon chained to a soldier or chained to a wall hallelujah he could walk with god chained to a dead man because the soldier wasn't made alive in christ and and we can have all kinds of excuses for reasons why we can't serve god the way we want to the apostle paul served to serve god the way he wanted to in spite of all the obstacles hallelujah god's holy ghost is here to help us cause us to overcome more things amen amen hallelujah now what about you and i you know the scripture god has to interpret the scripture to us what do you mean by that i was going to finish with this what i mean by that is it's not just making it make sense but make it live so when he said lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover lord interpret that to me and what happens he leads you to lay hands upon the sick and they get better you actually see the manifestation of it in my name thou shall cast out devils lord what does that mean he anoints you and you cast out a devil right you see a devil leave someone their lives are changed hallelujah speaking new tongues lord you've got to interpret that to me what is he doing anointing you speaking in your tongue he causes the word to be make it he brings it to pass in your life that what i mean by him interpreting it now you know all the revelations we've received they need to be interpreted to us they need to be made alive so it goes from just a theory to a reality hallelujah you know brother branham was there and he was hunting squirrels and he was meditating on the scripture if ye say to this mountain be thou removed cast to the sea it shall move you don't down your heart it shall move and it's wondering what is that really you know how does it really work and the lord came down he asked him what are you looking for squirrels well he's you've been asking about that scripture you just speak the word he said well let us scroll up here on this and he shot it he says visions don't bleed and they ate the squirrel and they said well the you know how about and then and then the lord said well how many do you want he said well three or five i can't remember he said well uh let it appear in this tree where squirrels aren't a squirrel a pet he shot it he ate it so god came down and interpreted that scripture to him it shouldn't be the same thing with you and i lord come and make the word alive to us hallelujah hallelujah but you see now the antichrist spirit wants to come into the church make it formal cold and powerless but the holy ghost is present to make the church on fire alive and full of power amen not formal and powerless but alive and the holy ghost quickened by his spirit amen but the thing is now as my title is tell me who's doing the telling will be manifested in your life so if a spirit is telling you you're worthless and you'll never make it and you're not important and no one loves you what what do you see in a life someone's depressed withdrawn and depressed right because they're listening to a spirit the thing doing the telling comes and lives in them that is not the voice of god we're important to god we're the apple of his eye one soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds if he went to calvary just for you he would have done it well just for once he would have gone hallelujah so now it's the one that we're listening to will be manifested in you and i hallelujah now that's why it's very important forgive me if i feel like i'm going into another subject but i'll close with this statement that's why during the book of revelation it says listen to him the heaven ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church that voice is the word of god to the church now we must have a spiritual ear to hear what the spirit says and we've got to speak that same word forth that means that at that if god says you're more than a conqueror we're more than a conqueror if we're overcomers if our faith has overcome the world amen that that is the sow if we are accepted in the beloved in jesus christ then we are that's what the spirit tells us that's what we're going to speak forth amen if the devil will be under our feet devil get under my feet in jesus christ's name if there is power in the blood to overcome all temptations troubles trials cleanse us from all unrighteousness hallelujah let it be unto me according to the word lord hallelujah this is how we're living it never ever can have a negative confession have a positive confession in the name of jesus

you will leave me now in jesus name just as musicians keep playing i was just thinking this morning as brother ben was preaching you know we've either got fear and doubt or faith fear or faith are the two options that we've got and when the spies went and searched out the land they came back with a report and those that had fear and doubt heard the report a certain way based on their fear and their doubt they said wow were there big giants there yeah they were big giants well were there fortified cities yes there were fortified cities did they look big and strong yes they looked big and strong they and they were being fearful based on what these giants could do to them what the people in the land could do to them like are there thousands and thousands in these fortified cities yes there are thousands and thousands in there and they were becoming more fearful as they were being told this report based on fear but think about it this way when caleb and joshua heard the report their report was based on faith right amen so they saying so that caleb and joshua would ask also there were giants there really there were giants so they were really big yeah they were really big it's good but they look real strong yeah they look real strong did they have big fortified cities yeah they had big cities and they're getting more and more excited did they look quite hard-working people yeah they did this is gonna be good if they're big and strong means you've got to eat heaps their vineyards would be nice and big they're they're they want to be like if they're fit and strong and and work hard they would have built all sorts of machinery to till the fields you mean we walk into big fortified cities do they have watch towers everywhere yeah they have watchtowers that's so good we don't need to build them ourselves you know they probably had water coming through the city it's all irrigated for us imagine if you had to come into a land with lazy people that don't do nothing they run away when you see them what's the land going to look like they'll be run down nothing near these they would have turned up and had to do all this work because the place was run down these giants worked hard man their metabolism was going so fast at it it was a lamb flying with milk and honey because they had to eat a lot of food man they're working hard and all the vineyards and that depends how you look at it they were so excited they're like let's go man this is all laid out before us we just gonna chase a couple of giants away but aside from that there's no problem it all depends on how you look at it and everything that we go through there's a blessing in all of it amen amen praise the lord let's um let's just sing our god is awesome as we go this afternoon hallelujah my god is awesome
