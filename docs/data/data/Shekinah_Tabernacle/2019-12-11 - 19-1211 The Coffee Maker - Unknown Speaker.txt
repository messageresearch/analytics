we've got a new song leader yeah I think he's got he's got some of the best professionals in the world they're residing in his house so I think I think we'll make it he made no thank you from the bottom of my heart that was awesome and and it worked out like I had it in my mind you know I yeah I'm supposed to be the bandleader as well but yeah anyway so I asked brother Paulie well he song lead and you know he's you know brother boy puts up his hand yes let's make it working and I I just it turned out beautifully so right so this is my first time with the presentation so let's let's see how that goes no pressure there at the back technicians you will make me look good or not so we'll try that anyway so brother Caleb if you bring up a yes let's see there okay hopefully you can read that apologies if it's a bit too small I'll try and read that tonight so this is our I'll get to the subject now so we'll read the scriptures first and then I'll introduce you to what what was laid on my heart and it's a while ago so but maybe before I jump in this is son this is a Sunday School lesson okay now when I say Sunday school listen I don't mean to look down on anybody if you've ever been in a proper Sunday School lesson Exhibit A to my left any of those rooms is for me a proper Sunday school there's this substance there's this teaching there's lessons that's coming out there there's truth right and 100% truth and and and in word and so I'm bringing you that I'm bringing you a bit of a a condensed version of hopefully a sermon that could be taught and if you have some grace for me this evening it's a it's a subject that's dear to my heart and if you can if you can watch it from from your spiritual lens your spiritual eye you might you might get something out of this so please be gracious it's practical for the kids to to relate hopefully they don't relate too much okay anyway I don't want to it's don't want to spoil it yet let's read the first scripture the first scripture is Isaiah 55 we will start from verse 11 if you can't read there again apologies for that it's our 55 from verse 10 [Music] verse 10 for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and make of the bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall psyche shake forth sorry break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands I love that I love that and the next one is Romans 8 Romans 8 from verse 17 I've got one quick more Scripture before I sorry after that and then you may take your seats so Romans 8 from verse 17 and if children then here's here's of God and joint his with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also glorify together be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us in us for the earnest expectation this is what I want to get to the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God there's a waiting there's expectation of Hope excitements coming over the pulpit now quite a bit and then the last one is 1 Peter 4 first Peter 4 verse 11 if any man speak let him speak as Oracles of God if any man minister let him do it as of the ability of which God giveth that God and all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and Dominion for ever and ever amen bless the reading of his word you may be seated Saints and again I ask you that it can be various for my message today so I'll just go back to that previous slide that would have given you indication or a hint on the on your right little picture if you don't know what it is by the fool you may not answer but that the next one will probably give you a bit more of a of a hint yes yes that's what I want to hear so my subject tonight the coffee maker something that's dear to my heart if you know me and look I've been I've been part of this message end and and and since I've been I've never looked to the world and to my my interests and everything the same right the Lord brought forth aney he unveiled to me a lot of things you reveal to me and while you walk in your daily walk daily life you go to work you go to home you play golf you played you know go fishing you're not looking the same way as you as you look before you're doing the same things right and I wanted to bring you I don't want to jump too much ahead but I don't want to I wanted to bring like a little glasses like you know you get these three-dimensional glasses one of the boys at homes got a book and it's got massive tires and 4x4 cars and the mud looks like it's spitting you know out of the pages when you put on those glasses take it off and it's all blurry it's all - can't figure it out put it on and it comes alive right so I want you I'm pleading with you tonight to put on those spiritual lenses that spiritual eyes and everything that I will tell you look at the spiritual meaning the spiritual significance behind it and while while I've been studying and researching all this about coffee I which is I was amazed by all the little tidbits that that I could relate spiritually and put it back to the word and and look at like wow am I this this is this has been a real revelation so yes please follow with me okay so I talked about glasses right okay next slide let's see now this is this is my house so on your left is a coffee tree a small one it's busy trying to grow the in the in the backyard for multiple reasons it should fail but it is still going there's still new leaves on the top I'm watering it and giving it what I can it's going on well on the right might look a bit weird okay so we've got do we have I've got a pointer here some way is that this thing ha ha ha so that who could tell me what's that it's a popcorn maker a popcorn maker I roast my coffee with a popcorn maker so through all my research and my my excitement when I saw big old drum coffee machines and that's when I saw it just before I saw the price tag I thought ok let's turn it down a notch so I've done my oven roasting it works I've done my K Dec barbecue scott'll dry roasting it works sort of I think Brotherhood month still got a video of that that was my very very first one I put the K Dec dry inside the the kitchen ironically and I was Brian's just smoking everything out and just thought it was yeah it was it was fun it was fun right and then there is a single origin mojo green bean from Tamala so what's next next is so that's the inside of the packet that is a a unroasted or green bean and it's a Rebecca bean we won't go into the detail and on the right is what they call husking or chefing right so you can't see anything on this being you can have it up close you won't see any anything else that's supposed to be on this coffee bean that needs to fall off that needs to change or disappear or whatever and again I'm bringing you back to the spiritual reasons now right there chefing so remember that okay so let's see what do I have now ah okay the into the in product right so that's that's after my roasting after it comes out of the coffee or the popcorn maker probably about seven minutes roasting in that thing it's about 30 grand or sorry probably about 60 70 grams of coffee in depending what type of bean it is weird it's from which origin so we call we that's not like a professional they call the the important coffee beans the coffee belt or the bean belt so if you look across the globe you've got South America Colombia in the in Geneva Papua New Guinea Vanuatu all those places that's got a high altitude good rainfall moisture not too cold Wellington so perfect perfect conditions for for growing good coffee right a good old brother of mine brother Joseph Bayley done and and Taranaki gave me some of his or some of the local Roasterie coffee and that's me trying to trying to make something pretty like like that but that was me I just want to say that was me yeah so exciting stuff from the beginning to the end I'll take you through the process now of yeah what what it's like now this is a I just like the picture you know pyramid so here at the bottom we have the world coffee of the commercial grade coffee those that like McDonald's coffee hands up while being coffee all those a Starbucks I don't know how to spell that even then I don't like it then then you have the preparation coffee I would say there's a there's a there's a few local Roasters around that's that's probably sitting in that then don't worry about this the standard label goes so here this this is now where they put a label on it it's a bronze medal or a sole votes you know part of the gold standard order and we get into the single origin so I showed you that green bean from Guatemala so this would be from a roasted perspective they would roast it to perfection for that particular country or bean and then you have this state coffee now I can mention one and that's the Blue Mountain coffee I'm still after it people on the web all the locals if you know where I can get some Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee single origin I would be most grateful it's probably about two hundred and ten dollars per 100 gram if I remember correctly yes they said at the top the cream at the top spiritual reasons then we sit at the top it's we're not boasting we're not but we've walked this walk right we've we've been in the commercial grade we've been you know the McDonald's coffee we've gone up the ladder because of Revelation because of surrender because of a multitude of things because of a geographical move a shake that the Lord had to give you to shake off their checking so we'll get to that now right and then here's just well it's a bit small sorry about that but this is a estimation of two million and eighty three cups of coffee every five minutes which equates to around I think an estimated 1.6 billion cups being drank each day across the globe the step was something like eight eight hundred million cups that McDonald's would serve only in the US a day something I can't remember it is it's significant right so I just wanted to show you some fun stats and what do I do when I have time off so now we're getting into the nitty-gritty Coffee is not better doesn't matter whoever tells you what coffee proper coffee is not better you do not have to add sugar really trust me and I've walked that walk so I've been I've been in South Africa and I've had my Rico cough my Rico Hassad Rico Frisco Rico Frisco and Rico coffee you know two spoons of coffee three spoons of sugar you know and you'll have eight cups of that today an area where it's just awful right back we know is a student we had this little regular ketchup thing after church on a Sunday evening we'll go over to what they call it's a franchise called mug and bean and mag and bean has got about five or six urns full of coffee different flavors and you can you you you you pay for a cup or a mug and you can go fill up as much as you want throughout that day or night so after church we will go there that's probably about eight o'clock or so and we'll sit there till whenever because of his students right so we never really I didn't you know drank alcohol or smoked a lot and that bake was not smoked a lot drank a lot and smoked nothing but I drank a lot of coffee so I think the one night I finished about eleven probably of those cups those mugs and that's that's when I found the revelation that that will keep you awake yeah so I've had that revelation I've walked that road now what I have there up there is revelations 22 verse 18 for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto Him the plagues that are written in this book first time I've read this I said thank the Lord I'm part of the message there's nothing at is nothing away but when you read church he's talking about you as well he's talking about a bit individual walk and I started thinking oh my if God's that serious you can be in any organization denomination you can have your own personal walk you need to make very very sure you're not adding or taking away from the word and it's gonna be hard it's gonna be tough some of the things are so easy I think who talked about it brother nd you talked about it last Sunday it's easy to stop smoking and in some people's lives some I'm swearing and and drinking and all this kind of that's the easy bit right and that's when when God's got out there's big old vital what's a vital in English pick ax picks X probably a hammer and chisel here we go chisel hammer and a chisel and he's standing and he's knocking out you know big chunks that falls off I'm trying to unfreeze some of the stuff in my deep freezer so I'm there with a knife and a hammer and everything to get all the ice loose bit jumps fall off but one shot with the with the chisel on your arm is going to be ouch right but if someone comes with a little sandpaper and do this that's gonna be significant that's gonna be hurtful that's gonna be so it's gonna maybe take a bit longer to heal than just one with a chisel right and that's where I am that's where you are we we are being polished we are being sanded we're being made to perfection in His image he wants to see himself in us now not finished black coffee no sugar no cream okay I drink some cream some some some milk but what I want to read here for you is and thou shalt shall possess the gate of his enemy this 1962 brother branham sees an organization a church that's the reason why we find our organizations falling by the wayside is because when it comes to the tests what tests God's Word that's the test God's Word is the test what we do what a bunch of men sees do or will we do what God says do that's the difference there it comes the days of Dwight moodily moody the the days of Finney Sankey Knox Calvin Spurgeon all the rest of them those spiritual men are like this the organization's followed after them they didn't started there was the I think that's how I read this there was a sincerity in their heart and gods placed the message there to bring forth but but people crowded and and that's it that's that's that's the sayeth and we need to go and it was in that day but again it's a spiritual its individual walk you have to you have to do not form and that's what it comes now they've got a bunch of men back V that's cut their way into that each one believing this and that adding a little here taking with a little away V adding a little until finally they made an organization out of it that's the coffee tree so on the left as as all the cherries on the right is just that previous beta these are there's a nice white flower that comes around springtime and then late summer they become this this red color there's a bit of green it's in a bit of a yellow orange E and then and then red that red means ready red means they ready to be picked the beans or sorry that so that yeah but cheery consists out of out of the out of flesh that you see there the red and inside there's two beans we refer to it as beans but it's actually seed and again put your spiritual hats on he's talking about seed inside what you see there I can't do anything with it it looks beautiful the flowers nice but there's a cheery coming and it's red the flesh on the outside is beautiful everything on the outside right you can you can color it you can wash it you can polish it it's not useful to me I can't use that it needs to be proceeding needs to be refined and needs to what needs to do what's what's inside needs to come out right and that's where I want to get now so how do I go on here there we go in 1953 brother branham said we are in his making so we are perfected in three soul body and spirit and our body is controlled of nerves and bloods and cells flesh three all perfected in three so I thought wow okay you've got this flesh and then the two beans or seeds inside and I thought if the ones that spirit maybe in the ones the soul they outside the flesh right if what what we striving for is to to let our spirit become what is our soul what is our driving factor right that's that that's when when you alone when you when you are when you are away from fellowship when you are when the when the tire hits the road that's when the the white dog and black dog wants to fight yeah every time right and that's growth that character that building there when we'll get to that part of the character building I want my spirit of my soul to look exactly the same right and how do I get there well a bit through a bit of trial but yeah I just thought man and three that's that's basically what it's it's it's it's it's made out of out of those three but I need to get the flesh out of the way to get to my spirit in my soul right so the best way to process to get there is what they call a wit process so this is where this is where my journey started when I sorry to burst your bubble but the sunday-school has had a very condensed elation on this way back and I thought but I'm not done yet I want to I want to just dig in a bit more so sorry for those that that some of those rings a bell for kids I think they might have forgetten already right so the best way to process those beans is what they call a wit process to get a clean green bean but quotes oh sorry the scripture I've got out there everyone knows that then Peter said unto them drip pens and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so just as an FYI there on that right hand side is the washed which most of the most of the organic growers and and the top Markey growers would use so I've got this the squirts from brother Brennan this the great servant Moses beautiful type of it when Jesus said in the wilderness that he was the rock that was in the wilderness now one of the people screamed back they that day when he came into Jerusalem riding on that horse at little mule and they were crying those Nazarenes crying Hosanna Hosanna to him that cometh in the name of the Lord some of those self-styled starchy priests it'd make them hold their peace why he said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out what does the rocks the rocks has been washed by the same waters and watered by the word they have to cry out that if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out something had to take place and what I what I love about this is this whole process and I and I love nature and be so close to God's creation there's a law there's there's something that needs to happen in a certain order everything needs to go through a certain a period of its life a season and everything and it comes to just look to creation to find out what is what what is God busy with there's a you know summer winter spring autumn there's a season and something's happening in that even in nature and even if the rocks are going to cry out then how much more do we need to cry out then and get on this road that's mean for us okay so you can't see the green bean anymore here this this has been roasted and on that green bean I wish I brought you some sorry about that is you can see nothing it's there's a bit of a shine on it but I can't use it like I can't eat it I can't drink it like that it's horrible it doesn't smell like anything where's Jessie Jessie can you remember I brought that green coffee beans in that it smell like anything that didn't smell like anything I yeah so I had three different beans there I had the green bean and I and I roasted it to about two minutes nothing happened maybe a bit of chefing fell off roasted to three or four minutes start off a bouquet and I'll get to that now the smell smells like almost like a bread like smell of baking bread you know but you're expecting a coffee smell so no way through this process you are smelling coffee it's it's different smells and burns and all this to get this chafing off but nothing about coffee so yes the the roasting process starting now so from the green bean you can't see any any of this husk or this chafing and even before that first crack so now I'm pouring it into my roaster okay a popcorn machine and switch it on starts with a hot air and it's circulating around the bean and it's heating up all the beans quite evenly and before so there's this different stages of this coffee you get a first crack and it sounds like a popcorn cracking and a few minutes later you get a second crack or very softer crack that's when I start getting excited because I know okay time is right I can chuck it out and and and and start looking at cooling this process down and even before that first crack so Mike popcorn machine and that's why it's so efficient is it blows all the Chaffin out so in a pan or in the oven you've got chefing everywhere you know it's just it's a mess to clean up and the same with my little k dog BBQ it was just a walk so I had to get that out otherwise that burns more and yeah it's just a mess but the spork own maker does it quite well for me so I use that regularly and has the heat builds up that chef that husk begins to separate and it falls away from the seed okay so in our walk and I'm praising the Lord and I'm reading my Bible and I look at my family altar in the morning before my first coffee and I go praise the Lord this is a walk this is a lot three months later you like whoa that's a missus a lot of chefing lying around here but I'm not smoking anymore I'm not drinking I'm not not satisfied by anything that the world can give me keep on walking keep on roasting it's sometimes hard a trial by fire we'll get to that now and but the chaff thing is falling off right do you get to that first crack that that almost a masterpiece we'll get to that now so what I have here is the unwelcomed Christ 1955 Simon said master if you only knew what kind of woman that was she's speaking now if the prostitute Jesus said Simon I've got something to tell you you invited me to your home you didn't wash my feet you never give me any oil my face you didn't even kiss me welcome but this poor woman ever since she's coming here she's continually kissing my feet washing my feet with her tears wiped them with her hair then he turns to the poor prostitute looking at him she's standing there he is dripping down the tears all staining her cheeks she wondered what he was going to say is he going to rebuke her and say get over out of here you awful woman no he turned to her and he said child your sins which are many is all forgiven your faith in me has made you whole all their chefing gone in a wink of an eye if you carry on with that message is just beautiful help brother branham's coloring that in and oh yeah it just made me excited so they the worst of the worst call it the worst MacDonald Coffee Bean chefing will fall off chefing will fall off if you go through the fire if go through the roasting process there's a law and there's our order for everyone yesterday today and forever the same so first crack first cracks happened and you have this earthy tone earthy it smells of the world the earth smells like baking bread but nowhere near how coffee should smell yet so we waiting still continuing on I don't switch the roaster now off because I don't smell coffee I continue on I read my Bible I push on I get to fellowship storms coming and all that kind of thing I find a way to get to church so that can get a beautiful message from mother any loss Sunday please go and watch that again it's just amazing how you know we're just thankful for the for the ministers in our midst now we get to the second crack so like I said I get exciting now much much much less chaffing right but there's this inside crack that's inside stirring this softer crack this something's happening Lord what is this now you are in that quality coffee tasting zone now you know you're getting somewhere there's a woofed in the air that earthiness is gone there's a there's a chocolate eNOS there's a there's a rum a filling this and if you continue on hopefully I've got there here yes if you continue on you get to that bit which they call a fringe roast I don't often roast this this is just personal preference but they're certain beans you can roast to a French or a dark roast now that Ben has not each been individually polished that is oil being excreted from the inside oil coming out this is just the roasting process so from green it goes all the way till we have a cup of coffee but that for me was amazing I thought it was marketing I thought there was you know but Harris you know do something and put something in their bag to make this all shiny when you open it up but being itself its gets it gets so dry and it gets so dark in that roasting process that oil becomes to come out it's just wonderful to see and yeah again through your spiritual lenses what's that oil inside you that wine in oil beloved think of it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy so I call this the this is a Edwin Odia terminology I call this the third crack and that's when you actually actually have to grind the coffee I can look at that beam I can they do beautiful artistic things with coffee beans I can't drink that I need to grind it I need to go through the grind and that's why I'm say that polishing phase that sandpaper phase when when you go through that burr grind and everything needs to be less of me and more of him that's when when them when the bouquet comes out that coffee bean and the and the grind can sit next to each other the grind smells better than the coffee bean it's a fact right and to get that aroma and that bouquet out of it it needs to get to its final stage its final destination and something I mentioned earlier is the best beans grow at altitude so we're sitting here on or no altitude here in Wellington but the best beans Jamaica Peru South America Brazil Brazil is the largest exporter of or grower of coffee they've got altitude to work with and we need to go up we need to get into the mountains and the high mountains the Blue Mountains so at thy word 1951 may every person in here that's bound by sense bound existence only trusting and that what you can see here taste the fuel smell may they fall away from that tonight go up into the reales to the high of the higher and may this church literally be rocked with a with the power of God and that's what I'm praying tonight send the Holy Spirit may every angel that you've ordained to be at this meeting tonight take his place now standing by the sick and afflicted by the sinner by the skeptic Lord send the angel that stood at Baia by thy servant then proclaim these things that I've spoken to be true that they'll know it comes from not a man it comes from God hear me father hear me for I ask it in the name of your son Jesus Christ and to finish it off I like this quote 1957 as the Eagle stirs up this nest I remember the night when God made that scream to me you're not of this world you're not of them chickens you're not a chicken to begin with you're an eagle you're mine and I've come for you now honey up and listen to my word listen to my word I pray that this very nice re just a little jump and a flop of your little wings she's circling the barnyard oh I pray that this hour he's circling the barnyard you're mine you belong to me there's nothing about this voice that I understood that he that he understood well it was goodbye chicken yard he made a great big flop with his little wings and he landed right on top of the barnyard post he's seen he had done something that's a little rock falling off that of that big old mountain but did the rock fall off that that pair of people fall off yes I did keep on walking his mother screamed against it honey you've got to come higher than that I think we do too we've got to come higher than an under an organization or denomination or a confession she said just simply make another jump and flop with all that's in ooh I'll catch you on my wings and I'll bear you up to the place where you ought to be and it was just beautiful that brother Andy means in it on Sunday and that's how it all tie together with mine and I thought Lord yes this must be something in there must be of you so with this whole literal thinking of the coffee process you go think oh wow it's quite a science you know it's much more complex than I thought well I'll tell you this I think personally we are the most complex individuals on this earth and why you can't explain this to the world you can't explain the Godhead to the world you can't sit down and explain ma agape true love to this world we've talked about this brother ful at my house how do we how do we if only the world found the true definition of love according to thy word and not anything else what a difference it will be and why are we the most complex individuals because he hides in simplicity there's less of me and there's more of him and he can do his work thank you very much for tonight hope you got something out of it the Lord's good to me and go to my family enough had time today to sit at home and just think of his of his thoughts in and telling him Lord just inspire me just bring something on the scene and and while I'm there I'm thinking or bless brother bring because he needs to do the same he needs to step into that place the brothers has been before me you know and it's just wonderful I just had a an awesome time of worship and I think we should have a have an awesome time of Prayer now and I think I'll well start praying I don't know if we have a certain are we just going to pray everyone together I'll lead us into pray and then please just come before them tonight and wherever you are in your season in your in your and your coffee or hosting season get some revelant relevance find find where you are your position and what's what's the Lord doing with you you know the Chaffins fall off beautiful praise the Lord are you why you passed that first crack second crack are you busy going through that that burr grinder that mill you know is and then you know you know when when everything's going haywire everything's going wrong according to what the flesh would see in your and your senses will pick up your natural senses there's that in the spirit you've got the two senses and that's faith and doubt and when that faith you know that something's something's happening the Lord's not leaving me alone why is he not leaving me alone he wants to get me to a place to a position to step into a position walk a certain walk is for day or for danger this plan that and yes god bless you for your work and your walk with Him let's stand to our feet and I'll just pray
