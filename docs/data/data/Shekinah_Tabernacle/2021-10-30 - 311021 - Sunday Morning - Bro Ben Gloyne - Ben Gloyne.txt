may be seated [Music] who would love to be first all right so i've got a testimony about um the the sunday night um when brother alpha was preaching he said um how he had an experience and i said that i want to have an experience like that and he said that you can have it right now and i went up at the altar and i got that experience [Applause] i want to testify about sunday night um yeah got hit by the four gospels just before christina um started her tongues um it was like the holy ghost my back all the way to my head it was like no drug head i've ever had before and i had a few when i was in the world so yeah it was like it was absolutely amazing the power of god was so good [Applause] i just want to thank god for camp and thank you that we could have a great time um it was a real revival for me and speaker and lily and i just wanna i'm really happy for lily and she got baptized as well [Applause] um i was praying to god that i knew that he would move on someone but i was also thinking god can you move on to me and i was only expecting god to do it once but he did it twice in two different sermons and uh i think we all have a testimony about sunday night and um i think what the place i'm coming from is just how thankful i am with the lord on this prayer directly and there is little testimony about us um youth we get together monday nights and um we pray so the first time we got together first thing up on the list was camp and we prayed for every aspect for camp for the lord to come down for the lord to hear us and you know what he did and i just want to thank the lord for that [Applause] this isn't really a testimony about like on camp but yesterday when we were working in the garden i was busy like packing rocks to make a little path and my dad was chopping wood by me and when he was chopping the wood he hit the wood and it bounced off and it came at my head but before that at lunch my brother liam he prayed for us and protection and when the ex came towards me it just stopped and i thank god that he saved me [Applause] um so on the way to camp i was in my in my car praying that um the lord would touch me in a way that i've never been touched before and he did that on sunday night and it just amazed me like we know that god answers prayer but like when he does it's just so amazing and it never ceases to amaze me so yeah man warning signs um just want to add to the rumored testimony but i first want to say camp was awesome it was when i went back uh to work somebody asked me you know how was your weekend all i could say is i don't want to be i don't want to be here right now it was so amazing and i got to testify and i said to him go to a place where there's no sin go to a place where you can you can let your guard down and you can be yourself and you can experience god just you go to that place and then i'll tell you how camp was you know i didn't have to look away i didn't have to fight any anything i could just go there and have peace on earth it was amazing so i had an awesome camp thank you it was amazing thank god um so reuben so liam prays for protection um the afternoon at lunch now it sticks because course things that you pray we don't pray for no reason the words come the inspiration comes and why you say it is because it needs to be said it's a spoken word so when liam prayed for protection when we were at lunch because we quickly went in had lunch and came back i kinda it just struck me it's like why would he pray for protection we're not doing we didn't have the chainsaws going we were actually just raking and shoveling and doing stuff like that there was no real danger but and it felt like why would you pray for protection so when we went back i said to ruben go get the axe we needed to chop this tree down it was just a stump about well that high but about this high enough from from here and i was hitting at the base of it and reuben was packing rocks about a meter away from me and i was hitting just at the base and i thought oh it's controlled because i'm just heating down i just want to chop it in such a way that goes halfway so i can push it over you know and i went and and you know as as a man you thought okay i'm just going to give you that one you know just give it a good one and she'll go and as i went down to hit it it slipped and it bounced off and it went straight to his head and stopped now i'm swinging it so you know how much effort you put in and it just stopped and as it stopped i looked at reuben i said praise the lord that your brother just prayed for protection because then the first thought that came back was protection and why did liam pray for it and then i testified i said you know that should have hit you right in your head because i know how much force i put in i said and so we might not have seen why liam prayed for protection but this is that this is that we prayed for and he stood up like the woman at the well run straight on we went to told his mom and testified little things but little things matter amen so praise the lord i didn't hurt my child he protected him and if your children pray for something listen to what they pray for as well amen [Applause] um okay so um on the saturday night i was praying because um i couldn't go outside because i puked in the service and i'd go back to my cabin and so i was like it was like really sick and stuff so i had to go to the cabin and i was praying that the lord would give me the holy ghost the next day on sunday and then as i was praying and then in the service when sister christine just started speaking in tongues like the holy ghost just came down like filled me and i just couldn't stop screaming [Applause] i think for me me and edward was talking last night and i think it's there wasn't one specific moment but it was the whole camp every from start to finish was absolutely just just amazing and like exactly what on once said it felt like we were i had heaven on earth over the weekend everything all the world everything that was bothering everything that is was just gone it was just heavenly and i realized that in such a big sense when tuesday when when we got home and you know you're back to normality and you're back to the world and you're back to all of this it's just like ah i don't want to be here i just want to go home and just said lord just just come just come and and and take us home so yeah the whole thing the whole camp was just absolutely amazing so praise the lord i get a feeling that the bride wants to leave i do hey guys i'm just going to give a bit of a background to my testimony so on the thursday or the wednesday before before going to camp i was really scared because you know a whole entire vaccine thing and all that and i was like i'm going to lose my job because i don't want to get a vaccine i was just really frustrated right and i was a little bit terrified and i was like oh if i'm not a christian and like the tribulation comes and like everything will go wrong for me i'll be stuck here everybody else is in a rapture and i was really questioning that and i was like scared terrified and then i went to camp and on the friday i don't know if anybody saw me but i was in the back like the very back and somebody i got pretty bad so like halfway through the seven brother kubian came and handed me the box of tissues could i because i would like go back and forth because i was crying crying because everything that they said on friday night it really hit me you know it was good it was really good and it was like talking about don't be afraid you know take your time everything's okay so i just want to thank the lord for that that was pretty cool amen hallelujah god bless your sins just a small testimony that you know sometimes we pray and we we do expect the lord to answer our prayers but maybe not in a way that he answers prayers so i was sitting there praying that lord when i go big may i not be the same as when i came but you don't necessarily highlight the areas where you want to be an overcomer and he knew exactly where i needed to overcome so as we were praying sunday night and then he would point this one out and say okay on this area you need to fix this then i'll pray for that area then he said okay this one as well and then when i think i'm done he's like no no this area as well and then i was like oh okay so i asked you that i need to go back now the same way that i came in and i let go i did not say one two three i let it go i i left it with him and then he's the one who knew where things needed to get fixed and then he helped me and said this this this this you need to fix all of this when at the very end when you think you're done he comes and says no no you forgot this one as well then when i came out i knew that i was not the same as when i went [Applause] always good to sneak up on this brother isn't it amen um you know it's awesome i just like to just give the highest acolytes through our tech group amen they did a marvelous job there was there was earthquakes happening on that day and it was so good but you know the tech team makes you sound really good hey isaac [Music] and he did really well too amen yeah that was an icebreaker friday night was a awesome icebreaker you know our brother got up and he preached his heart out he stamped down that devil he threw it out of everybody and he caused that earthquake to shake the very church and it was like joseph you know he had to bring forth that extra fruit and when he brought the icebreaker through then the next icebreaker was isaac asking my wife to come up and sing a song and she did not want an icebreaker again but you know out of all that i think as a team as saints and brothers and sisters in christ we really united together we really did and the icing on the cake was not the last preacher the icing on the cake when our preacher was crying out from his heart come home come home come home that really hit i believe that really stirred up the gift of the holy spirit was coming through our pastor crying out crying out you know such a wonderful time a bless you all [Applause] good morning saints good morning i don't think anyone wants so much the opportunity to thank our lord for what he's done for us the fact that we are here and he's called us by name andy ben marion you know sister k each one of us for a reason camp was wonderful from day one from the time we got there from the time we start setting up and doing all those things you know the lord has got a hand in everything that we're doing for timing whether we're under pressure or we think we're under pressure it's for a reason everything worked in unison he used every gift from the youngest in the in the feeding hall in the dining hall for preparation to the teenagers or the middle-aged guys to clean up and wash up the dishes to us older guys in the kitchen in around everything that we're doing he used every gift for his glory whether you have to wake up early in the morning or you had to go to bed late in the night because you were sharing with someone or just enjoying the fellowship it was for a reason yes as brother andy said we have camp and we love having camp because we get to fellowship with brothers and sisters we missed you brother we were hoping that you were there uh but your family stood and and took your your place amen we we want everyone to come together when it's camp yes we're going through this trial at this moment with this with this this epidemic that's out there but he gathered a few saints just a small number but still we had a victorious time better than the last one you know if we can just see that and if that was just you guys how much more is going to do when we all get together when all the saints get together from the north to the south to east and the west we all come together think about it just think about what he's got in store in that storehouse for you all right so today i want to encourage you today is that day amen claim what is god in that storehouse for you don't sit there if you're never saying before we prayed this morning if you didn't sing before sing today if you didn't testify before testify today if you didn't do something before today's the day this day is set aside for our lord it's a resurrection morning are you ready are you prepared that's what it is we we don't want to miss that opportunity i just think about our young ladies here in front of me this is the biggest biggest miracle testify i can testify with just about talking about them only hi what about you what about you i want to appreciate all the gifts that is working together the tech team like my brother said you'll do an amazing job long days late nights early hours you know even after the time you are working we appreciate y'all each one of you right our pastor and his wife we didn't know where we were going we didn't know whether this was going to happen and witness tonight it's happening we are ready in the background they are working thank you pastor thank you to you and your wife the other thank you goes back to our treasurers and our our people in the background that we don't see working thank you for making it possible brother isaac brother andy pradhan we appreciate you all thank you for making that happen thank you for allowing each one of us to come to camp and it not be a burden on anyone's pocket we appreciate and thank you for every other gift that was used for that camp to make it possible sister priscilla for all your hard work in the stage work with sister uh chantal as well thank you for that you know brother andy and sister brownie for the food who can get food like that in a can come on now who can get food like that in the camp you know in a short time a short space of time all the preparation done sister maggie i take my hat off to you yeah you never missed a beat you weren't on the roster but you're on the roster oh yeah you know you make sure the kitchen is that's how it that's how i can explain it it works you know sister naomi from nelson you don't have to ask she's there it's so important when the gifts work together right so that's my encouragement to you look at our peers look at our older brothers and sisters and our younger brothers and sisters that are working so if you are falling short just reflect have a look see what they are doing work with it this body cannot work on its own amen right that's why the lord has placed us here that's what has brought us here we have to work together so thank you each one i appreciate you all thank you for the camp the camp from day one to the last day i'm still having camp i'm slaving camp you know if we if we want to leave it there think again you know i was just reading all the messages and brother andy says oh can we buy the camp hey hey hey think now can you imagine if you got camp every day can you imagine that right as brother armand said you're not looking at anything that you don't want to look at you want to be in that you want to see everyone because everyone's beautiful everyone's happy everyone's pure everyone's clean all right and then we come out and we look at this you want to hide away you know so we want to have that atmosphere staying with us that atmosphere is staying with us if you have a burden it doesn't only be prayed in the camp our church is here brothers and sisters are here to pray with you all right don't miss the opportunity when i was there and i was seeing the young people not going up for prayer when the altar was opened why why are you missing the opportunity i shared with brother and paul and brother andy how hungry we are we don't come from the message background our families were not from a message background we came from a hindu background or a denomination background or whatever it was but yet we are hungry we want to bite that word we want to eat it it's so fulling it's so fresh but we scared to take that step we're scared to take that step let's take that step today's the day leave camp two days that day so i encourage you i just want to say don't miss your opportunity amen thank you [Applause] okay so on friday the 1st of october um the friday before i got baptized i struggled with an eye infection in my eye and it's been like that for a while and then it went away and then it came back on the thursday of camp just before camp and then on saturday night i went up for prayer and brother ben anointed anointed me with oil and the next day i woke up and it was fine and there was nothing there i noticed and i just want to give god all the glory [Applause] come on um i just want to add to my dads and reuben's testimony so we're living in and we just moved into riku rangi and then that like i think it was a friday or something that my dad prayed for the neighbors because we technically never prayed for the neighbors but um god put the thought on my dad's heart to pray for the neighbors that day we saw the rescue helicopter hovering over and then um at school we found out this um that this older person nearly got kicked um he was chasing the cow to get back in and then he was gonna grab the cow and push it and then he forgot that a cliff was behind him and then he fell off the cliff and that um same day no the next day after that a boy got hit by a car when he was crossing the road and like it was just a testimony that like how the lord put on the thing on my dad's heart [Applause] amen is there anybody else don't be shy amen praise the lord i'm getting signals we're good we're good okay i'll use this hello thank god for the tech team hey man they work really hard [Applause] you know i'm in all of the world and things for for us to have a simple experience in technology and that there's a lot of background work that's going on for it to be simple for us and these guys this looks quite it may look simple but there's a lot of stuff that makes it in the background amen amen can i put this down [Music] okay amen i believe we're a prophetic people you know like i just hear from the stravics testimonies when we pray god prays through us you know we're not too insignificant for god to use us we don't have to be a major prophet or anything like that to have god pray through us so i encourage you let god pray through you amen because really the great victories are won by the prayers of the saints amen amen that's why the devil the whole hell shakes the christians glory to god amen let's stand let's just sing a few worship songs before we invite the pastor to come and minister to us amen [Music] hallelujah see [Music] oh i know the time is near where everything that i hold near will lay before the holy comes to me fire all my works and all my deeds every present on my knees [Music] all i want to see [Applause] jesus all i want to see is him in me all i want to see is jesus [Applause] through me

privilege to have meals with these people this caliber of people you know it's a real blessing so um god bless you uh it's it's um before we read the scripture i want to say uh happy reformation day it's it's actually reformation day today yeah we're in martin luther now the thesis on the church door you know we know this is not a reformation it started there but now this is a full restoration but you know so the devil tries to make it some other thing but no happy reformation day you know praise the lord um and also thank you for your prayers for william um yes so he came home um friday afternoon he's got a case of handful and mouth him and baby faith so there at home christine really wanted to be here today but we don't want to share those things around um and yeah i think that's all we have but yeah god bless you let's go to the scripture this morning we're going to go to second kings and we're going to read uh second kings 13 and 20. and i just have two verses to read and then we're going to go to romans chapter eight amen trust everyone's well and um as everyone's been saying you know the same god at camp is the same god here he's not confined thank the lord to forest lakes campground right so and he wants to prove himself the same here now and in our everyday life and we'll go into that a bit later but so second kings 13 and 20 verses 20 and 21 it says here and elisha died and they buried him and the band of the moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year and it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold they spied a band of men and they cast the man into the sepulchre of elisha and when the man was let down and touched the bones of elisha he revived and stood on his feet and we're going to go to romans 8 and verse 10. this may seem a bit i trust we'll you know you'll see the context of of this romans 8 and 10. am in romans 8 10 and 11 it says and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen let's bow heads on the word of prayer we've got one prayer request for brother chris he he pulled us back uh yesterday so when i lift him before the throne of the lord i mean if you ever need to

live make it manifest in our hearts oh god lord that when we leave this place lord jesus that lord would be changed would be renewed would be made more like you oh god and father those who are streaming lords think of lord my darling lord at home with william and baby faith their father lord i pray you touch them bless them o god anyone else is watching this service lord may your presence be so real with them as well granted father may your word become alive in every life in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning i want to speak about the bride's last miracle and um but before we do that i just want to read you know because the devil uh the devil's crafty but he's um he thinks that god is only god in certain places now when when when syria would come against israel the uh this is in first kings and and in chapter 20 you don't need to turn into it i just want to refer to it because sometimes the devil thinks well god is only powerful in certain places so what he tries to do is he tries to put your experience at campus that's just a camp experience but you know god wants to prove to you that he's god everywhere in every situation he's god so the assyrians came against israel and they said well let's fight them in the hills they fought israel in the hills they got massacred then they came back a bit later and said well their gods are the gods of the hill so we'll fight them in the plane but then they got massacred in the plane and that proves that god is not only god of the hills or the mountaintop but he's god on the plane i mean so he's not just god on the hills but he's god on the plane in everyday life i mean so he's not confined to a certain place or a certain certain situation he's the same god i mean so the enemy wants to make us think that he's only strong in certain places but he said he'd never leave us nor forsake us right he's the same yesterday today and forever amen but he needs he wants to prove that to you you know jesus defeated the devil with the word in the desert amen after a 40-day fast right so proving to us the prophet said that that any believer even who would consider themselves the weakest of christians can take the word of god and defeat satan any place anytime anywhere amen the apostle paul would find out that god is god in every place not just on the road to damascus but in damascus amen in the jail with paul and silas he was god amen in the storm in a shipwreck he was gone i mean collecting collecting wood being bitten by an adder he was god and the reason the apostle paul none of these things moved him is because he had a revelation in his heart he had to go to rome and nothing could stop him going there and being a living witness because that was a revelation to him he's going to roam so the storm couldn't kill him because he had to go to rome the the the ass couldn't kill him because he had to go to rome now we're going to realize we're on our way to a place and it's not to rome it's to heaven right so we're going to realize nothing can if you just yo i trust is so anchored in your souls i mean nothing can take me off this path the devil will try and push you off the path but if there's divine revelation in your heart it doesn't matter i mean what situation you go into i mean you go through it but god wants to prove to you he's the same god everywhere and he also wants to prove to you who you are it's like when abraham was there god revealed himself to abraham but he had to reveal to abraham who abraham was right that he was the father of faith that he could stagger not at the promise of god but give god praise being fully persuaded that he could do that which he had promised right so he had but he had to show abraham that it's the same thing with this message with the lord i mean he wants to prove to you who you are hallelujah so never ever let it be a uh oh it's just camp he's the same god in everyday life i mean i got the holy ghost washing dishes at work this is back at university hey the lord was dealing with me the word came alive the bible became a new book but he just anchored his love in my heart and i realized how much he loved me and how much i loved him and the bible says in romans 5 5 that we are not ashamed because the love of god has shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us so i had an ex a life-changing experience with god washing dishes amen so god will meet you in the everyday life so we've got to realize god is not just god of camp he's god everywhere amen and he wants to prove that to us now elisha we read here uh brother braham tells us that elisha types the believer types the bride and elisha he was just living his everyday life but then god had already told elijah which represents christ the word to go anoint elisha and then so allah um elisha is just plowing with his oxen and then elijah comes along and just cast his mantle upon him and the prophet says that that elisha had to be cut or had to be changed to fit elijah's mantle he was ordained to wear the mantle but he had to be shaped and had to be molded that the mantle would eventually fit him i mean but then so elisha what he did is he as he just said to elijah can i just you know basically burn every bridge and i'll come follow you because he killed his ox and he he he cooked it up and the harness everything fed it to his family he burned every bridge and he said i'm gonna walk with god i'm gonna and it's the same thing with you and i i trust you've got nothing to go back to you've got no formal religion you've got no custom you've got no world whatever it is it's dead hallelujah you cooked it up you send it away praise the lord i mean so now elijah i mean elisha now if i get these ones mixed up i'm sure you've come to a place where you realize take what i say no take what i mean and not what i say because i get these things you know vice versa anyway so as elisha was following elijah he was being shaped and molded i mean to fit elijah's mantle now here then he comes to a place where where it's revealed now that elijah's going to go up into glory and then even elijah tries to tell elijah to stop following him he would say in second kings two he says you know carry here and gilgal you know stay here in bethel he tries to get him to stop but then elijah says to elijah i'm not gonna leave thee i'm going you know because remember the lord's looking for our response are you going to stay you're going to continue and i just made up my mind i'm continuing on wherever this word leads me i'm going because the lord knows the future he's the god of the future so i'm just going to follow this word remember this message did not find us god didn't save us to lose us right he redeemed us to keep us remember redemption is to claim back that which was lost right so we were lost but we're in the back part of god's mind his attributes expressed upon the earth and god knew that where we were we're part of him and he came to find us he can't lose one of his children right so he's not going to save us or redeem us to lose us there's nothing the devil can do that can get an attribute of god away from god forever either we may stray the path we may be a prodigal but eventually there comes a season we come home right in god's great economy there's a season where we come home hallelujah so you know because god's not losing one he cannot the devil's not going to get one of god's children hallelujah they're all coming amen that's why we've got to believe for our families they're part of god don't give up on anyone amen hallelujah so elijah so elisha was led by the word until finally he came to a spot where they where where the mantle that your elijah took the mantle and he struck jordan as his and it separated divided hither and thither and they went over on dry ground now we know jordan you know this this there's three places they go to or they start at guild gathering they go to bethel they go to jericho then they go to jordan and brother braham tells us that this is this this types the believers walk from justification repentance baptism amen and sanctification then eventually you come to jordan you die to everything because jordan represents death amen and then you go over to the baptism of the holy ghost so here they did so so so they crossed jordan and then a lot but it's amazing because there were other people around the sons of the prophets and they knew what was going to happen but they were just spectators you don't just want to be a spectator in god's great plan say lord i want to be i want to be front and center of your word amen i don't just want to be uh you know staging i want to play the part of the bride amen remember really we god knows who's going to be there but really this this whole life is an audition what part do you want to play amen i don't want to play the villain he's already got enough people playing that i want to play the damsel in distress because she goes to safety the wedding supper in the sky i mean so here he is she i mean here here he comes over jordan and then elijah's taken up and in that same mantle because but but before that before that happens he asks for a double portion i want a double portion and then elijah says to elisha that's a hard thing but if you see me when i leave you'll receive it so the mantle fell down after elijah was taken up in the chariot and then elijah i mean then elisha picked up the mantle and he came back to jordan and he said where is the god of elijah and he struck the jordan and it parted exactly as elijah did hallelujah so now we know that uh jordan also represents death and i'll just say that right now you've got to have the mantle of the baptism of the holy ghost the living word in order to part death and go into heaven you've got to have it in you you've got to be carrying it it's not something you're you're the prophet says that god just doesn't change the spirit within you just before you die and you go to glory no you've gotta you gotta be ready gotta be robbed in his righteousness now hallelujah are we dressed today amen in the mantle of the holy ghost so now elisha he asked for a double portion and he did twice as many miracles as elijah did but to me the last miracle was the greatest one and that last miracle was the resurrection of the dead man and that last miracle was nothing he consciously did he didn't pray he didn't he didn't lay hands he didn't say there's a need here i've got to go here or lord what would you have me do there's a life in him there's a life in him now we've come back to the literal life of christ right christ is in his bride this is the bright coming of jesus christ right now the bride coming of jesus christ that's what you know god says i know brother braham said that god changes his mask right and his last mask to the gentiles is you and i god veiled behind skin again the great unveiling of god is actually veiled in simplicity in you and i hallelujah so now it's a life so so we've been returned back to the literal life of christ not just gifts not just being justified or sanctified but all those with the giver that's what we have right brother bam says deity is not just in heaven it's in you amen i just say amen because remember the holy ghost is not a lesser god he's not part of the you know he's not a second person or a third person or whatever of the person of the godhead it is god the one who made sun moon and stars comes and dwells in his redeemed children hallelujah so so it was a life on display that brought forth a resurrection this is where i'm going this is elijah you know it seemed to tarry maybe the critics would have been watching elisha saying oh you said you got a double portion how many miracles what's done god what has god done in your life he maybe would recount seven i said where's the last one you said you had the double portion and then elisha gets sick and you know when the devil starts fighting that's when the critics start barking or chattering but just just stay steady with god because god remember god vindicates you and i god vindicates his word if his word is in you you're part of the word he'll vindicate you it's not us trying to prove this thing you know we don't have to prove nothing it's god that steps on the scene hallelujah and fights the battle if you let him hey we can fight a lot of battles but every battle i've thought i've lost but every battle i've let him fight he wins i'd rather let him win that's a good conclusion no one wants to be the loser yeah hello okay so maybe the critics begin to gather around and you know they were counting miracles and things says oh and then he dies i thought he had a double portion i thought the bride had the goods some people say the bride has the goods there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a resurrection the dead in christ are going to rise first hallelujah so there's a lingering of this but the thing is it wasn't it wasn't up to elisha to fulfill it it was the life of christ within him that was going to fulfill it it's the same thing with you and i you say how's the dead in christ going to rise there's going to be a life on display that's going to call them out of the grave amen he would say this brother brown would say this and and it is the rising of the sun he's so speaking about the resurrection morning brother kabin was saying this is resurrection morning that's why we have church on a sunday morning because to honor the resurrection hallelujah he says and the first light that was ever given in the earth was god's spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth then the spirit of god as it moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of the creation upon the earth the sun rose and swept across its rays and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the earth by a seed that was a great hour but oh it wasn't nothing that sunrise like the sunrise on that easter morning this time when the sun leaping into the skies it brought forth a greater sunrise than ever because it came because it came greater news with this sunrise than it did the sunrise at the beginning this sunrise brought forth the news he has risen he is quickened from the dead as he promised he's risen from the dead the first time the sun rose in genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth mortal life but this time when the sun rose there was a dual sun rising another sun rising it was not only the s-u-n rising it was the s-o-n had risen to bring eternal life to all god's promised seed by that by four knowledge that he had seen laying upon the earth hello because we know if you read the account of genesis it doesn't say that he created the seeds they're already in the earth but they're waiting for god to brood upon the face of the deep and the waters to be part of the sun to shine it's the same thing with you because your seed in the earth that had to come forth it's the same thing with you and i there's a seed of predestination and it may have been carried covered in a lot of darkness our first birth brought a lot of darkness over the sea hallelujah but then god but god began to brood over your life because he knew there was a seed in there that had to come forth i mean he wasn't just satisfied with your first birth being manifested there's a greater seed than your natural seed that you were born by there's eternal life in you that had to come forth so you begin to brood i was just like a elijah throwing the mantle over elisha there's a seed in him hallelujah there's a seed in him that had to come forth hallelujah amen no more could the botany life lived back there at the beginning without the s-u-n to bring it to life no more than today when sons of god is upon the earth it takes the s-o-n light to bring them to eternal life amen he has chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world hallelujah and on easter morning when in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the earth and in heaven there is a book of memory and his attributes was in him knowing that because this son of god raised it would also raise to life every sun that was ordained to this great time he knew it would be and what a glorious sunrise that was than it was in the beginning at the time when it first dawned he says oh he says now on this breaking of the easter seal to me that's more poetry i mean it's more than poetry it's making a declaration i mean the son has risen this is the greatest sunrise hallelujah and he said it bring life to every foreordained son or daughter of god that's why we should rejoice but the thing is the devil tries to rob us saying oh you didn't feel anything no you believe it that he brings the feeling right because god wants to prove himself if you feel as dead as a post do you still believe hallelujah sure these feelings come i mean we we believe in heartfelt religion that we're not a morgue this is living living voices living people hallelujah amen but the thing is we can't you know just believe just take god at his word and he will bring it to pass in your life but if there's just a tug in your heart for god i want to make my life right it's not like that that's god pulling you because he wants to bring to bring to life something in you hallelujah of that seed amen so it was so it would raise to life every sun that was foreign to this great time what's this great time a rapture i'm talking about this great time what's this great time a wedding supper in the sky we're about to go to what's this great time a union amen between christ and his bride which we are enjoying right now hallelujah i'm so thankful that we don't just become a good moral people i mean this is not a reformation sure i said happy reformation day but we're we're you know it started there but didn't end in a reformation i mean we have been totally loosed from the systems of the devil we've been turning loose from all of his clutches from unbelief he has no claim on the bride of christ whatsoever i mean if the devil if you have the devil still trying to accuse you've got to recognize that the blood of jesus christ has so cleansed have you accepted that blood the power of the blood breaks every hole hallelujah and it's not just us putting away our first our first union with the devil because brother ram says that our first husband was actually satan the devil by our first birth it's not just putting him away in a closet for maybe when things get bad i'll turn back to the world no that nature's got to die he's got to die i mean if you think anything that you used to do in the world and you have a positive thought about it it's got to die because that's still part of your identity it's got to die all i'm thankful about is i'm not in that anymore i'm so glad i'm not back in that cage of unbelief and sin i've been loosed hallelujah amen so i'm so glad we're not just a a reformed people trying to live the word of god in our own strength but god's quickening power quickens us to the word that he becomes the christian within us bam says in investments he says and that he says and that was that's been so twisted that they brought it over into christianity just a form just to say that we should make a declaration of creeds or laws by laws of christianity and we have been very able with intellectual beings to present this to the world but you see we don't find them taking it like they should because it hasn't got life in it see we must find something every man is looking past the curtain from that somewhere beyond that he come from and knows he's got to return someday everybody wants to see it wants to know what is beyond that speaking about the life the next life this is a very beautiful picture jesus said when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man did you notice he never said when he's cast out of a man but when he goes out by his own will when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man and returns back to this man and finds that the house that he lived in has been swept garnished then he goes and gets seven other devils demons unclean spirits and enters into this man and the last estate of this man is seven times worse than it was at the first did you notice the devil went out by his own will and he returned by his own will now if this house has been uh has already been occupied when he returned he would not be able to get in but you see he found it swept and garnished it's a very beautiful picture of a moralist so we think of men today tries to think he's going to heaven just because he quit gambling or maybe he quit running with the woman that wasn't his wife or stopped us drinking on new year's day and turned over a new leaf and joined church see he isn't really converted he's just a moralist we don't want to be a moral estate the devil using moralists to go out and make a fullest representation when really the real power of the living christ isn't there the world is wanting to see christ jesus said i am the vine and ye are the branches and the branch bears the record of the vine because it draws us energy and life from the vine while the first vine first branch that came from this vine they wrote a book of acts behind that branch we see the way the holy spirit acted in that first church that church of pentecost when we believe that if it's this original vine never puts forth another branch it'll write another book of acts behind it because of the same life that's in the vine hallelujah because remember in that book of acts church there was a space of time before the church age fell became the ephesian age amen and we've been restored to that not the ephesian age of just aiming at and relaxing right but actually not but aiming it and becoming i mean so aiming it and becoming the word hallelujah amen we don't want to be a bunch of moralists see see the world is looking for christ now elisha when he crossed jordan he had the mantle of elijah so that same god that was with elijah was now with elisha it wasn't a different god it wasn't a different mantle it was the same life amen manifesting in the same way same god hallelujah as the same thing with you and i we don't have a different god this may be very elementary but we don't have a different god we can't i trust when we read the book of acts we say i can see me in the book of acts because the acts of the holy spirit and the apostles should be the same holy ghost and you and i amen hallelujah amen that's that's how we should be hallelujah now we're living in an hour where god is manifesting his full power that rhymes but i didn't mean it to rhyme but this is the hour where it's not just a professor of the word so claiming things even though we need to do that because he's the high priest of our profession but it's those who possess the promise right we are possessors of eternal life we are possessors of every divine promise you know brother brahm says the quickening power quickens you to every promise in the world hallelujah do we have that now i mean it's not something we'll get one day we have it right now in your possession if you've been quick and this message become alive to you you seen a living god living your life like you've been quick into the word of your age i mean not to a different word not to a church but to the living word of the age where you become now a living bible remember many people will never read a bible but they'll read your life and and really what needs to happen and i trust you can see it is that the character of christ the revelation of jesus christ it's a nature it's a character of a person right that character by the holy ghost comes into you amen so when people read your life they should see jesus they may not recognize who he is but they should be able to see there's something different about those people more than how they dress more than the things they don't do but a character a life remember it's a life on display elisha had quickening power in his bones he was just living life he was anointed by elijah but he had quickening power and it was the life within him that brought forth a resurrection now brother braham says this here i believe it's in looking unto jesus he says now mechanics ain't what runs the automobile it's the dynamics that runs it amen it the mechanics don't run the church it's the dynamics the holy ghost that gets into this word it's not a seminary that teaches you all the theology and the greek interpretations but it's the dynamics of the holy ghost in there to set that a fire and bring it to pass and to make it live just exactly what the promised word is for this hour what is the promise for this hour that a people will become built into the image of jesus christ will be built to the fullness of the statue of the perfect man that's the promise of the this hour and then when jesus when the lord sees himself reflected in his bride remember the prophet said she is him we become so much the word that when he sees us he doesn't see our peculiarities of our humanity he sees himself displayed in a people hallelujah amen so that's that is the promise of the hour that he sees himself manifested in a people hallelujah now not the mechanics the dynamics it takes the mechanics and the dynamics the word and the spirit they are the one that gives life what god promised for this hour look for it to be fulfilled you must look to him because he is the word and the only way you can look to the word is look to him look to him he is the word and the word promised for this day is to be fulfilled this day noah's time could not be fulfilled this day it was only a type moses time and so forth but this is the day that god has promised these things that we're now enjoying these things that we're now seeing and the world is laughing at this great monumentous power of the holy ghost that can change a sinner's heart they can take a lukewarm church member and give him a testimony that will set the church of fire from where he came out of as a dynamic that got into the word what did we see at camp it was the it was the former ladder rain running together there's a teaching then the quickening that's what we saw there's a dynamic power the holy ghost being poured out hallelujah that's the season we're in we're not looking for it it's here oh people are looking for a great move of god it's here are we oh we need the bride's revival it's been going on we need to recognize it's been going what's the awakening of the bride hallelujah we did yes like the welsh revival the people from america went over to wales and they're trying to find the welsh revival maybe they're trying to find a big church or whatever and they see a policeman whirling is batting around and whistling i'm so glad i can sign one of them or whatever he's singing and you know and they asked him good sir we're looking for the welsh revival and he says well you've arrived it's in me i am the welsh revival highly the life he was living aiming because god was so alive to him the word became alive to him he realized i am the welsh revival hallelujah and we're going to realize actually we are the bride's revival where's the revival going on is it here no it's in here hallelujah amen amen he says and what shall i do with jesus called christ he says let me say something to this uniting time we're in a uniting time aren't we christian is broadly uniting to see churches uniting nations uniting its unite it's uniting time of god and his bride too and i say this with reverence and respect i believe that the bride of christ is called i believe she's sealed in the kingdom of god i believe the mechanics is there they're waiting for the dynamics it'll take her off the earth into glory and the rapture i believe with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is the dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and we see his uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper and we're waiting watching for that their big church is to be united the dynamics of this church this is you now will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's the dead in christ for hundreds of years ago will raise and the beauty of his holiness to take a flight to the skies the dynamics is the holy ghost amen and that's what's happening because remember it's not just a uniting it's got to be uniting and with individuals remember a church by association is not going into rapture it's individuals right it's individuals that are united with the headstone they go on the rapture so as we see more and more believers being united as he comes down what's happened the dynamics comes in a greater measure hallelujah because remember the dynamics of this church is a refilling of the holy ghost what is worked in small measure while the headstones coming down to unite with the body when their head and body unites together the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead and here we are this is what's going on this is this is this is current affairs amen hallelujah our god is working what has been laying on tape and just in the pages of the scriptures becoming living and it's actually you know because elisha he couldn't just point back and say well elijah did this and elijah did this so he would have enjoyed the testimonies of elijah but he had to realize the same god that's why when he took the mantle he smote the jordan where's the god of elijah i need more than just a historical event i mean to part these waters i need that same god to be alive in my life i mean and the and the waters part it says the same thing with you and i we appreciate everything that the that god did through the prophet but he's the god of the bride lord jesus christ right that mighty angel that descended didn't leave when the prophet left he's the same god who turned up at camp the mighty angel himself jesus christ it wasn't a different one it was the same god and he came to unite himself with a people hallelujah that's why it's so powerful i mean when you can see that actually god is uniting himself not just with all but with young people hello he's the old god of the old is god of the young he's the god of the middle age god of the teenage god of every age he's the same god hallelujah god uniting himself with his people amen yeah i'm so glad 10 15 well i haven't been here that long but you know i came to the message you tell people what god had done for you they look at you like they have no idea what you're talking about unfortunately but now as time's gone along more and more people have got the holy ghost and it's not just being a good church person the word becomes alive god becomes real to them they say my father you're real you're more than my father's experience my mom's experience you're the same god and i'm so glad that wiggletails can't get into this experience because we have a living word we don't have a historical word that can go rotten right but we of living where fresh matter from the holy of holies that never goes off hallelujah amen hallelujah we have a part to play in getting the dead saints out of the grave right elisha had a part to play to get that guy resurrected you say but he was dead what part did he have to play he had to receive the life he had to have the quickening power hallelujah and he received it before it came on display now i feel like i'm stumbling around here but we'll get somewhere no and wisdom versus faith so this is what we've got to do because the devil loves to tell us that the word is not for you who's ever had that i've had him come you know when i was in the pentecostal church before i came to the message i never had a voice in my head saying you should leave you should leave this is not true you should leave and then you come into the truth and there's like a little imp sitting on your shoulder you should leave this is not for you you should leave i said satan no no i'm staying here you go out because it's a mind battle because the devil because the devil's afraid because he has a good memory the devil has a very good memory hey he brings up your past all the time and and he brings details but he also has a memory every time he was defeated so he's seen the power when god and man unites when two omnipotents come together and the supernatural takes place he knows what it's like to be cast out of legion that whole legion of devils remembers that day hallelujah amen you know those those seven devils and mary magdalene they remember the day they were cast out of her and all the way down through the scripture he remembers when he was defeated because devils have good memories hallelujah amen but the thing is now we have to remind him that he's a defeated being you have to remind them we face a defeated foe hallelujah because so what he tries to do so i just go back to my thought about that as he tries to keep us away from the promise of god because he's seen what he's what it's done in the past he's seen the power of god come down and cast him out out of many many lives down through the ages so he knows if he could just keep people from the promise he has control in their life so the devil sitting on your shoulder saying it's not for you you're not feeling anything you're not getting anything out of this camp was a waste of time wave that's the devil trying to fight you trying to get you to believe it's not for you but yet there's a pull hallelujah you actually there's a hunger in your heart for god so what's that god telling you actually it is for you but you've got to make the word your own it's not just my word this message is not just brother brown's message it was never his message to start with it was god's message and it was for the elect hallelujah so it's for you and i he says in wisdom versus faith why did jesus stand there and say to mary and martha take her take you away the stone why he was god he could have said stone be no more and it wouldn't have been no more but he had something to do but she had something to do why did he stand there and look upon the harvest you believe is the lord of the harvest he said to his disciples you pray the lord of the harvest that he'll send laborers into his harvest other words you ask me to do what i'm going to do see we're buddies we're it's it's a church we've got something to do ourselves you've got to do uh you've got something to do here's the gospel i know it but if you just let it sit there and don't preach it what good is it what good is it going to do see you've got something to do you've got to make an effort you say well i believe god can heal but i just don't know stand up and let that word become your word believe it don't reason it just believe it i mean to let that word become your word make it personal for you buy his stripes i'm healed he is my savior here's my redeemer here's my peace he is my advocate he's my comforter my god he's my lord he's my all in all not someone else's he's mine amen so we have something to do in the end time make the word our word and let it live in our lives hallelujah see elisha elisha became the living word for his day elijah lived his portion taken up in a rapture but now it was elisha's ministry and as i said in the very beginning elijah types christ and elisha types the bride right so we are now living out our part of the ministry amen that shouldn't be a shock right we're actually here to be a living witness amen there jesus would say uh i would say in the church age book he would say this he says the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles reader known of all men for their generation when the methodists failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until on this last day hello people in the last day there is another there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age hallelujah so there will be a people on the earth that will be the final voice to the final age they won't be debaters but the word will be living their lives will be lived voices he says yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it's its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will be confounded he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her i mean yes it is for it says in the in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god is at pentecost but of course that word bride will be reputed uh as in the first age so he says that the voice of god is in her hallelujah says i can't remember who was saying about prayer i think it's brother andy when inspiration comes and you pray or you don't feel inspiration and you pray you pray in faith who's praying through you is it your own top two inches using your vocal lord no it's god holy why because you become a living bible and the word has to be spoken and it's not just spoken by words or is it spoken through a life right i'll you know we preach i don't just preach here my life i trust the preachers the truth but our lives preach something too we are declaring something right rather than declaring the word or the world i want to preach the word my life not me actively oh i've got to do no no it's my life subconsciously should be preaching a message hallelujah amen so here we are elisha became a living voice to that age hallelujah now we know in revelations 10 you know it's quite a scene but we understand that that mighty angel has descended brother braham says that the seventh angel earthly angel is on is on earth at the time of that coming of revelations 10 1 coming down so we know this has already happened christ himself has come in word form right but then john is instructed to take the book that he wasn't even worthy to look upon revelations 5 and eat the book and prophesy again so there came a time when the prophet's ministry was over now john who's a symbol of you and i remember one man in a vision can represent a whole body of people because at the end of revelations 4 1 there he says i saw a door open in heaven and a voice he come up hither and that's the rapture at the end of the later cnh right so one man represents the whole redeemed group of people right and so he's instructed to take the book eat the book or become one with the word and then speak its contents that's why it's very important when when we preach when we speak about our own selves we don't confess our humanity's failings we speak the contents of the book we talk about who we are in christ what he has made us if you want to be negative you won't get anywhere that's why i always say i can't remember who said it at camp but always think positive about yourself i mean confess positive things i'm an overcomer i'm accepted in the beloved i mean here's my peace my sins are gone i'm going to heaven the lord's found me he's keeping me he's going to see me through hallelujah the devil's defeated i face a defeated foe you've got to confess those kind of things hallelujah it's very important amen so now elisha came to a point where that quickening power was in him and this is where we are right now we're not waiting for it to come it's come brother abraham says that the holy ghost was bound at the doors of creeds and dogmas has been loosed upon the people by the message of the hour because we've been restored back to the truth of the scripture hallelujah and then so now what has happened in this day so well let's just jump back again elisha was beholding christ and elijah and what you look at you become and so now we've had we've had another you say christ has been on display again in this end time now i don't want to be too much longer but we have in the feast the feast in leviticus of the way sheath being waved the day after the sabbath and we know that what happened is is you know they'll take the mature part of the field they'll cut it down and the priest would wave it before the lord giving thanks to god that the rest of the seed in the field was going to come forth to the same maturity as this part of the field and so jesus was the first wave sheath i mean here's the mature part of the of the field remember we are his brethren we are his family so the same seed in him sure he didn't need to be redeemed he wasn't born lost but that same seed that was in him as in you and i when when the marriage of the lamb has come which it has it's like mary's like right it's like mary's like i married another human being you know marriage is between you know you can't marry different species so when the lord unites himself with his bride she is made of the same material he is halloween this is what the lord i trust as he's been walking with you you begin to realize i made a different stuff than the rest of the world not my humanity now but there's a cg in me i mean that's expressing itself hallelujah i made a different kind of stuff so now the priest would take that wave sheath and wave it before the lord and brother ram said on the day of pentecost that same wave sheath was waved not just as a symbol but in reality the holy ghost was waved over the people and god was giving praise it was god actually rejoicing saying there's more seed in the field that come forth just like this one and he says at the end time that has happened again there's been a mature life has been waved over the earth and the lord is giving thanks because there's other seed i wasn't alive in 1965 or 1963. i was born in 85 but god saw that i was in the field there was seed that had to come forth so now this word's been waved over the earth hallelujah and god's giving thanks saying that the rest of the seed in the field is going to come forth just like this one which is the word in flesh hallelujah it's that same quickening power i mean that was displayed on the day of pentecost that came into a people brought them to maturity that same quickening power has been waived in this end time in a prophet's ministry hallelujah and what's god doing he's praying he's giving thanks saying there's others like this that are going to come forth and now what happens is the lord found you just like elijah found elisha and now he's been brooding over your life a life has been waved in front of you more than doctrine more than books and tastes but all those things but it is the lord himself has been waved in front of you and you've been beholding an image i trust as you've walked with god you've seen god mature you and mold you and shape you and stabilize you and encourage you and strengthen you what's happening is you're becoming what you're beholding hallelujah and then so what is that now there's now a quickening so the holy ghost has come into you you have the same quickening power and elisha is now in you not just in the shadow form but in reality and a greater measure because of the blood of jesus christ now when they you know the lord has descended with a shout out right brother bram says in the rapture message that the shout is the message right it's not a it's not something we've got to work out he just says the shout is the message right he does all three things as he just as as he descends the shout the voice and the trumpet now the shout is the message now the voice we are to be lived voices so now that life comes into you and i and then our lives are actually voices speaking and brother braham says in if i can find it here but he says what jeffersonville needs today is thousands of lived voices the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness and purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy the inner the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump up or how much you can do this or that or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy consecrated life to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil so if we really want to shake the devil just live a sweet undefiled holy pure life before god just love the lord with all your heart that will shake the devil real good i like to see him shook don't you hallelujah amen and by the baptism the holy ghost we can live such a life hallelujah and then so now so there's the shout now the voice now now after these things what happens is the dead in christ race what brings them from the from the grave because remember it's a harvest so when god looks to upon the earth it's just like a natural harvest a farmer doesn't just wake up one day and say well it's the 25th of december or no not christmas but you know it's a certain day in the calendar i'm going to harvest my wheat now no he looked at the condition of the field and he says it's ready it's all golden it's all bowing before the presence of the sun it doesn't think it's something sticking up and saying look at me it's bound to the one that's worshipping right there's a maturity in the people am i just like remember immature wheat stands up like this look at me look what i can do but mature wheat bowls to the one that worships right it's the same thing with a mature believer it doesn't say look at me look what i can do about say lord you're my life you're my everything the only good in my life is you it's not me hello amen so now when the when the wheat comes to maturity then they then the farmer says i'm going to get the combine out and we're going to harvest so now what will bring the dead from the grave the dead in christ is a life on display the quickening power amen when the lord sees us come to that level of maturity whatever he dictates that to be then that life out the life within us will call the dead from the grave the dead in christ and then the rapture is on hallelujah that's why we said this that elisha's last miracle as the bride's last miracle amen and we are living that miracle out you know the thing is we get a you know everyone knows what it means to be acclimatized day like if you're not used to living at altitude and you go up there you find it hard to breathe but eventually you get acclimatized so you get used to a different atmosphere and it becomes normal you know what happens is you know we live in the world this is me anyway i was lost undone in the world i was used to that atmosphere but then i came into a different atmosphere of the holy ghost and you get acclimatized thank god to that kind of atmosphere and that's the atmosphere you want to stay in but then what happens is sometimes i mean we've got to go like we can't live as monks i'd love to buy the camp praise a lot but we can't live at camp we have to go out and be a living witness god wants us he's not afraid to put us in ladies here he's not afraid to put his bride in satan's eden he engineered it this way he had satan i'm going to put her in the worst stage of the worst time you can do basically everything you want certain limitations of course right but she is made in such a way that she's ordained not to fall amen that the world can be so dark and so wicked but she'll stand amen in the beauty of holiness and just keep walking on with god hallelujah we're made of hey if you're fallen this week just get back up if you have failed you may have failed monday monday night or tuesday morning you might just just get back up it's not him that falls at him that gets back up hallelujah amen you know but here we are here we are with this quickening power it's going to bring them from the grave you know we shouldn't be afraid to be alive in this age we have nothing to fear so i'm finished with that but you know we are living here we are living out this miracle as i said about being acclimatized you get used to a certain atmosphere then you go out into the world and the atmosphere you once enjoyed you say this is horrible they feel like dark yucky kind of you know that's the evil spirits it used to be yes they have fellowship i'm sitting by myself you said fellowship with those things but then god set you free and takes you to another atmosphere and that atmosphere becomes normal you get used to it you get used to being in heavenly places right you used to walk into your home in this piece and you know it's a different kind of atmosphere but don't let it become common you know oh you know you feel like you've lost like no no you just come become acclimatized to living in another atmosphere hallelujah don't let it become common though it should become normal though hallelujah but but you know praise the lord let's have the musicians please just walk with god friends walk with god amen hallelujah we're on our way to heaven's fair land amen but remember i said elisha didn't make the dead man come to life the life was already in him that resurrection power was already within him and it's the life of christ by the new birth inner people will bring forth the dead in christ and it's the lord that does the maturing just walk with god do you believe you're one of his he'll bring you to that spot just stay surrendered yielded to him loving him and he'll he'll mold and shape you amen lay in the prince of the sun hallelujah amen spend time with the lord that's what that means let god bring the maturity amen let's stand this morning amen the lord's good amen sorry brother isaac you got a song i don't know if anyone would not be one maybe sister living for jesus serving and following him oh boy i think so finally the words though that's true living i mean this is the best life this is the best life do we
