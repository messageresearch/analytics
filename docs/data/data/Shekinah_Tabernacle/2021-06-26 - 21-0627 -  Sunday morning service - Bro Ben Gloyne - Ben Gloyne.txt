========================================

[Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] praise the lord good morning welcome to church this morning amen it's good to be here it's good to be in the presence of god and with believers that have a good spirit about them a nice warm spirit i like people with warm spirits i don't really gel with cold evil spirits very well i don't know why but birds have a feather flock together that's what they say you know and we're attracted to our own kind not that we're anything special but you know when you are filled with the spirit of god then you just like people that are filled with the same spirit you feel comfortable when you fellowship when you talk and even if you don't say anything if you notice that like even when you don't talk it's comfortable because you know there's not going to be any weird stuff coming out it's just nice stuff you know like like even work you know that's i i'm a bit um naughty these days i've been able to pick my employ my workmates for about 20 years and i just like i don't really like working with non-christians i just don't do it i know no no one has that i shouldn't say that i feel bad saying that but i just like working with christians you know people like easy for you to say i shouldn't say that i was thinking this morning but it is i mean it is true i it even if i work with a non-christian and we don't talk it's comfortable i just it's a nice atmosphere you know like but yeah i i find i find it hard to to have deep meaningful conversation with with people that don't really appreciate the things of god because it's hard to find you know you have to keep it on quite a shallow level and i'm not really into that but anyway um i was thinking this morning you know we i don't know if i'm getting old am i am i old because because brother andy and i joke around at work you know we joke around like we're old tradies you know we say i've been doing this for 20 years you know like the old but i've actually i was thinking this morning and i've actually been coming i've been coming to church faithfully for 20 years like week and week out week and week out and i thought lord it's been an honor to be able to do that for you to show lord i can't repay what you've done for me but at least i can show lord this is i'm very grateful for what you've done for me for your sacrifice for your the effort you've put them for me and the least i could do is put this effort back in for you you know so here we are here this morning and every one of you are putting in an effort for the lord and the lord sees it the lord's not just a person that doesn't recognize that you got up this morning and said lord i'm going to go and worship i'm going to serve you i'm going to do whatever i need to do the lord that's not lost on the lord we sometimes think he doesn't see those things he actually sees everything you know and he appreciates the effort that everyone puts in so the lord is pleased with your effort here this morning to to to be here so um um let some stand and we're going to enter into some worship and we're going to um just get ourselves into a place where we can receive the word of god and become changed people this morning who's looking forward to being changed you're going to be changed we're in the presence of a life-changing god this morning so we are going to be changed we're going to be better in about a few hours time we're going to be better than what we are now that's the way that's the way life works life grows death goes backwards but life goes forward so let's um let's um close our eyes and just commit the service to the lord heavenly father we're so grateful lord that for your keeping power in each one of our lives lord we understand from the bottom of our heart lord and from everything that's in us that that there's nothing good that we've done lord or that we've said or that that we could attain lord to or do to merit your mercy and your grace lord but we understand that it's only by your your hand of mercy lord that you've called each one of us lord it's on that basis that we come this morning knowing lord that this is your work lord i'm not my work but i'm your work lord i'm your workmanship and each one here is your workmanship lord jesus so we're so grateful of that lord and we just want to invite you into our midst this morning lord that that you would have full control in our service full control being lord that we we don't let our mind go to places where you wouldn't feel welcome or where it wouldn't welcome you lord because we know lord your it's more than just a natural realm that we deal in but it's a spiritual realm lord and may our may our spiritual lives this morning invite you into our presence lord forgive us of any sins we've committed lord anything that would that would stop our fellowship with you and would stop you from just dwelling peacefully with us lord jesus because we desire to always be at peace with you lord and as brother branham put it lord on speaking terms with god so that so that we could just have all the things that you have for us this morning lord and for every day of our lives so we just want to commit the service to your hands and just thank you lord jesus in jesus name amen amen i just i said that word speaking terms with god because i found it interesting brother branham there were there was a service and people were up the front and brother branham said oh all you ministers everyone here that's on speaking terms with god come and pray for these people you know and that's true you know we we know when we're on speaking terms with god and we can we can come boldly before the throne of grace amen let's sing um take your shoes off moses you're on holy ground e take your shoes off moses you're on holy ground

way back in the day you know we used to go to um i think we used to head into cambridge and um maybe i was about six i think and i used to when i was during the service i thought that when i closed my eyes everyone else couldn't see you know so we were doing the songs and i thought when i i asked my brother i said can you ask tell me if you can see now and i'll close my eyes and he said i can still see i thought if i closed my eyes everyone else was it was all dark but i think i couldn't read that while maybe i was younger and but some other brother there would um he would always find me the words you know and then he would give me his book and point the song out and then i'd get it and then but i couldn't read it but i was like on the right words no yeah we're doing this and then the next song he'd do the same here because we had swap books and i don't know who that was but that was um it was in cambridge was a it was a little haul down by the river yeah heritage it's great to

hallelujah praise the lord amen we're strong let the weak say i am strong hallelujah amen thank you musicians thank you amen brother isaac amen just another reminder we have a youth service at 3 p.m today as well i mean so let's just go straight to the scripture shall we i trust everyone's had a good week everyone's well and rejoicing and um it's good to have everyone here praise the lord amen amen we're going to go to genesis chapter 3 and then we're going to go to ephesians 2. so very familiar piece of scripture i'm sure to us all if he um genesis 3 and 1 and we're going to read down to verse 8. so it says here now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the tree of the fruits i mean sorry we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat it neither shall you touch at least you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall surely not die for god doth know in that day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods known good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden and the cool of the day and the and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god among the trees of the garden amen we're going to go to ephesians chapter 2 uh verse 1 as well just for uh just a reading down to verse 7 and then we're going to then you may have your seats here so ephesians 2 and 1 and you have the quickened who are dead and trespasses and sins wherein in times past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the ear the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among uh among whom also we all had our conversation in times past and the lusts of our flesh the fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy amen i'm glad he's rich in mercy for his great lover and he loved us when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together to make us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through christ jesus amen so you may all have your seats this morning i just pray the lord would bless the reading of his word now i want to talk about the tactics of the serpent because we know the devil is a creature of habit what he did at the beginning he's still going to do right now and he will do until he's cast into the lake of fire now we so we have been looking through the past few services about how we're being made and as as you read there in ephesians 2 that the lord has made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus which is our which is the believer's position in christ and from that position we have the authority to bind the devil to cast him out to take dominion over all of his works and that's the position that they that that the lord has placed us in so but you know there is always the enemy trying to drag us from that position and we can see his working here with with with eve that what he did is he as he is he isolated her uh by herself put question mark on the word uh appeal to her reasoning and then uh then and then it said that when she looked upon the tree for it to be desired to make one wise what's happening now she's anointing her emotional realm and then all that was done to drag her from her god-given position and this is what the devil does to you and i yeah right amen so we've got to be very aware of this that we're not ignorant to the devil's devices i mean because if he can blindside you he'll blindside you real good and he'll keep light signing you until god steps on the scene so you know we have as i said that we have our god ordained position which is in heavenly places in christ jesus and we are there in order to conquer every enemy to walk a victorious life in christ now we know the devil is has been a squatter in that position because he's in the heavenlies too but we're here to cast them out through the spirit of god and we have been given authority over every devil every sickness and every spirit of unbelief but that is not the only enemy we have dominion over because our greatest enemy is ourselves right so it's not just all of hell that should be under your feet your own will and your own ability should be under your feet as well amen because to me the greatest miracle jesus ever did was he he subjected his own body to god's will for his life i mean he went to calvary as a man with the sins of the world upon his shoulders amen to me that was that was the greatest miracle he ever did amen so so the so the serpent i mean the devil through the serpent used eve against herself in order to dethrone man from dwelling in heavenly places now we are here so so you say well but i've been restored back and i'm sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus i know my position now that may be true but that won't stop the devil from trying to drive you out of that position so that you're no longer operating by the spirit of god but you're living as a carnal believer now we read in romans 8 and 1 there is therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus amen who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so yes there's no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus but you've got to walk after the spirit not after the flesh but the but the devil wants you to walk in the flesh that's what he wants you to do i mean that's what his fixation is because he knows if you walk in your flesh he's got you i mean just like when the prophet was there and tommy osborne was a witness to it that maniac came up on the platform and you know you know he's a demon possessed man he already beaten up some other preachers and he came up there and he and he was threatening the prophet saying i'm going to tear you limb from limb and he got right in his face and he spat in his face and he's trying to why he's trying to get the prophet to go operate in a carnal way because remember brother brown was a trained boxer right but he knew this was not a spirit a fight against flesh and blood but this is demon powers coming to challenge the spirit of the living god and and so the prophet actually he actually felt sorry for the man and divine love projected hallelujah and then and then he you know and then that man was about to punch him but he said you know we'll see who's yo you know there's a challenge and um you know the prophet said you know you because you've challenged the spirit of god you're gonna fall at my feet and then that demon just said i'll show you who's gonna whose feet who's gonna fall over whose feet he wants to go punch him and he falls over and he pins the prophet's feet to the floor now if if brother brown tried to you know actually allow the devil to win that battle and get him into the flesh he would have been torn from limb and so this is the challenge that we face every day to walk after the spirit and not after the flesh amen because remember the biggest enemy we have is in have is you it's not lucifer it's not the demon over new zealand or the you know all the all the hordes of hell and you know the two thousand thousand demons have been released from the river euphrates or whatever that number is it's not them it's you remember they got whipped on calvary they already got been defeated jesus conquered hell death in the grave but now you've got to be conquered amen but it's your own choice it's your own human will it's it's it's what side you chose to yeah we're having church today how we're doing praise the lord now he says in perfect strength by perfect weakness he says there see we smother him out now now he's not talking about the devil talking about god here we drive him away from the poorest of us to the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep god out of our lives because of our own selves i've often said the greatest enemy i got is william branham he's the one that gets in god's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to play sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it you know that's the problem we get to a certain oh we're mature now now we can handle things because you know you know that's that's thinking you can do something about it and when he does he shoves god right out of the picture but when i can get rid of that guy when i can get to a place that he is out of the way then god can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about that's when god can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we've got ourselves in the way then he cannot so we gotta we're gonna get out of the way what's your job description to keep out of the way and let god have his way hallelujah but that's the challenge the devil doesn't want us to be kept out of the way he wants us to be carnal now you say well but i'm a sanctified holy ghost-filled believer we're still not exempt from these things you know we can allow people allow ill feelings jealousy insecurity unforgiveness towards anybody to rule them and that pushes god right out of the picture thinking that we know what we're doing because we are believers we've been down the road a bit that pushes him right out of the picture i mean but but why do those why do those feelings come up it's because the devil comes and he and what he does you know i was thinking about this you know we you know we read in um genesis where where before man begins to come on the picture it says and god made heavens and earth and that word means elohim the self-existing one but when man is about to come on the scene it says and the lord god made and that means the self-existing one who reveals himself so now he's got someone who's coming to the picture he can have a relationship with he can talk with he can walk with he can reveal his you know his heart who he is too that's man but then when the serpent comes along he says yay hath god said so he's trying to get eve to think now god is some distant somebody that doesn't care about her or is even conscious of what is going on and i was thinking what kind of lives would we live if we were conscious god was always worth us every moment of every day i'm talking about in our secret little chambers where it's just it's just you and your whatever you do you know would you talk differently uh to people or about people if your conscious god was right there because he's there right he's not some distance somewhere on the other side of somewhere so many billion light years away he's not he's he he's here right so i wonder if we would talk differently about each other or even people in the world or you know and then brother brown even got told by the angel lord your thoughts speak louder and heavier than your words so i was wondering if we were really conscious of that would we let our minds just mereander along some garden path somewhere the devil takes us on some crazy boat right you know in our thought pattern what do we think that way if we're conscious god knows all about it i think i think our lives would kind of change a little bit don't you know if we're really conscious god he's right there he knows everything you do hallelujah amen and i to me i think that's wonderful i'm glad we don't serve some distant god somewhere who's not interested in you and i he's very interested his whole his whole focus is on the bride of christ getting us ready to leave this world hallelujah so i think you know our lives would be very much different but you see the you know the devil through the serpent got eve to believe that because she said no but god has said she didn't say the lord god has said she said god is said so she was agreeing with what the revelation the serpent was giving her and so she was also isolated from her husband you know we can be living in a house you can be actually in a church like this and be isolated you know don't really talk to anyone connect with anyone have a real friendship you know you can be an individual you know families sadly these days are a bunch of individuals in a house there's no real connection going on and what's that you're isolated now and then he begins to put a question mark on the word and that's what the devil always done you know you see all these websites and parasites and things online that's always question question question question you know it's all questions and that's like the serpent yay hath god said is it really true does this really happen to this really do and i came to the conclusion i don't have to go back to the holy land and dig down to find where abraham was i don't have to go to egypt and find out where the children of israel were i don't have to go to iraq to the era of the chaldees and find out where his you know papa was from abraham i don't have to go i don't have to go where paul was to believe that paul preached and he was in prison and there he was i don't have to go there right i don't have to go to america and see jeffersonville and all i don't have to go and see whatever god did through history to really believe it he reveals his word and you believe it because you see it manifesting in your life that's the proof of the pudding right but the devil says did it really happen well i know this word is true because it lives in my life i believe the whole word of god because god did something to my life i met the author of the book hallelujah so the biggest challenges that he was is yay hath god said is it really the truth well it's vindicated itself and i can just say these little four walls here it's proven itself hallelujah and then now she then when when he opened when she opened her mind to him his reasoning then she then he appealed to her emotions and that's why a thought comes into your mind some ill feeling comes up what's already happened the devil's already already appealed to your mind you've agreed with the thought that the emotion comes up you grab a hold of it and then what happens you're carnal and this is all the way through well this is us hello you know maybe i'm just preaching about myself you know i don't know but let's take off our angel wings and you know here we are but we're in this real battle right but we've been given overcoming power i mean to break the cycle of the devil what we don't have to listen to is nonsense anymore but we can discern and withstand the antichrist spirit in our midst hallelujah amen because i want to sit in heavenly places and i want to you know i want to manifest what jesus purchased on calvary he went through i think brother isaac said he went through a lot of effort i mean to redeem me so much i'll live out his victory don't you think so i mean so now we are called not to walk in a carnal way but to walk after the spirit now if you think about walking after the spirit then therefore if we walk after the spirit all things are possible now brother brown had a um if i could find it here he had a lady come up in the prayer line and she she had a deaf spirit on her and he says here oh can i find it let me find this good old technology but she has a deaf spirit on her and she's come come forward for prayer he says it at thy word in 51 but just have faith now believe that god is and there is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him you believe that with all your heart all right now i see right now it's in her ears she's she's got a deaf spirit on her almighty god author of life and giver of every good gift send thy blessings upon this woman and healer thou art here lord and this devil knows that his time has come to this woman entering into the sphere of faith here he knows he's got to lose he can't hold her any longer so she was stepping into a sphere of faith and because it and the devil knows when everyone steps into that kind of realm he has to let go his time has come i mean so how would it be this morning or actually for the every moment for the rest of the rest of our lives if we just lived in that sphere of faith not of a sphere of ill feeling and resentment and grudges and unforgiveness uncertainty but it's fear which is unbelief all that but a sphere of faith amen where wherever we step into that into that realm the devil knows he can't hold you any longer hallelujah and this is the kind of place we're ordained to live in amen this is actually our address as a sphere of faith i mean that's why jesus died amen that a people would be lifted back up into heavenly places in christ jesus where adam and eve fell from i mean they'd operate by faith they wouldn't operate by faith i mean by sight but by faith hallelujah but imagine if we're living in that kind of sphere of faith right now hallelujah and you don't have to imagine it no it's our portion hallelujah where the devil's got to let go he can't be there any longer hallelujah they say well does it really matter about about what can happen based on how i feel or what i'm doing well i tell you jesus went back to nazareth and it says in matthew 13 he said he couldn't do many mighty miracles there he couldn't do many miracles there because their unbelief and they were astonished they were offended because they began to ask questions is this not the carpenter's son is not his mother called mary these are his brethren you know james and joseph simon and judas and his sisters are they not all with us whence has this man all these things and they were offended in him but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor saving his own country and saving his own house and they and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief they were offended at the fulfillment of the messiah not at the idea of the messiah i doubt very much if we went there before jesus was ever born and and we asked the question the messiah is coming that's a praise praise jehovah god we're excited to see him you know look at these scriptures they get all excited about the prophecy but the fulfillment offended them and it's always the way through history as the fulfillment of scripture that offends the people not the idea behind it or the prophecy behind it is the fulfillment amen but because they took him to you know they they only saw his natural side as naturals family sign they were offended in him in the idea of him being the messiah and their unbelief hindered him that he could not do many mighty couldn't do many miracles there that was a sphere of unbelief but if we can get us into a sphere of faith where all things are possible amen to this problem that we face you know this devil that's fighting tormenting us he's got to let go we don't have to put up with him no longer amen by their faith amen will drive him away hallelujah amen now amen so this is basically where i'm going um you know the scripture i mean brother braham says here speaking about he says the devil's always trying to point out to somebody's failure but he tries to keep you away from the real testimony that's genuine why is that because that would build faith that's why always points to the failure he'll point you to a hypocrite sometime who went out impersonating something he didn't he didn't do it because he was impersonating but if it come from the true source of the word of god heavens and earth will pass away but my word cannot pass away it's got to stay there he says you see it says it must be accepted in the mind then believed in the heart then the word of god becomes a reality then every every senses of soul and body as a spirit and body as you scout out with the holy spirit then your sense of god your conscience of god everything that's godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up there's nothing that can come up in the memory and say well i remember miss jones tried to trust god i missed so and so missed though tried to trust god for healing sometime and she failed what is that that's the tactics of the serpent this person tried and they failed so what's that reasoning against the word of god and then a bit of ill feeling unbelief comes up that feeling that a wall goes up what's that why because it's it's it's the devil engaging into our emotional realm but if that channel's been cleared out and being purged and be filled on the inside with the holy spirit that don't even come in memory no matter about miss jones and what she did it's you and god together nobody else but you too there you are there's your battle kill him at the beginning what's that don't even listen to his lies i mean stop him dead in his track it ain't how long you can make the law make the war linger it stop it right now amen we don't have to let this thing drag on you can stop it right now this has got to come to an end hallelujah romans 12 1 says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service i mean so we are called to continually be a living sacrifice on his altar amen it's not a one-time thing it's a daily living in the presence of the king you know some people think i'll just have a one-and-done experience at camp you gotta keep walking with god we need a fresh experience amen amen we cannot live on the past we're gonna live in the present amen we were continually living in the presence of the king where because this word should never become common this is how i say this how you kind of know that you're trying to live off a past experience the word becomes common it doesn't excite you anymore you just go through the motions that's you know we're not called to have that kind of walk you know you know a honeymoon should never end between a husband and wife that honeymoon phase should never end in spite of all the busyness of life and children all these things you should still have that freshness about your relationship it should be still wonderful and you should appreciate them and you know that's how it should be with the lord too hallelujah and he says in the next verse be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove that what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god so we are called not to be conformed to this world or this world's order which is its way of thinking so what is the world full of today selfishness it's all about me it's the age of the selfie right it's the era of the cult of self where people worship themselves remember the scripture says you come in the end time lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god so they'll be religious but they'll worship themselves in their own pleasures more than they'll worship god new clothes new car new phone new renovations new holiday me me me now what does that breed jealousy people become unhappy when others do well in life and it produces insecurity because of people always comparing themselves with themselves which is which the scripture says is unwise right comparing their children with other children comparing their churches with other churches discontentment uh which is produced i mean it's really from discontentment but the scripture tells us to be con godliness with contentment is great gain i want great gain don't you hallelujah so that's what happens now this is the age we're living in but the apostle paul says do not be conformed to this world so don't don't don't be trapped into this thought pattern this is not you know if if you're thinking like this that's a carnal way it's not a spiritual way so we shouldn't be conformed to that but but then we begin if you ever really begin to think about what the lord has done hallelujah you really think about what he's done for you in your life amen wasn't it he that saved you by his grace washed you by his grace transformed you by his grace set your feet on the king's highway that leads you up to glory by his grace has he done that i mean when you begin to think on those things i mean it's no longer the you know you know to me that renews your mind lord you've given me another day hallelujah you're still alive you've done all this for me and lord what's what's today going to bring and then everything else around you just kind of fades away you don't care about how much money you've got in the bank who cares about that or your clothes if then you're old or whatever you know you're not too worried about those kind of things i mean because he is everything amen i love this quote from mighty conqueror brother tazowa brought it out at camp he says man was refused from men was refused from heaven now as i say think about what the law has done for you the highways was closed there was no highway but where there was no highway he came to make one oh my the first line was demons of doubt the next was prejudice the next was selfishness this earth was covered all over with lines of demon power then sickness diseases but when he began to ascend up to heaven last night we adam coming out of hell with the keys of death and hell on the side this morning we're taking him up hallelujah when he rose he was triumph and as he went up he broke through every demon power that holds over man he ascended on high and give gifts to man the gifts of the holy spirit the mighty conqueror he stands alone this morning and between him and every believer is the blessed old highway of holiness that the righteous walk shall walk on there is not a way of escape there is only one one line cut down from glory he left the bloody footprints as he walked through the corridors of demon powers and made a highway for us all the way through he sits on high this morning as the mighty conqueror i mean so for you and i he cut through all unbelief superstitions resentment amen all demon power sickness unbelief prejudice he cut through all those things he said my son and my daughter i want you to walk up this way amen from earth to glory hallelujah he did that for you and i amen you just think about what he did is it incredible oh my he's done so very much for me i cannot tell at all hallelujah amen amen first corinthians tells us i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily the apostle paul says amen then he says if after the manner of men i have fought with the beast of ephesus what advantages at me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners now many times we think of this evil communications corrupting good manners there's actually a bad influence in the world coming in and corrupting us which happens right you can't put rotten apples with good apples in the same basket and expect the good apples to fix the bad apples but in reality it's not that well that is true in one sense but in the other sense it's actually the corruption of good manners from the evil communication is actually out of the believer themselves now this word evil i'm just going to throw some dictionary definitions at you from the thais this is the bible dictionary he says evil is of a good nature i mean i'm sorry of a bad nature it's it's a mode of thinking feeling or acting that's what the devil wants you to do feel in a bad way think in a bad way act in a bad way i mean it's troublesome it's destructive and it's injurious now this word corrupt it means to corrupt or to destroy but it has another meaning which means to lead away a christian church from that state of knowledge and holiness in which it ought to be or to abide now i'm bringing this down to the individual right so now a man could interpret holiness by length of dress or how loose loose clothing is or modesty in that way but people can dress all the right way but have a temper to fight a buzzsaw and they'll take them all on at once right so real holiness comes from the inside out true it is there from the outside with modest dressing but it's really a cleansed and pure heart that thinks no evil holds no malice holds no grudges or resentment or unbelief right so and then our manners it says as a moral habits now putting all this together i could say first corinthians 15 33 says be not deceived but communicating or speaking bad natured troublesome things that injure and destroy a person will cause the person that does this to be led away from a true state of knowledge and holiness and become corrupted that they're no longer pure in their heart yet still professing to serve god so it's really you know it's it's those things they corrupt the person doing them but someone who's always making snide them snide remarks tearing people down saying negative things about people that's evil communication and it doesn't just hurt the person that it's being sent at but it's hurting the person it comes out of amen so we don't but the devil's tactic is to get us into that kind of carnal state so we don't want to ever go down that way amen but it should be so that's why he says don't be deceived be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners i think i've got everyone's attention just about now hello but you see that's the thing is we can walk in a carnal state where god can't use us like he wants to use us because the devil the devil speaks to our mind gets our emotions makes us agree with those because i'm feeling this way so it must be real right you know all this memory so alive because it's made me feel the certain way it takes me back there the devil takes you back there because he's trying to get you dragged down into a carnal state i mean what then what happens is that now god can't work through us anymore and we're just a carnal believer we're not called to be in this kind of state you know it's amazing how a misunderstanding can snowball into a big thing brother braham says in the everlasting life and how to receive it he said it could be it could be psychology you say do you see that there and you keep saying yes i believe it and believe it so much till actually you think you see it then you don't see that's right but that's psychology but uh if you just get so mentally pressed towards it till you just imagine it so imagine it so much till it becomes reality you just imagine somebody hates you once and they don't hate you but you imagine they do and and you just keep thinking they don't like me and the first thing you'll be shunning that person when they haven't done nothing to you now what's happened now is there's been a misunderstanding the devil plays on that misunderstanding so that person don't like you and and it's you know they oh that person doesn't like me and then you feel you know insecure and you're in your word and so the devil takes your feelings and basically writes those things and makes you act a totally way actually makes you act a way that's totally contrary to reality and after a while it becomes so a reality to you till you actually believe that person doesn't like you and you'll might ball them out or say something or say something to you for instance your wife or your husband or some neighbor or something like that when the person is absolutely innocent of any ill thing it's because you just imagine it so till it become a reality to you you see what i mean see this is this is a trap that we can come into our brother so-and-so didn't shake my hand three sundays in a row this happened or you know brother cabin's always sitting in the back i think he doesn't like me the devil could play on that i can say that because he's my buddy you know but you know the devil could play on that or look at these brothers behind the sounders they're always behind the sound disc they're not interested in what's going on the devil could play on that you say well that's ridiculous that's how ridiculous some people get trapped into you know so we never ever you know we don't want you know as as jesus would say a little levin living with the whole lump so i'm going to start with just a little insignificant thing but it'll change and you think about yeast it changes the whole structure and chemistry of the bread the whole thing gets changed by just a little powder that's kind of sprinkled in or activated a certain way and it's the same thing with this it can change your whole your whole demeanor how you how you speak how you act can change because all that person's here and they're just happy praising god and everything's one they have no idea what's going on but in your mind it's this big thing and what's that the devil using your emotions and your and your reasoning to tear you down and become a carnal person you know we should who forgives everyone in this room let's just let go of everything right now whatever the past is forgetting the things that you're in the past let's just forget it we're pressing on oh what about last week i can't what happened last week i don't know what about last year is that so far what happened i don't know but that person did that what do you mean amen so our years got a goldfish memory no no the blood of jesus christ can come into your life in such a way that you cannot hold anything against anybody jesus said father forgive them they don't know what they do and if you look at the case you say no they planned this they orchestrated it they were waiting for the right man to come which was judas to you know find out where he is and go secretly and you know they planned the whole thing they knew what they were doing they thought but they didn't really know he was the prince of life but you know the lord can move in your life and such and this is not pie in the sky you know you know perfect faith is based on forgiveness you read that about you if you stand to this mountain you know when you're standing pray forgive jesus says so let's just forget about you know can we can we do that i forgive brother all these people hold nothing against them amen hallelujah we want to walk into a sphere of faith where the devil has to go hallelujah but you see now it can be the world we live in god wasn't panicking when he made ladies here or when he allowed ladies here to come he wasn't panicking that as bright as she going to make it through right he wasn't he's not stressing his blood pressure hasn't gone through the roof he's not got panic attacks in heaven he's not in a state of emergency he knows that his salvation is strong enough and the devil does not have enough to to defeat the bride of christ in this hour he knows that the devil cannot win because he's seen to the end of the book he's seen all the way through time and then when time is no more and eternity rolls on so do you think he's panicking no do you think he's worried about the devil's devices no why because he's equipped us with the with the right weapon and armor to defeat the devil anytime anyplace anywhere you know the prophet said this end time message meets end-time conditions i mean so whatever condition the end time is in right now this message meets this condition i mean the word we have received is far greater than the devil's tactics his psychological warfare his propaganda you know when he comes along and says it ain't gonna happen it cannot happen they're never coming back and you could just ask him do you know the future devil that's right he don't know the future he's got his algorithms and projects a few forecasts but you know he's like a weather man maybe a bit better than the weatherman sometimes but you know he's kind of thinking oh if this happens i can get this to happen but he's just projecting things he has his goal but he doesn't really you know he's got plans but he doesn't know the future so we could really ask him devil do you know tomorrow because you're telling me this is never going to happen maybe he's wasting breath talking to him but you just think about it he tell oh this ain't gonna happen you never see nothing move you know oh you say you've claimed them and this is gonna happen but you don't see anything and you say devil you don't know tomorrow my lord holds tomorrow hallelujah and my lord said all the father all that come to me i'll know why it's cast out and we have a story of the prodigal son i mean we've got cases of people who are you know there's a woman that was being brought up in the prayer line before brother branham and she died in the prayer line i learned she came back to life and she was in the meetings after that even years down the road hallelujah so don't tell me my god can't do i mean whatever the devil's fighting or trying to hold you and says oh i've got this you can't get it back who said that you know i love about the story of ziglag and david hallelujah because he he he encouraged himself from the lord you know no doubt the devil because he his own men turned against him they even consulted we're going to stone david and you think about these men they forsook all to follow this runaway i mean this man who's on the run you know if not that israel had you know the fbi in those days or whatever but you know he would have been numb one of the most wanted top ten was david maybe plastered around every city was posters dead or alive david of bethlehem you know but these men knew he was coming into power oh they knew he was coming into power and they forsook all to follow david but then they came to a place where you know they'd come back and they came back to zig lag where home was and they saw the smoke rising or whatever they saw and they came back into the city and they saw all their children all their family was gone the things that were most precious to them were gone and they and they got to such a spot because it says yeah the bible says they wept until they could weep no more hallelujah but then they and then they even in their pain and anguish because now no doubt the devil's just yo playing on this now look where he's brought you you thought this man would become king he can't even protect your families look at look at your reward of serving this man and they begin to talk yeah that you know emotions are relay we're not robots overcoming is not shutting down your emotions that's not healthy we have real emotions we should feel happy we should feel sad when we're sad we should grieve when we you know suffer loss you know david said when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i so it's okay for our us to feel overwhelmed right so no doubt the devil played on them and then they consulted now we're just going to stone him we're just going to get rid of this guy and so no doubt david now he would feel the same anguish because his own family had been taken where'd they go and they didn't know and and and as children all these things were gone and no doubt the devil is playing on his mind it's over you've crossed a bridge too far you know you've you've overextended yourself this is the end look even your own even your own men are gonna try and kill you they want to stone you they didn't have happy grins on their face they were angry at this man they were angry at david but he encouraged himself in the lord see this is the big challenge you know it's easy after the trial to praise and rejoice and say god did this and god did this what about in the valley when the enemy's pressing in you can even feel his breath on your neck and you're fighting and there's great anguish and trials and trouble in your mind i mean can you rejoice even in that moment amen because you know there's got to be a mountain after the valley hallelujah it's not always valleys all the time there's got to be a mountain oh there's got to be an end of a trial maybe every trial has an expiry date it's got a best before date and it goes off it's done right hallelujah and so here he is he delights himself in the lord why because he began to think back i was a shepherd boy the prophet samuel came to my home even my own father didn't consider me but god god told samuel i've got a king in jesse's house and i just happened to be that man hallelujah and i felt the anointing oil come down remember sometimes you've got to go back and remind god of the covenant he made with you remember it's one thing for us to make a promise to god but when he makes a promise to you that's a very different thing because he cannot fail on his side of the bargain he will not withdraw he'll not say well i'm sorry the conditions have changed and you know you know it's it's unprecedented times i'll be kind and you know it's covered 19. you know i'm sorry we just we can't i can't fulfill my word in this kind of season that's not how god works i mean when he promised his word he knew the condition that it would be fulfilled in your life he knew the troubles you'd be going through the strife whatever may be happening the global events everything he knew what would be happening but yet he said i'm going to fulfill that in your life irrespective of what's going on and so david began to encourage himself said lord i remember when the anointing oil was poured upon me by a vindicated prophet where i could say when the word was poured out hallelujah and some and he said the spirit of god was with him from that day on hallelujah and lord i remember when i was taken from there and there's a lion came and i killed the lion and then the bear came in and i killed the bear cause those sheep were not going to be food for a lion or a bear i mean i'm not yeah i didn't let the devil get one of my sheep hallelujah and then i was just taking my brother's lunch them in the battle and then goliath was there holly and you anointed that stone lord i swung it round hallelujah even through my own voice i spoke you spoke of his his demise hallelujah i'll cut your head off david said he didn't even have a sword hallelujah and then so yeah and then and then david went down i mean sorry goliath went down david cut his head off with glass sword and he walked out packing the victory hallelujah and then he could go through all those things what was he doing he was delighting or encouraging himself with the lord his god lord you brought me thus far amen and what does that do that silences that's hissing of the serpent hallelujah because you see really god's made a covenant with me as i said before it's not us making a promise to god which we must give our lives to but it's really when you realize he's made a covenant with you and he will bankrupt heaven before he lets that fall to the ground hallelujah and then he began to encourage himself in the lord and then he begin to acquire with god god what shall we do and then he was told pursue for you shall recover all hallelujah you shall recover all amen so that he went from being just you know in despair and trouble but because his source of strength was god i trust he's your source of strength it's not your carnality not what you think about people and trying to have a higher higher status in the church forget it we're all the same by the way you know forget that kind of thing or all the influence you have over this one whatever no forget all that stuff our source of strength should not be the number of friends we have or we're the best friend with everyone or this or whatever no our source of strength is god i mean this word that he's given us that should be our source of strength he went to a source of strength and his and what did he do he stepped into a sphere of faith and he was promised you shall recover all hallelujah and what to do he pursued amen and he went and got what the devil had taken maybe in his mind before that happened he thought how am i ever going to get out of this one and the devil always plagues just with uncertainty how is this ever gonna happen you know we're gonna you know there's a there's a uh um uh in in pidgin english i know this may sound a bit silly but in pigeon english if you say it's your problem you say problem belong you right if we are if we are in god's economy we are god's problem he's going to look after us right he has to fulfill his word in our lives i mean if we're surrendered to remember david was thinking how am i gonna how am i ever gonna how am i ever gonna get my family back they're not here they're not dead among ziggler they're gonna be somewhere but he had a you know but when god said you'll recover all he just believed he's gonna recover all he wasn't worried about the details this is just me he just knew the word was going to be fulfilled harlem what did he do he recovered all shouldn't that be the same thing with you and i am i don't know how it's going to happen but i believe it's going to happen i mean i don't know how the body i don't know how the rapture is going to happen i believe it's going to happen sure you know while the you know the holy ghost comes and you and our bodies you know i understand that that but how's it really going to happen the dead in christ are going to rise you know i want to see brother blue kennedy sister val different ones have gone on you know i don't know how they're going to come out of the grave i know by the power of god but you know what i mean hallelujah the details of that all belongs to god amen hallelujah so now i you know all things are possible to them that believe amen so don't be all shut down because what happened eve was basically shut down because of the lies of the serpent we shouldn't worry about what the devil tries to do you know even it says here in in hebrews 3 take heed brethren least there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the living god but exalt one another daily while it's called today at least any of you should be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin now this word hardened it means surrender stubborn now someone becomes stubborn because they think their idea is better than the idea presented to them irrespective of of how of how illogical their stand may be right so and then also this hardening means to lose i'm hard and also means to lose feeling so it's a it's a stubbornness but but in that you actually lose feeling towards the lord now there was a brother there was a brother evan john roberts who who was a he was a young man who was one of the leaders of the welsh revival and before the revival broke out who knows what about the welsh revival even yep okay before that revival broke out there was a brief period of time in his life where he said even seeing the cross brought no tears to his eyes it didn't stir his heart anymore and that greatly bothered him thankfully the lord brought him out of it but the danger is some people get used to losing feeling we're not a bunch of wood we have feeling but he was bothered lord why does this not move me anymore it's the emblem of suffering and shame he took my sins up on your pin to a cross now to a cross why does this not bother me anymore you know what i mean i mean why does it why does it you know not stir me anymore and that bothered him and the lord brought him out of it so he must never ever get to a place where living in just a carnal state is normal right we must always i trust have you ever walked in a spiritual way where the lord is you know you just fall in love with him i believe in a heartfelt religion this message is a heartfelt religion hallelujah it's not head knowledge it's a heartfelt religion so you think about what the lord has done for you and how great he is and just how much you know we should never it should never become common you know it's like you're like you know a marriage and god forbid it ever happened but you know you're you know you're in your first love and then a few years down the track it's all hey you you know it just kind of boils down to nothing that should never be with the lord so oh lord you're my everything i love you so much and then a few years down the ladder oh hey you how are you you're not you know not even the how are you it should never come down to that deceitfulness it's to give a false impression the serpent gave a false impression to eve you won't die the consequences aren't really death you'll be like god's doing good and evil they already were gods they already were gods you know but what the world wants to do or the serpents do is expand your mind expand your world what to know well they already knew good but now i want to teach you evil you need to get out more you know it's a false impression because the reality of the consequences were really an entirely different thing what did it make them do god came down for fellowship in the call of the evening and they hid themselves the day before that hallelujah father god how are you this is awesome how's your day in the garden children are wonderful and they worship god under the great cathedral of the trees and different things you know but because of this happened they hid from god we don't want to hide from him no time anywhere amen now if i have amen as i said before uh a little levin living with the whole lump and sin can be so deceitful that we even think that that it's actually someone else's the problem ahab would come to a spot where the drought had come on elijah had come into the throne room and said to him and jezebel no rain or jew will fall from the ground until i call for it and then so elijah is now you know you know the droughts come on and he's got to take i'm sorry not elijah but ahab's got a you know it takes you know the horses and animals and they're trying to find water and pasture for them through through israel and then he meets elijah and then ahab says to elijah aren't you the one that troubleth israel in other words this is all your fault elijah this is our deceitful sin was this is your fault elijah that we're in this predicament but elijah said to him no it's your fault because you and your father's house they have forsaken the commandments of god have followed baal that's how deceitful sin can be i'm nearly done now in james 1 and 13 we're just going to read through this and then we'll and then we'll um and then we'll go james one and and well i got 14 here but does anyone understand how the devil um speaks to your emotions makes you feel a certain way because you feel that certain way you go that certain way we've got to guard against that right you're gonna you've got to really it's real good sometimes to take stock of your life it takes the lord to really do it where you actually get next to yourself and really just examine why do i think this way why do i feel this way and it could be and it could be the truth oh brother so-and-so literally did this and this and this and this to me and he told me yeah i meant it you know well but does that give us any right no one's done that here by the way but you know but even if they did would that give me any right to hold it against them well of course they should be like this they should be loving and kind and they should speak on but what about you it's really about how we respond that really matters amen because even jesus said you know don't try and take the little basically twig out of your brother's eye when you've got a whole beam in your own eye oh i've got to fix this person no no what about you that you can see clearly you know so it's like lord help us lord help me amen and yeah i'm preaching to myself thank you for turning up uh james um 1 and 13. but every man is tempted hey we're all in this battle together we're all human being right yes good okay but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and entire sorry can you go back to verse 13 just just just real quick let no man say he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither attempteth he any man now next one you go to 14. but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust has conceived it bringeth forth death i was bringing forth sin and sin when his finish bringeth forth death do not uh my beloved brethren so he's saying here because men say oh praise the lord i'm being tempted of god he said no no no this is not true it's it's your own lust draws you away and you're enticed so there's so how does that really work the devil appeals to something in you to draw you away because if you say well god's god's allowed this i must just go through this trial hold on you know no it's we're drawn away by our own lust and enticed now he says do not er my beloved brethren now this this word er means to wander out of the way so don't wander out of the way brethren just keep walking with the lord he says for every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning but uh of his own will he uh so of his own will beget he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god now what is the wrath of man basically you get annoyed at someone else you try and be a better christian that's the wrath of man and but you know when it says the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god what that means is the wrath of man cannot accomplish or fashion or perform the righteousness of god so you being angry with someone else cannot actually um perform or manifest or you know fashion the righteousness of god in your life wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluidity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any bear hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and gotham's way and straight away forgetteth what manner of man he is so he has been observing himself in the mirror but then when he walks away he forgets who he is and this is and this is how we must you know we got to remember who we are right i'm just gonna i'm gonna close just with this thought when the serpent came to eve he was giving her a different identity if you do this you'll be like god is knowing good and evil surely he was a god you know and that's how what could happen is because remember we're everything we should do we should walk after the spirit and we sing we sing in the spirit pray pray in the spirit how we deal with each other should be in the spirit not in our carnal makeup but if we go away from seeing what the word says about us and then the enemy comes in with a thought or something and we get into a carnal state what's happened we've beheld our image in the glass but then when we walk away and deal in a kind of way we forget who what manner of people we are amen i just finished with this quote here i know i've seen that a lot but let's just do this one divine healing in 54 sometimes we have growing pains when we get to be men and women when we're born in the kingdom of god christ but the thing about it is it hurts the thing about this it just makes you joyful and happy it's growing pains you're going out getting bigger getting to be a bigger man now what you used to be you can look you can look over things not you just get wider shoulders that don't mean nothing about it but you're wider in here see not across here and here here is where you're supposed to spread out bigger in your heart on the inside when christ comes into the heart then he comes into the mouth then he comes into the eyes and he comes into the mind he comes into the mouth he makes you talk different you don't talk like you used to christ got you got in your mouth done grow it out done growed now from your heart your love you had for him till you can bridle your tongue brother that's a great thing then the next thing you know he grows into your eyes the next thing you know you find out that old lustful things you used to look at you'll turn your head you're growing then the first thing you know you still turn your head but you're thinking see after a while it grows into your mind you don't even think about it no more then you're just a great big boy then you're coming into a full matured man living for the lord so then you're in christ then a new creature isn't that wonderful hallelujah we can just grow the lord i

emotions she saw that the tree was to be desired off but that's an emotion and it dragged her from being god over the earth joint ears with adam dragged dragged her down that she was now under satan's grip and was under his control but the new birth my friends takes us from that and places us back in heavenly places in christ jesus that we're no longer under the devil's control but now he is under
