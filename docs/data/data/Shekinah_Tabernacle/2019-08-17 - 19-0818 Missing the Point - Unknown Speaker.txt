verse to you and then we're going to enact the stories that we've read and then we're gonna say our memory verse again with a bit of a spin on it now this is a bit of impromptu skit we practice two times which is about 30 30 minutes altogether so yep we'll share it with you but we'll also have fun in the meantime so have patient [Applause] is this for me or is the lighted way okay are we all in position okay here we go the lighted way and we've got Fred Fred come on out right out in the front hi Fred Fred had been sent on an errand to his uncle's farm he thought he knew the way well as it had been described in detail to him by his parents but as the shades of evening gathered he began to get a little anxious I should have been there alone I should have been there a long time ago he said to himself I must have taken the wrong road somewhere I wish someone would come along whom I could ask but nobody came when darkness fell half hour later Fred was standing in the midst of a woods without the faintest idea which way to go well I'm in a fix he said to himself what shall I do in this other darkness he could not find I can not find my way back home let alone go to my uncle's farm for some minutes he stood still thinking a bit afraid there's one thing I can do he said to himself by and by but I wonder if it will make any difference a moment or two later he shut his eyes put his hands together and asked Jesus to show him the way out of the woods to his uncle's farm when he opened his eyes the first thing he noticed was what seemed to be a path of light through the trees strange he thought I never saw that before what does it mean anyhow I'll follow it I'll follow it when it cm so on he went following the glow of light and Teller last he was out of the woods when he ceased yeah when it ceased yep they turn off the light now he saw another light in the distance and walked towards it I'll just wait for our props to come back this way awesome you're coming to the farmhouse how yep when he found it came from the farmhouse he quickened his steps where he saw it was his uncle's farm how happy he was to get there without any mishap all safe and sound but the path of light in the woods he said to his uncle as they talked over experience his experience that evening how did it come to be there lo worms said his uncle smiling and so it was but God can use even glow worms to answer a little boys prayer [Applause] yeah and I know there was a couple of stories not just that testimony my husband has one where he was lost and he grew up in a prayerful family and you two go to the Lord and he got out from being lost as well were you with your brothers yeah with his brothers so we don't have anything to be afraid of okay now the next one we need okay all right we'll just give out our props that was another thing we did we practiced in our room we did practice out here so thank you for being with us here we go in a humble cottage friends and a humble cottage and friends the poor by body men was dying oh you'll have to give me some grace - because Pauline is only son to him he said my many troubles will come to you in this world but always remember that all comes from above then you will find it easier to bear everything with patience shortly after this poor man died and little Peter found himself quite alone in the world the only thing he could do for a living was to go out and beg as he went from door to door in the villages he would sing to the people receiving from them just enough to keep them alive to keep him alive every time anybody gave him some food or money he used to say it comes from above remembering his father's last words thank you girls you can sit down it became a habit with him to use these words whenever it whatever happened to him and he found that they did indeed help him to bear everything with patience ready Abraham you ready to stand up Jonathan you got the sheet ready yep guys stand on your chair okay we had to get a sponge something soft for Abraham to throw you'll you'll realize why one day he was passing through a village a sudden gust of wind blew a tile off a nearby house it's struck Peter on the shoulder knocking him to the ground it comes from above where his first words as he regained his feet at which you can imagine the by standards laughed heartily Hey a minute later however another gust of wind tore off the entire roof off of called it a little further down the street had little Peter gone on he might have been killed by it so he thought to himself that tile had that had struck him and hurt him had indeed come from above on another occasion um on another occasion little Peter ready ready with the first prop put that one down that one's for later on another occasion little Peter was employed by a wealthy gentleman to carry an important letter to a businessman in a neighboring town as he was told to be quick Peter ran as fast as he could coming to a stream he tried to jump over it but alas he fell in and was nearly drowned when he finally climbed out onto the bank drenched and weary he found that the precious letter had disappeared try as he would he could not find it in the muddy water [Music] sadly made his way back to the rich gentleman's house naturally enough the gentleman was very angry with him in fact he drove him out of the house with a stick but all Peter would say was it comes from above next day however the gentleman sent for him yes yes you are falling into the stream was a fortunate accident for me oh he said something changed overnight if that letter had been delivered I should have suffered a serious loss please accept this little gift as a token of my gratitude and the gentleman put more money turned towards the audience ribbon more money into his hand um then he had seen for many a long day it comes from above he said as he went down the steps smiling thus Peter grew up always believing that the hand of God was ordering his life confident that all things work together for the good that loved God one day he too became a successful business men happy are the boys and girls who have such faith in their Heavenly Father it will save the many needless sorrows and fill their hearts with peace and confidence that nothing can disturb why not see how it works for you hey we're not finished just yet sorry everyone so that was the end of this story and we can go ahead and bring our chairs in a straight line runs in front guy if I could have the dads of these children to come up behind the chairs for everyone to visualize okay so we're gonna say our memory verse one more time and I know this is a human representation but I believe that if the Lord gave us our spiritual eyes we see the same thing in many more so everyone all the lines ready yet one two three every now if the lines cracks would take a seat and if the father's but also go stand around the room and all around the church and let them show that they are also one of God's little ones everybody in this room is one of God's little ones can I show a raise of hand who's one who's God's little one all right look what besides you if you could see this room

name Amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning I take a I want to take just the scripture and I was just one verse but brother Brown says you know it's not the size of the reading that matters it's what's in there that matters and I want to take a I thought a little thought this morning about missing the point you know we can all agree this Pharisee missed the point of being in the presence of Jesus he missed the point of inviting him to his house just think about it the lord of glory he invited him to come come to this feast I'm putting on he missed the point of him being there now I fell to understand the essential or important part of something so that's the missed the point as to to overlook or fail to understand the essential or important part of something so I pray none of us missed the point of this word none of us missed the point of Jesus and how much none of us missed the point I mean so you know who's ever felt that when you try and speak to someone they don't really understand what you're trying to tell them who's you know who's ever tried yo you talk to Mum you talk to dad you try you got something on your heart you try and convey it and they you just say they don't really understand they're missing the point hello children amen here yo who's ever felt that you know children I'm sure you felt that many times you want maybe you can't even put it on words quite right but they don't just quite catch what you're saying they are missing the point I mean they don't seem to parents don't seem to understand you know what you're trying to say and yeah I know that this is even more true from parents to children you know don't do this you know say please say thank you you know big kind stop being mean to your brother or sister stop you know and and you know stop whining you know whereas my parents will say stop being a bleacher bum you know stop stopped and you know the thing is many times and parents can say I mean silently I mean the children missed the point of what we're trying to tell them I mean because the point of it is not rules and do's and don'ts but we want our children to be decent human beings I mean that a kind that Icarus that a thoughtful I mean that a giving that a loving that a warm friendly open that while we say say please say thank you thank the person do this yo don't chew with your mouth open stop you know don't grab all the food you know big kind think of one another because the point of it is not know you're in trouble the point of it is that they would become decent human beings but many times the children miss the point right you got to see what is the point yo your parents speak you say what is the you're not really thinking you mind what's the point of this what are they really trying to get across because you know our lives aren't based around telling you off I mean that's not our life school you know start wake up in the morning another day to tell them off hallelujah oh it's the weekend I've got all day no that's not that's not the point the point is we want to raise you to be adults and we're going to have that in our minds it doesn't matter how young they are you got to think one day this child is going to be an adult so what's the point you're trying to give them Alleluia the problem is though many people miss the point because they already have their mind made up I mean they're fixed on a certain thing or a certain argument and instead of actually listening to what they're trying to be told they're just waiting for the other person to finish so they can respond who's never had a conversation where you're talking to someone it can be very serious but you know they're they're cogs are turning in their head and they just waiting to give the response they're not really listening to what you're saying they're missing the point they're missing the point of the conversation because they're just waiting for time to speak now can I have the floor now basically can you just you know you know like who's ever been in a debating team we should do it at school sometimes you know they have certain time then you got your time just waiting you know and as they're arguing you're all scribbling down notes like fury I mean because you're just going to counter what they're saying that happens everyday life you missed the point I mean see now if that is and that is the case errors people people are the same that happens bride not bride save Center whatever people do that because we're all human right but how much more now between God and man you know God's had God has sent his word the mystery of God is finished in the stage that says in Revelations 10 7 a means that knows we know the heart of God Howley you should bail say I know the heart of God I mean this message is revealed the heart of God to me I mean so we know what he likes what he doesn't like we know how to live a life that pleases him and that is more than how we dress but it's how we treat our spouses our children each other I mean because that's our actions right hallelujah but the problem is is we have all inherited ideas that are wrong all of us have inherited something wrong doesn't matter if you're fourth generation and the message or whatever generation we've all we've all inherited something wrong I mean but the thing is now what happens is that people they take that thought that's wrong they become a believer they may wrap it around in quotes and scriptures and it just fortifies that position in their life because the Prophet said right but they miss exactly they missed the point of what he's saying I mean so you take very classic example men who are controlling domineering over their families over their wives they come into the message they hear brother for him rebuking men saying you know how do you let your wives go out and smoke and drink and dress immoral and do these things and they say Amen why cuz the nature is already in them to be controlling but now they have something to fortify you know what what you know their preconceived idea you know people people come into the message and they hear brother BAM saying that the Catholic system and all the denominations is the great harlot and the daughters they already believe it they say Amen or they've got a revelation they say no they already believe that there's something they inherited or the husband is the head of the home amen I'm in charge now they just inherited that right but they missed the point of how actually to be the head of the home amen you see the Lord you see husbands and men to be like God as to the church does Jesus come to you and say you'd better line up Sonny Boy I'm gonna burn you alive you're gonna you know he doesn't browbeat us he following me he doesn't bring his fear and yo check us and living in you know torment and worry and what's going to happen I'm gonna be lost so I got a tow the line no you know if that's your relationship with God you need to change the relationship your your actually so following the wrong ones I mean because he motivates us by divine love and when he motivates us by divine love he changes our heart he changes our thinking so he we line up with his word because of love and not of fear right but if but if someone hears quotes about how to rule their home and how do you let your wife do so and so I mean then what they do is because they only have that preconceived idea being domineering then they try and force them to conform to the word but they've missed the point because the point is you get the Holy Ghost in your life I mean and let let the Holy Ghost manifest his life through you because it happens unconsciously it's not you consciously or I'm anointed now no God is a you know if he's in you you always anointed if he's in you he's always manifesting hallelujah so it's the life and you exchange and that life will go down down into your family and they will begin to line up with the word of God hallelujah want God to yo do a house clean in your house pray until he comes down I mean don't just kick it out and leave the void and I let God fill the void hallelujah sure you go to throwing stuff out but God's got to go fill their void otherwise you just have a bunch of people receiving what you're doing because their hearts had changed yeah they're both you follow me so so many people miss the point of the word because they have their own arguments in their mind surrounded by quotes and scriptures but if we really have the Holy Ghost then we do not hold and then when the word comes we can't hold onto our own our own arguments anymore because we receive because revelation as God's thoughts coming unto you so how he thinks about his word is how you think about his work because the same one that wrote the word comes into you and manifests the word that's revelation revelation is not well I understand it mentally no God's thoughts this multitude they have different thoughts on the scripture but when the author comes hallelujah comes unto you then you receive the revelation of the scripture hallelujah amen the thing is it says now proverbs 20:1 I'm going to come to Simon the Pharisee we're gonna it's going to go like this we're going to get okay amen proverbs 21:2 every every way of a man is right in his own eyes but God pondereth the hearts this word pondereth means to balance that is to measure out figuratively to arrange or to equalize I thought Lord balanced my you and your heart as your emotions so Lord balance ponder my heart wholly a balance at pellit your balance my emotions arrange them equalizing by your word holy it's how we should be Amen now I'm sure you can agree that when Jesus came to the earth and his first coming the religious world of the Jews missed the point of the law they had missed the point of being under the blood of bulls and goats there were promises in the law that if Israel would love the Lord with all their hearts and serve him according to his word they would and here at the land they would dwell that have pc1 would be under his fig tree or vineyard you know that have peace in their land that was the point of the law that God would come down and walk among his children that was the point wasn't it that's the point but the thing is by the time Jesus came there was no cry like there was from Gideon if God is with us where as miracles that cry had gone they weren't looking where is the God that was with Moses they see where Moses disciples but they weren't Moses disciples because if their Moses disciples the god of Moses would have been their God so the same one that delivered back then would have delivered him in that day but they had long forgotten the point of God delivering them they had long forgotten what God did for them and they were now just this political way here we're going to keep our you know keep our nation intact and keep our you know carry favor with the Romans and all that it was all politically minded there's no deliverance is no power there's no freedom they were under the yoke of Rome they missed the point Amen we don't want to miss the point it had become the the law had become a dead ritual just a tradition amen Matthew said it I mean sorry Jesus said in Matthew 23 5 but but all their works they do are too poor to be seen of men they make broad their whatever they are fella sorry I don't know I can't really and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uttermost room at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi but be not called rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are brethren so this was the point this is what they thought the law was this is the point but they thought of you know being a Pharisee being a said you see people would think highly of them look how great I am look at what I do that wasn't the point the point was God would dwell among them God would fight their battles God would manifest his glory that was the point but they missed the point they forgot the significance of the importance of it Jesus says in Matthew 23:23 further down the same chapter well won't you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith why did they admit these things I'll say because they missed the point of them they missed the importance of them do you think those the most important things Lord's judgment mercy and faith but they admitted them they're all about surface stuff well I type this I do this I do this none of those things are necessary wrong but they missed the point hallelujah these you ought to have done and to leave the other undone he says you blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel they missed the point are we all on the same you can agree you say man those guys are crazy they missed the point the same God that was with Gideon should have been with them that's a good question if God is with us where is his power where's his miracles where's his deliverance where's the reality of his first poly Raffy still God let him be God and he is still God hallelujah amen now the gee-gees that got y'all just oh yeah I was studying this last I make me so sad it's so ridiculous you know you take John six Jesus feeds the multitudes previously crosses the sea and they follow him across the sea and he says you didn't come because you saw miracles but because you didn't eat of the loaves and were filled so they got a free lunch they wanted another free lunch they missed the point here was the Messiah upon the earth for one they're looking for the woman was prophesied from the Garden of Eden and they wanted free lunch My Lord Jesus think about it just let it just just think they miss the point of them being there where's the food see I'm not here for food I'm here that your sins will be washed away I've been here you go to glory I mean you don't have to be under the law and you're kinda lazy you be delivered you be born again there was the point but they missed the point my they thought the point of him being there was free food they were looking for natural blessings same thing today people are Christians because you know people preach the promise of prosperity and that started an eye about the mid-fifties people begin to preach about prosperity gospel and people became Christians because God because I said if you become a Christian God will bless you oh I want a big house I want a big car on they missed the point they missed the point of being a believer I mean the point of the believer being a believer is not how rich you can be or whatever no the point is that you have eternal life that's the point probably that God can manifest this word through you to a dying world that's the point that God can come and dwell in you manifest themselves that's the point I mean but they but people go chasing money and all these big money-making schemes it's gonna burn it's not gonna be a memory polio you know when we are on the other side I believe we will be and we're fellowshipping about the days when do you think we're gonna remember well I you know this is the size house I had and my car broke down here and they don't know we're gonna be talking about what God did for us what he did he did it here he delivered me here he saved me here he healed me here he got a hold of this one here that's what we're gonna be talking about those are things we're going to remember we're not gonna remember the car and the wish I got this car and you know let's not miss the point haloo yeah nothing wrong with wanting a bigger house whatever but the point of being a Christian is not those things right brother Ram says God's blessing is not necessary reflected and being rich or poor that's irrelevant amen if you're rich praise the Lord of your poor praise the Lord whatever content state you find yourself and be content for that is the will of God concerning you hallelujah you know as I said you know your Papua New Guinea people scavenging out of the rubbish dump looking for Elementium cans to to buy yo to sell to recycle to get money that were happy they went walking under will move to do this again today this is dumb know that were hippie you drive along like hi how are you honey having done that were happy they weren't ashamed you know they weren't like that no why because they were content you know we should be content in the Lord hallelujah I have eternal life I have everything I want it all hallelujah what else do I need I met his brother Isaac's you don't we say what's the worst thing that happened you die and death is just a travel bus to get you where you want to go hallelujah so why do we need to worry hallelujah so I think we should just not miss the point where we should catch the point hallelujah so a Christian is a Christian because they receive eternal life and they believe him no matter what happens you know I'm not a believer because things go well and when things go bad I quit well I throw attention so God didn't do this movie you know people get angry at God they justify themselves what are you lil boosie doodle-ooh you're they fuss they throw tantrums you know doesn't change God barely robbed themselves really and if they could look at themselves I think men you bring an egg you're being ridiculous you know sometimes I won't name a name this three than their you know they get on the ground they cry they first you know what I do sometimes I get down on the ground I cry and fast with them and they stop and they're like you know and I just say this is what you look like you know yes it doesn't daddy look ridiculously like years like well that's what you look like and sometimes we need to really think man we get angry angry at God what's he ever done oh he just died for eternal life for you oh oh he owes me something he doesn't owe you nothing you know oh you better do this otherwise I'm not gonna follow you anymore you missed the point something a spoiled child you know you know I heard a testimony from foxes Book of Martyrs there's a guy and he's about to be burnt at the stake and he recanted there's a 17 year old girl and and she said youthful watching it she as a believer said you fool you you you traded eternal life just for a few maybe years of pleasure and she took his place at the stake because he missed the point we don't want to miss the point hallelujah Amen brother BAM tells our story in the message Messiah 1961 about a mother in Germany he says a little mother standing near her baby died over in Germany her husband's a chaplain and they called up long distance about five times through a day and night to ask me to come see they know that God would raise a little baby up I said let me go pray and he and I went and prayed and prayed that afternoon that night and I'll show you you whether the doctors believe or not when she already gave the dumb she already gave give the doctor my book to read I believe it's called profit visit South Africa something like that she said God will raise the baby up the little mother said God will raise the baby up and the baby had been dead before they knowed it about four or five hours so they got the father word down to the base where he was and the baby had been dead died that night and so the doctor said all right I'll tell you what I'll do I'll slip over and turn the oxygen back on and he let the baby lady for two days with the oxygen turned on at waiting and I was over there praying they were going to fly me across with a jet they could leave here with an immediate come back the same day to Germany and one morning about daylight I got up and the wife went out of the room she went out of the room and I just woke up and I laying there a little bit directly I heard someone coming into the room and look there was something moving in the room I jumped up I said Lord what would you have your servant know he said don't rebuke that that's the hand of the Lord see so I got her on the phone I said no God has called your baby so when she come over to see us so um I'm she said what was it brother branham my weakness of faith I said you have great faith you prayed for your baby you and your husband held on to it God raised that baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best and still you love him that's real faith anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works there that's when you prove whether you got faith or not he says that's real faith hallelujah when God says no but you don't mind cuz he knows the best hallelujah she saw the point amen and we and we think we have a bad day you know you missed the point you know is that right we get all twisted up in our mind you missed the point it's not a life a flower of b2v God didn't promise us a flower bit of ease he said take up your cross deny yourself take up your cross and follow me oh that's what you've got to be willing to do some of us said we all have different kind of cross but you'd be willing to be your own cross hallelujah problem is pride stops us doing it Allu yeah Amen Jesus says in John 6 he says labor not for the meat which perishes but that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the Son of man shall give unto you for he hath the father seal I mean so you know we're not Christians because of a free lunch hallelujah we're not here for the material things we're here because of eternal life because this word is rapturing faith in it it has eternal life I mean this word is transforming power amen why do we worship not because we gave blessings but because of who he is I mean that's why I was even because of who he is not what initially he stayed more than enough for me he died for me he redeemed me by his blood I mean he purchased me he rents from me with his own life hallelujah that's more than enough I mean if he never doesn't a single more thing for me in my life he'd already done too much Halloween's already done enough for me because I am eternal life hallelujah that's all that matters that's all that matters they'll come a time and it will that this life won't be hallelujah and we'll be dancing on streets of gold hallelujah and I often think what's the first thing I'm gonna think I'm gonna think man I'm so glad it was worth it all hallelujah I'd do it all again hallelujah to end up right here hallelujah amen it doesn't matter it doesn't matter about what blessings we receive he's done more than enough we're gonna focus our perspective we're gonna get the point hallelujah it's amazing let's go to Luke 22 that's what uh you know I love the Gospels I love the scripture a man that's got to Luke 22 and 20 here we are this is the Last Supper you know must be an incredible moment it's called the Last Supper because they pass over before but this Passover was a little bit different I don't know if Jesus ever ever spoke these words of their previous Passover's where he said this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you I don't know if he ever spoke those car things maybe if we could just go there you know you know for a little bit you know maybe he you know he knew he knew in the next few moments he is going to guess M&E and then it's gone to Calvary he knew where he was going you know when someone's facing something real serious they kind of change it but maybe a little bit more quiet but more serious a deeper look on their face you know so I don't know yeah I imagine Passover maybe it was a somber time but it would have been a rejoicing time too because the Death Angel passed hallelujah I mean but you know maybe he had a deeper kind of look in his face maybe he wasn't talking so much I don't know but I don't know if he ever said these words at the other suppers this was the Last Supper why wouldn't you think about it here's the disciples they've been following the Lord and he's coming to the climax of his earthly ministry he's been telling them for this cause I've come into the world I'm gonna be betrayed into the hands of wicked men I'm gonna be killed he told them these things and here they were brother Brown said they were in the greatest week in history death burial resurrection of Jesus Christ multitudes of prophecy was being fulfilled the Messiah was on the earth they were following him but if they come to this point they come to this place and he speaks these words in the next verse but behold the hand of him that betrays me is with me on the table I don't know if he ever said those before and he just through he just he just speaks it out and then they begin to ask you know he this is in the next verse and truly the Son of Man garthe's it was determined but woe unto them that man unto that man by whom he is betrayed and in the next verse they begin to acquire among themselves which of them was that they should do this thing John you think it's you Andrew they be going to talk the conversation changed but they noticed them go go next verse go down and there was also a strife among them which of them should be account at the greatest so here he is I just I just pray God just makes us look here he is this bread is broken there's my body which will be given for you do this remembrance of me this cup is the New Testament in my blood drink it as often as you remember me it is now Helu you the one among you is going to betray me and they're just talking about it and then they're still fighting but this strife this debate what trans greatest know I'm the greatest the Andrew says I'm the greatest John says no I'm the greatest this strife among them God fulfilling his word the promise of the ages is about to be manifested wholly of the Messiah his blood on the earth and they are missing the point they are striving among themselves though I'm the greatest now I know the best I can do although they're missing the point they're in the greatest moment he's going to be taken not long after this holy and be crucified they were missing the point of the moment oh well we had Passover last year we're headed the year before but this was the last one this was different hallelujah and we come to church well the songs will be this long this brother will make this comment no doubt we'll sing that song because he likes it this guy will do this you missed the point our Sunday School will be like this so this teachers teaching so he's like this or she's like this Allah you know you missed the point we missed the point of gathering we missed the point of being here amen they were they were so carnal you think about it here here he is one of he's going to betray me but then the conversation changes I'm the best I'm the booster this one's the best this is deficient animosity I am among them because of carnal things and they were missing the point of being there incredible you say well how can that be how can they be so caught up in things that they missing the importance they were missing the importance of the word being fulfilled in their day right in front of their eyes people consider the presence of the Lord and because they are so obsessed with their own situation what people have done to them what their family has done to them how much money they have or they don't have their pain they carry the suffering they have gone through they miss the point they miss the importance of being in the presence of God they miss their moment of deliverance that's true we can be so self-absorbed in our own lives and what's going this person is my brother did this my sister this my does this my dad doesn't you miss the point of sitting even here right this morning and this happened in my past and this person said this and this person looked at me this way and people get so obsessed with themselves they miss their deliverance you say you sure about that you'll show you in paradox 1962 beckon here you people sit here a lady sitting right here I've never seen her in my life but she's suffering with the trouble with her throat trouble with her eyes she's sitting right here looking at me she's a woman preacher stand up on your feet and accept that lady be made well I don't know the woman never seen her in my life you try to hide your sin now he's a man he's been passing his opinion on me that's right sir your profession as a teacher and you have spiritual problems you're wondering about it if that's so raise up your hand they'll all be settled accept me as God's prophet I'm telling you the truth I say that the Lord do you believe here's a woman sitting back here she's suffering with the condition on her breast she's had three operations she's missing it god help me miss Alexandra receive your healing in the name of Jesus Christ that if that's your name and we're strangers stand on your feet stand up on your feet if that's right I've never seen the woman in my life do you believe it if that isn't the same Jesus that once lived I don't know I'm a man do you believe receive him here was a woman she had her she was suffering with the condition on her breast she had three operations so she had this paint you're suffering with this physical sickness she was missing and he was the son of man he think just just think about this many times he said wouldn't it be wonderful to be in those meanings God comes my brother says I'm just a man I'm just your brother I'm waiting for him to come angel the Lord comes down reveals that you know manifests the thoughts intents of the hearts of the people reveals them to show that the word that's has gone forth is God amen and here she is she's being called out right down to the specific details and she's missing it why cuz she's sitting with her own pain and suffering missing what God is doing it was God's grace that called her name oh my lord think about it we don't want to miss the point she was missing the point of the service amen and he's the same God today I mean why do we come to church why are we in his presence let's not miss the point although all the season of our deliverance you have the devil always the devil will never say believe it say yes amen that's why what happens is you got to see the point of saying amen it's not just to be loud I mean but when you say men you're receiving that word and that word I mean that powers released into your life I mean and you get what you need I mean by agreeing Amen you're connecting your faith with that word and there's power released and it helps you that's why it's important to say yes doesn't matter how loud you can be quite as nobody say amen amen as I said when I was prayed for it to camp down in Christchurch brother Craig boss said no go believe what you receive I said I receive it and the anointing came down and I had a jubilee hallelujah what if I just didn't say anything he said go receive us say well I receive it now God came down and join t'me I knew I'd received it I'm still living under that receiving holy I said I want a revival in a row for the church hallelujah he says go receiving our receiver Here I am hallelujah Amen so you've got to agree with the word doesn't matter it can become you can come forth quietly it can come forth whatever just say yes I mean you're here to speak to me God I don't want to let my own suffering and pain make me miss the point hallelujah amen oh yeah now let's go back to Simon the Pharisee you think about you think about how so many people you know we talk about blind Bartimaeus he saw the point the woman with the blood issue she saw the point Lazarus saw the point the woman at the well saw the point but so many missed the point so multitudes missed the point of him being there and here Jesus is he's been preaching you know it's been a very hot day at least and he's you know he always been ministering to the people he comes a man coming up the hill he's got a message and he's been sent from Simon the Pharisee and he's come to invite Jesus to this feast and he comes to the disciples maybe he came as as you know they were Peter James and John room you know the closest disciples but maybe it was one of the other disciples Andrew or one of them and he he you're this you're this servant pushes way through the crowd yo what's going on he's not interested in what's going on he's got a message to bring and here he is he comes to Andrew maybe says Andrew I've got a message from my master to your master Congo speak to him Andrew goes maybe speaks to Peter James and John this guy wants to speak to Jesus and they say yes and finally here comes this man he has got through the crowd he's standing right in the presence of the Son of Man and he's not far away he's right there he's looking him in the eyes and here is the very fountain of eternal life standing in front of him and all he has fixated on as hard as his message to give him he had an opportunity you think about that wouldn't that wouldn't that have been raising polio if you knew who he was back then you would have kicked people out of the way you wouldn't want to say I must get to the son of man hallelujah and here he was Jesus Simon the great Pharisee of Jerusalem has invited you to his great feast will you come and Jesus is always he always comes when he's invited he always accepts an invitation I mean brother MC you know so you can invite him to where you are right now with an open heart he'll come he'll come if you really invite him he'll come hallelujah and so here's the servant he's delivered his invitation Jesus says I'll come and he walks away thinking that he has he has fulfilled his mission but he's missed the point how many other people had a one-on-one audience not planned just push through I've got I've got this message with the Son of Man and he missed the point and it goes back put yourself there you think wouldn't that be a shame and broadband speak spaces you know know that Jesus actually felt said so this man was in my presence and he missed the point he didn't use the words miss a point but he missed the point of being in his presence and then said this man the servant goes back to his master oh great master Simon farad the Pharisee I delivered your message as you have commanded and Jesus of Nazareth says he shall come and he thinks he's done is done is laden life he's missed the point I mean so then Jesus maybe maybe no doubt as you know his disciples are speaking to him saying Jesus why are you going to this man's house he's a Pharisee he doesn't care you know and Jesus said well he invited me so I'll come doesn't matter how he treats me I'm gonna go don't put him in the corner with unwashed feet and then here he comes you know this is a great feast so it wasn't just Jesus going the great celebrities of Jerusalem maybe in their chariots trumpeters going to make way for whoever who have a great name fancy pence man you know here they come this great fanfare they come out there's one door into the feast come in good sir you know feet awashed they get anointed kissed and made welcome and when the servant goes back before the feast starts he tells the man with the guest list at the door Jesus Nazareth is gonna come so his name is on the list he comes Jesus looked like any other man placed anchor but bad than ever who knows when he had a bath last time sweaty hot from the day his disciples can't come and he comes to the door the man with the list do you think about this so ridiculous what's your name and probably he said uh probably rather you know cuz if you see someone with a big fancy turban and golden robes if they are good sir what is your name it's so nice to have you at this feast but he sees this basically a bigger walking along short little man nothing of him that we desire he say what's your name he wouldn't have been welcoming Jesus Jesus of Nazareth coming think about it he had an opportunity here with eternal life you know that's the problem is how it presents itself is never how man thinks it should be it's the foolishness of preaching the scripture says it's foolish but you to them that believe it's eternal life hallelujah so to the believer it is not foolish it's precious I mean when God comes down into a meeting and manifests himself it is glorious hallelujah but somehow Jesus comes to the door the foot foot wash flunky maybe moves his bowl to one side I am washing his feet he missed the point imagine those sacred feet I believe in half our religion so if I cry a little bit well he's got to put up with it he gets to watch the Messiah's feet haloo yeah but he missed the point he washed the other guy's feet well not this man look at him pulls the ball to one side Jesus keeps walking in the man with the anointing spices in oil well I'm not anointing this guy stinks missed the point measured anointing the word hallelujah Mary Mary anointed him for his burial Pauline is going to be a woman on the earth that night's the word hallelujah what's next part I'm in miles over you miles away me how do you anoint him you say Amen yes Lord I believe it hallelujah that's how you anoint the word I mean don't look at me funny if I'm screaming I mean you know but but I'm not anointing this guy and where's the kiss to be made welcome but he goes where he's invited you know this is going to be played before those people at the great throne great white throne judgment and we will look at it we'll think that was the most ridiculous saddest life that has ever been because they miss the point amen Jesus just was in his earthly ministry three and a half years they had a moment they had their moment but they said now this guy stinks went you know do you know why they missed the point because Simon the Pharisee told them to miss the point and they would rather listen to the master and reject the word then anoint him and make him welcome because of just because of influence that's why oh this person will think this this person says this I want to be cool with this person so I'm just gonna sit here like a stone and do nothing and not really you're missing the point I know what peer pressure's like here's a guy in my dorm rich guy from Ramiro Auckland he wasn't even my friend I thought he was cool so I started dressing like him I started trying to act like him because I thought he was cool he wasn't my friend but but it was influence hallelujah Lord was dealing with me at university I was so afraid to lose my friends because God was dealing me wilshire I became a Christian sure but I didn't want to say anything about it because I'd lose them peer pressure is real and they didn't get up every day and say there's no God and God's not real and God's did and you're stupid if you think he won't you they never they never were anti religion they never spoke about it but because of peer pressure and some of them are non since I was 15 I lived with him a boarding school but because of peer pressured helped me back so I'm in the Pharisees influence cause those people to miss the point and here's Jesus he comes to the feast and it's the greatest mother em says about the courier that that we didn't delivered the message this is in the meanest man in Santa Maria he sees a Miss Korea standing there delivered his message I can imagine how a master watch the fellow with pity thinking about perhaps that he was passing the greatest opportunity that ever labor for any human being was to stand in the presence of Jesus Christ and he is the same yesterday today and forever the same presence is here I mean we have that same we have the greatest opportunity every service and I'm not just talking about getting saved Amen but two forgot to meet her need hallelujah and his Simon the Pharisees influence making them not received word in their day that's all they had and then that Jesus in the corner made unwelcome with unwashed feet not anointed he's there but there was someone there who yeah doesn't matter God will have a witness God will have one who'll receive him hallelujah and she wasn't invited to the feast but something I don't know how she heard Jesus was there but something moved in her heart what do you mean yes unwashed feet what do you mean he's not made welcome I'm gonna do something about this hallelujah and so she took all her money she was a prostitute it doesn't matter where we're from what's what what sin was triptan oh then that's irrelevant she said I'm not gonna make him welcome Polly she takes all the money she runs the Apothecary over it was and and the man looks at her or what do you want they know he knew who she was or what do you want puts all the money on the table I want your best I want your best he's probably thinking he's play thinking I wonder what she's gonna do with this she was about to anoint the word he missed the point hallelujah people get emotional on church they begin to praise and sing God and we were the critical spirit look at him so I wonder all the air up to I wonder what's going on with him - you're missing the point you're missing the point here she is gets the greatest one maybe puts it on her Road runs hardly to the feast I don't know how she got in it doesn't matter she got in totally it's like us I don't know how I got it but that doesn't matter I got in hallelujah I got into his presence that's all that matters hallelujah and she comes along she finds where he is she's not interested in Simon the Pharisee she doesn't care about critical spirits she doesn't care what other people are doing she's not worried about anyone else and what they think hallelujah she came to where he was I need more monitor please put me up hallelujah she found where Jesus was didn't even ask permission kaalia didn't even ask permission yeah I'm gonna wash his feet took that alabaster box hallelujah broken hallelujah she didn't just tip it out a little bit say well save the box no she gave everything polish she gave her all polio then she let her long glorious head down begin to kiss his feet these were feet that had the dung of the field on them they was thinking that was sweaty they were muddy hallelujah they were dusty she didn't care these were the feet that would turn to wear someone else didn't do it but she I'm gonna do it she didn't give it wasn't giving any water she had wash them with her tears kaalia took her towels of her glorious here how is she saw the point how is she saw the point of having Jesus at the face hallelujah and she pulls out her tears washes the feet hallelujah oh yeah and then Simon the Pharisee looks over there and he seasoned as hard if that man you if he was really a prophet he would know what kind of woman was touching his feet Jesus didn't say would she he just let her do it hallelujah he said that it was hard that person doesn't deserve to do that what she even here for and he's obviously not a prophet he's not really God he would rebuke her pride of a Pharisee disgusting religious devil and Jesus says I have something to say he missed the point of what was going on this woman was going from lost to found Paulo she's gone from Senator st. Holly her sins are gonna be were washed away hallelujah she'd recognize the Son of man was there Paulo she knew there's eternal life on that match piling in eternal life from that word she didn't care about anyone else cause she saw the point Tyler she saw the importance of the word and we must see the importance of this message is eternal life it is the rapture that is the point I mean that is the point of this word Kalia it's a body change work I mean it's a parting word hallelujah I need some help here please I mean yes I can hear myself Here I am I mean that is the point of this message it is not do's and don'ts and rules and whatever it is eternal life I mean Christianity is eternal life being imparted to one another kaalia that is the point hallelujah we need you getting talked about you know we need to see the point if we miss the point we have missed everything Simon the Pharisee missed everything his career with the missus missed everything the foot wash flunky the one that anointed they missed it all and all the other guests miss the point but that woman did not she got the point hallelujah and then Jesus turns because he knows what people think Simon I have some what to say to thee oh my you don't want him Jesus to look at you like that I have some what to say to thee I mean my feet weren't washed no one made me welcome wasn't anointed no one kissed me made me welcome Here I am and what I came but this woman this woman I say this church this church Kolia has come she's anointed my feet she's washed my feet with her tears she's dried them hallelujah she's dried them with her hair I mean brother I'm seeing when they're alabaster box broke that smell that perfume filled the house filled the whole face time in that worship filled the whole beast hallelujah and win over everything holy and the stand and his amen Christine cheering wrapped up under her she don't care why because she got the point I mean the devil will never tell you what the point is I mean cuz he can't get the point he can't get eternal life hallelujah and she looked down at him at her and said though her sins will scarlet they are white as snow your sins be forgiven thee go and sin no more holy Oh hallelujah she didn't care what others thought she didn't care what others attitudes were she said no I've come to anoint the word I'm not worthy even to anoint us in anointed Street Carly I'm gonna pour myself out I don't care what others think I don't care what others soon I don't care about the consequences of my actions I'm here Kolia to anoint the Messiah hallelujah and what did she got she got eternal life hallelujah what else matters does peer pressure matter does what your friends think about you matter doesn't matter what the young people think about other young people doesn't matter what her kiss her kiss don't worry about that stuff Amen know the word has come the son of man is walking in this generation still hallelujah and that's why we anointed that's why we say lo you pour your life out I mean when she broke the alabaster box there was a point of no return she could have put it back together she could no it's broken the life has been poured out hallelujah and it's the same thing with us you really pour your life out you can't take it back together it's gone it's been poured out over his feet hallelujah and that's the real worship he receives that's the real life I mean he receives as a life poured out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there she is no one said no more you are forgiven license me media forgiven me Jesus knew where she got the money to bring the box hallelujah he knew who she was it didn't stop him he did not he didn't care hallelujah didn't matter who she was what she did wishes from what she was going through irrelevant amen what about you do you see the point amen do you see the point of being a believer amen I trust you see the point it doesn't matter what other people do I'm here to anoint the son of man I'm here to anoint this word because unless word has pardoning Grace I mean Jesus said that they that receive you received me and they receive you receive him that sent me I mean so to receive the Lord you received the word that sent Israel ask the question how can we do the works of God he said believe on Him who he has seen believe this word hallelujah and she gets up she's just been pronounced pardoned hallelujah here's the supreme judge come to the earth with pardoning grace and he imparts it to this woman hallelujah do you think she felt ashamed being there seen I'm so glad I saw the point yeah how was your day Harvey where's all your money gone where's your life gone I poured it out you pour now where'd you pour it out at the feet of a man at the feet of a man what's his name Jesus of Nazareth Olivia hallelujah and do you know what he told me I'm forgiven hallelujah and you know what he tells you you never did it in the first place to justify hallelujah all the guilt is gone all the condemnation there is therefore no condemnation I mean those that walk out the spread not according to the flesh there is therefore no condemnation hallelujah hallelujah Amen hallelujah never did it in the first place you're justified I mean it's not yo yo God just doesn't sweep your sins under the rug and say and say no brother as soon as I bleach the blood is like bleach hallelujah and you drop it's like ink going in to bleach it breaks up you don't see it Hali and brother have says even says the egg becomes bleach Holly you can't find it no more but try and find it you won't find it why cuz the blood takes care of it hallelujah and we have a word that gives us access to the blood well as well as message does that's why I changes us I mean that's what's we can never obtain that we obtain it Holly we're just talking about the grace we experience grace I mean we're manifestation of grace because we know God's grace hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven verse 48 I'll close with this and they that said it meet with him begin to say within themselves who is this at forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman my faith has saved thee goes in peace hallelujah and that's how we should be go in peace amen don't worry he's taking care of it hallelujah he's our advocate he's our high priest if God is for us who can be against us hallelujah no doubt no doubt when she walked out of that feast it would have been murmuring or who let her and what's she doing who's this man thinking she didn't care he told me my sins were forgiven he told me he told me he's coming back for me he told me I mean he told me almost sinless as he is sinless he told me he told me all my guilts gone he told me he told me my sins are washed away he told me hallelujah he told me he's coming back for me he told me how lujah like brother man tells a story of the armored company girl you know the cousins you know she

a no there's no rapture we just wanna you know it's not happening now but in her heart Jesus no last time hallelujah and then at the time appointed as the Sun is going down what does that sound hallelujah does a chariot come on there's the carriage coming hallelujah and it stops by the gate and she sees her beloved step out she runs to meet him halfway hallelujah they jump in the carriage and she sees that place last time and she waits goodbye last time goodbye world I'll stay no longer with you goodbye treasures of pleasures of sin I'll stay no longer with you I've made up my mind to go God's Way the rest of my life I made up my mind to go God's way the rest of my life hallelujah why because he promised he's promised me a body change he's promised me he's promised me a seat and his throne as an overcomer why because he said that's all that matters his word of promise his word of promise is the most precious thing and it's an unconditional covenant why do we put so much pressure on ourselves all the pressures on him amen His divine love motivates us to live the word maybe that's just me but hallelujah it's how it should be why are you a believer because I love him
