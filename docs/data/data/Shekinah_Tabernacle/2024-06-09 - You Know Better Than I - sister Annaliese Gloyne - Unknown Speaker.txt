========================================

God bless you brothers and sisters. Um this song is a real testimony to me. Um being near the start of the year and till like a month ago I was really struggling and um like on the outside I looked fine but then on the inside I was just like really hurting and every night I would like cry and I would be like why am I here? Like I don't understand. And then I got this song and it's a real blessing to me and I hope it's just a blessing to you as well. [Music] I thought I did what's right. I thought I had the answers. I thought I chose the shest road, but that road brought me here. So I put up the fight and told you how to help me. And now when I have given up, the truth is coming clear. You know better than I. You know the way. [Music] I've let go. The need to know why. But you know better than I. [Music] If this has been a test, I cannot see the reason. But maybe knowing I don't know is part of getting through. I've tried to do what's best and faith has made it easy to see. The best thing I can do is put my trust in you. For you know better than I. You know the way [Music] I've let go and the need to know why. For you know better than I. You know better than I. You know the way I've let go. The need to know why. For you know better than I. [Applause]
