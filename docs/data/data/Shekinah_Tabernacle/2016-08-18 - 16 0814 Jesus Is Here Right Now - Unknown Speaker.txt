========================================

the the the whole way of victory in our life, Lord, is just to spend time with you, Lord. And that if you're for us, and who can be against us? So, we're so grateful for your calling in our life, Lord. And we're so grateful that you are for us. Hallelujah. And we're so grateful, Lord, that we can come and spend time with you and be refreshed, renewed, empowered, encouraged, Lord, that we can be vibrant people full of life. Hallelujah. And full of hope, full of joy. Hallelujah. full of happiness, full of longsuffering, full of patience and goodness, peace, meekness, temperance, Lord, all the wonderful things that come from you. We're so grateful, Lord, that that within you is an abundance of all those things. Hallelujah. So, Lord, we just come to that fountain of life this morning, Lord, just to to drink from the fountain of life, which is you. Lord, you said you have come that we might have life and we might have it more abundantly, Lord. So, we we thank you that we can have an abundant life in you. And we just want to invite you into our midst this morning. Bless those that couldn't make it, those that are unwell in different things. Bless those that are streaming. And we just um yeah, we just want to pray you bless the word this morning. Bless Pastor Benjamin as he brings brings the word, Lord. And may you just continue to anoint him. We thank you for the blessing that he is to us. And we thank you for each person here, Lord, that that do their part in the body of Christ. It's such a wonderful thing to be able to come here and and worship you, Lord, with saints of like precious faith. So, we just commit this service to you this morning and we just humbly invite you into our midst once again in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Um when um when Jesus walked along the road to Emmas with the the um two disciples, when he got to the I guess when they got to where they were going, he said, "I'm just going to carry on for a while. You know, I'm going to carry on." But then the Bible says they constrained him. They said, "No, why don't you stay here?" And I don't know what the discussion was, but I don't think they they didn't just say, "Oh, stay here." He says, "No, carry on." They said, "Okay." They would said, "No, no, no. Where are you going?" You know, "No, stay here with us. Come on. We've got some food in here. We've got this. We've got that. Come on. Come on." "No, maybe I won't." "No, no, come on. Come on. Come in. We'd like to have you. We've enjoyed the fellowship with you." And I think they they constrained him so much that he really felt welcome and he came in and then he revealed himself to them. So, let's make the Lord feel welcome this morning with our with our hearts and all that we are. Amen. Uh we'll stand and sing. Um lift up your heads, oh you gates. This is for brother [music] Kubin.

The question is did uh do you think Eve ate an apple? Cuz a lot of people believe that she literally ate it. There was a talking snake in a tree that and she grabbed an apple and ate it. Amen. So, so they're at the front and they just slide in into where they go and just make sure that you know there has to be a contact and a date and everything on it. So, just write that on it. But we want to um before we started the church, Christian and I letter box dropped a whole bunch of tracks. Now, we only got one angry phone call, but we did something. And if you do something, I believe God blesses it. And after that, all you're here. That's right. That's right. Amen. So, we're putting out a lure. Amen. Amen. That's right. We're going fishing. Amen. And remember, the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. He can't direct your footsteps unless you're walking. And we want to do some outreach. We want to see people come in. Amen. It's it's it's us for and whosoever will. That's right. Amen. And we're stuck here until the last one comes in. and they might have just got off a plane right now and they've moved into the city. Amen. Amen. So, so those are on the front, they're for all three supermarkets and brother Andy's going to make some more. Amen. We want to we want to put put the word out there. Amen. So, so those at the front desk. Amen. And um that's the only um announcement we have. Um so, re So, if you want to turn with me to the book of Revelation. Amen. Who's happy to be a believer? Amen.

So, it' be wonderful if you could take these and put them wherever you live in, you know, in the supermarket because you never know because on this So, they got a So, the website on the front is a livinggod.com. It's got an excellent article on the serpent seed, but it's also got testimonies of Jesus Christ today. Amen. Like the latest one they put up, there's a I think a 10-year-old girl, you know, the healing of uh one of the children there from Evening Light Tabernacle. She had a she had an incurable disease. Lost all of her hair. Totally bald. Not even not even a little bit of stubble. Amen. Amen. But she believed. Now, she's only 10, about 10 years old, but she went through a prayer line with some bobby pins at a youth camp. And she believed that she was going to grow hair again, and she was going to put those bobby pins in her hair. That's right. That's exactly what happened. Amen. Amen. So, so there's testimonies here of Jesus. It's not just brother, you know, the same God back then and brother Baron is here today. Amen. Amen. So, we need to tell everyone there's a living God. Amen. Amen. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. This is not doctrine. This is not teaching. It's a living God that you meet and become one with. That's what Christianity is all about. And that's what we're going to go into today. So, Revelations chapter one and and we'll read verse one down to verse three. [crying] The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must surely come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John, who bear record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. And it says, "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand." Amen. Amen. Amen. And then we're just going to go to um Yeah. No, I think that's all we'll read. So may the Lord bless his word. You may be seated. [snorts] Now when you think of, you know, normally when you think of when you go to the Bible of I mean and you know to the book of Revelation, uh I'll just give a title. This is where I'm going. I want to make this declaration. All that heaven is is on the earth. Amen. Okay. So everything that God is is present. Yep. Here right now. Amen. We're not waiting for more of him to be revealed. He's here. Amen. Everything that God is is here. Amen. Okay. Everything. So, we're not we're not back in the Old Testament, you know, under the blood of bulls and goats. We're not in the dark ages. We're not living in the days of Luther where they just had the just shall live by faith or the Wesian age where they had that in sanctification. We're not living in just the restoration of the gifts. But we're living in a season where he, the person of the word, is here. Amen. Amen. Brother Brand, he said his ministry is to declare that he is here. Amen. Amen. to everything that God is. That's why, you know, you read the gospels and like we you know in prayer I was just saying about that woman that had the blood issue. If I could just to touch the hem of his garment, I'll be well. That same God is here. Amen. Amen. He's not He's not just up in heaven someplace. You know, the Christian world is looking for the, you know, for the Lord to come back in the end times and all these things. He is here. Amen. Amen. That's right. where remember we have these bodies have to be changed for us to meet him in the air. Okay? So there's part of his coming that still must be fulfilled. But he has already come. Amen. In in in word form and spirit form EVERYTHING GOD IS ALL healing all redemption. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. ALL YOU KNOW ALL reconciliation you know everything you have need of is present. Hallelujah. Amen. Upon this earth. Amen. Everything. Amen. And that's why I really want to hammer that in because we got to recognize God isn't just up in heaven some distance someone somewhere someplace sometime but God is present among us and not just in these four walls BUT WHEREVER YOU GO ALL OF HEAVEN IS with you. I mean all that God is is with you. Amen. Hallelujah. So now the word revelation hallelujah the word because you got to oh the world is dark. Sure the world is dark but the light has never been so bright. Amen. The glory of God has never been so glorious upon the earth. It's never been so never been a day like this day. There's never been a day like this day. And it's more than just I tell you, if this anchors into your soul, you'll be a different person. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Now, the word revelation in the Greek, it means an unveiling. Yeah. It means an unveiling. It means it means to take off the cover. So something that's been covered up now it's going to be revealed. Yep. Just like a statue or some piece of artwork or a plaque that you know there's a curtain and they pull the pull the curtain and you know there's the plaque of a founding of a building or something. That's the revelation of that plaque or a statue that's covered up. Now I'm going to show you the revelation of the statue and then the sheet comes off and then you see what's hidden. Yeah. Amen. So like a statue you can kind of see the form of it. you kind of have an idea what it'll be, but then it's when the cover comes off and then you really see what it is. Right now, I want to make this statement. I'm just going to make this statement right now. Revelation, I'll just find it in my notes. Now, when we think of revelation, the world thinks of revelation as a mental understanding, right? Amen. But a revelation is when he makes himself known to you. That's right. Okay. And he can only make himself known to you if he's present. You follow me? I want to be very deliberate in this fact because you got to understand this. He has to be present in order to reveal himself. Because it's like myself. Just say if I wrote a biography of me, okay, and I gave that to you, you would just learn about me. Yeah. You would just learn about me. But then if I turned up to your house and I begin to spend time with you, then you would begin to really know me. Amen. Then I would be revealed to you. Amen. It's it's a massive difference. And you got to understand it. God has to be present in order to give you revelation. Amen. He has to be present. And we'll go through the life of Abraham. I'll show you this all the way through the scripture. God has to be present to give you revelation. So you got to understand when you hear the word or when you're reading or when you're in prayer and God quicken something to your soul, it's because he's present. Amen. He's not it's not you learning something or understanding something, just reading a book, but God himself comes into the room and quickens that word. He reveals part of himself. Amen. He reveals part of himself. Amen. Hallelujah. Just like in a relationship. Amen. You could have, you know, just like you, I don't know, you know, just say if like if someone had like a long distance, just an email or letter on the phone relationship. That'd be really a lot of you would maybe catch a bit of what that person's like. But when you really meet that person, you spend time with that person, then you really know that person. That's right. Amen. And there's a massive chasm between mental understanding, just reading about him and knowing him. And you know him because he's present. Now, God through the ages has been revealing himself. I want you to turn to um I want you to go to Exodus chapter 6. And I know I've been through these things before. Got Exodus chapter 6 and verse one. And the Lord said unto Moses, "How now shall thou see what I will do to Pharaoh? For with a strong hand shall he let thee them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land." Amen. And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord. And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty. Pardon me. But by my name Jehovah, was I not known to them. And I have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, ruined they were strangers. Now if you go read the book of Genesis when it says the Lord spoke to Abraham or the Lord spoke to Isaac or Jacob, you go look at the meaning of that word I mean that name and that word is actually Jehovah but they did not know God as a deliverer. Yeah. So that expression remember the name how God is revealing himself is tied in with the name. Y amen. So how God reveals remember in him is to be a father, to be a son, to be a redeemer, to be a savior, to be a husband, to be a healer, to be a high priest, to be a sacrifice, to be an advocate, to be a help, to be a guide, to be a king, all and many more of his attributes are in him. But then now when he comes to the earth and is and the name he uses when he speaks to people, he's revealing part of himself. So he's going to give those people, he's revealing himself, revelation of who he is or revelation of part of his character. And so they did not know him as Jehovah because Abraham never needed to be delivered. Amen. Out of out of slavery. Jacob didn't need that. You know, Isaac didn't need that. So he was going to reveal part of himself to Moses and the children of Israel that they Abraham and that did not know. All right? And so this now now but Abraham knew God in many different ways and it was God was present. Remember we are the sons and daughters of Abraham. Yeah. So God was present with Abraham when he revealed himself to Abraham. Amen. Are you following me? He wasn't somewhere else. He was standing there. However, whatever form he was in, God was there. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. He wasn't He wasn't He was present. And he was going to reveal parts of himself to Abraham. Hallelujah. And so in Genesis 12 and verse one, it says, "Now the Lord said unto Abraham, get thee out of thy country and out of thy kindred and from my father's house into a land that I will show thee." And that word there is is is Jehovah. And so, but then God would come down in Genesis, I think it was 17. No, no, sorry. Before this, as as Malchazdc, as as the priest and king and so now, it was the same God that called him in Genesis 12 was now revealing himself in a different way. Amen. And then after that, in Genesis chapter 17, God came down as El Shadi or the strength giver like a like a like a mother nurses a baby. I mean breastfeeding like I am now the strength giver. So all of this he was in the beginning but as Abraham was walking with God was revealing different parts of himself to Abraham. Amen. If you took a trinitarian idea because how did the trinitarians work? They see well there was like they take Matthew chapter 4. Well, there no end of Matthew chapter 3, chapter 4, you know, and so there's there's Jesus coming to get baptized and then they say, "Well, there's the son and then there's a voice coming out of heaven. So there's the father, a different God. And now here comes the spirit of God like a dove descending upon him." Well, that's the Holy Ghost. Look, there's three of them. But if you take So what they've done is they've taken a manifestation of God and they've separated out into a different God. Remember, because oh, we believe in three persons in the Godhead. Well, to be a person, you have to be a personality. There's more than three people in this room. Amen. But we're all different personalities. So they So they're saying three different gods. But if you can go back to the Old Testament, you say, "Well, there's actually at least eight." Yep. That's right. If you take their point of view and you go into the scripture because you see, well, there's Jehovah, there's Al Shadi, there's Mazdc, we know which had no beginning of days or end of life, no father or mother. That has to be God. Amen. And then he was the angel of the covenant. Yeah. Amen. Amen. Gideon saw him as an old man with a staff. There's another one. How many have we got? That's right. But it's the same God revealing himself down through the word. Amen. But you have to understand he is a he has to be there in order to reveal himself. Amen. He has to personally come. He had to personally come to Abraham and reveal himself to Abraham. Gideon, he had to personally be there. You know, Gideon, you're a mighty man of valor. Yeah. You know, and then and then Gideon's very honest. He says, "If God is with us, where are the miracles?" Amen. And so, but get God had to be there in order to reveal to Gideon, you're actually a mighty man of hell. And if you just walk with me, this enemy is going to be done away with. But he had to personally be there. Hallelujah. Amen. You understand? Amen. You may say, "Well, this is very elementary." No, you understand God. You know, you could you could. Now, you wouldn't because you can't physically rewrite the Bible, but you could put yourself in Abraham's life. Yeah. Amen. And the Lord appeared unto Ian or Arand or Edwan or anyone here and said, "Leave this. Leave this old way. Follow me." Amen. Amen. And then he came as, you know, because he was, you know, he revealed himself as Jehovah Gyra. The Lord himself will provide a sacrifice. Amen. Amen. Amen. When he went to um sacrifice Isaac and Jesus was Jehovah's provided sacrifice. He provided himself a sacrifice. Amen. Now, so I don't want to jump around too much, but then it says now the Lord appeared on the plains of memory in Genesis 18. The Lord appeared unto him, Abraham in the plains of memory and he sat down in the tent or in the heat of the day. Hallelujah. So Abraham was there and he saw three men walking and they were physically men because they sat down and they had a meal with Abraham. Amen. So here was now but pardon me notice if you read the account God Abraham says to one of them Lord my lord singular come and stay here and then after after they have their discussion two of them get up and they go to Sodom it says but the Lord stays behind and tells Abraham what's going to shortly take place. Amen. And now that's why we know where we are in the word. Amen. We know where we are in time. We're not guessing where we are. And it's not because everyone on their Charisma News or whatever kind of thing is saying, "Look, the world is ending." That is not the reason we know where we are. We know where we are because we've had a visitation of God in flesh. Amen. Amen. where God would take a redeemed a redeemed man. So, a man that was born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking lies, and he would surrender his life. Amen. And God would God would come and dwell in that man and God would make himself known. Amen. Amen. That's exactly what happened. And but it's the same thing. It's the same thing, friends, with you and I. Because the last manifestation of God before Sodom was burnt is that God was manifested in human flesh. Amen. God was manifested in human flesh. And I want to put it to you today, that's just not the prophet's ministry. Amen. But that's your ministry. Amen. Because the last manifestation of God upon the earth before the rapture is that God has put on human skin once again. And not just in a prophet, but in a many membered body. Amen. Where God would step down into your flesh. He would take your dust. Amen. Your body WHICH ONCE GLORIFIED SATAN. AMEN. Which once you worshiped in some religious system or was just in the world someplace and you actually giving glory to the devil. Amen. But then God came down. Amen. Hallelujah. And laid claim upon you because you don't belong to Satan. You never belong to Satan. Amen. You've got to recognize. You got to look the devil in the eyes AND SAY, "DEVIL, I'M NOT YOUR PROPERTY. I NEVER WAS YOUR PROPERTY. I BELONG TO GOD." AMEN. HALLELUJAH. And then so God now takes claim upon you. What is redemption? God puts his hand upon you and says, "This is my son. This is my daughter. Satan, you have no right to hold them anymore. Hallelujah. And God lays claim. And whatever God lays claim upon, nothing can stand against that claim. Hallelujah. Everything must move. When God says, "This is mine." Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why that's why the Holy Spirit is very zealous of his church. Amen. God is very zealous of his bride because he doesn't want anything to touch her. Amen. He doesn't want her to be manhandled. He doesn't want her to be manhandled by the creeds of man. He doesn't want her to be manhandled by the world. Amen. He wants her pure, spotless in the washed in the blood of the lamb. And that's God's desire. Amen. So now the last manifestation I want you to understand, you are the last manifestation of God upon the earth before the rapture. Right. The bride is God in flesh. Amen. You understand? You have to You have to be able to say Jesus is in me. That's right. Amen. Because I met him. That's right. Amen. He's not just God above us in the Old Testament or God with us as Jesus in the body of flesh, but he says, "I'll be with you, but now I'm going to be in you." Amen. And we're living in the time where it's not just God with us or or or above us, but God in us. As the Apostle Paul said, Christ in you, the hope of glory. So, who has the hope of glory? Hallelujah. Hey, it is what it is. Amen. You've got to be able to just come to the reconciliation OF THE FACT GOD is in me. That's right. Amen. Praise God. Remember, I'm just going to read this. This is brother Bradam and uh questions and answers on the seals. He says, "Heavenly Father, with your great presence laying here, the great Holy Spirit, the one we have the picture of, that's why we have it in the front there. The one that we read in the Bible, he's present right here." Now, amen. He is revealing himself through human flesh. You got to put yourself in this. Remember this is not remember Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. Amen. So what he did in the ministry of the prophet he is continuing to do in his bride. Amen. Amen. The same life, the same works. Amen. The same walk is in her. Amen. Amen. That's why we don't just point to a founder and say, "Look at what everything God did through brother Brandon." But we should be able to say, "He's the same today. We serve a living God and he does the same thing. Amen. Because if we just have a history or a tradition, this is a dead formal work and let's get rid of it and find something that lives. But we have something that lives. And it's not just enthusiasm or some excitement. It's the reality that Jesus has risen from the dead. Amen. He's not in a tomb. And you're not in a tomb either. Amen. Amen. Of this world or some tradition of man. Hallelujah. Amen. Hey, this world tried to seal you up. Amen. It tried to keep you dead in some any kind of way. Doesn't matter if it was religion or the world or everything in between, culture, whatever it was. The world tried to seal you up. Amen. But it's like a bunch of, you know, plants that have been buried in concrete. That thing will worm its way around. It'll come forth as sure as it as sure as there's a tomorrow. Amen. So, it doesn't matter how much concrete the devil tries to pour over your life. Amen. There's a sun shining and there's something in you knowing that there's a light that it must reach out to. Hallelujah. Amen. We serve a living God. Amen. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. That means he doesn't change in in any way. Amen. Our character may mellow with age. It may get different with age, but he is exactly the same. He does not change whatsoever. Now, We know sorry I'll go back here now. Now we've seen him without one time failing through the years to be able to reveal the very thoughts of the heart to reveal the sin that they did. Tell them exactly what happened and what will be without one time failing. Then we know that the God of Abraham, Isaac and of Israel still remains God in the person of Jesus Christ. And by now by his spirit descending from heaven under the blood that was shed at Calvary, coming down among people to make himself manifested in human flesh just before the burning of the world. The great Holy Spirit represented in human flesh. Those precious people who has been who has accepted the blood atonement and the Holy Spirit takes into their being God represented in human flesh. Therefore, it would not be the human flesh only just to perform the act like in baptism and so forth with a commission that these signs shall follow them that believe by laying hands on the sick. The Holy Spirit would see to it that they got well if they had believed. Amen. So, we are living it. Remember the scripture says in in Luke 17, as it was the days of Lot, so shall be when the son of man is revealed. That's not just brother Brandham's ministry. Amen. Cuz that same one that was that was you could say in one man is now in a many membered body. Amen. And that's why you can go around the world pretty much every country under heaven and you can find a group of believers that know the same God you know. And he does the same things here. He does the same things around the world. Amen. Because God is manifesting himself in human flesh just like he did before the burning of Sodom. Hallelujah. Now, God through the Old Testament revealed himself and we know that there are seven compound names of Jehovah. We all know that, do we not? So, just like in Genesis 20 uh in Genesis 22, Jehovah Gyra, the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice. Jehovah Rafa, which is the Lord that health. Exodus 15 and 26. Jehovah Nissi, the Lord, our banner, which is a standard. Amen. So, he is our standard. Remember, when the enemy comes in like a flood, I'll raise up a standard against him. Amen. Jehovah Shalom, the Lord our peace. That's why Jesus could say, "My peace that I give you." Why? Because he was Jehovah Shalom. Amen. He was Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will provide himself a sacrifice. He was the manifestation of the sacrifice. Amen. He is our banner. He is, remember, by his stripes we were healed. So he is Jehovah Rafa, the Lord that healthth. Amen. The same God. Remember the Old Testament and the New? It's all the same book. Yeah. It's just the same God revealing himself all the way down. Jehovah Rafa, I mean, no, Jehovah uh Rah, the Lord my shepherd. Amen. And and then Jesus says, "I am the great shepherd." Yeah. So he is our shepherd and then Jehovah uh tiskanu the lord our righteousness. Amen. And Jesus is our righteousness. Yeah. But then you cannot have those attributes being displayed unless he is Jehovah Shama which is the Lord is present. Amen. Amen. You cannot you cannot know God any by any of those other attributes unless he's present. Amen. Amen. So he must be Jehovah Shama. Amen. He must be present. The Lord is present. Amen. Amen. Are you with me? Amen. Because now remember Jesus says a little while the world seeth me no more. The unbelieving world will. But ye shall see me. Amen. Amen. I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world. So he promised the believer, I'll be with them even in them. So he was promising the believer, I will be Jehovah Shama to you. Amen. Amen. I will be the Lord present. Amen. Hallelujah. Now, as I said, so he has to be Jehovah Shama. He has to be the Lord is present. Amen. That's right. Now, I want you to put this into your own. Remember, I'm talking individually to you. Yeah. This is not all the church and God's in the church. The reason God is in the church is because God is in the people. Amen. If God wasn't in the people, God wouldn't be in the church. Amen. Because remember, this is just a location that that the Lord has allowed us to have that we can separate to him that we can come and worship him at. But in but in reality, all this is is just a location. That's right. Amen. That's why we go to camp and God's at camp. That's why we went our Rancho Chapel. God was at the Al Rancho Chapel. That's why the Anglican church that Pukaru obey, God is there when we're there because God is in his people. God is present in his people. Amen. Amen. So all of the compound the seven compound redemption redemptive names of Jehovah that I just read, they're all in Jesus Christ. Because even the name Jesus means Jehovah's salvation. So now remember, they were saved physically from Egypt. They were delivered physically from Egypt, but they were never delivered from their sin because the blood of bulls and goats just covered up sin. Amen. It never actually set the people free. And that's why it even says in in in Revelations chapter 1, if you're still there, it says this in verse 5. He says, "And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth, unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood." And that word, I think it's that word washed actually means a loosening. We're being washed. We're being separated from them. Amen. They did not know that under the blood of bulls and goats. They did not know that as when God was just Jehovah God. But then when Jesus remember the first declaration of Jesus' name upon the earth when the angel Gabriel announced it, he said, "You shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins." Amen. So they so he be to so the declaration that Jesus was coming. This is the reason that God was going to manifest himself this way because he shall save his people from their sins. Amen. So, and that's why. And so, and so deliverance from sin is the greatest revelation of God. Yes. Amen. Amen. Because you can be physically healed, but then you can get sick again. That's right. Amen. You can, you know, but it's when it's when your sins are washed away. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Because by one offering, he has perfected them forever that are sanctified. Amen. So by that one offering, amen, that sin burden you were born with and was added to by your first nature. Amen. By one offering, he said, "I'm going to do away with that burden." Amen. Amen. You don't have to carry those things anymore. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he said it's like a tub of bleach and you're dropping a put a drop of ink into the tub of bleach. It says he he said it it goes down. It breaks up. And then I don't know how this works, but he says, "But then the ink becomes bleach." Amen. So it breaks up. But then not only that is that it's not accounted to you anymore, but it goes upon the head of the accuser, Satan, because sin has to be annihilated. Amen. It has to be annihilated. And the place it's going to be annihilated is in the lake of fire. Hallelujah. And it has to be attributed to someone in order for it to go there. Amen. So it all goes back down to Satan. It goes on the head of Satan and he carries your sin. Amen. The thing that he trapped you with. Hallelujah. And he's got to pack that thing down to lake of fire and he's got to suffer the punishment that you should have taken. Hallelujah. However many millions of years, I don't know, in a consuming fire. Lord, he's got to pack your what he tried to trap you. The thing he tried to put upon you to make you stop you going to heaven. Amen. And it gets transferred by the blood of Jesus Christ onto his head. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And he's got to pack that down to a lake of fire and you go up into glory. I think that's a great exchange, don't you? Hallelujah. But now you must understand in in order in order for him to be Jehovah Savior, he must be Jehovah Shama. Amen. He must be present. Amen. Hallelujah. And and that's why I said in the beginning, in order to receive a revelation, he has to be present. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. That's why you got to rejoice. Amen. If something if God has made his word alive to you. Amen. He's quickened. He's quickened his word to you. Amen. And and and you couldn't deny it even if you wanted to. Amen. You couldn't a believer that really knows the Lord, they might try and go back into the world. They could try and go back into some dead formal church. They never could. Amen. Amen. Because you cannot deny a part of yourself. Amen. And when he reveals himself to you, he infuses that into your being. Amen. The word becomes part of you. Amen. Because remember, he is his word. Amen. And it's like the centurion who had the sick servant, he had remember the Jews whenever like like Jeras with his daughter come lay hands upon her that she'll get well. That was the Jewish belief. But when the centurion who was a gentile had a sick servant, he had a revelation that he remember because Jesus said, "Okay, I'll go pray for you. I mean I mean I'll go pray for him." But he said, "I'm not worthy you come under my roof, but speak the word." Amen. and the servant will be well. So the centurion had a revelation. Remember this is gentile faith. Now the centurion had A REVELATION THAT GOD'S WORD is exactly the same as him being there. Amen. He Yeah. He did not distinguish this is Jesus. This is his word. He knew Jesus and his word were one. Amen. Amen. So he understood all he need to do is speak the word and he'd be well. Amen. Amen. him speaking the word there was just as good as him stepping in the door and laying hands upon a sick servant. And God's word is here. Amen. So that means Jesus is here right now. Hallelujah. [applause] Everything everything God is is present. Amen. That's why we hold his word so dear. I trust you do because it's not only it's not only this is God in print form. You should treasure this with all your heart. But we don't just have the written word, but we have the right interpretation of the scripture. We have the spoken word of God. Amen. And God speaks his word. And in his word is creative power. Amen. Amen. It has the power to change a sinner into a saint. And we've seen it. He sent his word forth. And people have been changed from sinners to saints. Amen. People have been changed from lost to found. Hallelujah. People have been who were once in religious harlotry and whatever more, they're now being made virgin again, washed in the blood of the lamb. Hallelujah. God just doesn't patch you up. HE'S I'M GOING TO MAKE ALL things new. And he starts in you, [applause] friends. He's not just going to make all things new in the creation. He starts in his bride. That's why you never did it in the first place. Hallelujah. Just hold on. Just hold on to these things. as the devil comes along, you got to you just got to take take God at his word. That's right. God said, "I'm as sinless as he is sinless." Remember, Jesus became me that I might become him by grace. Amen. Amen. It's either true or it's false. But it's become quickened to me, so it's true. Amen. Amen. And that's why this Bible is true because you read it and the spirit of revelation drops into it and it begins to manifest what's on the pages. And it's the same thing with the message. Amen. You hear that word, the Holy Spirit comes in behind that word and transforms you. Hallelujah. That's what it does. It's what it does. I've seen it too much. Amen. This is not doctrine. And well, he said this and he meant this and whatever more and what you know what about the serpent seed and all these different things. It goes beyond doctrine. WHY CAN'T PEOPLE JUST SIT DOWN for a second and look, this is what I was and this is what I am and this is what changed me. Amen. See, we could all stand up and say, "This is what I was. This is who I am. This is what changed me." And it's not enthusiasm. Enthusiasm fades. Enthusiasm burns out. This is not burning out. Hallelujah. This will never burn out. How many of you just keep your focus on the word? AND EVEN IF YOU GO SIDEWAYS, GOD WILL BRING YOU BACK. [applause] HALLELUJAH. OH, I'm lost and undone, God will bring you back. I FEEL SO DISCOURAGED. I'M GOING TO ENCOURAGE YOU. I'm your guide. Hallelujah. David said, "You're the strength of my life." Amen. Psalms 27, that's the rapture message right in there. Hallelujah. Amen. You got to recognize he's the strength of you. Always just just look to him. Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith every day. Look to him. Don't look at this guy cuz you'll be disappointed. Amen. Look to him because in spite of you, IN SPITE OF ABRAHAM AND SARAH, Sarah doubted for a long time. Sarah doubted for 25 years. She doubted the promise. Amen. But Abraham held on. And Abraham knew she was part of the promise. You may have unbelieving family. Disbelieving family. You got to just I trust it anchors into your soul. God, they're part of your promise. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. And then he had a visit. She had a visitation. Hallelujah. Yeah. And then it says that she judged him faithful. Amen. Remember, we are even in the scripture, we are Sarah as well. The church for 2,000 years has been sitting there waiting for the return of the promised son. But just before the sun comes, God is manifested in flesh. Amen. To turn to turn the unbelief into faith. Amen. Amen. Because we are a people. Let's go to Re uh Hebrews chapter 11. now and we'll read verse 11. This is your This is you. Remember Sarah is a type of you. Hallelujah. He says this here. Remember that's the reason God God in Genesis 18 that visitation as I've said was not for Abraham. Abraham already believed because he says he says and this is God in flesh saying according to time of life you're going to have the promised son a time of life speaks of a woman doesn't speak of the man. Amen. So this was Sarah's visitation. Amen. Yeah. And so after this now after this Sarah's Sarah's report was through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised. Amen. Amen. Remember God God has to be present to reveal himself. Amen. And so God was present on the plains of memory to reveal this to Sarah. And her her she turned from unbelief to faith when she actually now begin to judge him faithful that judge him faithful who had promised. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And we have come to an age where the bride of Christ judges him faithful. Amen. Because this is the age where the world is falling apart. Amen. Amen. and everything. We're living in a post-Christian era. Amen. I don't know if you've come to that realization. We're living in a post-Christian era. That's right. And people are trying to, oh, we're going to Christianize the West again. It's not It It's not in scripture. But there is ones and twos. Amen. There are still lost lambs floating around in darkness. We were I was floating around in darkness. Amen. Hallelujah. God found me. God found you. Amen. There's got to be more than just us in these four walls. Amen. Amen. That's part of the reason why we're going upstairs because we don't have any more room. Amen. There's there's more. And if we need to move somewhere else, God will move us. Amen. That's right. Amen. But we got to have it in our hearts. There's got to be more, Lord. There's got to be more. Hallelujah. Because a mission-minded church, God always blesses. Amen. Yeah. God never blesses an ask for and no more kind of people. Amen. So if we want to be blessed as a people, we got to we got to have our heart. Even even if you just pray because I've been feeling quite strongly recently, we need to pray expressly that the people who need to be free, God breaks those chains. Because we know people, they want to they want to come, but they're still bound into the old systems of man, but there's something in them that wants to come free. It's a spiritual battle. It is. Amen. So we especially this Wednesday or start praying about now pray expressly God break the chains of the people who want to come free. Amen. Amen. Amen. Cuz that's why people are torn. Well, I want to stay here but I should stay here but I want to come and I know you've got something more and you know God seems to be real with you and I want what you have but I but but but I want to stay here. Why? It's because the devil's saying I will not let you go. Amen. Amen. So we need to pray expressly. Amen. That God breaks the chains. Amen. Because this is a spiritual battle. Amen. It's not like the devil, you know, I remember when I first came into a message church. I was in a Pentecostal church before that just for a little bit. There were no doubts in my mind. Then I come in, sit in the pews there, truth is being preached. All these distractions in my mind, all these doubts and all these things come in. Why? Because the truth is here. It was back there as well. Wherever the word, wherever the truth is, the devil's there to try and disrupt you. And a kid falls off a seat and no one's seen a kid fall off a seat before. And oh, this kid's crying and oh, I've never seen a kid cry before. He tries to distract. Amen. Because the truth is there. But you got to understand, of course, that's going to happen. Don't be surprised. You know, sometimes people go, "Oh, am I even a believer?" Yes, you're a believer. Amen. If you didn't have the doubts and the questions and all the things trying to distract you, I say, "Well, you should be more worried about that." Amen. Because Because remember, there's only a battle when the opponent's trying to thinks he can get control again. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. But if you're on his side, if he's got you, Yep. Let them go. They're fine. They can do whatever they want, right? Amen. That that's why there's about Oh, that that's not really true. Oh, he's just putting too much emphasis on this and oh, he's just putting a wrong angle on this kind of thing. That's why he's saying this. Oh, it's just his personality saying this and you know what's that? That's the devil. Amen. Amen. It is. Just take the word for what it is. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. You know, now he has to be present to give you revelation. Yep. Romans 10:6. Let's go here. Now, for the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise. Okay. Say not thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven? That is bring uh that is to bring Christ down from above. Or who shall descend into the deep? That is to bring Christ up again from the dead. Righteousness doesn't speak this way. Yeah. But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thine heart. That is the word of faith which we preach. Yeah. So Paul is saying here, remember this is what unbelief says. We need to go get Jesus somewhere. Yeah. We need to go get him from heaven. We need to call him down or we need to get him up cuz he's still in the tomb. This is unbelief. What is unbelief saying? Jesus is somewhere else. Amen. Oh, he's coming again. We're looking forward to him to come in the meeting of the year. We are, but he's already here. Amen. I'm just reading this from the scripture saying, "But righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise." Remember Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Amen. Because he believed, it was accounted to him for righteousness. What? The thief on the cross believed God. Yes. And it was accounted to him for righteousness. Mhm. Cuz he said, "Lord, remember me when you come into thy kingdom." No one said no one preached him a sermon. He didn't read any website or hear some sermon or go to some church. He saw his he saw Jehovah Gyrus God will provide himself a sacrifice. He saw the sacrifice hanging right next to him. Amen. Amen. And he recognized now this one this one was going to go up into his kingdom and empty out paradise and deliver people from the chains of darkness. Amen. And he believed God and it was accounted him for righteousness. Amen. How do I become righteous? Believe his word. Amen. Believe his word and then everything else will fall into place. You don't you don't patch up the outside. Just believe his word. You believe his word and then the outside will come right. Then the house will be changed. Then your relationship will be different with your spouse. Just believe the word. Amen. Amen. That's all you have to do. Yeah. Believe the word and then watch everything else fall into place. Because when you believe God now, God has to back up what he said to you and do what he promised. Amen. Amen. All you have to do is believe it. Amen. Now, so but righteous of faith speaketh on this wise, saying not say not in thine heart. So don't say subconsciously, who shall ascend into heaven, that is to bring Christ down from above? or who who shall descend into the deep that is to bring Christ up from the dead. But what saith it? Now remember Christ remember he is his word. Yep. He is his word. But what sayith it? The word is nigh thee. It's close to you even in thy mouth and in thy heart. That is the word of faith which we preach. So Paul is saying that God is present. Amen. You following me? He is actually declaring this is this [laughter] is the righteousness of faith. Faith says God is present. Faith says that word is neither even in thy mouth even in thy heart. Amen. Amen. Remember the word is not just this is just a printed form of of words. Amen. But he's not talking about mental retention of a word. Even though you must it's good to have memory verses and read the Bible. Amen. Because it goes the word goes from here into here. Amen. If you don't give anything God to work with, then how's he going to work? Amen. It's very very ABC simple. You know, that's why that's why the devil makes your life very busy. Amen. I'm just going to look at Facebook and there goes 40 minutes. I'm just going to read the news. There goes another 40 minutes now. I'm just going to go to bed. How about this? God have mercy. Take the time you spend on Facebook, spend it in the word first and then go into Facebook. Amen. Try that out. But I want to know what's going on in the world. This is the newspaper. You just get into that message. The thing I've said it many times, the thing that things that brother Brham said, we are seeing manifested upon the earth. Amen. Amen. when the last vision he had was America all smoke bombs and craters and look what's happening in the world. Russia's awakened. Yeah. Amen. They're preparing themselves for war and America's playing Pokémon Go. Yeah. Amen. It's going to be It's been prophesied to happen. He said the Revelations 18 about the bomb being dropped on the Vatican, Russia's going to do it. Amen. They're coming into their position. Yeah, we have the technology and the egg. Have you ever Googled cars in 1933? They are these big box things. They didn't care about aerodynamics. They just probably thought, "Well, that looks cool. We'll build it that way." Go Google cars in 1933. And that is the same year when brother saw eggshaped cars. And there's a and there's there's no steering wheel and there's like a family in there playing a game and it's just driving down the motorway. We have the technology. We have the cars. Yeah, right. Amen. Amen. It's all here. He saw it back then. And if that is true and he saw, he says, "Now I see woman rise in America." And and one will rise, beautiful, but very cruel. He says, "I'll be a president or the Catholic Church." The Catholic Church is already in control in America. That's exactly right. Most all of the Supreme Court judges now the Supreme Court in America, they are there for life when they're voted in and that's the highest authority in in the country. They're all Catholics and Jews. There's no Protestant Supreme Court judges anymore. Amen. Most of the you'll see the political parties, especially the last election, both of the vice president choices were Catholic. Amen. They're they're all in there. the Pope comes in and addresses the Senate and everything. And one article I read about it was uh they were saying he's probably the most like the best politician oral statesman in the whole room. Amen. And here he is. And this is what you know puts forth his agenda. And says in that same trip that that the cross was a failure. Amen. All these things are happening and brother said the Catholic Church will rise and in 1933 the Catholic Church was not on the rise in America. Amen. They never would invite the pope to the White House. That's right. They never did those things back then. But it wasn't it's not that far down the road when this last pope died and there's all the former presidents there. George Bush senior junior Clinton I think another one there and they're praying. There's a picture. There's Pope John Paul's body there in in in St. Peter's. They're on the front row there, and they're bowing down, praying before this dead body, paying homage to this great man. The prophet saw it and it's here. That's right. Amen. Don't take these things for granted. Don't let it Don't be numb. That's right. To where we are. That's right. Amen. Because it's the most glorious time to be alive. Because before the first bomb falls, the brides in glory. Amen. Hallelujah. But that also and I want to put this burden upon you. We have to find the last one. Amen. Amen. Because the door is shutting to the Gentiles. Amen. Amen. So, and I said, we say, I don't know how to witness. Your life will live. That's right. But pray above all things. Amen. because it's the powerhouse of prayer where why do we have such a blessed time? I could be standing here tripping around saying all kinds of things. Amen. But God is present. Why why does why has God blessed us? Why does he continue to bless us? Because we pray. Amen. Amen. Why Why can we rejoice in the Lord? Because prayer changes things. You understand? That's why the I'm so happy we have the prayer meeting. We have the We have a church prayer meeting now. I love it. Amen. Oh, it's awesome, isn't it? I love it, too. Amen. Amen. But that's why I'm so happy we have that now because prayer changes things. Amen. And Yeah. Amen. So, we have to we have to find there's coming a day where we can no longer labor. Where it's the end. Amen. And we have we can't just let this world wants to numb us to that fact. Oh, it'll be maybe I don't know when it'll be. It could be right now. Amen. I'd still be happy. Amen. But let's labor. Remember, we do not earn we do not earn salvation. But when we see him, I want to hear those words, you good and faithful servant. Amen. Enter into the joy of the Lord's. Yeah. You want to be good and faithful in what God has committed you to do. That's right. Amen. But we don't want to go up empty-handed. Yeah. I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about all of us. We want to, you know, I want to say, "Lord, I ran this race with everything I had." Amen. Remember, he enables you to do it cuz race enables you to live the word. Amen. But we want to run this race victorious. Amen. Yeah. Amen. Amen. And even if the thing is don't look at well no one's listening to me remember who who does anyone love fishing here like really or hunting now [laughter] if you don't shoot something do you throw your gun away and say I'm never going hunting again they say next time. Yeah. And if you know there's only say one deer or one whatever you say I'm going to get that one. Amen. Right. Yeah. And it's the same thing when it comes to finding souls. There may be less, but they're still there. Amen. I didn't get them. Well, I'm going to get him. You know how there's like those old stories of there's that big fish and that guy's been trying to catch it all those years. You heard those kind of stories? He doesn't. That guy doesn't get discouraged. I'm going to catch old yeller or whatever his name is. Big Bill, you know, I'm going to get him. and their whole life becomes focused. They may work, they may do all kinds of things, but but it becomes an obsession. You're like, you're like the book, was it uh was it Moby Dick? I want to get that white whale, you know, the you know the captain, whatever his name, he becomes an obsession. Amen. Amen. What about us finding souls? Amen. Remember, we're not building a kingdom, just an oh, a church. We're not I'm not Forget that. We're here to find the last one. Amen. Amen. Amen. And even if you hear about mission work overseas and you pray for that, the success of that mission work be is because you're anointed to pray. And it doesn't matter if you never they never know until the other side. Amen. But we got to we got to whenever we hear about God's doing something, we should throw every shoulder behind the wheel we can. Amen. And pray for it earnestly. Amen. Because remember this is a body work. Amen. It's not a church work or individual work or you know we're all in this together. Amen. With our with our brothers and sisters. Doesn't matter what country or what nationality, what language. That's right. We're with them. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's why we should always pray. Amen. Now, [snorts] he is present. I just want to read this. I'm sorry, my time has slipped away. But now Jesus promised that he'd be with us even in us to the end of the world. Now we're not going to read it, but I'm just going to cover this very quickly. You go read Revelations chapter 10. And it says, "And the mighty angel descended from heaven with a rainbow over his head and open book in his hand." Amen. That is Christ coming down to the earth. Not in a physical body. Remember, we we meet the Lord in the air. But that is part of his coming. Amen. It's like are you you know it's like the tide coming in. The tide. It takes a process of time for the tide to come in, but then it's in. Yeah. But it doesn't just Oh, now there's high tide. It's the same thing with the coming of the Lord. He starts his coming and and his coming begins. He places a prophet upon the earth. Because if you read the breach, brother A Bram says the seventh angel speak of himself. He he he just reads Revelations chapter 10 and he says the seventh angel is on the earth at the time of this coming. Revelations 10:1. That's right. Amen. That's what he says. And so that began the coming of the Lord there because there was an Elijah to introduce Christ to the bride. Yes. Amen. And then that's why you always, it's so significant to me when he's standing there behind the pulpit and he calls someone out in the audience and he just poses the question, who did he touch? Who did she touch? And he says he says like they were 20 feet or whatever feet away from me. He said they didn't touch me, they touched the high priest. Well, then why is why is the man standing here revealing what's going on in their life? Is because that high priest has now stepped into that body. Amen. And by faith, they touched the high priest and then they re God, the high priest in him reveals what's going on. You understand? So the high priest they were touching by faith wasn't up in glory. He was down there on the platform. I trust you catch the significance of that. Amen. So all that Jesus, remember Jesus, the fullness of the Godhead bodily was in Jesus. Everything God is was poured into Christ. Amen. Yep. And then everything Christ is, God pours into the church. Amen. Amen. And you see it on the day of Pentecost, pillar of fire comes down. Jesus in a different form comes down, separates himself into the believers. So everything that was poured, remember Jesus when he was baptized, the spirit of God descends upon him like a dove. The angel of the covenant comes to his temple. Malachi 3. Amen. And then Jesus does his earthly ministry, redeems you and I on Calvary, ascends from the grave with the keys of hell, death, and the grave in his hand. Hallelujah. That's why Paul could say, "Death, where is your sting? Grave, where is your victory?" Remember, death only takes us to where we want to go. Think about it that way. Hallelujah. And so now, so now all that God poured into Christ, the man, Amen. Now that is poured into the church in Acts two. Hallelujah. Amen. All brother makes a statement many times. All that God poured into Christ, Christ is now poured into the church. Amen. Amen. So now when we talk about Jehovah Shama, God being present, Jehovah Rafa, God is our healer or God was it Jehovah Nissi, our banner. All those seven redemption names, seven compound redemptive names of Jehovah, Amen, is now poured into you. Amen. I'm trying to get you to see God isn't just in heaven, he's in you. That's right. Amen. Amen. God has put on flesh. Hallelujah. And what we do now, like Jesus, why did he go away and pray? Cuz he wanted to stay in fellowship with the God that was in him. Amen. You understand? And that's why we stay in prayer. and stay in the word because we want to stay in fellowship with the God that's in us. Hallelujah. Because if you stay in fellowship with the God that's in you, then you can do his will. Remember, there is therefore no condemnation. Romans 8:1 to them that walk after the spirit and not after the flesh. Amen. Amen. Because if you walk according to your flesh, you'll get condemnation because you will stumble and fall and fail and the devil will drag you through the mud all he can. But if you walk according to the spirit that's within you, then there's no condemnation because you walk victorious. Amen. And that's why there's always the battle who who remember when the pressure comes on, why does pressure come on? Cuz the devil wants to put you back into your carnal way. Amen. Cuz this body is not redeemed. Amen. This body needs a body change. Please, Lord, now. Amen. Amen. That's why we're there's something groaning within us. Amen. Lord, I want to put on that new body. I want to be closer to you than I am right now. I don't want these five senses. I don't want that veil between you and I. Amen. Amen. That's why we have a longing for the rapture. Not just to escape this world. We want to be. Remember, he's with us even in us. But there's still this thing. Remember Jesus Jesus said, you go read it in John how how how he's there by the temple and they think he's talking about the temple but he says he says destroy this temple. And in three days I'll raise it back up again. And that word destroy actually means loose. Amen. Amen. So he says he says he's basically saying loose me from this temple. Amen. Jesus the joy that was set before him was being in you. Amen. Not just with his people. I want to be in them. That's what he's always longed. He wants to be back in the human soul again. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why he's based saying, "Loose me from this temple." That's why he said to Judas, "Whatever you do, do it quickly. I want this done." Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. So now, Revelations chapter 10, Christ comes down with an open book. Brother makes a statement. He says Christ is those seals. Amen. And he and so he says he says that the opening of the seals is revealing Christ. Amen. So he so he's not saying he's not because remember well this is me. The first time I listened to the seals I saw the horse riders and the tribulation and whatever more. But the next time when I listened to it I just saw the lambstepping forth. Here's my redeemer now. The whole picture was changed. Amen. You see, because by him releasing the seals, he's actually releasing part of himself. You know, he's revealing himself. Amen. He's not he's not veiled in in the creed and dogmas of man. Amen. He's he's not veiled behind. Remember, it's the unveiling. God actually pulls the cover off himself. And say, "Here I am. This is me." Amen. And that's why that's why Hallelujah. That's why John, remember the first chapter you read it, John is there and he heard hears a voice like a trumpet behind him and he turns around and he sees the candlesticks and one like the son of man walking among the candlesticks and it's showing in time as the bride he's advanced past the seven church ages. Amen. And then now he turns and now comes the revealing the revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. You understand? Because brother Ram says, "One man in a vision is a representation of a whole people." And you see that in Revelations 4:1 where John sees a that same voice speaks from heaven with an open door saying, "Come up hither." And that's showing at the end of the seventh church age is the rapture. Amen. Because the bride John is a symbol in the book. Amen. You understand? So now there's been seven church ages, but the book's sealed. And here's the bride at the end of the seventh church age. And he and she hears a voice. Hallelujah. Turns around and sees what God has been doing in seven church ages. Amen. Amen. But not only that, now he says, "Now I'm going to show you eternal things." That's why after the seals, you have a prophet stand. You know, brother B stand in Christ the mystery of God revealed. Says, I'm going to tell you what was in the back part of God's mind. Amen. Hallelujah. Take these things are significant. Amen. Now, I'm going to tell you what the hidden mystery was in him. Amen. Amen. And so at the end of the church ages now, now is the time for the revealing of Jesus Christ as supreme deity. Amen. Amen. That's why he says, look, because he says the cloud picture, supreme judge, supreme deity. You see, it just vindicates the message perfectly. Amen. Because this message, you know, people say, "Oh, it's a prophet." Whatever more he exalted Jesus Christ. I am. He didn't say he's the second person of a godhead. He says he is the almighty, the supreme deity. And it even says in the book of Revelation in there, chapter one, I am Alpha and Omega, the Almighty. Hallelujah. Not just a a mighty one, the Almighty. Amen. The beginning and the ending. And now you're living in a season where I'm going to take the veil off of me. Amen. So you can know me exactly as I am. Hallelujah. Glorious. And the reason this has happened is because God wants to show you I am Jehovah Shama. I am God present. Hallelujah. So now when when he descends there Revelation chapter 8 that is GOD ALL THAT GOD IS. I say all that heaven is. Remember because John was about to write he said seal it up. So there's a portion of the word that was sealed up until the time of the end. Amen. And that's why before the seals open, Brother Bram's in a meeting and a guy, I think Danny Henry, he comes to him, a Baptist guy, and he says, "Brother Bram, I don't want to sound sacriiggious, but that could almost be the an extra chapter on the end of the book of Revelation." They start speaking in tongues in French. And there's a, you know, like three French speakers there in the in the meeting. Two actually wrote it down and their notes were exactly was the interpretation. And then the French interpreter, the UN came and he vindicated that's exactly what he said. Denny Henry didn't know a word of French. And he says, "Because you have chosen the hard way, the narrow way by your choosing, a great portion of heaven awaits you. This is a great victory in the love divine." And that portion of heaven was the word. A great portion of the word awaits you. Amen. Amen. And then he comes now. And then now the seals are open. So part of Christ that was veiled, sealed away. Amen. Amen. beautiful is now made known. Amen. And all remember in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, all the mysteries of God should be finished. That's not just, as I said, it's not just doctrine. It's not, oh, I know the Bible, how it fits together. It goes beyond that. It's now I'm going to fully reveal myself to you. Amen. Amen. So, but in order, remember, in order to have a revelation, he has to be present. Amen. Amen. And so now here he is. So now all that heaven is Amen. Amen. Because remember I said you go read in the breach. He says the seventh angel's on the on the earth at the time of Revelations 10:1 time of this coming. And because it seals the book is open. Remember that's a symbolic thing. He's saying now this was this was sealed. Amen. This is the book of redemption and your name is in this book. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why when the book was open and now he's going to reveal the inheritance. Amen. The reason it's become alive to you IS BECAUSE YOU'RE PART of the inheritance. Amen. Because that's the reason it's quickened to you is because you're part of the book. Amen. That's right. Amen. It's a supernatural thing. You got to Oh, you so blessed. We just recognize what God has done for us. Done for you personally. Amen. It's not just I'm a Christian. That's no God has redeemed you and now he's reading the contents of the book to you and he and because he's present he quickens it to you. Hallelujah. SO ALL THAT GOD IS NOW I say all that heaven is emptied itself and is down upon the earth because there's no record of that angel ever going away. Amen. And that's just Christ leading us into the rapture. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the reason I say that now, the reason I say that is because many times we just made you on Revelations 10:1-7, but 8 to 11 is the bride's ministry. Remember, because John, it says, remember, he took the book. He took the inheritance. Amen. Amen. It's like a lawyer. You're sitting in a lawyer's office. This goes to you. This goes to you. This goes to you. Writes it down. Signs it. He gives you the bit of paperwork. And then you go take it. Then you go possess whatever's been given to you. Right. Amen. So now God is God has taken the seals off the inheritance. He gives it to the seventh angel. He preaches it. It calls you out. And then what happens is you become one with that inheritance. Hallelujah. Because it says John was told, "Take the book and eat the book." I mean, so take the inheritance and become one with it. And it's sweet in your mouth because it's glorious, but it's bitter in the belly because there's so many things that got to go. Hallelujah. Everything's got to go. That's not a Don't hold on to anything that you once believed. I KNOW IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS, but just throw it out. Lord, if it's contrary to what is the truth, help me get rid of it. Amen. Because you have to have the confidence when the spirit of truth has come to you personally. He will lead you and guide you into all truth. Amen. And that is the spirit of Christ. So you have to have that confidence. Amen. So don't be, oh, I don't want to be deceived. No. When the spirit of truth has come, he said, "I'll lead you and guide you into all truth." He said, "Remember, it'll be so close that it will deceive the very elect if it was possible." That means it is not possible for the elect to be deceived. Amen. Who's elect? Amen. You just got to have that confidence. Don't be scared about it. You'll have something in you and you will know. And there's a difference between your flesh fighting it and God saying, "Hey, that's not me." And my sheep hear my voice. They know my voice. So you'll know if it's actually your flesh or it's actually false that God's warning you. And so now John, because remember John, it say he says after he he he eats the book says you must prophesy before many nations. Wait, let's just go to that Revelations chapter 10 very quickly. Last verse. And now I must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and and tongues peoples, nations, tongues and kings. Last verse. John, you go look at his life. He was on the aisle of Patmos for he had this received this book of Revelation over two years and then you think he goes to Ephesus and he passes the church and he dies of old age. There's nothing in history where he goes and fulfills this because it wasn't speaking to him personally. Speaking of an end time people when the word is open. Amen. Saying that you must because Jonah said one man in a vision represents a whole group. Saying saying now you must become one with the with the inheritance and you must prophesy again. You must speak it again. Yeah. That's right. Amen. because it's already been spoken. Amen. But now you must speak it. Amen. That's why it's so important. Just like in, you know, Revelations 19, when the Lord comes on the white horse, the word, the two-edged sword is out of his mouth, you got to fight like your God fights. Amen. Amen. That's why you got to put the word in your mouth. Amen. Amen. That's why you've got to you've got to speak to your mountain. Amen. Amen. That's why brother Bam had the vision. or I think it was a no no I think it was a vision or a dream and he said there were all this like a like a dungeon jail place and there's people behind the bars saying deliver us brother Bam help us you know and then and then that person even said it'll take more than this to set us free and then so now but then but then God said to brother Baron just speak and then he begin to speak house of hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ he says all the all the bars begin to break and All the prison doors fell down, everything and the people walked free. Amen. Amen. That's why you got to speak the word. Amen. Amen. Don't be afraid to take God at his word. You speak the word. Hallelujah. Amen. Whatsoever things you believe. Amen. Ask and it shall be. Amen. If you ask anything in my name, then I'll do it. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. You just got to be yielded to have a God answers that. But don't be afraid. You got to fight like God fights. Amen. But now I wanted to say all that because the reason remember I remember the subject is all that God is is here. Amen. Everything God is is present here. Amen. Amen. Amen. And it's not just here on a Sunday morning. Amen. every day, every moment of every day, you've got to just recognize he's with me. Amen. Everything he is is with me. Amen. Not just a part of himself, a part of the word, but now everything he is. He's present. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Can we have some musicians to come? You got to recognize all heaven, all that heaven is, all healing, all redemption, all salvation. Amen. Everything you have need of, the word is neither even in thy mouth. Amen. So whatever you have need of today, he's here. Amen. Remember the pillar of fire did not leave when brother Brown was taken off the scene. Yeah. That same I'm fully persuaded the same God that was back there is with us. I'm fully persuaded. Amen. Because he does the same things. He produces the same kind of life. Amen. He's vindicated his word to us. I just thinking, yo, you just think whenever you get down to a bad patch, just go back over your testimony. Amen. Amen. And just think of all the amazing things he has done. Amen. And against the odds, we're still walking. Because this whole world is stacked against you. But you've got to recognize if God be for me, who can be against me? Hallelujah. And God is for us. Amen. Otherwise, he would never have. Why would he reveal himself? Why did he reveal himself to Abraham? Because he wanted because Abraham was part of him. Yeah. Why was he Jehovah Sheama to to Abraham? It wasn't just, oh, I'm going to make him a religious kind of guy. No, he had a certain promise that he was going to fulfill through his life. And why does he reveal himself to you? Because he has certain promise. They which are alive and remain shall not hinder them which are asleep. For the dead in Christ arise first, and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to with them to meet the Lord in the air. Amen. Amen. That is our promise, friends. Amen. I could go on, but you got to understand, you got to just hold it in front of you. Amen. Amen. We have our ups and downs. We have whatever more, but God is with us. God is with you. All that heaven is is is invested in you. Yeah. Amen. Malachi 4, behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Amen. You say, "Well, I'm not in the scripture." Yeah, you are. It says you. It says me. Amen. Amen. And if he and if he if if there's only one going in the rapture, he'd do it all for one. Amen. Thank you, Lord. If Jesus was dying just for me, he would have done it all. Amen. The whole Bible, all the prophecy, whatever, all the shadows, whatever more, all would have been done just for one. Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet, and the God of Elijah is with us. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's stand, shall we? I just trust it sinks in today. Amen. Hallelujah. God's with me. Amen. God is my strength. He He's the strength of my life. Absolutely. Hallelujah. Amen. And let's just Can we just sing He is here again. Hallelujah. God's here. Amen. You say, "Well, I all I see is a bunch of excitement, people crying and shouting." Just open your heart. Give him one second. Give him [music] one second. He is here. Hallelu [music] He is here. [music] Amen. [singing] He [music] is here. Holy, [singing] holy. I [music] will bless his [singing] holy name. [music] He is here. [singing] Listen [music] closely. Hear him calling [music and singing] out your name. He is [music and singing] here. You can touch him. [singing] You [music] will never [singing] be the same. [music] He is here. Hallelujah. He [music and singing] is here. Amen. [music and singing] He is here. Holy, [singing and music] holy. I will [music and singing] bless his holy name. [music] He is here. [singing] Listen closely. [music] Hear him [singing] calling [music] out your name. He is here. [music] You can [singing] touch him. You will [music] never [singing] be the same. So I just want to read one more. [music] You say now listen to this. Doesn't Christ the mystery of God again? He says [music] now the same God, the same pillar of fire, the same way. Speaking of now, [music] uh, and back in Israel, he cannot change his way. Is that just perfect? How many gods did Israel have? One. How many [music] has the bride got? One. How many will there ever be? One. Sure. Sure. under the leadership of the Holy Spirit which was the pillar of fire in the days of Moses the great prophet. He is directed by a pillar of fire. Is that right? Going [music] to a promised land. And in the Christian age there was one God which appeared in the form of a pillar of fire to a prophet called Paul who was sent to the Gentiles to take a people out for his name's sake. Is [music] that right? and in the last days has come down in like manner vindicating himself in the same signs, [music] same wonder, same pillar of fire, same gospel, same word, same manifestation. His body will do the works that he promised like in Mark 16 [music] and so forth. His body was not held in the grave but was recognized with him in the resurrection. Do you get it? then in the body of his believing children will not be held in the grave when he comes but will be recognized with him because he died for a purpose to resurrect his bride the [music] body recognized because it's his body because it's the word it's so completely yielded from denominations and things to him and he is the word seed and it's recognized with him because now we have the first fruit of first fruit of our resurrection by knowing that we've passed from death under life become prisoners of his and God proving to us by his personal headship that he is the same yesterday today and forever by doing the same things through the church that he did then he in me and I in him and you [music] and him and so forth. That's right. His body was not held in the grave recognized with him in the resurrection. Amen. Same as he is now. Now listen, which means this his word which he is has has beun to be risen. The word that down through the age of Luther Wesley see has beun to rise up to its power. There it be to move. Then it moved a little more. Now it's coming up to identification. See watch now to the bo to the life in the body is a vindication of the rapture is at [music] hand. Amen. You understand the proof that the rapture is at hand is because his life is in you. Amen. Amen. You [music] see the headship and the body become one and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is ready to be received to the headship. He says nations are breaking Israel awakening. See what I mean? He has begun to give life into his body. Why? The one that he has redeemed, the mediatorial work is done. He's bringing his life to the body in the vindication for [music] the rapture. Amen. Amen. How do you know you're going? Because his life is in you. Amen. And that is the proof or the vindication that the rapture [music] is at hand. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. [music] Hallelujah. I'm so glad to be a believer. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just let's just sing. You chose me. [music] And if anyone has prayer or maybe someone who hasn't given their life to Christ and wants to, you're more than welcome to come. He is here. Hallelujah. Amen. [music] Were [singing] it not for thy [music] nail scar head?
