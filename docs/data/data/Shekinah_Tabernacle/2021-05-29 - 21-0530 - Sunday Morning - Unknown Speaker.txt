[Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Applause] praise the lord welcome everyone welcome to the house of the lord i mean it's good to be here again it's good to be an atmosphere where anything can happen and where all things are possible that's what it's like when you're in the presence of god all things are possible regardless of what your situation is or how it might seem or anything like that all things are possible when you're in the presence of god so um we this morning we want to um we want the spirit of god to dwell richly with us you know we don't just want a small amount we want we want an outpouring of the holy ghost and our presence this morning because that's what that's what changes things you know we when you're young you think you're pretty good or most of us did hey that's true if we're honest you know we we rate ourselves you know but and and especially young guys you know they go through this phase where they think they're the strongest thing out the strongest thing that ever existed you know i'm this big strong guy it's all in here though because it's in reality we're not really you know we're when you look at the scale of how big we are and the amount that we can achieve with our physical strength it's minuscule you know absolutely minuscule what what we can do and as you go on you realize i'm just nothing and the the power of god is everything you know that that's what that's what changes things that's what makes things that's what changes our life it's not how much effort i can put in it's how much god puts in and it's how much i surrender to the lord and that the power and the spirit of god work through my life and and do things for me go go before me you know we want the spirit of god to go before us and and and everything that we do we don't just we don't want to be pressing on by ourselves you know we're we're going ahead i don't want to go ahead man i don't know what i'm doing and i'm not and i don't have the ability to change things or to make things work you know we even think about what you know people think they're smart and intelligent and they can work a lot of things at once you know especially business people and that you know they but they're not really they don't they can't they're only controlling this fear that they're in a maybe they're sending a few texts and some emails and controlling a few people they're not controlling the world you know there's a lot there could be they could be thinking everything is fine and they're doing so great in the meantime something could be brewing to destroy everything that they're just trying to work for and they know nothing of it you know but god knows all things so if we want success we want the lord to be in control of all the things that we can't see that we don't know what's going on lord you lead the way you go before me let's um let's uh stand this morning we've got some visitors i'm looking at one of them brother ian hammer down the back

take your seats this morning um thank you musicians so so i was actually preaching today not not song leading but we just realized um about sorry i'll just blend my nose we realized about 10 o'clock 10 30 last night thanks bro that we were short of a song leader so that was me but um yeah i'm i'm actually preaching this morning so sorry you had to sort of put up with me for a whole session it'd be good because you'll be real sick of me and there'll be no requests for a long time it's a cunning plan amen excuse me i'll just grab this so i've got a very very simple um thought this morning a lot of the times i end up with a little thought and then it compounds to be quite a big thought and i have to rush really fast to get through it but it's not like that today i've honestly got a very simple thought and i can just take my time on this one because it's it's um it's very very simple and it's not something that um i'm reasonably confident it's not something that you won't already know and i i yeah and it's not it's not really a i'm not going to call it a big deep revelation i just want to take my time it's a very simple thought i'm just going to slowly take my time through it so that so that we we get the essence of it because i'm when you think about the thought and school patients that i'm going to talk about it's actually the it's actually the um i would call it almost the backbone of our christian walk of our of our journey here is this term called patience and it's something that that when when the apostle paul talks about older men or women that have been through life's journey and that may be elders or pillars in the church one of the essential ingredients one of the central characteristics that he or she must have is patience he always the bible always lists this this characteristic called patience that they must have patience if they are going to be in that sort of role because it's a it's the sort of thing that is always worked on over our christian walk is our patience it's it's something that that is always refined in the door that is always growing and that when we get the further towards the end of this natural walk we get if things are working as they should be then we should have more patients and we should be we should get to a point where we've got perfect patients because that's what christ is he's perfection and when he works in our lives he brings us to perfection and so there is a place we get to where we have perfect patience when we're younger in our walk we get flustered that's not patience that's that's flusterations you know that's that's worry that's i'm concerned i'm fearful of how things might be but as we go on we have patience but i think and looking into this word because that's how i kind of get these i get one word and i have to sort of look into it it's almost as though the way that english works is that words take on different meanings or the meaning of a word can change over time so that it can mean something else 100 200 300 years later something different than what it was originally saying the king james or in these older versions it was written down a certain the word meant a certain thing but it's almost like now it's changed a bit now what do you think of when you think patience i'm going to probably ask you a question i think you think waiting right like to a big degree you think if i'm patient like i say be patient you know if if you're my generation you'll think is that what you think if i say be patient you say oh okay i'll patiently wait you know it kind of isn't really that we get this wrong term of this thing called patience because it doesn't really exactly mean weight it's actually a very powerful term and it means it actually means to push forward relentlessly as patients it doesn't mean weight it's not weight like sit around and wait it actually means it's very powerful which i didn't really think about it or know about it till i just was looking into this so um let's just stand and we'll just read these few scriptures and then you can have your seats again um romans 12 12. it says rejoicing in hope patient and tribulation continuing instant in prayer patient and tribulation and hebrews 12 1 says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us may the lord bless his word you can have your seats again this morning for i've got other scriptures but that's the ones we're going to read at the start now when you read this verse here especially hebrews 12 1 it says you run with patience does that mean you run and then as you're running you slow down and you stop and you wait you run with patience and it's a very powerful term and it and yeah that it really means to push forward relentlessly towards a something you're trying to achieve okay but we'll just we'll go i just want to lay that out there but because of our um modern language which it sort of lost its meaning and when we read it we can sort of lose the essence and the power of what this thing actually is and actually how that every one of us need patience and it's a critical component but i've coined this little phrase here and if you want to quote me you can quote this people say persistence but it's not persistence it's patience patience proves patience persists in patients pace and i'm going to refer back to this once i go through this a little thought about patience we'll come back to this and i'll break that down a bit to show you why i meant about about that one there okay but this is the modern i guess the modern understanding of this term called patience i'm just going to go real slow with this that's all right i'm just going to take it slow i'm not in a rush i haven't i've got a few slides to get through but i don't need to power through them like i have through some of the other ones where i can't even take a breath you know okay this is the current term of what patience is if you search the dictionary it says the ability to wait or to continue doing something despite difficulties or to suffer without complaining or becoming annoyed which to a degree is kind of correct but it's not really it sort of lost the essence of what the word actually is in my opinion and i could be wrong i'm not really a i can't say that i've passed english in school but i can say that i read the bible when it says you run with patience and i think okay that doesn't really mean sitting around waiting it means i'm doing something these are the examples in monday terms of of how the word patients would be applied okay uh term one you have to have such a lot of patience when dealing with children with kids number two in the end i lost my patience and shouted at her number three he's a good teacher but he doesn't have much patience with the slower pupils number four making small scale models takes or requires a great deal of patience like excuse me five the youngest son was beginning to try my patients that's a common term you trying my patients and number six patients they'll be here soon to me they're not it's not quite it's sort of not quite how it should be right i've changed these words to maybe write a better word of what they're talking about right so this one here number one says you could almost this would be a better word for the situation rather than patience you have to have such a lot of self-control when you're dealing with kids right because what it is is you you lose your vital control of your emotions and then you redline and who knows what would happen after that right but that's your so your temperance almost your temperance has come to its end because you're frustrated by a situation it's that's more what that situation is regarding not so much patience like because it's not you'll see what i mean as we go through but i'll replace these in the end this is another one that could be referred to as self-control in the end i lost my self-control and shouted at you now we that would that would be a closer term i believe than this word patience of what the essence of the word patience means um he is a good teacher but he doesn't have much i'm going to put the word tolerance but there probably are other better words but tolerance with the slow pupils like he's getting frustrated because some people are learning fast but others are taking a while to pick up what he's trying to teach them and it's frustrating him you know come on i need you to be up with this other with the other crowd because now i'm having to go back and teach you so he's he's these examples more based on just a personal emotional level right of what the examples are giving this one here is kind of closer to the word patience what i believe would be so i left this one in here because it's it's closer because it says making small scale models takes or requires a great deal of patience because he's trying to achieve something so he's not sitting around he's trying to achieve something but and he's got to work very hard to achieve it but it but it has to be a calculated um sound focused approach in order to achieve what he needs to achieve which is making his models so so he has to have this patience because he's got to diligently press on until he achieves the outcome that he's desiring see that that's that's more in line with what the word patience means like i'm going to press forward and achieve this thing not so much i'm frustrated so i lose it you don't really lose your patience you give up right the youngest son was beginning to try my self-control once again these are more examples of you know self-control this word patience they'll be here soon we might as well just replace that word for wait wait you know wait they'll be here soon just wait like you're waiting for them to arrive so just wait you don't really need patience you need to wait it's a that is a different word but we've now thinking it means patience right this is what i believe a scriptural term or the essence of the word is as means more than this term if i'm just waiting around because i'm waiting for you so i've got to be patient it's the ability to persevere towards a desired or relatively better outcome regardless of the obstacles circumstances or cost so i want to i want something that i deem to be better so that i am going to continue to press on towards that goal regardless of how it might seem or what the costs or how hard it might be during this process i will continue to press on until i've reached this desired outcome because i deem that to be better than the situation that i've got now that's patience right that's why it says run with patience the guy running believes that me winning the race and getting to the end is a great outcome for me therefore i am going to focus regardless of the climbing uphill downhill over fences wherever i'm going i am i am going to continue to press on regardless of what might be happening i'm going to have patience that doesn't mean i'm going to stop and wait by the sideline i'm going to run with patience i'm going to run with this desire to get somewhere because i deem it right now it's based on how that's why i say the other one was i need to slowly explain this relative it's relative to what you deem to be better because not everything we all deem to be better is actually better but if we deem it to be better then we're going to go for it because you know if i if i want to be a drunk then and i i could pursue being a drunk because i deem that to be a great achievement in my life but that doesn't mean it's a great achievement it just means i relative to my circumstance i think it's a great achievement now now here why patience why this term called patience is because because you or we desire something better than what we currently have we desire that there is i'm gonna i'm here but i'm gonna be here and i'm gonna patiently work towards that that goal whatever it is that i think is better that's that's what this whole term of patience is but it it it takes up a big portion of life when you when you when you start to break it down right and you'll see what i mean okay so this scripture here is is james 5 7 and it says be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he hath received the early and later reign but ye als be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh now you might think that sounds like waiting but i want to show you that it doesn't mean he's just waiting around because he's had to make action to do his field right i want to show you this okay so what i said patience doesn't mean waiting we want to get that thought away from our mind that it just means i wait around okay patience is only patience when it is related to a specific certain outcome like like if someone is just waiting you say what are you waiting for nothing i'm just sitting here so then he's not sitting there patiently waiting because there's no outcome he's trying for he's just sitting there so it's like you're just sitting there but your patience has got to be based on a certain outcome that i'm after therefore my patience is going to pursue that right that's how this thing works and in the farmer's case the farmer is patiently waiting for something that he knows if he pursues on with it he will get it and this is where the greater term of patience comes in because he knows that a month two three months ago i planted seeds in that earth i dug the ground i planted seeds there is going to be something happening in this field and it is going to be better than what i had four months ago which was bare dirt in six months seven months i will be reaping some sunflower seeds and my his patience is not based on i i don't know if anything's gonna grow i've never been here before let's just wait and see it's based on the fact that i planted those seeds in the ground and each day i'm going to come out make sure they're watered i'm going to make sure that the weeds are out of the ground i'm going to look after it if if there's too much rain i'm going to drain the soil because i'm patiently laboring in my field because i believe that the outcome i'm going to get is better than the outcome that i've got now that that's patience so the the the right term for him would be the farmer patiently worked his field until he had ripped the harvest he didn't just go there and sit down he actually there was effort made and his patience was was the driving force to achieve the outcome that he desired to have was it was patience right because i'll show you this other example here of this now here's a guy here the farmer patiently sat and waited and looked at his field year after year hoping something would grow see that the word patience we're talking about wouldn't be applicable in this situation here because he has done nothing he doesn't know if anything's going to happen he's just hoping something's going to happen but he doesn't actually know see patience is not based on i on hope patience is based on a solid foundation of something is going to happen something's going to happen i know that it's going to happen that's why i see patients proves that you believe something's going to happen you can't have patience unless you know there's going to be an outcome like the farmer could patiently work his field because he knew there was going to be an outcome he wasn't hoping this guy here a better term for this one would be this right the farmer foolishly sat and waited and looked at his field year after year hoping something would happen because he didn't know that anything would happen so he just waited and chances are nothing will happen you'll keep getting what he's getting because so he wasn't patiently waiting he was foolishly waiting and there's a big difference in how we and this term called patience scripturally and how and the characteristic of patience that we should have as a believer and as i get onto it a bit you'll find that it's actually a part of our nature but it's a part of god's nature this thing called patience and it's very powerful and god's patience with us brings us from one place to another because he knows he's going to be a definite outcome he's sure so his patience works it till he gets the better outcome that he desires right we um i don't know if you can see this picture here but during the day we like to go around to houses and cut through water pipes in the bottom of houses and cause all this water to spray out all through the house right it's what we do for fun we're not supposed to do this but now and then we do we cut these pipes and the the water we're in certain jobs i don't know if any of the guys have worked for us and probably never done it but you you cut a main water pipe in a house that's under mains pressure you only need to knick this pipe like so small sort of like our carnival nature you know you just need to knick it a bit and out it comes you know it's high pressure under there you know you want to keep that thing subdued don't cut it don't let it out that's what this is like you know you do a tiny nick and man it's like you because it happens so suddenly you don't know what hit you man you're like whoa and all of a sudden the wood is spraying out and it the water doesn't care what's there like our carnal nature when it explodes it doesn't care what's there it just makes a big mess everywhere whether there's a dice tv in the corner there or whether there's a fridge or whether there's nice carpet this pipe and the the water in the pipe doesn't care it just goes man so so you wouldn't say in this situation the worker patiently sat and watched as the water flooded the house you know oh he's a very patient man he just sat and watched you'd get into action and you know turn the water mains off stop this water from blasting through the house because the outcome that it's happening you don't want so that's why you wouldn't say i patiently waited because i don't want all the water to spray through the house therefore i'm not patiently waiting i'm stopping this thing because i don't want that i patiently want to finish this job without making a big mess so see that's why i say this one here would be the worker foolishly sat and watched as the water flooded the house right that would be the right term if you're just sitting down doing nothing about getting this outcome okay so i'm going to read this to you again patience the ability to persevere towards a desired or better outcome regardless of the obstacle circumstances or cost and i'm going to say this again just to really drill it in why patients because we desire something better than what we currently have that's what this patience is the whole thing of it is for is to get us from one point to another to a better point that's the whole purpose of patience however in this situation here if for some reason we were trying to flood a house with water and that was our goal and we were searching around for a pipe we maybe worked for hours to try and find a pipe and suddenly we found him and we cut it would be so happy i found a pipe guys you can all rest up now we found it and we could then patiently sit and let the house fill up with water we've done it we high five we we enjoy we celebrate we've patiently achieved our goal you know we how it took us days maybe to to get here but we're here now we can now patiently sit back see patient this patients we're talking about is based on an out on a desired outcome not and it's not based on a negative outcome it's on the desired our desired outcome that we deem to be better than the circumstances that we've got now okay that's why i say here patience is only patience when it's related to a specific certain outcome that's why i say you can't sit on a chair and your goal is to sit on a chair well you don't have a goal you're just sitting on a chair doing nothing you can't say he's just patiently sitting because he's got it's not based on anything if he's patiently sitting with a fishing rod in his hand or her hand then he's patiently fishing because he's going to stay there fishing and he wants to get five fish and he'll stay there for months until he gets five fish see now he's patiently he's still doing the same thing except now he's got an objective so he's going to patiently work his objective regardless of whether it rains whether it's sun whether he gets hungry whether or not he's going to stay there and sit and keep fishing till he catches his five fish and once he's got his fly fish i'm done and that's what his patience is going to drive him to do it's and that's why i say this word here she patiently pursued her agenda right and here's the guy sitting on chairs unless there's a purpose it's not patience it has to have has to be related to a purpose and what you deem to be a better thing otherwise you don't we wouldn't that's why i say in the beginning like i lost my patience with my child well it's not really that's it's not really related to this term of patience you see now that's more just how you lost your you weren't temperate okay and that's why we come back to the scripture now and it says wherefore also seeing we can pass about was so great at cloud of witnesses let us laugh at every weight and the so much stuff easily beside us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us let us we're pursuing forward for this goal so we're going to run with patience we're not going to run and stop we're going to run with patience okay once again the the ability to persevere towards the desired or relatively better outcome regardless of the obstacle circumstances or cost now when you look into this you realize that patience is the critical component needed for success in anything is patience it's a critical component in any aspect of any achievements we're going to make is patience this ability to press on regardless of whatever the cost is and to achieve it that's if you don't have this component then chances are you won't succeed in much in life because you need this component right but when you look into it you realize there are two types of patients that are in existence there may be three but i didn't look into whether satan has patience or not and i kind of ran out of time i think he may have but he uses ours anyway but let's just go with this for now we'll leave the other one for another time but there is natural patience which is what we have a degree of is patience right and it's driven by your desire and my desire our patience is driven by our desires and also our natural patience is driven by satan's desires as well because he could put a desire in us and our natural patients will push forward towards his goal but there's also a godly patience so god has this thing called patience that exists it's not like a wishy-washy thing it's something that does exist a desire that he's pursuing forward for its godly patience and the thing with patience is it's not something that exists on its own it has to be driven by the desire of a person patients can't just do things it doesn't work like that it's linked to a person it's linked specifically to a person and specifically to a person's desires right like a drum kit can't have patience because no one is there to it's not achieving anything for anybody this patience is there to achieve things for us it's a it's like a servant so it has to be linked to a person that's why i say we have a degree of patience but god also has this thing called patience that's linked to his personality linked to his plan his desire right that's that's what this patient says it's it's not just on its own somewhere okay i'm going to show you this little example and then i'll show you some natural examples of patients but in this situation here i think this is relevant i think this works it worked once and it didn't work when i read it again then it worked when i read it after that so i think it's relevant it may more show someone's desire but still it in this situation here you had um jesus telling his disciples from that time forth um sorry i can't say that it's too small from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and to suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and to be killed and to be raised again in the third day so he's telling his disciples these are the negative things that are going to happen to me in the future sometime and then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from the lord this shall not be unto thee right so his patience his desire was for jesus to stay alive and be healthy do well you know that was his desire so now his patience hooked into his desire and he began to push forward and say lord this won't happen to you i'm going to be with you to protect you if this guy's going to come and try and get you i'm going to fight against them if the jews try and get you i'll let you know i'll i'll talk to my friends that are in the circles of the synagogues and that well i'll give you information if they're going to come and get you i'm going to look after you because this negative thing that you've told me about is not going to happen to you not as long as i'm around right and he he started having this desire to stop this thing from happening to him and a good desire right he was trying to look after his friend and his so there was him with with his desire to look after his friend then his patience is pushing that desire i'm going to stop this right now jesus also had patience right so he said but he turned unto peter and said get thee behind me satan for thou art an offence unto me for their saviours not the things that be of god but the things that be of men jesus had another desire which was to go and pay the price of for all of us and his patience was driving that desire and when he came face to face with another man that had when they i guess the two the two forces met and jesus said get behind me i'm going to press on with what i'm going to achieve see his patience was driving him right it was because the certain outcome was i'm going to pay this price i'm going to pay the price of death and i'm going to my outcome is going to be i'm going to save all you people you're going to be with me that's my goal and my patience is going to drive towards and if you try and stop me along along the way i'm going to push it back because i'm going to carry on see he was patiently pursuing his agenda right okay now i don't know if satan has patience i assume he may have patience i'm not sure we'll leave that but i know god has patience right okay but it doesn't matter whether because satan just uses our patients anyway to manifest his will on the earth he that's how he has to work so i'm just going with that he uses our one he can't work any other way anyway he needs us to work through that's how satan exists in this realm he you know in movies and things they portray as though these spiritual things come in and cause all the stuff and do things satan doesn't have the power to do that he can only work through us it's all made up stuff you know he doesn't have that ability not like what people think that he does okay but galatians 5 22 says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience now the reason why i wrote this one is is because if when we say a fruit of the spirit what we mean is a characteristic of this personality because because the spirit of god is a its person it's christ it's god and we get his personality in us and along with that personality come personality traits like we all have personality traits that are part of our character you know when we become a christian we try and god sort of subdues the old the bad ones and we keep the enhances the good characteristics you know so we he changes us but we all have characteristics now god has characteristics in his personality right one of those is love he's got this characteristic of love that exists it's not something that we make up it actually exists it's a force it's a so there is a godly love that when we get the spirit of god we get a portion of this godly love that that it drives itself it doesn't need us to try and work it up it drives itself that's why the more we surrender the more and let his life come through the more his his traits his personality can come through in our life so it's not that's why i say this morning like it's not us doing it it's surrendering and letting him his personality joy you know we don't have to work up joy i'm trying to be happy we just surrender to him and his joy exists without us being happy with us being happy or not right so patience is also a characteristic of god that's patience it's this ability to press forward to achieve a certain outcome now the patience of god always presses forward towards achieving the outcome of his word because that's his his word is what he said so that's his desire so that's what his patience is going to push forward for right and it's also in the statue of a perfect man and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience add to that so and it's that's one of the latter stages of our of the building of a christian right as patients because it's more than just like i sit and wait it's like i know everything's going to be all right i don't have to get flustered by it i don't have to get worried by it i've been through enough things that i know that i can patiently just press on regardless of what i see regardless of if it looks like it's going to go well bad whatever it is i can patiently press on in this walk i can run this race patiently i don't need to worry everything's going to be right there's seed in the ground it's going to grow i just keep doing this i keep doing that it's all going to work out all right i don't need to worry about it i can patiently press on regardless of what happens and that's why it's at the latter stage because that we learn that over time you know it's all going to be all right the lord's in control i can just patiently press on that's what gets added to our characteristic okay but let me go on this one for a little bit right let me go to natural patients now for a second natural patience is driven by the desire of a man woman or satan coming in us and driving us right now natural patients will always render success because that's a critical component for success but that doesn't mean that it's right okay let me give you some examples of this i don't know if you can read the writing at the bottom but here's guys in the 70s some of these guys camp out for days you know because i've just got a silly example here that like a big band pink floyd is going to release a new album and these guys i want to say i want that album and i want to be the first to get my hands on it they've got a limited supply at such and such a shop guys will go and see the tent up in the street you know because the outc the desired outcome is they want that album and their patience will will cause them to pursue this desired outcome they're going to sit there on the street they'll wait in the rain you know and when they finally get it they're like i've got this album i'm so happy there it was driven by their patience which was a desire they deemed it that when i get the album i'm going to be better than what i am now it's going to be a better outcome so so but just because they use their patients it doesn't mean that it didn't direct them in the right way right they got a pink fluid album so what waste of time see our natural our patients can drive us in the wrong direction and natural patients here's this one here he patiently taught him how to handle his alcohol till he could drink a dozen beers and not feel drunk you know this guy couldn't drink anything we need to nut but it took me about a year but we worked on it we worked on it now we can down 12 bottles and you know and man it was hard work teaching him and i had to be i patiently taught him you know he used his patience because he thought he deemed said this was relative the teacher deemed that it's going to be better and obviously the student did too that i can drink 12 beers and not feel it that's a better outcome for me so they were patiently pursuing the wrong direction just like peter was going to patiently pursue the wrong direction these guys here are too that's this is but you can call this success in their eyes i'm successful see that's why i say every degree of success requires patience but it's not always successful the success that we achieve the only success is surrendering our life to christ and letting his actual patience working his will patiently working his will to achieve his outcome that's real success in our life this is a bad one but this is true hitler patiently opposed the jews until he had slaughtered a great majority of them it took him a lot of effort to achieve that outcome he didn't just sit back and go well let's hope it happens he patiently pursued his plan they had meeting after meeting and all sorts of ideas and trying things to patiently pursue this agenda but the outcome was so negative but yet for them it was successful i succeeded we succeeded congratulations you know but there they patiently pursued their agenda they ran with patients a race set before them the race set before them was let's exterminate them so they they in their terms relatively speaking they were successful but we look on that and think that wasn't successful that was horrible okay i'm just going this way i'm just going to go so i'm just going slow through this okay god's patience right this is the reason why i showed you those things is because our own desire we can easily get our own patients that we have can easily drive us off on the wrong track we've what we actually need is god's patience because god's patience will only push his will god's patience won't push our will like it will only push his will because he deems if if the lord has a certain objective then his patience is going to push his own objective it's not going to he doesn't come down and push our objective he pushes his own objective because it's patience is linked to a person's objective right so what we want to do firstly we want to see what what is god's objective for us and i like this scripture here i've got two when i've gone through these i've gotten a few different versions because sometimes our my english is not that great so i find reading a few other ones sometimes to get the essence of it i failed in english but for this very reason i was shown mercy so that in me the worst of sin is christ jesus might display his perfect patience as an example to those who would believe in him for eternal life see i'll read it from the king james underneath how bad for this cause i obtain mercy that and me first jesus christ might show forth all long-suffering but it's the same word patience in the greek it's the word they just switch it around now and then but it's it actually means patience for a pattern to them who should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting so now when paul is speaking about perfect patience what he's saying is god saw me and he had a desire that i would be in a better place than what i am was at that point he had an objective he looked at me with an objective i've got an objective to get him from there to there currently he's all over the place but i've got an objective and i'm going to start my work and pursue that patiently pursue that objective till paul comes from a unworthy sinner to a saint and filled with the spirit of god and walking in the joy of the lord that was god's objective so and paul is saying can't you see the patience of the lord how that how that he there was it was a driving force which was his patience his driving force came and got me and brought me from this to that that was the patience of god that's why he says his that christ jesus might display his perfect patience as an example to show you look if he can do this for me if if that patience he has that driving force to patiently pursue his agenda can win me over then it can win you over as well that's that's what he's saying or despise the sound of the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering knowing that the goodness of god leadeth it to repentance and once again the same word or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness forbearance and patience not realizing that god's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance now the reason why you can link it to long suffering to away and that word is because that means regardless of what how you're acting i'm not going to give up i'm not just going to give up on the process of bringing you to there today from here to here even if you're not acting very good and you seemingly are going against my purpose and my outcome i'm not just going to give up i'm not just going to go oh well we tried no my patience is it doesn't patience doesn't have an end point it just carries on and perfect patience pursues to get the outcome regardless of what the circumstance might be it's going to pursue it but perfect patience knows that the outcome is achievable and it is going to get it period that's what perfect patience does and god has perfect patience and his outcomes are always going to be achieved period right now i'm going to read you some scriptures based on those i'm just going to read through this because when you think of the word now when you start to read these scriptures the word takes on a different meaning right now this is now patience towards each other in a godly sense with all long suffering and meekness with all loneliness and meekness with long suffering for bearing one another in love or there's another one always be humble and gentle be patient with each other making allowance for each other's faults because of your love now now when you look at this in that light with the term of being patient with each other you can understand that god's how would i describe it like my desire for you my godly desire for you is that you would be better than what you are now and i know that god is able to get you let's say i'm upset with you for some reason but my but if i tap into god's desire it is that you would be from here to here you would be better therefore my my patience towards you should be based on is a driving force i can i can ride through the storm i can ride through all your carnal things and my kind of things because we know that the outcome we're going to achieve is better than what it is now so i can patiently endure with whatever i need to with the brethren in this case you know i can be patient with you because there's this driving force that knows the outcome is going to be better than what it currently is therefore i don't have to get frustrated or why do they keep doing that no no at some point they won't do that at some point that will stop because there's a because god's remember if i tap into as a christian we don't have our own our own patience now and our objective is based on the word of god and on his objective therefore we come into that channel and that's what it's talking about here with be patient with each other not i'll be patient while he learns how to drink more it's not based on that it's based on god's objective this here is based on god's objective that we each other are going to come into the statue of a perfect man so it's saying that that's so tap into god's objective what his objective is for each one of us and patiently pursue that let god's patience come through us and pursue that objective in each other that's what that's what this is related to specifically to god's purpose okay being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you might have full endurance and patience and joyfully i'll read you this other one strengthen with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and long suffering with joyfulness you think why would it say you're strengthened and you're getting powerful and everything's moving on and that saves with patience because this thing called patience knows that regardless of what happens then as a as i get stronger i understand that regardless of what happens i'm pressing on towards the goal of of in this case receiving more of christ in me i'm pressing on with that my patience is going to press on with it that's why it says be strengthened unto all patients you understand this quote it's yep therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved close yourselves with hearts of compassion kindness humility gentleness and patience have that as a part of you now now that you when we understand that this idea of patience then when we read the things that paul talks about we can understand more why he is saying it he says truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you and all patience and signs and wonders and in mighty deeds or this one here was explains it the way that we would when i was with you i certainly gave you proof that i am an apostle for i patiently did many signs and wonders among you so he's saying i was with you and i had this objective that christ might be displayed to you because that was the call and god said go the lord will tell paul go there and display me to those people right so that was paula tapped into god's objective for the corinthians when he was there my that's my objective he wasn't there i want to go there and make a million dollars it wasn't as objective as if he was there from the lord he was following the lord's objective and he patiently pursued that objective which he says lord uh he woke up we'll wake up every day and think lord um where do you want me to go today who should i speak to what shall i say you know and situations will come should i pray for that person as this can happen and he he patiently wrought the agenda of the lord not by sitting back doing nothing but press forward every day and for a patient he did many signs and monies and miracles among you i was i knew there was going to be a better outcome than what there currently was so i patiently pursued it day after day after day after day after day until we get a better outcome which is now you're all you've seen the signs you've seen the wonders you're believers you're walking with the lord it's a lot better now than what it was when i first turned up because i patiently pursued the agenda of god but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god so now you want to be a minister and much patience and this ability to press on regardless of what might happen whether it's good whether it's bad as a minister someone that wants to administer the grace of god you've got to have the single patience otherwise when it gets tough what are you going to do run away fail i don't mean fail like but i do mean fail because patience won't let us fail because it will say look even though it looks bleak i'm going to carry on you know but it's all falling apart no it hasn't i'm going to press on because satan's going to be trying our patience do they mean it he's going to be at us and much patience and afflictions and necessities in distresses you want to be a minister you need patience you need this ability to press on the agenda of god regardless of the circumstances take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy he wasn't patiently waiting for his boils to get worse he knew that there was going to be a better outcome than what he had currently so he patiently he was patiently waiting on the salvation of the lord he wasn't just sitting there but he was he said no it's going to be alright folks his friends were coming up saying oh it's because you've done this you've done that no i haven't it's just the lord trying me but everything's going to be all right he could patiently press on and his patience got him an outcome if he had given up said i'm done with this the lord he failed me i'm off then he had no patience right but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it another one same similar but if we hope for what we do not yet have we wait for it patiently see this is waiting patiently for it because i know there's going to be an outcome i'm not just waiting for nothing i know there's going to be an outcome therefore my patience this critical component is going to continue to wait because i'm going to get this i'm not just aimlessly doing this this is based on specific factual information god is going to deliver me it's fact and i'm just going to patiently pursue any care if the circumstances appear like against this the desire that i have god is going to deliver i'm going to patiently pursue this every single day that might mean i sit might mean iran might mean i walk i mean i do whatever i do but i've got the single patience that's pursuing it daily that's what patience is to them who by patient continuance and well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality eternal life patient continuance he just i'm going on and just continuing on this walk because that's that's the the patience of god is in me god's patience right rejoicing in hope patient and tribulation continuing instant in prayer as soon as you read the word patience now if you want to go through your bible it's all through the bible and anyone that ever got anywhere had to have patience that's a critical component it's basically the back that's why i say it's the backbone of our christian walk is patience and that's why i say you know if you want to be an elder in a church the critical component is he a very patient person do they have the ability to stand and haven't done all to stand because if they if they don't have that critical component don't let them in they need to have this patience that you know it's nice to see brethren that are real believers that when things happen they just it's as though nothing's happening don't you realize all these things are going on that's all right it's a problem that's patience i'm going to go through a few of these i want to show you why i wrote this now and then i'm about to close after this patience proves patience persists in patients pays i want to show you why whoops why i coined that phrase here patience proves the reason why i wrote proves is because patience proves you know what the outcome will be and that you're acting on that right it the fact you've got patience shows that it's linked to some outcome you believe is achievable it proves like if you don't have patience then it means you don't think it's achievable you don't have patience for it so if if you're just if you're desiring something that even though it's not there and if you've got this patient desire in your heart for it that proves you actually believe it's attainable and you're going to get it otherwise you wouldn't have patience for it because the job of patience is to achieve that right this characteristic so that's why i say patience proves it proves that you know what the outcome will be like but this farmer here he he didn't mind patiently working on a field because he knew eventually he would reap the harvest he wasn't just aimlessly doing it like let's see if this works he was patiently pursuing it so and his actions proved that he knew he was going to get it because he patiently pursued it right so patience proves that we know we're going to get this thing and in any situation once you get the word of the lord on it it doesn't matter what it might look like once you get that patience that proves that it's going to be all right the outcome is going to be right it proves it i've just got i can just have patience now i can just it doesn't mean i stop it just means i've got patience i keep pressing on but i stop if you know what i mean like i i can rest up it's all going to be right but i'm pressing on it's sort of more what patience means now and now the job of patients is that it persists regardless of what the obstacles or resistance might be because once you get this thing called patience it just keeps going it doesn't it doesn't stop and say oh it's too hard it patience doesn't have that characteristic and it patience just pursues on through anything it doesn't it doesn't stop it actually doesn't stop it doesn't have a let's turn around no that's that's getting rid of patients patience doesn't turn around patients move forward all the time towards the objective it doesn't it's like the the the um the armor of the lord you know there's no protection on our back because we're not designed to turn around and go backwards it's probably the same as patience you know patience is designed to go one way and that's forward to achieve whatever it is it's trying to achieve in any particular way that's the that's that's patience and if you've got patience that's what you're going to do you're going to keep pressing on through anything because you've got patience everything's going wrong doesn't matter i've got patience i'm going to press on right that's that's the way patience is i'm going to take you through a few examples this is not the picture of the man but i the example of a few examples i thought of was the man that brother brown who said you know you're you're he was blind he went through the line and brought around and prayed for him and they said okay go now and you'll be well you know so he walked the other out the line and maybe off the stage and he was still blind he thought something's not right here the guy out there said i was going to be that i was well but i can't see you know there's something wrong here better i'll make my way back and i'll go through the line again just to figure out you know how i think you did you make a mistake or what's the story here i just need some clarification on what my you know on my stand so it goes back through and they says i was came through the line before and you said you know i was going to be well and everything was going to be fine but i'm still blind and i think brother brown said so what did you get told i got told i was going to be right everything's going to be well well then go on then everything's going to be right you're going to be well just go on your way rejoicing so now at some point patience clicked and he realized actually yes i'm going to be well now now he could patiently pursue that agenda of i'm going to be able to see at some point that's it so then this patience he received i'm going to say he received the patience of god he just something anchored in him okay then everything's all right then let's do this he may have been sitting down here but he was patiently pursuing the word of god that was promised to him he was patiently pursuing it sometimes he would sit and wait sometimes he would tell others praise the lord did you hear that i'm i've i was blind now i can see if you heard all about it you know this is the greatest news ever and you're still blind our patience it doesn't always sit down sometimes it presses on sometimes it sits down it does it doesn't matter what it does it's achieving some objective it doesn't matter how it achieves it it's just going to press on and achieve it and he he so he patiently pursued on towards his objective which was i'm going to see the promise of god come to pass in my life that i was given that i'm going to be made well so what do you think eventually happens to this man it gets made well because patience pays it will achieve its outcome that it's desiring for it doesn't it will keep going until it achieves it the minute it achieves it then it will stop okay the patience has achieved this that's what it does by long forbearing i'll do the one here through patience a ruler can be persuaded and a gentle tongue can break the bone i like that one through patience just keep at it or that other one says by long forbearing as a prince persuaded you know this is this may be a natural example but it shows you that this thing called patience you can just keep pushing and this thing called patience will eventually persuade a king i write that in here because this reminds me of this one you know you know the story about the woman that she felt like she was and things had been unjustly done towards her i'll just paraphrase it and she felt like what happened to me was not good and i need to go and see the judge and tell him about what happened because when i lay out my facts before him he'll realize yes you were wronged and then i'll you know however i was wrong you'll you'll pass your judgment and i'll get justice but the judge wasn't interested in hearing a case because he was a corrupt judge he was like not saying the laws but you know he he was probably too busy spending his money that he being paid being a judge and going doing other things not really doing his job which is what a lot of you know people as they get more status they start to not do their job they they enjoy the fruits of it anyway so but she was patiently pursuing her agenda which was i want justice now the bible said that even though the the judge here was unjust he didn't really care about you he just got sick of her pursuing it so eventually he said okay what do you want just give her what she wants i'm tired of this person pursuing me she's wearing me down give her what she wants now that's not to say the laws of that but that but the lord uses as an example this is what patients when we patiently pursue something this is what it will do we'll just keep on going keep on going keep on going it doesn't just give up she had patience she knew i'm going to achieve this outcome eventually i'm going to get justice so she had just this patience in her just kept on pursuing her agenda which was i want justice eventually she got it because of her she patiently endured for it another one here which was the woman that had the daughter and the other and and she went to the lord and all the time the disciples were like i go away she's just trying to get and she's trying to um jump the cue you know get back get back and they were pushing her back and eventually they got to jesus and said oh there's this woman she's always she's trying to you know she's she's actually been a bit of a pain she's trying to come up and see us it reminds me of the story of brother branham with the the woman that had the dead baby you know and she was at some point during the day of the day before she got this the patience of gods anchored in her heart and she thought i've got to get this baby to that man to pray if i get him to that man to pray then he'll come back my baby will come back to life something anchored in here and she was she didn't patiently pursue her agenda she aggressively pursued her agenda she was god had this dead baby running through the crowds and causing all this fuss you can imagine maybe there was a big crowd and brother brown was preaching and over in this corner there was all this commotion of all these people and they're trying to hold this woman back and she's throwing these guys away and throwing this one away and maybe these brothers feel a bit bad grabbing on to this woman so they're kind of like trying to stop her but they're not sure she knows that she's he's exploiting the situation these christian brothers aren't going to wrestle me to the ground they're christians if i just be aggressive enough they'll get out the way and even to where brother brown said look she doesn't really and that word got back to him and he actually said look she doesn't really know who i am just why don't you guys go down and pray for her you know i'll just carry on you know because just as a natural solution to the situation because he had to keep on preaching he said just just don't pray for her she don't know it's not me you know not tell her lies but you know but you know her patience was greater than that because it was the godly patience there was a god god's patience actually come into her and and it had to eventually move brother branham you know because then then they tried to do that but she was she wasn't going to have that she still kept on coming on and then a vision broke out and brother brown saw this woman with a baby she said well hang on hang on her patience has actually had actually caused the vision to come on and something more to happen above the situation said hang on hang on where's that lady where's that lady with the baby i just saw a vision of a lady with a baby and a baby coming back to like where is she patience has made it made it all the way through it had just pressed on and made it it wasn't because she pushed them in away it was because she believed and that patience she anchored in and she just patiently pursued that but it was god's agenda and it just it made its way through to the gates of heaven and the doors opened up and said yep let this promising you know let it in and and let the spirit go go out and and fulfill the promise fulfill the desire that she has you know so it came down and then what happened patience pays her baby came back to life it also means other things but peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet will not i he now we think well i thought patience just means i get a good thing but in the end peter peter's in sorry to change it so drastically but peter's end of his ministry was hung upside down and crucified but he had an agenda to see the word of god go forth come want me and hey he would have thought the most to himself i gotta i've got to go out sooner or later hey why not go out in a blaze of glory why not you know that his patience he endured all sorts of things and at the end it endured through this i was reading last night guys that were got the electric chair you know they would when they were they would be sentenced to death or something and they would they were saying about how the electric chair didn't really work sometimes they would sometimes take 30 seconds or a minute for the person to die and very gruesome i don't know how people can have a death penalty still it's just how can someone condemn another person to death i don't care what the person's done that's not how man wasn't given that jurisdiction to kill another man it's barbaric any country that does it is barbaric lock him up and pay for him fine yeah let's pay who cares oh he's going to cost a hundred thousand 200 000 i don't care pay the money we can't just kill people we don't we we can't i'm another man they're a man and woman we can't kill them it's not how it works just put that out there i just when you read about you think do we still kill people we think it's right i'm going to kill you it's never right but anyway i had this electric chair and they they said it's funny you know most people this one guy that was a serial killer you know he was all sort of thought he was arrogant and everything in the when he was in court and everyone was paying attention to him he was all arrogant and that you know but when the time came to walk the path from the the prison to the electric chair then he all felt he fell apart because he knew this was the end you know and he and they did say that a lot of people when they're at that phase they stay out they break down they can't handle it they said even a lot of them they they give them drugs like these days inject them with sedatives and that to so they won't worry so they can not be hysterical when they're going to to their end you know that's a man that's going to the room with no patience but peter had patience lord i'm gonna i'm gonna patiently pursue through this if this if this is the agenda then this is where we're going and then he even said look hang me upside down the lord was hung this way hang me upside down that's why they flipped them around see but that was he had an agenda the patience is a very powerful thing a very powerful it's it's a driving force of our christian walk to pursue the agenda of the lord regardless of what the circumstance now this is my last one patience pays you the outcome you're patiently waiting for yes so i say patience proves that you believe it patience persists in patients pace coin that phrase that's the truth but i wanted to just change it more to be like this you know because i don't want to make it like it's a natural you know 10 steps to achieving things this is not what this is about we need god's patience that the patience that's associated with the spirit of god like that that is him we get that patience it's that patience that proves you know it's that patience that persists it's that patience that pays god never does anything hit and miss he never he never tries something at all that didn't work we often as men and women have schemes and we try to scheme and it completely fails we're like whoops didn't realize this would happen and we fail god doesn't have schemes and plans that he goes out to try and achieve and it fails all his plans work so what we need is to surrender to his spirit and to get his his patience lord put give me your patience and that's linked to his will and to his word and then let me pursue that let that patience come in me and let that be the driving force of my life that i'm patiently pursuing your will let that be the driving force of my life i've got one more testimony then i'm going to close on this here just because i think it may it may or may not be an encouragement but this is what happened excuse me when i was getting to if you it if you know me you know i've got this my young fellow that i that we have a uh interesting dynamic between us right he's he's um like i really love him he's a he's a nice guy but it's been in the most interesting interesting but eye-opening experience i never knew the effects of satan's the effects that satan's lives can have on a person's life until i watched this thing unfold like and i suppose i could say like this because from a young person i've always had a desire to serve the lord so i've always in a general sense let the word of god govern my mind even though when i wasn't fully serving him i still let the word of god govern my my actions so i didn't do anything drastically too bad because i still had this i was brought up a christian but also i had a desire to have this word of god in my mind and that was enough to keep me out of a lot of trouble because the word of god is truth and it will actually lead us the right direction in life to be successful right you don't even have to be saved to live a successful life based on the word of god you can actually that's why they say if you just even if god doesn't exist if you just supply the godly principles to your life and live like that you'll have a better life anyway so you're you're scientifically speaking you're theoretically better just to be a christian whether it's true or not that's what they worked out you know because the outcome is better anyway then if you don't do it so no i'm not saying it's not true what i'm saying so you so you can live your life like i live my life growing up and i i kind of stayed out of a lot of trouble because i would still have this word of god governing me when i was going to do something about i think no hang on the word of god would say to do that so i'd veer away from that and go this way right that's that's how i would and a lot of things i got out of by the grace that's only the grace of god but so i was naive a bit to the power that satan's lies have to govern somebody's life and to direct their life in a certain way and to steal someone and to lead them on a path that they actually don't really want to go but if you lie to someone enough and they're convinced and they believe a lie they will go on a certain path believing a lie and their whole objective and everything within them will go on that path but it's based on a lie very powerful i never realized the power that lies have until i watch this unfold i'm like well because but i know eventually one day those lies will be revealed and you will see that you were being told lies and that your actions you acted on these lies and that's what brought you to that path because that's all it is that's how satan works by telling us lies that's how you if you look back on your own life all of your times you've gone astray has been based on a lie you've been told or you've followed a certain direction see if we always follow the word of god we won't get into that situation every one of you could look back on in your life and realize that right so these these lies are very powerful things but they but it causes a lot of trouble you know in someone where it just it causes no end to trouble and i'm part um irish i'm basically irish and part maori so my my um my natural way of dealing with things if i cut my little pipe you know i get mad i'm just like yeah you know it took me a long time to not be mad you know but that's that's that's my natural my natural carnal man just gets angry and i just it's all on man thanks thankfully for the grace of god you know his temperance comes in but that's that's how that's my natural my father was in like biking gangs and stuff that's sort of the we come from a very good lineage you know so let's just say there's been this this we have a colorful relationship david and i you know very colorful because i'm venomously opposed to what he's doing and he vehemently wants to go that way and we vehemently disagree with each other and we get mad you know so um and it's it's created so many so much interesting thoughts in my mind you know now i've it's taken me a while to realize to actually come before the lord and say lord i've just completely failed and i cannot achieve a good outcome in this because up until that point too you think so far in life i've done pretty well i've managed to maneuver things the right way and i'm doing pretty good and things are going all right so i can probably do this one too and it was the first time in my life that i said lord i actually completely felt and i do not have any answers to achieve the outcome that i want i do not have any answers at all i'm just this is a it was a very good place to be because you realize i'm completely i i do not have any ability to achieve a good outcome here i'm just i'm totally done i've pulled out all the tricks you know i've done every trick in the book you know my trick bag is empty and the result is still negative i've completely failed and i do not have the answers to achieve this great place to be because that's when god can start to work you know and then great great lessons to learn because then you start applying it to other things you think well i'll just let's just let's just take that step from the start let's not take a long time to get there in situations let's just start in that situation lord i don't know you do the situation we can apply that to anywhere in our life you know but that was where i got to in that situation and but you know this this the lord's been dealing with this you know i'm i'm you get to a point where you know actually lord is going to be all right and you surrender it all and you know that you start to have this this page this but i didn't know it's patience but something builds up and he was over the other day he usually comes over to get food you know he runs out of money but he didn't he did eat heaps of food but he reckoned he didn't come around for food he came around say hello so but have food in the process and about a 20 minute shower probably didn't shower for four days no hot water where is that no he's alright so he was there and i actually had gone out and i come back and he was still there and i know shannon had a nice time with him just talking and and um i found out afterwards some things that she said but you know i can i sort of have a i have a cutoff point i shouldn't say this but i'm being honest i have a cut-off point with my interactions with him because it's like okay i'm to leave now and like just let you chill because i'm probably going to burst the main because i get frustrated i'm like i'm going to great to see you bro i'm going to go back and i've got a bit of stuff to do actually at a sermon to get rid i've got to get a sermon ready bro you know good to see you man i actually meant it but i shouldn't say it like that is that all right okay that's bad i regulate it you know because someone close to you easily like i wouldn't pop with you guys because i'm not as close to you but i pop easily with people that are closest to me so it's a good challenge but now i've learned okay when i start to get a bit i just hey man good to see you i'm out so i went back and then but i also wanted him to catch up with shannon for a bit and just talk you know because he was in quite a nice mood and um yeah and then i hadn't actually got this sort together but i just typed that word up on the this word here right on the my computer because i just had this little thought brewing and and he was about to leave and he he yells out from the where the doors are see you later dad was like and something in me thought go and see him because i was going to ask this guy yeah but something i felt okay go and see him and now if you know david he doesn't really like too much he's a bit like i don't do it he doesn't like any too sentimental you know but although he does but he wants to prove he doesn't so i was there and i walked out and somebody said to me give him a hug tell him you love him you know and he was he was there and i waited for him to do a shoe laces up and i said hey and i meant this i said hey it's good to see you bro i said come give me a hug and he's like yeah i gave him a hug i said i love you man he said i love you too dad and then i just saw in the corner of his eyes you know was sort of like real quick you know because he's got tears in his eyes you know but i kind of did too you know but any shot out the door see you bro so it was most interesting feeling because you know it was led by the spirit of god and there was things happening it was a powerful moment right and then i got to sit down on my computer and i look at the screen and it says this patience yeah i think yep this is going to happen no this i'm going to patiently pursue this because it's the promise of god this is going to happen and it felt like it all came alive and i found out afterwards that that because david when he was young used to randomly say to us all the time i love you've run in this car i love you guys you know just randomly and she actually said that to shane in the lounge i love you mom just out of the blue but you know i know that god has an agenda for him and it's not what i can see it's not god's agenda but it may be part of his plan right so i think i'm going to patiently pursue that agenda regardless of what we might see praise the lord thank you for um allowing me to share this little thought um with you all this morning i hope it's been a blessing to you and you can um patiently pursue the promises amen amen let's um let's just stand and sing a few songs this morning let's sing um they that wade upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint teach me lord teach me lord to wait i'm going to sing um two songs and

for me to have seen brothers like brother isaac grow up just to see god working in people's lives you know as we get older and and have different roles like pastors satan will try us even we want spirit thicker than blood it can be hard we just want the best for each one of us to see us grow more to be like jesus christ [Music] it's my desire you know last night we came down from tauranga and

he's got the car to fix the fix the um the windscreen so we couldn't have been going to a better place um and um you know just listening to isaac we must be born again jesus said you must be born again then your patience is going to be directed towards being more like jesus christ we can have patience towards things of self and i've had them over the years but as you get older [Music] i just thank the patience of god towards me [Music] and i just pray for each one of you here now and i pray you know i heard this testament i heard it before but corey team boone when she was in the concentration camp they were in a camp and it had fleas and she couldn't it's just the bets he was saying thank god and all things give thanks and she said i can't thank god for these fleas and you know the the guards wouldn't come in there in their heart because of the fleece so she could read the bible so if god knows about the fleece how much more he knows everything about you everything john everything amen and he loves us and so i just pray heavenly father in the wonderful name of jesus christ i just thank you for the perseverance the patience to come here today to hear what was preached you know the songs we sung i've been trying to learn those songs during the week i keep getting magic and promises round the wrong way but it doesn't matter because your promises are true you just

patient and present to the things that please you and as i said that's why you said we must be born again so bless the fellowship here you know each one of us has different situations in our life each has different challenges but you're god you're the creator of heaven and earth nothing is too hard to you lord and you want the best for each one of us so i just want to say i love you lord i thank
