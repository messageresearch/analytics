amen praise the Lord well it's just really a real privilege for me to be standing here in your midst and be preaching for brother Bend this evening and it's just been a real treat to get to know the brothers and see everybody tonight but you know we haven't come really to see one another we've come to see a living dawn now Charles you've come expecting to just look beyond this little frail vessel here tonight a man come expecting to see a living Dawn's amen you believe that he said wherever two or three are gathered there I am in their midst amen and I believe that tonight amen otherwise why what if why would I be standing here if I did not believe that there's a Living God you can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities that can heal that can save Amen that can inspire and encourage us tonight amen hallelujah amen I trust you become expecting like that this evening and I just want to greet you on the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ my name is brother Chris if you don't know that already and come from a church there in Vancouver areas living word fellowship amen but we're just another extension of the family that's here amen oh praise the Lord how many is hungry tonight amen let's go to the word at this time I want to thank the songs and the song leader tonight it was just a wonderful atmosphere and we just appreciate those things how many appreciates all the gifts amen all the gifts in the body ain't man what would we do without all those things all the sound guys the video the slides and you know all these things just to create an atmosphere where we can enter in and we can be comfortable and you know we want to appreciate those things you know back home the church there they they they can't meet right now we're not allowed to gather as an assembly they've blocked all those things and you know so now we have to we preach a little service too to an empty church and then we archive the service you know so let's appreciate these things while we have it and then we have an opportunity tonight to be gathered together like this and enjoy the word and enjoy live ministry and be sitting under under a voice and these things and let's appreciate it while we have it any men so to me it's just a real special to be speaking to you like this this evening Amen that's turned on in our Bibles book of Matthew chapter 5 book of Matthew chapter 5 and we're going to be speaking tonight on the covenant of salt and I trust it'll just be a real blessing to you that it will encourage you and give you strength for the journey ahead and we just ask that the Lord would just bless it amen well you find your places I'll acid you just bow your heads with me just at this time and if you ever need this evening I want to encourage you to just let the Lord know and just just in your hearts and in your minds just raise that needs of the Lord and say Lord I have this specific need ask him for something specific tonight and just say Lord I want I want you to just meet this need for me tonight just give me something in my heart that I know that you heard my prayer this evening amen and we don't have to leave the same way we came in Amen so just lift that need the way you feel to the Lord this evening and we'll just present it to him as we bow our heads precious heavenly father as we humble ourselves before you now we look into your word Lord God you inspired these words Lord for a reason so they would bring forth fruit in its season father and this evening we're looking to your word Lord that it would bring forth life Lord and bring forth power they would encourage us Lord as we stand against the floods that have been opened up Lord and we know that your word raises the standard Lord so we look to your words tonight Lord that you would raise the standard in our lives raise the standard in our hearts that you would make us overcomers of this day Lord we know that we are more than able Lord because of who is in us tonight father the Lord you saw the hands and the hearts that were raised before you tonight that he would speak to that need tonight Lord that you would just have full preeminence tonight notice we want to lay aside our thoughts in our in our feelings and our emotions oh god we want to have an audience with you tonight Lord we want the channel to be open Lord God so we ask that you would come Lord that you would have preeminence take the reigns this evening father let your Holy spirt have control in this service and Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen Matthew five and I want to go just a little bit before that you can leave the verse up on the screen there but let's start over here in verse 11 I was just so blessed by by this verse here verse 11 reads like this says blessed are ye Amen we'll take that tonight blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you and I believe we stand in that scripture amen and then it says here as we see on the screen verse 13 you are the salt of the earth not you might be Amen it says that you are the salt of the earth for if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under the foot of men and again notice that this statement that the Holy Spirit's making here it says you are the light of the world amen and tonight we just take that by faith right a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid any man we just want to thank the Lord for the reading of the word tonight you may be seated neither do no men in verse 15 goes on neither do no man do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick Amen like the the candlesticks in the tabernacle right to be lit for a reason to shine and to manifest something amen and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven I mean I believe the Lord's trying to say something to us and I believe you know we've come a long ways in the message you know we have we have heard all the sermons preached we've seen all the signs we've seen the miracles my brother and sister but tonight we're sitting here in 20 and 20 in it and and in my mind I want it I want us to go back and say Lord what was your intended purpose and sending us your word what was what was the purpose what was your heart's desire in giving us an open book amen showing us our names in the last book of life and you know these things are great my brother system we can explain histories and we can talk about the doctrines and all these things but there was an underlying purpose in all these things there's a reason why God sent us a prophet in our day there's a reason why he pointed our hearts back to the original word amen because there's to be a salt amen now I'm a simple kind of preacher so I like to find the word and find it there's a power in its simplicity amen I like something that I can take home and apply in my life amen so but I want you to have your spiritual thinking caps on you know we're taking a lot of messages and putting them together like crisis as a mystery of God revealed and these things you know and and but I want you to think of it from this angle tonight what is salt most of us had dinner before coming to the service amen I trust in the end you feel you feel good and you had a nice meal but you know it's it's something if you if you have a nice steak or you have some pasta or whatever you may have eaten tonight and you know it just doesn't have enough salt right you know that that meal it's just not exactly the way it could be right it's not at its full potential right let's say the chef completely forgot to put salt on your meal right you know it's just no good right it's not the same experience right and you know don't you know it's okay right we can just be honest tonight right we're human right we like things to taste good and and you know when we smell it it has a certain smell to it and and the room fills with a certain aroma and you know we start eating on that steak and man it's just you know that chef really knows how to apply the salt and you know it's just perfect right the seasoning and you know it's good right then we enjoy our meal and you know and I believe that's what the Bible is saying here he's saying you are the salt what is what is it Lord telling us tonight my brother and sister you are the salt amen you are the light now think about the things going on in the world there's an assault against the things that we loved and hold dear in our hearts there's an assault against our families amen come on it I hope it's not just in Canada right you know there's an assault against the Word of God there's an assault against our health there's an assault against our marriages amen and then the Bible turns around says but you are the salt of the earth amen you are you are the light of the world if you ever read what the Bible says about Mount Zion who we are right he says we are the joy of the whole world you know and then we message believers you know we walk around and praise the Lord I'm a message believer and you know nobody talked to me and our children are scared to go to high school or public schools you know and we're scared to go to the malls you know because of the influence is out there but we are the salt we are the light have you ever you know walked into a dark room if nobody here has done that right walk into a dark room and turn the light switch on how much power does that darkness have over the light huh is there a wrestling match going on between the light and the darkness know that light flees in the presence of light and that's I don't want us to start recognizing like the Prophet said when the bride sees when she knows who she is a meant that we we hold the pure word we've been restored to the original faith a man with a living God my brother sister is living inside of on me greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world salt you know just maybe give it a little bit of black background here salt is a very important part of our lives okay now we in the modern world we live in you know we take these things for granted so let me just show you a couple of things here but salt is very important you know that you cannot have life on this earth without salt you cannot have life on this planet without salt you know that the annual global production of salt is around two hundred million tonnes every year every year 200 million tons of salt is made you know that people used used it for canning and artificial refrigeration to preserve food for the last hundred or so years salt has been the best-known food preservative I want us to just log these little things back in our minds right salt has been the best-known food preservative just remember that right you are the salt of the earth right salt has been the best-known food preserve preservative especially for meat right and for many thousands of years right it's a preserver of food it's used to keep food from corrupting from going bad right you are the salt right we are what keeps the word from going corrupt amen okay it's also used to season food amen what is what does that mean to season food right is to enhance the flavor to enhance the flavor you are the salt of the earth right we are here to enhance the flavor you know my brother and sister this message that we have is a light to this world we need to start looking at it in the right from the right angle hey man it's not something to be hidden or something to shy away from as we've seen you know people criticize it and come against it don't worry about those things that you know that's all meant to be there that has to be there for us to have the right flavor amen for it to bring forth the right character and the right light all those things have to be you know let the word be fulfilled my brother and sister don't shy away from those things but don't forget right we are the salt what we have amen enhances the flavor amen that can you imagine not having the salt man isn't it amazing you know you know and I said it many times you know I don't know where it would go without this message where else would I go what denomination could I possibly sit in right where that food has been enhanced with that kind of flavor where the stimulation and the dynamics are there and the power of the word can strike a seat in the heart they met and bring something to life [Music] in other words salt is used to influence other things you the Bible is telling us you are the influencer not the enemy amen think about that for a moment so our kids going to school right we going into the workplaces right we don't walk in there and go hope nobody sees that I'm a Christian no we are the influencer and then we have we have Dominion and power we have authority we have the headship of Christ in our lives amen we don't have to back down from anything my brother and sister we have faith Amen that it can overcome any circumstance think about it tonight I want you to go to work tomorrow a different person amen go driving down the street a different person Amen I'm the salt of the earth let me influence somebody today amen let me enhance somebody else's life let me let me encourage somebody today let my light shine Lord amen salt has power power to keep power to maintain you know God says that I will maintain their cause if God maintains something I mean it's it's maintained amen but he said salt is is a power to keep something it's to maintain something it's to preserve yeah amen think about what we are my brother and sister amen you know we're the Bride of Christ right we are the maintain right we are to preserve we are to enhance we've got a job to do you know don't look back to the prophet and Wow look at the Prophet and look at the Prophet and look at the Prophet no he was the wave sheaf Amen he was there to show us what the rest of the harvest was gonna look like amen it has the power to influence oh I love that but now notice salt the only way it really has power over anything is if it comes in contact with it it has to come in contact amen we don't just live a sheltered little life and you know we do our own little things no to have an effect right to be the salt to really have an effect to have an impact right you've got to come in contact with something else you got a have you got you can have meat sitting on the table right and he can have the salt sitting over there and you can talk about the meet write the word and you can talk about the the holy ghost writing talking about the salt and those things in the dynamics you can talk about the mechanics over here but until those two come together they really mean nothing word without power right weird without the demon dynamics right you gotta have both both those things have got to come in contact so they can influence and have an effect upon one another let God have an impact of my life let God let the Holy Ghost salt amen have an influence in my life there's an interesting scripture and it's not on the screen I'll just read it out to you it's in second Kings two and nineteen and we know the who Elisha types but notice this here that the men of the city said unto Elisha behold we pray thee the situation of the city is pleasant as my Lord sayeth but the water is not and the ground is barren okay so there's no life in the water right and the ground is barren right now who do they come to they come to Elisha okay and he said bring me a new crews amen bring me a new crews and put salt therein and they brought it to him and he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast the salt in their right and said thus saith the Lord I have healed these waters the salt was having an effect on the waters right in a place that was barren where the the water could not bring forth life amen just poured a little bit of salt into the waters and it had an effect amen it had an influence upon the waters thus saith the Lord I have yield these waters they shall not be from hints from thence any more death or barren land so the waters were healed on to this day according to the seiya saying of Elisha think about then can can I have an effect upon my family can I have an effect or an influence upon my own life upon my co-workers lives he's saying you are the salt of the earth now now we're going back to the examples of what salt does amen now salt does the same thing for Elisha how much more should salt do something in our lives and in our families our co-workers our churches huh it has great influences on water salt right on food and on the air but I want you to notice the enemy you know me in those days the Bible days they figured out that if they destroyed an enemy right now notice this there's a use of salt here as they destroyed the enemy and they pushed him off the land right they would leave the lands and come and go back to their own lands but you know the enemy would would come back into their land and then they would grow crops again and carry on so what they started doing is when they destroyed an enemy they poured salt on everything right pour salt on everything and what does that do it destroys the land okay it just it just it makes it so that that land will never bring forth food for the enemy ever again right and that's what we need when the Holy Ghost takes over our lives on brother and sister and drives out the enemy in our life right we need to cover it with a salt amen we are the salt right oh all embodying salt right and if there's not a patch of salt that gets what the enemy can come in riding it can regrow some things that you don't like right then you got to destroy the enemy again it'll become a yearly cycle of driving out the enemy right but if you want to keep the enemy from coming back right from taking over your spots taking over your land right taking over your complexes or habits whatever it is you got to cover it with salt then the enemy has no reason to come back he can't live on your land anymore amen he can't grow anything amen he's lost all the ability to have an influence in your life because of the salt that's the power of the Holy Ghost in our lives huh that enemy has no say-so he has no effect he has no influence upon your life amen why because we are the salt of the earth huh the enemy cannot find ground that he can put his words into remember this Eve right it is made differently right she's the restored Word cannot be tampered with I'll give you a scripture here just so you can see it this evening and Abimelech fought against the city all that day and he took the city and slew the people that was there in and beat down the city and sewed it was salt right destroyed the land so the enemy could not come back and take root again now notice you're also with the offerings in the Old Testament salt was very important Leviticus two and thirteen says in every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou seasoned with salt how many offerings right every offering had to be presented with salt they needed to be seasoned with something in other words when we come to worship the Lord and we come to give the Lord of our time and we come to church or whatever we want to do and we give a sacrifice to the Lord it has to be seasoned with salt there has to be an influence there there has to be something that you can present to the Lord don't just do it just in the mechanics of it Amen but bring it with some salt some flavor amen hallelujah neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the Covenant of that God to be lacking from thy meat offering with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt amen hallelujah the meat cannot be offered without the salt salt was cast into the burden offerings amen Ezekiel 43 24 and thou shalt offer them before the Lord and the priest shall cast salt upon them and they shall offer them out for a burnt offering before the Lord even the burnt offerings required salt if something very important about salt amen salt was part of the incense Exodus 30 and 35 and thou shalt make it a perfume a confection after the art of the epochal tempered together pure and holy that tempered together is to say salted the incense or perfume types the prayers of his people regarding this verse here notice here it it means that their prayers they are savory and acceptable to God they are pleasing amen in all sacrifices salt was used and every spiritual sacrifice of ours should be seasoned with the same it is to be provided for those uses in the temple without fail okay now the Lord we need salt for our offerings okay so he provides the salt okay we don't manufacture the salt all right Ezra six and nine and that which they had need of both young bullets and Rams and lambs and for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven wheat salt wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which were at Jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail is not what the Lord does for us he he says to his angels write his ministering angels let it be given to them in every Church age and every day at every challenge at every turn Amen every dispensation let there be solved and let them be meat let there be offerings that all these things be provided in their hour of need amen without fail numbers 1819 all these heave offerings of the holy things which the children of Israel offer unto the Lord have I given thee and my sons and my daughters with thee by statute for ever it is a covenant of salt God made a covenant of salt with the people I know it sounds funny right but the Lord uses those types and things right so that we can really see what he's trying to say you know there's a covenant of strength right there's all sorts of covenants that the Lord's make that the Lord makes right Sampson had a covenant of strength right with his hair right but notice here he makes a covenant of salt with his people forever before the Lord unto thee right kind of like acts 2:38 this promise this covenant of salt right is unto thee and I children amen this is good for everybody right hallelujah let's get back to you are the salt of the earth right this is what we open up with this evening says that there are two very important roles here pointed out by the scriptures and this is a sermon that Jesus was preaching on the mount right now remember the the one role there is to be the light of the world a light that would be viewed from all over the world it's not hidden but it's seen it's visible in other words it's it's made manifest it's revealed okay this the other role is the salt of the earth okay so we have two roles that we we fulfill salt is that which preserves life as we were saying that which goes out like a river and influences and spreads out okay salt is only useful when it's salty that's not very complicated all right I'm just making the statements here right salt is only useful when it's salty the warning here that the scripture tells us is that if it loses its savor all right if it loses its saltiness it becomes bland and boring okay I've ever been in a message Church and it's like man this is really boring I would never bring my friend here right right or your life you know you go to school and you know I can't do anything can't have any fun right because I'm a message believer right what are you telling your friends right what what kind of a life is that that's miserable right you know I grew up in the message I've been around the message I know the message you know well I've seen all the different things in the message I mean I have lived around the message okay I was born in it and everything okay and I love it I absolutely love this walk with the Lord okay and I was happy to go to high school and tell my friends about the word and the things we see in the word you know and I wasn't I wasn't weird about it I didn't tell everybody and look down on everybody I'm a message believer and you know you need to come up to our level was never like that okay it's like I have something special and the Lord has done something special for me in my heart how can I help you right how can I help you and how was your life and you know how's your family and you start encouraged people around you you know we used to have prayer meetings at high school okay this is a total public high school okay and it was there was not a Christian school there was no Christian influence of any kind but you know we found a group of kids in the school that wanted a prayer meeting so at lunchtime we went in at prayer meetings right and today I found out that one of them is a pastor right and we're and we have friends you know and actually look look at our Lord does things okay so now this pastor right this friend of mine we were really good buddies he's not a pastor of the man that left a message okay and now we're connected right now it's just amazing how God does things right but we are the salt right that's what I'm trying to say we am influence will have an effect upon people around us right and it's exciting for me it's exciting to see how the Lord uses us and to see how we influence lives and how we can make somebody else's life better right you know that there's children out there and a complete identity crisis and God's due to a school he sends you to a mall he sends you to a Sports Complex or whatever it might be or a job place he sends you there and he sees you as the light of the world he sees are dying in a lost person or he sees a sick person or or or you know a needy person but but he sends you right you are God's hands you are God's contact point right we had a man in our church he was getting sick and and anyway he ended up in a hospital and Enys and his leg was really bad and I went to visit this man and this brother and you know his leg which is swollen up right and and he was just saying you know well I'd you know the doctors have no idea what's going on with his leg they don't know what happened to him you know and but you know there he is and they're just holding him in the hospital you know the Lord knows how to order our footsteps right because we are the salt okay now he's laying there right and so okay we'll just pray for the man and the brother and and the life goes on and the next day I guess it was about the next day or so another man comes into the hospital and they put him in the bed next to him there and this man is dying from cancer can a long story short this brother you know starts talking to this man okay it's just a worldly man right and he's dying from this cancer right and he ends up sitting on his bed next to him and he and it starts talking to him about God and Jesus Christ in these things and you know this man starts opening up to him right and before you know this man is giving his heart to the Lord okay the next day that man died but he gave his heart to the Lord okay and you know that date when when that man died that brother's legs started getting better right why God knows who to use right he's not he's not afraid to put you out there right remember when devil came by he said have you considered job right I know what job is made of there's no way you can affect job any man the job loves me job is connect with me I know the material that job is made from have you considered him and he got God brags on us okay he's got confidence in us my brother and sister right there's no circumstance that God put you in that you don't have control over you believe that tonight hallelujah I've seen a lot of things okay I might be a young pastor my brother and sister but I've seen a lot of things and you know this God he he's in control he knows what he's doing he knows how to raise men up he knows how to influence he knows how to empower a man he knows how to strengthen he knows how to to heal and how to move upon our hearts and I want you to have confidence in this God hallelujah my goodness better keep going here let's not lose our savor let's not lose the saltiness when it does that it becomes bland and boring in other words it becomes useless and ineffective and there's nothing as sad as an ineffective Christian you know you get someone saying I'm a message believer I'm a Christian and they just have the nastiest attitude right that's an ineffective Christian okay or there's no love right everywhere they go and you know sometimes you'll know a message believe or a Christian right and you know I'm just being real open and honest I hope that's okay brother standing right but you'll know somebody and maybe even in the same workplace and you have a testimony right that you're trying to uphold and everybody says wow you know this guy where does he come from right he's not like you right and why are you guys so different right he's a message believer you're a message believer you know he brings a reproach to what we believe or she right let's not let's let's not just say that we are Christians let's not just say that we're message believers but let's have the impact this has a life behind that testimony it's one thing to say it but it's a whole nother thing to be living this message okay like I said I've seen a lot in the message I've been around for a long time I've grown up in this thing but it's a whole different story my brother and sister to be living this message has been given to us it's one thing to quote it and say it and and and go into the mysteries and all those things but when you see who it is amen and you've become a part of it and you become a partaker of the divine nature amen now we're talking right hallelujah for salt to lose its savour it means that it has been diluted right that's a quick way to get salt to lose it savers just run water over it for a long time right and you know I think that's what a lot of people are going through is there is the message has come under attack right and then people get nervous so what do they do automatically right they say well maybe the dumb denominations aren't that bad maybe maybe we should love everybody more maybe we should be you know more inclusive right maybe we should be right because now we're we're afraid to offend people we want to you know my brother sister we've never we must never compromise with the word okay now that doesn't mean to seclude people right it's not on anybody everybody has a right to the life and the love of God okay everybody but we should never compromise don't ever dilute what we old we are message believers we have the pure unadulterated Word of God that is our strength amen that's our long-hair right that's our headship that is that is the power in our lives is the pure Word of God don't ever compromise with a word okay but you mingle you can fellowship you can do all those things but never never compromise with the word as soon as you do that my brother sister you lose your savor okay hallelujah for it to be diluted is to make it weak this is the warning that we are in this world but we are not of it thus being careful not to become contaminated by thus losing our effectiveness as being the salt of the earth according to the scriptures those are the two facts about the believer of the world we are the salt of the world Bible says this here Matthew 9:15 salt is good yeah praise the Lord but if the salt have lost saltness wherewith will ye season it have salt in yourself can't say it any more clear than the Scriptures amen and have peace one with another the Bible here requires that we are in possession of salt okay within ourselves like the five wise virgins right they were in possession of the oil okay to be the salt of the earth you must have it you must have it to be a message Lee it must have Christ living on the inside amen you can't fake this okay and as we go on we're going to see it more and more okay I've seen message pastors that have been bouncers for 30 years right leave this message what did they have right you gotta have Christ on the inside that's the thing that's gonna count amen you've got to be born again in other words to be a Christian you must have the Spirit of Christ in you you can't fake this okay otherwise you just have a religion this element is what weight is what will influence our lives it's a type of the Holy Spirit working on the inside of us it's the seasoning power that brings the flavor out of our life it is what the believer seasons his life was so that all that come near him will be influenced in turned by his life you know the whole token message is based around this principle prophet says you want to see your family get saved he says you just bring him into your home and he says and you just create an atmosphere right just an atmosphere what is that to have a life that is influencing upon them huh just living a life of love of peace right oh my goodness my brother and sister it's amazing I love it because you know this puts all of us in to the picture huh it's not based on the preacher right it's not just the Deacons not just the trustees or just a song leader any one of us have this power any one of us is a candidate tonight let your speech be always with grace seasoned with salt that you may know how you ought to answer every man huh that is to say as salt makes meat savoury to the palate right so grace is the salt that makes our lives and our interaction with people pleasant and effective let your speech always with grace be seasoned with salt prophet says isn't a message why are people so tossed about the veil is dropped they don't even hear it they're in they're coming to life amen yielding buds talk to them a little while and you'll see there's an odorous shape about them their conversation is seasoned with salt not talking about their neighbor or try to fuss about something being done this way or that way but their conversation is of Christ and of his glory that's where they lay yielding a freshness right yielding a freshness think about that yielding bringing forth fruit every day there live seasoned with a spirit of God bringing forth fruits that are pleasing unto the Lord says when the Church of the Living God gets to a place of get out of this little old isms and the sensations until it can display the real genuine love of God then you'll be the salt of the earth that'll create a thirst in the heart of the sinner that'll make him want to be like you right but notice that get out of the isms and all those things it's amazing that grudges right complexes bad feelings right having aunt one with another all those little separating things right the things that make us not get along with each other so well right all those little things the human things right you know that they dilute our of our salt they dilute our effectiveness huh praise the Lord prophet says we got a great product here huh but we're approaching the public wrong with it too much making us isolationists see it'll sell itself just live it see you are the salt of the earth and salt as long as the savers in the salt it'll save if it makes contact but if it's lost its savor no matter how loud we shout down here how much we jump up and down there's got to be a life out here that backs that up huh there's got to be a life my brother and sister and I think that's so good for us as the bride Lord let me be pleasing unto you let my life be marinated with with your Holy Spirit amen they live wherever I go let me have an effect don't you want that amen it's nice we go to church on Sunday and we go to church on Wednesdays and you know we have prayer meetings and all these things and but there's so much more right there's so much more what about Monday and Tuesday and and Thursday and Friday right all the other days of the week where that's where we live most of our life amen we go to church so that we can be strengthened and encouraged right from our lamps a little bit more so that when we go to our workplaces go to school on Monday we can have an effect right we don't live from Sunday to Sunday maintaining our little like existence oh my hope this is all right tonight salt can look like salt but if it isn't salty it's good for nothing right it's only useful upon upon contact right God uses our hands our lips we are his ambassadors we are as witness to this world message identification and you'll notice a lot of these quotes tonight's are also after the seals okay if anybody's curious about that salt saves when it contacts and we must be God's contact we are his point of contact amen so the Prophet said it we're good with that amen but as salt is a saver if it contacts she says you have a piece of meat here and a barrel of salt there you've got to get them together the salt to the meat or the meat to the salt to preserve the meat that's the way it is we I get the believer with the unbeliever that's right you've got to get them into the church do you get them into the salty bunch of people Amen you know that salt the Prophet says here it goes on it's not on the slides but he says he goes on he says that salt makes a thirst doesn't it and if you eat salt you get thirsty and God wants his church so salty till the whole world will thirst to be like them just thirsty and thirsty just think oh if I could only live the way that woman lives in the in the Bible right if she ain't the most sweetest peaceful person never out of humour never fussy right she's always kind trying to do something to help somebody else right why she's a credit to any man's Church what a testimony out there huh fellowship by Redemption says the Bible said that you are the salt of the earth and this salt can only save when it comes in contact with a spoiling earth the or the earth is spoiling it's rotten and you know that and the salt must come in contact with the earth and if it'll be gone that it's groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God hallelujah message hear him he says it's time for the church today to be manifested and instead of that we're drawing little lines like this and we have these little campaigns and these little doctrines and these little denominations that separates us how can God ever pour his spirit on such as that when he loves the Methodists he the same as he loves the Baptist or you Pentecostals or all the children brought the same by the bought by the same blood but we are the ones drawing the lines think about that statement tonight we look at people a whole lot different everybody is a candidate to the full open Word of God everybody has a right to come into Christ and now if the other fellow draws a line you just live right along his line right you be the salt we'll make him thirsty if you'll be the salt you are the salt of the earth and salt if it contacts it saves right and think we're getting that principle now right he says then salt creates a thirst and people were thirst when they see you living the life that you should live as a son and daughter of God so all we have to do is be salty right God makes the other person thirsty the important thing tonight is to have the salt live a salty life a life filled with the savour of Christ the love of God amen so we find that the more we go into these things and you'll even see this in questions and answers in the seals and the Seventh Seal all these things you start seeing the Prophet really focusing on on the life a hidden life with Christ he says a solid sane stable Christian right in the middle of the road right not over in fanaticism and not over here on starchiness right in the middle of the road right there it's an epistle known and read of all men and the message God keeps his words the Prophet says it like this jesus said you are the salt of the earth but the salt can only be a saver as in contact so you have to make contact in your life is the best thing to make contact with anybody your life okay he says I'd rather you lift me a sermon then preach me one any time the rest of the world will the same thing prophet says and behold I stand at the door and knock if you're the salt of the earth then you've got to live such a life you where you're a written epistle till all men will know what you are no matter what you profess to be you know they say this right this person is a Christian right he says your life speaks so loud I can't hear your testimony huh what kind of a life doesn't look like think about it tonight and you know well we're thinking about it might as well think about our own lives what does my life look like out there that it's so loud it doesn't matter that I profess what I am they can see from a distance this is the Bride of Christ this man is a believer 1964 the Prophet says I've got to live that example says Christianity ain't what you say it's what you live what you do it's an example amen you are the salt of the earth you are the salt of the earth hallelujah praise the Lord prophet says and when we lose our influence as a father as a mother as a Christian as a businessman as a minister when we lose our influence with people now we can be very popular in the line of the world and go along with the world but I mean as we represent Christ right when we lose our influence as that how can we blend in with a day when God is so against this day right now notice he though he pulls out a few roles that we all have okay that his father's right so it's not just about being a Christian it's not just being a what we profess writers to be a message believer right we we have responsibilities as all right as husband's right in the Bible and the message has been very clear in our conduct our order the way we treat one another right so he's saying that all those little roles right all those things right are important in our lives don't neglect being a proper daddy in your home don't let let being a mother to your children right that's all part of being a salt of the earth it doesn't mean that a mother neglects her duties at home and goes out there and starts quoting quotes to everybody and you know she's some religious fanatic out there that's not being the salt the salt is being in her role being in her place right remember that that woman that was praying for a husband to be saved and the man was at the bar right and he said man you come to my house I'll show you a Christian Ryan brings those men home right her life saved those men just the life on display amen what about the bride my brothers Chris brother and sister think about it tonight you know we go we go through our trials we go hardships people make fun of us like that husband threw his plate on the floor like that what kind of an attitude would we have how would we react to those kind of things amen but our attitude just the just the attitude she had brought salvation to those men and then we say Lord we're praying for our families were praying for people to come back into the message we're praying for people to be saved in our church and all these things but God's saying but you're the salt of the earth I've given you all the power and dominion over these things I've made you a mother a father I've given you so many opportunities where you can live a life before these people lord help us hey give us strength to live a life to recognize what God's called me to be to be let me be the right kind of father to my children let me be the right kind of husband to my wife a meant something when that when the world looks at that they say wow what is that right and they come and ask you you say well you know it's not me right it's the lord and savior's it's you know it's God who lives in me right if it was me you know I would not be like this right amen but praise the Lord for His grace right by His grace I can treat my wife the right way by His grace I can run my house the right way and you know and then they go wow I want the part of that grace hmm skip a few things here message the Queen of Sheba says we are the salt of the earth and if the salt is still got its savour in it and contacts it is a saver but if the salt has lost its strength if our testimonies are so irregular and one day we're up and the next day we're down and this this way we're believing in the next we're not how can a sinner man find anything from us huh so how do we combat that how do we not do that right prophet says he says we must take our stand for God you see you must come to a place where you just decide Lord I believe you right that's the beginning right he says if you must believe that he is you have to stand for God you have to come to a place in your life where you say okay I'm done with all the different influences and voices amen Lord what's your opinion right Lord what do you think right what's your opinion upon my life what is you know we you know my dad has an opinion my mom has an opinion my assembly siblings have opinions my pastor has opinions right everybody's an opinion good or bad right but lord what's your opinion concerning me what is your thoughts concerning me Amen make a stand right give God a shot in your life say Lord yeah we hear all these things and I don't understand anything but lord I have faith that you are a Living God and if this message is real Lord let it live in me show me the that pathway show me the stream show me the rivers amen take me through those familiar places open my eyes Saint man hallelujah there's a lot of things you know I didn't understand either but you know over time God has taken me through this door and then he's taking me through this pasture right and he's shown me this valley and he showed me that stream amen he opens your eyes but we've got to be willing to wait upon the Lord we got to be those things you ever had a little girl you know or your daughter your son come to you and say Dan I did something at at school today and I want to show you right and then I'm too busy and you move on well you hurt their feelings right they made something right they want to show it to you right that's thank God is like that with us sometime something I made something I want to explain it to you I want to showed you but we're so busy right we're so busy right phones and we've got so many distractions and the God wants to lead us he wants to bring us to higher heights he wants to elevate us say many wants to empower our lives and and we're so busy building homes and and and and maintaining our little existence huh oh god wake us up we stir our hearts again right like Samson let me feel the power of this of the the covenant of his strength upon my life let me feel the surge of the Holy Spirit let me feel the love let me feel that joy in my life again take all the doubts and the fear out of my life lord i i cast down my reasonings I cast down my fears my doubts Lord I only want to see you hey man I only want to know you you know it'll just be an ordinary day and he comes vine he answers huh he answers he knows how to how to get a hold of your mind and your soul and your heart and he knows how to speak to you and you know what it won't be the same like he does with everybody else you'll make it personal where you have an experience with God hallelujah you know I was just an electrician just uh just working for somebody and it was just an ordinary day and I'll never forget it you know it's just working and it was it was kind of a really stressful job and one day I showed up super early I was there around 6 o'clock in the morning that's super early to you and I'm walking up there's a long wooden walkway up into a kind of a wooded area at a big log home on an Eagle Harbor right it's just a gorgeous place but you know I'm walking up there and you know I'm just just this humble little electrician right working for this millionaire right and walking up this hill and I've got my hand I'll never forget even though the smells and the sensations I mean God knows how to purse analyze it huh and I remember running my hands up the grains of that of that would the of the hand rail going out and all my tools and stuff and you know I'm just going out it's just an ordinary day huh just an honor day thinking about the job and then it was like the next moment I felt like somebody was there no just somebody was there you didn't speak to me in an audible voice or anything but I knew that my savior was standing with me in that place he was walking with me he was letting me know Chris I know about your needs I know about your troubles and your family in your church all these things I'm with you I you've got me on your side amen it's my hand in your hand I'm with you huh and you'll never forget moments like that but you've got to be willing you've got to be consecrated you gotta say Lord let me be salty Lord created me a clean heart Lord show me your ways huh we've gotta be willing to die to ourselves die to our opinions die to all the outside influence it's not amazing that every time a question comes up we go to Google or Siri or write you think they've got the answers to those things they don't have a clue and there's a thousand voices out there but there's only one voice that will bring satisfaction to your heart Sweeper this little brine it's gonna stir up the young ones the old ones amen it might not be like the first second pull but it'll be a word bride huh she'll be right in the middle of the road he'll understand the word she'll be able to discern she'll have the power of the word in her mouth amen she'll have character I believe that you know prophet had a vision about you said about those young couples I think it is right young people that was sitting there in the meeting right and then he says the day kind of wore on and they started getting a little restless and then he said they started leaving I mean he's saying don't go right I'm getting to the climax right and we're getting to the good stuff right but there they were hungry so that you know he said it's okay right he said it's okay you're leaving for food right but he says they will be back those young people right they'll be back in the evening time in the evening shadows they'll come back and I believe that's where the bride is we're here amen we're here my brother and sister this is our day mmm the salt of the earth huh we are the salt of the earth think about that the strength of the Holy Spirit should be in every member of the church what do you mean strength the power of the Resurrection the life that Jesus gave for the church should be operating in every member of the body the strength of salt will only save if it contacts but it must contact if the church gets that burden on their heart to contact somebody get somebody say then the strengths coming back into the church again and into the people there's a beautiful quote you know look this up sometime where the Prophet says that we are his speaking about God right we are God's earthly strength if we underestimate ourselves we really do we really live way below our privileges we are the earthly strength of God hallelujah amen the Lord sees in our lives as reform 14 now because we have maintenance from the king's palace I want to leave this here with you this evening that maintenance right remember salt is a preserver it's what keeps it's a it's something that provides for okay that maintenance there that word evils salt okay we have salt from the king's palace it's those words if you go look them up right that maintenance is salt or like salary not vegetable sorry but salary like money okay you will get a salary from work right and that's what provides for your house that is the buying power for your needs the word salary comes from an ancient word meaning salt money that's what the word salary comes from now we're gonna take our salaries with a whole different look when it's salt money okay it's referring to a day when the Roman soldiers allowance for the purchase of salt was okay so they would give them enough money for the salt in their allowance okay so it kind of evolved and the word became salary someone who earns his pay is still referred to as being worthy of his salt right don't know if you ever had someone say that to you okay but he's worthy of his salt we have maintenance from the king's palace god gives us an allowance right he gives us a salary right day-to-day right all right praise the Lord I'm gonna close with a by John notices seen here ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever even to him into his sons by a covenant of salt so God made a covenant with abaya right with Judah in the kingdom of Judah right with a covenant of salt in other words that covenant will never be breaking it's permanent it preserves it maintains okay it protects it's it enhances right there's nothing that anybody can do to take that covenant away okay God has made a covenant right of salt that is in other words he made a perpetual covenant never to be made void right it's called so because salt preserve corruption so God made a covenant with a buyer and those men okay now goes in another place in the scriptures talking about the same thing he shall build a house for my name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever okay he's talking about this covenant of salt right that he made first kings again says nevertheless for David's sake that the Lord his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem to set of his son after him and established Jerusalem now in second chronicles 13 and 5 we see the power of this covenant of salt coming to affect Abijah the king of Judah remember how the kingdoms are divided into two there was two tribes over here in ten tribes over here right two tribes was was Judah and then ten tribes was Israel right we know these things but notice King the king of Judah by juh stands there with these four hundred thousand men you can go read about this battle in second chronicles thirteen five 400,000 men ready for war okay now that's a lot of men but Israel had twice as many had eight hundred thousand pretty bad odds okay now who in their right mind would take on an enemy that is twice the size of yours huh but remember the only thing that that Abijah had above them was a covenant of salt now I'm trying to show you the power of that binding covenant that God makes with you does it matter if say if the enemy showed up with a hundred and 1.2 million soldiers did would it matter if they showed up with chariots and all sorts of weapons and things I mean it just doesn't matter these guys have a covenant of salt okay that's the that's the dividing factor that is that is the deciding factor I mean that is what he's going to separate these two armies is this covenant Yeah right most leaders in a bi disposition would think again before fighting an army twice its size yet he seizes upon the opportunity to warn Israel right so Abijah goes to Jeroboam right and he and he warns them reconsider attacking because of the divine covenant I'm under right he imagined what Jeroboam was thinking like are you nuts we are twice as strong as you right we got this field covered with army with an army amen that is twice as big as yours we are gonna defeat you and you're telling us to be careful yeah why right well because we have a covenant of salt right right where we have a promise huh God's given us his word hmm reconsider attacking because God has given us a divine covenant with Judah and it's based upon salt he said should you not know right should you not know he can go read this in that chapter he asked that the Lord God of Israel gave the Dominion over to Israel to David forever don't you know this that the kingdom belongs to us he's given us the kingdom forever that he's going to establish it forever and you think you're gonna bring your army here and drive us off this place amen come on we thought in a we've got a covenant we're God's people right this is what I'm saying we don't cower for the devil we don't move off the battlefield because of the enemy huh we have a covenant and our covenant is a covenant of salt the promise was not given just to David and his kingdom forever but to his sons Israel didn't heed the warning and it and as a result 500,000 of jeroboams men died that day huh that is the this is interesting now notice we're talking about a covenant of salt I think the Lord is trying to tell us something that is the largest single-day slaughter in history to this day no five hundred thousand in one day we we saw in a museum today about Gallipoli right I mean it is tragic what happened there it is it is a mess huh it's like a hundred twenty thousand or something but over like an eight month period right this is five hundred thousand in one day what do you think our children do when they go to school what do you think your brothers do when you're going to work huh you're you're to breaking down strongholds destroying the enemy left right and center the Lord goes before you're setting ambushment against the enemy huh we are wreaking destruction everywhere we go amen think about it because of a covenant that we have now consider what an army of the New Testament would do an army of spurs filled believers walking in the power of the salt covenant hallelujah amen let's stand to our feet tonight what I encourage you to start looking at who you are don't let the devil tell you who you are he is is he can only lie okay he said is the father of lies okay which means that's where lies come from he that's all he can do if he opens his mouth is lying okay he says he cannot tell you the truth okay so anything he says just throw it out okay but I want you to start considering what he says about you what is what does the Lord say I am huh that we have not the spirit of fear right with all this virus stuff and everything going on around there a brother/sister we don't have a spirit of fear but we have the spirit of power and of a sound mind God's given us his peace his strength his joy and all these things belong to you they belong to you he doesn't want you to be confused or he doesn't want you to be up and down and right he doesn't want you to be unhappy you want he wants to empower your life he wants to fill you with his spirit his nature he wants you to see the power of is of what he can do in your life huh but we've got to be willing we've better come before him and say Lord let thy will be done I believe in you I believe this message I believe that you sent a prophet huh I believe all these things might I don't have a problem with those things I'm not ashamed to say those things huh I've seen it any man I've seen the power of those things in my life you can't you can't explain that away from me but you have to come to a place where you shut out all the outside voice and say Lord it's you I want your voice in my heart then you see things start to change he'll open things up in the message that that nobody has told you before trust because Mercy's new every morning it's a living book my brothers to this Bible it is a living book amen and every time I open it up I say mama that's me in there ain't man that says this is for me this is my huh amen praise the Lord I'll let brother been coming close we said god bless you amen we'll go out of here praise the Lord huh we'll give the devil a knockout punch give him a knockout punch shake praise the Lord brother amen amen praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand oh praise the Lord Amen cleared the musicians to come for but with the salt of the world salt of the earth hey man it's powerful never ever underestimate what the Lord has made you to be what you have in your life I mean sure this world is falling apart but we received a kingdom that cannot be shaken I mean this this stands where we stand the brother Chris have really enjoyed there there's tremendous amen let's just sing shall we oh sweet Jesus take my life I mean do we have that on the screen just before we sing let's just raise our hands the Lord and this this is pray to Him shall we dedicate our lives of fresh gracious Lord Jesus Lord we want to thank you we want to thank you very much Lord Lord you came by our way this night
