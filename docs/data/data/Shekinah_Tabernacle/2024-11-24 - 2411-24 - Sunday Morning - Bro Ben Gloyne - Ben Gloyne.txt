I um a good friend of mine uh about four years ago said you need to learn the guitar and I went oh really and he says I'll tell you what I'll give you a guitar and and I'll teach you and so it's only been a short short walk so far and um this is how we got got here and so um yeah and I've been really encouraged because I was at a at a church conference and they said um the person next to you you know speak to the person next to you and tell them what God's saying and I and the person next to me turned around and said God says never stopped playing the guitar so and he didn't even know I played the guitar so that was uh a huge um encouragement for me just to keep keep going so um we'll see how it works out we just me and the Lord yeah and you're know know the song and uh you're

this is a real um picture of of our walk really we got God's creation at the start and then we got our enjoying you know a walk through the woods and Glades or I think of uh brother brandham you know walking through the mountains and all that stuff you know and just enjoying God's creation and then then it comes to the Salvation part and then it's the the take me home part so it's a it's a progression and uh it's a just a a very simple um explanation but uh it covers it all so when through the woods and Forest Glades I wonder and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees when I look [Music] down from lofty Mountain grander I I hear the broke and feel a gentle [Music] breeze then sings my soul my savior God to thee How Great Thou Art How Great Thou Art then sings My my soul my

amen praise the Lord keep it up brother Colin that was the epitome of that little dog you know I might not have much but I'm going for [Laughter] it and that song also um is it has a bit of uh sort of a special meaning for me just at the moment because it's um in the film that I'm making that's that's I've had a lot of trouble to finish it off but the the at the end of the film I've got it's about a protest and that the people that were protesting were Christian people so they sang a lot of HMS during this protest and and one of them that they were singing in the news footage that I watched from the 70s was how great theyou art and there's a it was made very popular in this country by Sir Howard Morrison he sang it of it and it seemed to be his theme song although I don't think he was a Christian he just seemed to do that song and then I managed to get permission from his son to use how great they are at the end of the film so it's it's when when I hear it it's kind of it speaks to me people said I should take it out take that out of the movie you'll offend people it's all right um let's um let's stand this morning and just um just Worship the Lord the only one I don't want to offend is the Lord everyone else I'm not I am concerned about in a human sense but when I when I have to take sides I'm going to take the side of the Lord amen and I believe that's what you all do this morning when I serve the wonderous cross on which the pr of Glory Die My ites G I Can't Bel [Music] Lo and P cont on all my PR for B it Lord that I should boast saveing the day of Christ my God

is going to share a slideshow and uh her experiences being on the mercy ship in si Leon so if you want to uh if you'd like to be here and [Applause] okay we'll see how this goes now now so everyone hear me okay okay so we're going to read from Ephesians chapter 6 and then we're going to go to Hebrews 11 for a bit of a context what do we do oh man you what look me all right okay we're okay now we're good all right let's go Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye uh shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the SP and watching there onto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen then we're just going to go to Hebrews chap 11 I pray these things all tied together but I want to talk about our feet being shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace today because we got good Footwear I I mean there's a joke we've got Footwear and God's given us authority to to to walk in his promises to stand on every enemy amen so um and then just a bit of a context when I talk about Moses here I just couldn't especially verse 27 I just couldn't get it out of my my out of my heart this whole week I've been meditating on this is by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw him as a was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward and by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing he him who is invisible amen so let's pray this morning if you want to be remember remember in prayer want to slip your hand up to the Lord amen let's pray gracious Heavenly Father truly Lord Jesus our hearts cry out to you holy blessings honor and power be unto you Lord ask you would take service Lord may you feel so welcome Among Us Lord may your word flow hindered Lord you touch every life Lord may you just come and do what you want to do in our lives today touch our hearts like only you can we also especially want to remember those who are away today be their portion Lord be their strength Lord be with them Father we love you Lord as we've read your word we ask that you would anoint speaker and heer one more time for your glory Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can have your seats um what we're going we're going to go through every mic until and then we'll just not have any how about that okay we'll try we'll go Blue okay we're going blue all right we here yes we're here so I want to I want to speak on this here about how we've gone through the shield of Faith a bit and I just want to speak because you know we but it's amazing how when the Apostle Paul's inspired about the whole armor of God he of course we're covered from head to foot but you we we we have we have these uh our feet is shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace so we're ordained to walk a certain path and now Moses as you know Moses when you really think about the the the magnitude of his decision here where he forsook all the treasures all the wealth all the glamour all the greatness of Egypt and and and he'd rather suffer the afflictions and walk with the people of God but the reason he could is because he he he endured because he was seeing him who was invisible so he he caught a vision of the Eternal God and also he caught a vision of where everyone would end up in eternity so because of this he could look beyond the natural and what you know what he was enjoying in the palace and he could he could um walk walk by faith now it's amazing when you think about Moses because he could have been the next Pharaoh yeah there's a lot of distractions today I'm standing on a thing anyway there was a lot of so it was a big decision he made naturally okay naturally he made a big decision he could have been the next Pharaoh we understand brother Braham tells us he had his one foot on the thr throne and you know so the natural progression of his life is that he could have been the next pharaoh and even as brother Bram said Moses as far as physical done a foolish thing when he tried to deliver the children by the word of God um taking a bunch of people out of the Wilderness when he had this why he was the he of everything they had he had every Army uh there was and all the world whipped and where and there he was a great military General and the next move he he was to be king pharaoh of Egypt why he could just have stepped up on the throne and said all right children go back to your home that settles it he was you know see uh he was a pharaoh so so his next move was going to be was going to be um the pharaoh of Egypt now this is a big you think about that's a big decision to make in the natural and no doubt he had a lot of pressure on him to to take the throne his uh his uh was it Foster mother or stepmom or whatever you know the princess of Egypt that that that pulled him out of the Nile she had expectations son you're going to be AR those those men who are very loyal to him who are around him who who saw him as a great leader they saw the future that he could have stepped into there would have been pressure from from them as well Moses you're going to be the next Pharaoh so he had a lot of peer pressure that he had to balance as well so it wasn't just the the natural things he had to give up but people's expectations wanted him to go a certain way but you see he was not looking God God in his great infinite grace am mean spoke to Moses and showed him a different path so he had to forsake not just the riches of Egypt but he had to forsake people's expectation of him I'll say this carnal peer pressure is a very bad thing peer pressure is a demon right caral carel peer pressure is a very bad thing so he had to but see he could look beyond all that and he could walk a path uh according to God's word now we um see because he had an opportunity naturally to be immortalized on carvings of stone imagine if we could you know imagine if he didn't make the decision he made and he became the next Pharaoh we would have someone would have found his tomb somewhere they would have found the hieroglyphs and all those things and you know we probably would have thought what an incredible Pharaoh but if you really think about it in the spiritual you'd say what a missed opportunity that man had if he went that way sure he could have been Pharaoh he could have been in the history books he could have been all you know great monuments and things carved into his you know you know his name and all those things but spiritually that would have been actually the saddest thing he ever would have had done because he would have turned turn down the leadership of the Holy Ghost to go man's way but aren't you thankful amen that his name is not carved in stone his name is carved in the Eternal annuals of God am mean that when we're on on the other side in the Eternal am mean Moses will still be remembered as Moses as the man who forsook Egypt by faith and walked with God Amen and I believe it's the same thing with you and I you know there's a lot of gifted people here a lot of smart people here a lot of you know there's a lot of potential in the world sitting in this room but I believe by faith we've looked beyond those things amen and we see amen where we will end up one day which is not being in the Guinness Book of World Records or have a Nobel Prize or some great thing I mean you know just that's just upon the Earth amen but we've seen that our names are written in glory so we can look Beyond these natural things and we can endure seeing him who is invisible I mean to endure it means to be steadfast it means to be patient it Webster would say it's to continue in the same state I mean so Moses after he met the Lord At The Burning Bush he continued in that same state in spite of all he went through all the troubles the hardship the moaning the complaining the desert all those things that happened amen he endured Hallelujah he he remained steadfast God's commissioned me to take these people from Egypt into the promised land amen so he continued in that same state now I believe I'm looking at a people who have endured who are enduring because you got to realize the same faith that was in Moses is in you I mean so the same ability to endure that was in him is in you now we know Moses did not Endure by natural ability it wasn't just a maybe a stubbornness or a force of will or you know his his natural makeup that caused him to endure no he endured because of Revelation he endured because the faith of God came into his heart this is what he was called to do now it's amazing how brother arand would bring this up on Wednesday about how you know there was no open Vision in the days of Samuel now I think I think we can take the opposite of this and we can say there has never been a day where there's been such an open Vision as this day there's never been an ability to walk with God I believe as there is in this day I mean because Samuel we see there's no open Vision but when the word came open it was just under the blood of bulls and goats right they were looking for the Messiah to come they were they just dealing against Natural enemies and all these different things but you see now we live in a day where the word has completely come open amen the Seven Seals have been taken off the book amen where where where we know that we come from God we're going back to God Amen we know that it's not our works that give us salvation amen but we we love the Lord so we live a certain way I mean we know it's his grace that saved us and called us and keeps us right we know that it's not us trying to please God but but but the blood of Jesus Christ is more than enough you see in past ages there's a wrestling match going on are we saved by works are we saved by faith this has been a great debate the church has gone through for 2,000 years but finally am mean we have returned to Paul's gospel amen because Paul's gospel says we're saved by grace amen it's the blood of Jesus Christ we're Sanctified by that blood amen by one offering he's perfected them forever who are Sanctified right so now so now we've come back to Paul's gospel with a correct balances come into the church that it's not our works that earn anything amen but we live a Christian Life because we love him because we want to please him we want to we want to draw close to him because he's drawn all the way from glory to us amen so so you see a perfect if if if you just take if you just take the message you take the continuity of thought and the message about works and Grace you take it back into the scripture your life will come out balanced right you won't live a laxed life a loose life no you'll live a life you'll be people should ask you why are you a Christian you say because I love the Lord why are you a certain way because I love the Lord why don't you do certain things because I love the Lord It's not Thou shalt not that is that is so far gone out of it should be out of your mind I mean it's not Thou shalt not Thou shalt know I love the Lord that's the motivation of my life is redeeming love amen when I was a rank sinner lost in the world he came and found me I mean lift me up out of the myy clay and now I live for him because he first loved me amen so a cek balance has coming now so so there is a great sorry where have I got so so there is a great there's never been a day where an open vision is so the word has come so open that we can walk in confidence like we can in this day am mean we're no longer presuming how to please God or how to walk with him we know according to his word I mean the things that have been revealed to you and I Bible scholars are still wrestling about they you know they're still debating it's like you know brother Ed put up on his what WhatsApp status how they found under that um was it in Israel somewhere they found that uh mosaic or whatever that house you know was before the Nan Council there you know 300 years or ad or something that says Jesus is what Jesus Is God Jesus is the Messiah now they dig that up maybe many of them shake their head say but hold on he's this third person of of a trinity but we we know that that that that that inscription is nothing new amen because we've been restored back to the truth of the scripture that Jesus Christ is the Lord Of Glory am mean he's not the second person or minor person he is the person amen he is the king of glory amen so so we didn't need to dig down and find some archaeological thing to find that truth no but a prophet was inspired to look into the word amen to to actually dig past the Creeds and dogmas of man am mean to show us that he is Messiah he is the king of glory am mean he's Alpha and Omega he's the beginning and the end he is our all and all praise the Lord so now now we can we can walk with confidence because I say there is such an open Vision today that you've got to look into it I mean you ever to look into the word for yourself and say Lord reveal to me what you revealed to brother brandham reveal to me what you revealed to the apostles down Through the Ages amen see now Moses would Moses would look by he would he would endure looking to the Unseen seeing who he who is invisible so he could continue in that same state no matter what was going on now if you look at what he did Brother Brown makes a statement he heard this um he heard a uh quotation one of the commentators has said that Moses took the best side of the world put it on one scale and took the worst of religion put it on the other scale and the worst of religion outweighed the best of the world now you think about that for a second so the best of the world was he was going to be the supreme authority over the superpower of the age he wasn't going to rule some minor Kingdom some vassel State somewhere some little village somewhere he was going to be the supreme authority over the superpower of the age Imagine now if if if America was a dictatorship because Egypt was a dictatorship right so imagine now you've been installed as president for life of America and what you say goes right there's no there's no checks and balances anymore it's it's what you say goes and what you've said that what what did they say in the Moses movie shall it be spoken or what is you know it's written shall it be done whatever everyone probably knows that but you know so it's just it becomes law what is said you see so he took the best of that the world in his hand and you think about the worst of religion that he had to enure he enjoed Church splits he enjoed murmuring in the camp he enured you know the gains saying of Kora all the fussing the fighting the problems the politics the division all these things the slave mentality all the worst of religion he took and that outweighed in his mind the best the world could give him and the reason that is is because he could he could see humanly that wouldn't make sense but you see the only way to to make correct decisions in life is not humanly analyzing things but it's by Revelation you see so so by Revelation he could look at those two things and say actually the worst of religion far outweighs being Pharaoh amen now I trust we can look at the world the same way amen you know that that the worst of being a Christian far outweighs the greatest thing the greatest life or pop star whatever person who's trending hashtag whatever their name is going on that that the the worst of being a Believer far outweighs that and I say it sure does Amen because when all when when all is said and done where will they end up and where will you end up unless they get saved then you'll end up in the same place right so it' be far better those things far away now there's another thing where where see so so to be steadfast or to remain to endure we need to we need to wait on the Lord this world's in a big hurry right have I okay this world's in a big hurry now Isaiah would write in Isaiah 40 and to me it's quite interesting where where Isaiah 40 in verse three I think it says here a voice of one crying in the wilderness so so it's like you know there's a bit of an order of this of this chapter where where John the Baptist has been positionally placed and now he's going to speak about the Believers here okay it says to whom will uh ye sorry to whom then will you like me or or shall I or shall I be equal sayeth the Holy One lift up your eyes on high behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them by all by names by the greatness of his might uh for that he is strong in power not one faileth why sayith thou oh Jacob and speaketh O Israel my way is hid from the Lord see we can't have that attitude why do people say I can do things in secret and God doesn't see it God sees your God sees your browsing history God sees what you've been watching you may delete it but God sees it right God sees we can't hide nothing from God if you think you can pull the wall over his eyes the devil's been trying it for thousands of years and how's that working out for him it's not going to work out good for you either right amen uh my way is hid from the Lord and my judgment is passed over from my God hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength for the Youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall Ally fail but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint now that now that now that wait there it means to it means to look patiently to to T to wait upon right so so if you want to endure you got to see him who's invisible right so you got to look upon him who actually the five senses don't declare you got to look upon Him by faith that's how you wait upon the Lord see if you bring God into any situation it will come out the right way right the your perspective will come out the right way everything will actually become how it's actually meant to be when you bring God into the equation see the devil does not want us to bring God into any equation of life you going through a situation you bring the word of God into it you'll get the right answer right you'll get the right perspective but if you take the word of God out and you're trying to use human reasoning trying to work things out you ain't going to end up balanced amen now brother brah would say in in in in in the reaction to an action we will get to our feet soon right he says he says now uh he says I just went through an experience of a um of that a few days ago now he's talking about when he when he when he um when when the IRS or whatever the tax man in America was calling him he just under so much strain and the phone rang he's at home and he told his wife you know tell them I'm not here but he was you know he's under this under this thing he had to make it right he says now I might just stop and tell you about it for we never want to be in any hurry now that's what's one of the great ruins of of our American Heritage today is we're trying to run over the top of everybody look like we're just trying to run uh run over the top of God not waiting they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength he says this is one of the ruins and I say the great ruin of of I say New Zealand Heritage as we're trying to run over the top of everybody just trying to plow on not even take anyone into consideration and not take God into consideration because remember you know how do you know how do what's the proof that you love God you love the Brethren right you can say you love God all you want but if you got a temper like a buz or indifference towards someone to some believer you don't love him right but if you really love the Lord you will love the Brethren you'll treat them with respect you'll treat them honorably you'll put them above yourself right you won't have a selfish motive in your heart all right are we all together amen this morning amen so that's why it's so it's it be such a ruin Amen to try and run over the top of you and no just just just wait on the Lord trust him all right now as was saying now that Moses could walk this walk because he was he was he was looking he was enduring cuz he saw him who is invisible now as I said earlier before there's never been a time when there's been such a such an open Vision right now but it depends what you see when you're looking see Moses did not endure because I see because of his own mental willpower or his stubbornness or determination he endured because it was the Lord in him caused them to endure ultimately it's a supernatural endurance there'll be times when you want to quit but something in you doesn't want to quit am mean you want to give up you want to go somewhere you want to you're making plans to escape but something in you says no you ain't going you ain't leaving what is that that's that Supernatural endurance amen is is is in your soul amen is is actually conducting your life now and we're going to realize that when we you know Moses if he could stand here today and we could ask him how did you endure how did you put up with all the fussing the fighting the trouble and all these things and he would say it was the Lord it wasn't me it it was the Lord am mean and we're going to realize one day when we look back at our lives we'll say We'll realize it was him the whole time it wasn't us it wasn't our ability or what we thought of them our mind being made up no it was him the whole time it's him that kept us it's him that carried us it's him that saw us through amen now he saw Moses saw Christ we understand that right he saw the invisible becoming visible by Revelation now in order to endure we must seek Christ in his word as well I mean because the message is not about brother braham's Humanity it's more than God sent a profit am mean the message is Jesus Christ the word revealed amen when you when it's reveal to you amen that this message is the is the word revealed Jesus Christ himself being made known amen then you can endure then you can endure because you're not looking at the humanity of a prophet you're not looking at even a supernatural Ministry you're seeing Christ revealed amen then you can then you can endure because you're actually seeing him who is invisible and I encourage you friends if you just hear if you just hear Brother braham's testimonies you just hear a prophet say Lord speak to me and show me you re being revealed show me the voice behind The Voice show me you in the tapes in the Bible show me you because when you see him you'll be able to endure because you're looking to him who is invisible now I mean you see Moses when he when he you know you had such a desire Lord I want to see your glory and he saw the back parts of a man right that that was how much the vision was open in his day now when John was standing on the aisle of Patmos this was after Jesus so it was after that same one became flesh purchased our Salvation rose again right and then he saw then he saw the glorified Christ right but you see now so so Moses saw the back parts of a man but then when John saw him he saw his lamb amen he saw a greater part of God than than even Moses saw hallelujah amen so it helped it caused John it gave him a strength to endure what he was going through right and that's why friends I pray that when you hear the Seven Seals you see more than horse riders you see more than the tribulation you see more than the 144,000 I mean but you see the lamb taking the book redeeming you I remember the first time I heard it I saw all the symbols it was wonderful right but the next time I listened to the seals I saw the lamb step forth taking the book claiming me amen I trust I trust it becomes such a reality to you that it's not just a nice idea or a nice song it becomes such a reality that Christ has stepped forth in this day to take you you said well how's that got to do with taking the book well brother Bram and the beree when he spoke about that he went to Ruth and Boaz and he said he said Boaz claiming Ruth is the same as the lamb taking the book which which you're part of am mean so if you can see the you if the Lord reveals those things then you can endure because you're seeing him who is invisible right you seeing just a a god from a god who's just a nice idea to a reality you see his attributes you see what he's done in your life and is doing praise the Lord amen just trying to find where I am now we we have been running two things at once it's very scary now so see so so the Apostle Paul says that now and your feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace so this act so this preparation means an act of preparing and it's a condition of a personal thing um so far forth as prepared that they preparedness they've got Readiness they are ready right so this means that you're actually in a condition right now that the Lord would call you go that means that's what it means you're ready see see we're dressed we we are dressed for the wedding supper now amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost the word of God that robes the bride is the wedding garment and you receive that wedding garment on this side right so we are actually see we got to get the faar out of the church look look there's so much uncertainty in the world right but that uncertainty doesn't have to come upon you it doesn't have to rule your life it doesn't have to govern your decisions am mean all that all that can stay out there but doesn't belong in us right so we got to realize we are dressed the the believer if you've really met the Lord you're dressed and ready to go Amen brother R would say the Rapture is in you at that moment amen hallelujah now this peace so so we so we so the our feet is shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace so we've been prepared amen we are now in condition now this peace it means of security it means of safety it means of prosperity I'm just wanting to read these things so you got to realize that we're walking in great peace amen it speaks of the messiah's peace my peace I give unto you not the world giveth amen it's the way that leads to peace it means of of you know in Christianity the Tranquil state of the Soul assured of its salvation through Christ so and so fearing nothing from God and content with its Earthly lot of whatsoever sort that is this is this piece that we're dressed in our feet are are we all together this morning right we're going to get this over okay amen so now we so if we've now who's ever tried to run in the frost and beer feet you can't sustain that e every first morning so when I was at boarding school the first morning of the first day of the year we had to get up at 6:00 a.m. and go for a run one morning I decided I'm going to go and bare feet that was a bad choice I still ran though I had to right but you see the thing is now my feet weren't prepared for the race right I thought of my provado yeah this will be cool yeah I'll be whatever what a dumb idea okay you get halfway through you can't feel anything your pain sets in it's like man I know how far I've got to get I can't take a shortcut I've got to get around this track I got to get back in okay but then you do it in shoes you don't suffer the same pain you can actually run with confidence you're not trying to dodge things and worry about what you going what your feet are going to step on you can walk in peace you can run in peace right it's the same thing now in this in this walk that we find ourselves in our feet are Shaw we're wearing the right kind of shoes so we don't need to fear what we stand in right you can stand in some doggy DW you can stand in it but you keep walking right you can stand on thistles prickles whatever it doesn't affect you why bare feet it does right but if your feet if if you're we wearing the right shoes then you don't need to worry about anything you can walk on now you got to realize that that that the shoes we wear are ordained by God right and they've given us authority to walk in places that no one else is ordained to walk in so you got to realize that actually as Christ has supreme authority he's given that Authority into his church right if we walk with God under his word that same Authority he has he's given to us now we read Psalm 9 1 Psalm 91 actually speaks of us you going to read the whole chapter I've just got these few verses here he says for he shall give us Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways amen we're not alone in this walk amen they shall bear thee up in their hands least thou Dash thy foot against a stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and Adder this is where you're ordained to walk okay Thou shalt tread upon the lion and Adder the Young Lion and the dragon Thou shalt trample under feet I mean because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I have I will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and I'll answer him he will be with me in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with a long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation praise the Lord amen so so we we we've been ordained now now this should not be a shock to any of us we're ordained God has commissioned us to stand on the head of the enemy when he's talking about trampling on on on the adder and lung Young Lions and the dragon son these are demon powers that rise up to try and usurp your god-given Authority amen but so we going to realize that we are ordained see see the devil wants to challenge Us by what Authority do you have see even when the apostles were brought before the Sanhedrin they basically asked what Authority do you have to preach these things to do these things and Peter said God gave us this Authority now this is not verbatim but just you know basically he said no God commissioned us when he said in Mark 16 you shall cast out devils in my name I've given you given you authority over every work of the enemy right now that power and authority is still in the church the morning right we have God has not taken it away he's not diminished it one bit no but we're living in a time of an open Vision where we realize that we have all authority over every work of darkness and it's not man-made Authority that has given it to us it's god-given Authority has placed the bride above every demon power above every work of the enemy right but where got to realize that we're walking in peace and it's the messiah's peace right it's not it's not a mental see peace is not some tranquil sitting with your favorite cup of coffee and there's no problems that is not that is not peace that's man that's manufactured peace but it's not the peace of God you see the peace of God passes all understanding where where the world can be literally falling apart but you can have such a peace in that shaking amen that you don't need to fear anything I remember when and Chris I know I've shared it but I want to share it again amen chrisy and I were in the first uh Christ Church earthquake the place it wasn't a gentle rock it was a very violent shaking up and down left and right and we got down to our front door and we started having a prayer meeting I wanted to I wanted to keep my eyes open and look around but I said no I can't focus on what I see I've got to focus on calling on the Lord right because you you've got a decision in every circumstance will you go by with what you see cuz you think about it you're in an earthquake you've got to your safety place but even even if you can't get to one what good is it watching the roof Shake how's that going to help you you say well I can dodge it you can't really Dodge things when you can't even really move when you're being shaken around like a thing right so what good would that help us you say but then what good would prayer do well God prayer brings God into the situation because it turns into a worship amen and the spirit of God came down when the world was shaking and we've never been in anything like that before when the world was shaking we called God on the scene called out to him and the spirit of God came down and we had a glorious time it was a tremendous time of prayer Hallelujah so we don't need to fear anything but you got to bring God into into your situation amen because we're ordained remember this so so so this peace gives us the authority over the devil amen we got to realize we're commissioned we're not commissioned by a country we're not commissioned by a church we're commissioned by almighty God amen that we're ordained to walk in this peace that passes all understanding so we had a great Peace during an earthquake humanly it doesn't make sense but we but God was with us God was present it was the three of us in the house and we had a glorious time so we had a peace that passed all understanding amen so so we have been given a god-given authority to trample on the works of the enemy amen the devil has been placed under our feet I think brother Isaac said it this morning he's been placed under our feet we got to w recognize that amen so so to to treat on to trample means you have the authority you you have authority over every Power of the enemy and you're ordained to stand on the head of the enemy amen but you've got to bring God you've got to bring God into your situation now I I haven't asked her this but you know um a couple of days ago Saturday morning had this uh Christine well we actually both had a dream was interesting we're both very different dreams but you know she had a dream where she went into this room and there's all these sisters in there and there's a demon-possessed person in the middle of the room and everyone's panicking and upset and stress and all these things and and but she realized by Revelation I have authority over the spirit so she told everyone start worshiping the Lord and so it went from a panic to now God came down you know every because the thing is what happens is a spirit will try and get you under its influence like you take someone and you yeah I'm sure you've ever seen it but you know people people who try and you know a spirit will get on someone and will try and get you to sympathize it by that person becoming very emotional you talk to someone you want to correct them something's not right you got to talk about something right and they'll get instantly very emotional their tears will start running it's not even a normal thing you know from one minute they're happy next minute it's just like Water Works and all these things what is that that's a spirit trying to get you under its control if you sympathized with their emotion then that Spirit can start to control you in the situation but you see we're not ordained we're not ordained to to to sympathize with with Spirit see that's that's being emotionally manipulated right and it's the same thing in that dream where where where all those sisters who are in that room they came under the influence of that spirit because they being scared and worried and panicking seeing the demon manifest right but then now when when when Christine told them start worshiping what happened is is instead of coming under the influence of that Spirit they brought God down into the situation where he could take control she had perfect peace going into that room right but now the others forgot their position that's why we should not get upset we shouldn't get worried we should you say well I'm feeling worried about something call God on the scene because prayer and worship puts God in control right it gives God the right of way amen stress and worry does not give God the right of way you take that stress and worry to God in prayer and you watch him come on the scene I mean so so so once they all started worshiping then she rebuked that spirit and left the person right and then and then I had a dream it's probably kind of opposite where I was we were overseas somewhere and this little church was all white and these things and you know there was no song service no no music no nothing and I tried to get up and preach and everyone started interjecting and talking and all these things there was no order there why because the people weren't and and then well I got woken up by a four-year-old landing on my head but anyway you know but you see you know there was he just clapped with that anyway but you see you see so because the people weren't under the spirit of God it brought a chaos everyone's opinion you know started talking about the Apostle Paul and some kid got up and said now let's read all the quotes and scriptures about the Apostle Paul like seg w everything it's just a total chaos you see we can't take it take things into our own our own hands got to let God you say well I'm going through a Troublesome time have you let God take it or are you holding on to it you know you got to commit it all into his hands and then praise him and trust him that he is in control amen amen now you see this this in Hebrews 11 here seeing him who's invisible right it means to be acquainted with by experience to experience so it sure it means to see with the eyes but we see Moses did not see God by natural eyes he he he became acquainted with him acquainted with him at the burning bush so he could walk he could walk by by faith and not by sight now brother says and looking to the Unseen if there ever was a time that the church needs to step across that line which separates you between faith and unbelief by sight and looking at the Unseen by faith it's now that's when we leave everything behind you every care every weary everything that says you can't be a Christian i've smoked too long I've drank too long brother Braham I've lived in adultery I don't care what you say and what you've done though your sins be as Scarlet you once pass that line of barrier of the devil trying to torment you saying you can't do it you can't do it I say I can do it for Jesus said whosoever will let him come and drink from the Waters of of the Fountain of Life freely leave it behind amen so we got to take we we must take those things the devil says you can't do and you've got to leave all those things behind now there's a great thing in this day where well I just I'll just come to this slide brother says this in the same same message see it doesn't take an intellectual mind it takes a surrendered heart to the will of God God am mean so now you say well none of us are intellectual well intellectualism is not just is not just being very learned being educated that's not an intellectual mind necessarily right that's just being educated but an intellectual mind is examining every point and and and wait let's see if I can find this here make sure I get it all right here see an intellectual mind is not necessarily a a educated mind many times we think an ed um intellectual mind as some great Bible scholar some great scholarship that gone through great Halls of learning but an intellectual mind is someone who must understand everything that they've got to get in order in their mind or their feelings their memories have everything sorted out then they then they say they have faith but that is not having faith that's just trying to get everything sorted in your mind right is trying to reconcile you know I feel this way and this is going on and this is happened and see that's an intellectualism you see but we're not but an intellectual mind can never do it it takes us surrendered it takes a surrendered heart to the will of God Amen so we've got to lay aside those things you say well I've got to work this out then I can believe it no that's not faith faith receives it before they see anything they hear anything they even before they understand it amen they receive the word and then God will bring the understanding you see the world has it vice versa I need all the facts then can believe no that's not even Faith that's just receiving facts right but faith is a genuine I receive the word and then God will bring everything into order amen you see it's you it's very it's you know so don't try and intellectualize see the devil will try and intellectualize the word to you and he'll always pin you down with it remember remember last Sunday or the Sunday before I was talking about you know the you know there was that um you wrestling match you we're in this great wrestling match going on and you know a wrestler comes out they've got all these intellect sexual beads around their trunks that won't help nothing so all these trinkets of well I understand this and this doctr means this and you know my feelings are like this therefore I've got faith here I don't have faith here all these things that's just intellectual beads and you get pinned by the enemy on the mat sure as ever amen but but if you've got a hidden strength of and what is that hidden strength God said so I'm his child his word is right in every condition irrespective of how I feel what I'm going through the things I remember see the devil will take your memory anoint it but pervert it and never bring you out bringing the victory right he'll always take your memories your conscious affection reasoning affections all those things right and he'll take it against you you see but that's how the intellectual mind he wants to keep us on an intellectual thought of does it make sense you know he tries to complicate it with all every smallest trying to work out all the smallest details I say that is not faith that is being intellectual so we need to we need to lay aside those things now I'm just I feel like I'm segwaying all over the place but we'll end up somewhere maybe we're just doing a Ticky tour but you see now the oh wait where is that one anyway well we're here now this is quite you think about you know it's very easy to read things and just gloss over them right the Apostle Paul says here now see that none render evil for evil unto unto any man but ever follow that which is good but both among yourselves and to all men Rejoice everm more pray without ceasing and everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you now the Waymouth uh New Testament translation says in every circumstance of Life be thankful for this is God's will in Christ Jesus respecting you so the Apostle Paul is saying whatever state you find yourself in that's God's will now now I'm not talking about being in sin now but I'm talking about well I'm going through a valley that's the will of God concerning you I'm on a mountain that's the will of God concerning you I'm distressed we got a great problem in our life that's the will of God concerning you amen you see see because many times you know because we're think talking about being shod you our feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace right so you think now if if our footsteps are ordained of the Lord you know then then we're going to have a perfect walk but what does that even mean who wants a perfect walk right now remember the devil will take an idea humanize it and it's always P opposite to how God says it should be and then so we think well I'm not having this perfect walk that I've actually imagined is not true therefore I'm not an overcoming Christian but a perfect walk is is see see many times we think a perfect walk is we have no worry the Devil Comes against us there's no problem we just overcome him we never put a foot wrong everything goes fine yep ises that that's my definition of a perfect walk I never have any doubts I never have any fluster I never feel carnal I never you know worry and you know I never have any trouble right isn't that what you think a perfect walk is but that's not how God says a perfect Walkers no not at all because the APO and surely if I have this perfect walk I will never be in any kind of dark place trouble a valley no but you see fruit is not growing on the Mountaintop it's growing in the valley and then what does even Jesus say I am the vine you're the branches right and then I'm basically going to prune you that you bear more fruit am mean she said well I'm going through a real pruning time I feel all like there's just nothing going on I'm going through hardship that's the will of God concerning you you say well that's a that's quite a mouthful to swallow but it is this is what the apost this is what God's telling the Apostle Paul here whatever state you find yourself in be content for this is the will of God concerning you amen this is God's will so because a perfect walk is not one without trouble it has trouble it has hardship it has questions it has times when we feel overwhelmed and we can't go on that's actually part of a perfect walk because through all of those things I mean God God is wanting to express himself he's wanting to reveal himself through it now I'm just trying to find you know even even you know the you you think about the Apostle Paul before he became a Christian he didn't have any trouble the only trouble he had was was trying to find a better argument than the next guy in his Ivory Tower and then the and then and then the next trouble he had was I going to destroy this this this cult that's risen up of Jesus Christ of Nazareth he wasn't Shipwrecked at that time he you know he was never beaten he was never thrown into prison he was never run out of town by a copper Smith he never had trouble with with with false brethren in the church he he he never had any of those troubles but you see when he became a Christian what his feet actually got shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace amen that he would now he because he was now going to walk through trouble but you could say the Apostle Paul had a perfect walk I mean because he said when he came to the end of it he said I have a Crown of Life awaiting me not only me also but all those that love his his appearing right do you see now the Apostle Paul you say well he went through a lot of hardship that wasn't on account of him right God had to take him through those things that finally when he came to this he says I have learned for whatsoever State I am therefore to be content remember he' write to Timothy and say it's getting cold Winter's coming bring my coat here's a man who had the who's a prophet age messenger Prophet messenger for the age I mean he wrote most of the New Testament but yet he he he would end up in prison he'd say and and and he would be so you know uh so what do you call it have basically nothing he'd tell Timothy bring my coat that I left behind he' say I had a thorn in the flesh the Satan buffeting me right but he had a perfect walk those things actually were not even part of oh you'd say well if that happened you know if he had this thing going on how could he have a perfect walk no God ordained his steps you see it's the same thing with brother Braham everything he went through the hardship he went through you see that all got him to a point that he's in Sabino Canyon the sword came in his hand am mean the king's word amen a an adopted son could receive a word amen to preach to the bride of Christ all those things were ordained in his life I would say humanly he did not have a perfect walk because of all that hardship but looking from God's perspective God ordained his steps to walk through all those things would we agree amen because he never got to a stage in his life where God said no the third pole you can't you can't have it the opening of the word you can't actually the whole point of your ministry you can't have no God ordained his steps to get him to that position that he would receive the word and fulfill his commission amen so it's the same thing with us friends you say well my walk is far from perfect are you sure are you walking with the word do you love him amen do you love him do you want more of him I say well then your walk is perfect you say well my bank account's full of zeros does that mean your walk's not perfect as and and there's no one before the zeros I just said zeros right you say I don't I don't know what tomorrow brings does that mean your walk is not perfect it's a perfect walk you see we've been where I find this here see the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord do we believe that see an intellectual man will look at that and say well if the ordered of God then certain things must take place right this will happen I'll be blessed this way this is how this is going to work out this is how I'm going to feel you know going to analyze everything but you see an intellectual mind cannot receive it no it's it's a surrendered heart to the will of God you see and if you really realize that the state you're in is the will of God concerning you see that scripture that scripture covers every situ if you're a Believer now if you're not a Believer become a Believer right then you can really rest in whatever state you're in if you're not well get into the get into the um City of Refuge as fast as you can but you see our footsteps are ordered by the Lord and it's easy to look back in history and say well Moses yes of course his steps were ordered and yes yo Joseph his steps were ordered and Jacob's steps were ordered and all these ones were ordered but what about you what about you could you realize actually God has brought you here for a specific purpose for a certain time I could even say that the thief on the cross's walk was perfect God allowed him you say well you know people have gone through great hardship why would that see the analytical mind would say or the intellectual mind would say the thief did not deserve what he received because of his previous life had nothing to do with it God God allowed him because God allows everything to do everything he did now now this is not a small thing this ain't to me this is not skim milk cuz you look at what he did he he he earned his position on the cross the thief did he earned it he he was not some guy who was just in the wrong place in the wrong time with the wrong company no he earned that he earned that but he was ordained to be one of the last or the last saint of the Old Testament to be sealed away amen and and God ordained that he would come to that position to show you and I that doesn't matter what we've been through what we've done mer still there if you look and look to the Unseen amen look Beyond the Veil and see the Lamb of God hallelujah so I say his footsteps were ordered he wasn't a good man well he actually was a good man because he saw the Messiah in his day that's what makes a man a good man sure there's Christian basic Christian principles all those things but you see what made him good to me is because he didn't see Jesus like the scribes and Pharisees he didn't see Jesus like like the Roman soldiers he saw Messiah amen his footsteps were ordered now I feel like we're you see it's not so what is that what is that um heart that surrendered to the will of God the will of God is the word of God that's what it takes doesn't take an intellect you just got to receive the word by faith and walk on right we can't you can't stand there see the devil loves to analyze everything over and over and over again and this is the age of analytics even even Sports people they wear these certain GPS things and it measures the you know the badges as they practice and they and they compete measures their heart rate their everything you know their steps they can follow themselves on the field map it all out everything it's it's incredible time of analytics is it not and the devil wants to take the same thing into our Christian walk you got to analyze everything you don't have to analyze anything walk by faith take God at his word and walk on I mean cuz otherwise you'll be sitting in the devil's dark room trying to analyze everything and you'll be caught up in his hamster wheel of trying to say well this and this and that and that you say forget that no it takes a surrendered heart to the will of God Amen and that's what we want I believe that's what we have amen praise the Lord now I'm just going to because time time's slipping away so I just want to see we have to accept the word by Revelation right brother Bram would you know he was approached by a Baptist ministry he says we just got to basically just get the Greek straightened out and then and then you know everything will be fine see we got to get we'll never be able brother Bram to get the things together till we get every word upon word upon word exactly with the Greek and so forth I said oh sir you better you uh you know better than that I said even in the nice year councel way back as far as 300 years from the death of Christ they were still debating which Greek scholar was right you can know it's a revelation the whole thing now there's nothing wrong with taking the Greek and taking all the scripture and the quotes but you got to have the power of God to reveal it to you so you can't just analyze it all and say well this make sense no that's all fine but the but God has got to reveal it to you that it becomes a reality and then he says I cannot accept Revelation and I said then how can you accept Christ you see unless you're willing to accept the word by faith you can't accept Christ you can you can accept a historical idea of of of him dying on the cross but it's got to become a revelation cuz he is his word amen now let's go back to this thought the steps of a good man are ordered of the lord we read this in Psalms the other day in family prayer says now the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou maintain us my lot the lines have fallen unto me in Pleasant places yay I have a goodly Heritage I Will Bless The Lord who hath given me counsel my Reigns also instruct me in the night Seasons I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved so in other words I will endure CU I've set the lord always before me now we got to realize that with this with our feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace now God has given us a goodly Heritage to walk in right he's given us like Abraham was told walk around the land whatever you see is yours right Joshua was told footsteps mean possession walk up the breadth of the land this is your inheritance right so he was ordained to walk in every place that God ordained him to walk so we're going to realize that as Joshua was given Authority to walk on every promise receive every promise so do we right but we've got to receive it by faith not by an intellectual understanding amen say he says the the lies are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places that means the lines are your inheritance they're fallen in Pleasant places have they not today I just want to say let's walk in peace let's walk in peace doesn't matter doesn't matter what because our what is our inheritance that we have authority and dominion over every work of the enemy that every promise Jesus died on Calvary for to receive we would receive every Redemptive blessing of Jehovah God is ours is yours amen it's yours this so this is your inheritance so walk in it never let the devil push against you say you don't deserve it you don't you're actually not even in the question you see it's like if I was Elon Musk who's valued at I don't know how many billion now and I said I give half of it to to brother Ed now you can fuss at him all you want saying well you don't deserve that Ed I've got greater needs in my family but he could say it wasn't up to him it was up to me you see and so what does the devil do God says I give you all things in Christ Jesus right I give I give you every promise every promise of the message every promise of the Bible is yours the devil fusses at you saying you don't deserve to receive it and for some reason we have to feel like we have to defend our ourselves and reply to him right but what we really should say is devil see what is that when he F you have that feeling come in your heart I'm not worthy I can't receive this I've done too much wrong look at my past look at my current day look at what I'm going see that's the devil coming at you saying it's not yours but you've got to take that and say Satan I wasn't the one who gave it to me I wasn't the one who gave it to me I did not come and get this no it came to me amen every Redemptive blessing of God has come to me through the message of the hour so Satan you are actually fussing with the wrong person go talk to the one who's given it out take up your fuss with him amen so we're going to stop arguing with the devil about what we deserve and we just got to receive what God has given amen we to realize that our lies have fallen Toto me in Pleasant places yay I have a goodly Heritage amen we're going to we're going to just walk in peace because that same word peace there in Ephesians is the same peace that God told Mary who anointed his feet with you know with oil and Simon the Pharisees house how how how Jesus said to her thy sins be forgiven thee go in peace it's the same peace go in the messiah's peace and we are walking in that same Peace So what's the summary of all this whatever situation you come in realize let the peace of God rule it well how do I do that worship and praise God don't try and take it under your own control cuz prayer what does prayer do it puts God in control right don't try and work out in your own mind how things are going to happen commit it to the Lord have a conversation with your counselor and he will bring a resolution right and realize that you are ordained no matter what enemy comes against you that Spirit whatever Devil Comes against you all of Hell could come against you you got to realize you've been you've been given a footwear to trample on every single one of them okay and it wasn't you that gave it to you God gave it to you so let's walk in peace walk in the love the Lord can we have the musicians please this morning we're just going to finish it there amen let's walk [Applause] on Amen praise the Lord now brother Isaac I'm going to put you on the spot as always we need a song Amen let's stand let's stand and and let's um let's just bow head shall we and um we're going to we're going to just pray and then I'm going to turn the service over to brother Isaac we can have a Time worship and praise but let's just bow our heads you say I just want to ask you a question who wants to walk in that peace you say maybe you say Lord I'm sorry I haven't walked in your peace recently I've been taking it all upon myself trying to work these things out trying to be all intellectual about it he said Lord may I look down at my Footwear and realize my feet have Shi with the preparation of the gospel of peace may I walk in that peace now amen let's pray gracious Heavenly Father you see the hands that have been raised dear God I just want to ask you'd forgive us Lord when we don't walk in your peace when we forget what you have made us Lord forgive us for that dear God I pray father that every situation we're in Lord we may not know the answer to it but Lord if we just turn to you Lord in prayer if we just take our needs before you father and wait upon you Lord you'll give us the answer
