the name of our Lord Jesus Christ it's a privilege for me to be here once again this evening amen I'm not here in my own capacity amen and uh I want to announce that I represent the Lord amen so I'm I'm not here for myself amen and I pray that you have prayed up for me amen as I have prayed for you amen that we have come in one purpose and one goal Hallelujah that the Lord will speak tonight before without Much Ado I I want to borrow I forgot to ask my my wife a phone because my my phone battery is finished then I can just set the time upy please batter is finished okay um I can look at the watch but I'm good with digital so we thank the Lord tonight amen we're going to read the scripture without Much Ado while you are standing and then we'll read the book of Hebrews chapter 8 amen oh thank you my sister Hebrews chapter 8 without much waste of time thank you very much musicians may the Lord bless you we appreciate what you're doing every Wednesday and every Sunday yes God bless you amen amen hallelujah music goes a long way with the word of the Lord amen and if he done well things happen in the presence of the Lord amen so we will read the book of Hebrews brother Ed please don't show my first slides for the scriptures don't show that because I think I've used a different version so I would like us to read from from one version oh I've got two tablets okay I'll use this one so Hebrew chapter 8 we'll jump a few verses and go to the other verses just try to be as quick as possible Hebrews chapter 8 let's read verse one sorry I'm a little bit nervous because I haven't been here in a long time so just bear with me if you see that I'm the Bible says here verse one Hebrews chapter 8 now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum so basically what Paul is saying here this is the summation of the things that we' have been talking about if you read from verse chapter one of Hebrews and you just read go through with it go through with it you will hear and follow the thought process or the inspiration of Paul what he's trying to say God in s time spoke through the prophet you know you you'll follow he talking about the priesthood and the and and and the and the and the priest and the perfect sacrifice that's what the thought that Paul is talking about there that's the process so he says here in verse 8 the first part of that verse chapter 8 he says now this is which we have spoken this is the PS ah I don't know if I should say this is the climax this is the p the peak amen we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens Hallelujah then we will jump to verse same chapter verse 5 to8 we serve unto the example and Shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle for see saith he that th th make all things according to the pattern showeth to thee in the mountain in the mount but now had he obtained a more excellent Ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better Covenant which was established upon upon better promises let's pray then I can let you see down Heavenly Father Lord you know that I'm incapable of ministering even to your children father and I'm the least to be to be chosen to stand here father but it's not about me this evening it's not even about my capabilities or my incapabilities it's not what I can do or what I can't do it's nothing to do with me Lord help me tonight to take that thought out of my mind and out of my heart and focus on you father just like I'm praying for the brothers and sisters to take the thought of brother Paul and who is standing in the front Lord and just come in the altar in the holy of holies with you tonight that will benefit us so much tonight if only we can find ourselves in your presence with all our mind our soul and our heart and our attitude just for just for a moment father that will do us a great benefit and I pray Lord that you forgive us our sins forgive us our iniquity Lord those things that we sometimes do them deliberately forgive us those ones father and and help us to to be better children next time to please you father to strive to seek to please you bless your people Lord I understand they're tired Lord and they've been doing things during the day we just want your intervention tonight just intervene Holy Spirit and just capture their hearts and their focus into your word that Lord you can get the glory and the honor take this time father we commit it to you come and speak the oracles come and change lives come and heal come and do as you please is our desire it will please us greatly as your bride tonight we ask these things thanking you Lord in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and we all say amen amen we may take the Comforts of your our seats and um so let's finish up that part uh I want to finish uh verse up to verse 10 verse S now for in that first Covenant this is now the old time Covenant we are talking tonight about the New Covenant the New Covenant spoken in the book of Hebrews that's the Covenant that was made now by the Lord Jesus Christ for you and for me now he's referring here Paul for in that first Covenant has been for if sorry if if that first Covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second are we together if that that first Covenant of under the the blood of ghosts and sheep and whatever if that Covenant if that Covenant that was done that time was faultless there was no need then for a New Covenant that's what Paul is trying to say there uh verse eight for finding fault with with them he said behold the days come said the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah are you spiritual Israel tonight not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I look them in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt not that one but because the they continued not in my Covenant and I regarded them not sayeth the Lord so the old covenant could not stand let's read verse 10 for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days say the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God yeah thank you Lord and they shall be to me a people amen hallu I believe it let's read the 10 and 12 11 and they shall not teach every man with his neighbor and every man his brother saying no know the Lord For All Shall know me for the least to the from the least to the greatest in other words he is going to do the job because he would have written his law in their hearts this reminds me of Ezekiel 26 amen so now as I said brothers and sisters you can jump to the third to the third slide my brother I can do that sorry I can do that yeah in fact I like that PR thing like brother Tess this one so so we hear here brothers and sisters that there is a covenant and this Covenant is about us who understand what the Covenant is H a covenant is is sort of like an agreement it's it's a it's a it's called promises inside in in the worldly way we can say it's more like you can say like a you know you can maybe you say a will or say a contract or say an agreement of some sort you know you can have an agreement with someone and you you can have a legal contract that will bring the covenants that are highlighted in there that form the process of the Covenant right now the format and the pattern of the format I mean of the Covenant is designed by the parties that are involved in that Covenant the parties that are part and parcel of the Covenant amen I wrote here that it can take you know it must take both parties must be in agreement in a covenant there must be in agreement you know like a marriage covenant a marriage a marriage is like a covenant yeah I you know it's like a you know we we it's a love Covenant so now but but but but a covenant or a contract in the worldly in the Earthly way you know is time bound yeah it's got a time frame we know that our covenant is is is eternally bound got no time limits the time frame of our Eternal Covenant is eternal that's the time frame for for our one that you and me are under amen but I'm trying to give you a context of what actually the a covenant is and it is binding huh it is binding you don't have to say you can't say no no no I I don't want to do this or I will do this no no it has got the terms and conditions it has got um it is enforceable you you if you don't want to be bound by the Covenant or the contract the other party whom you are involved with can take you to court to enforce it because it's an agreement we have agreed that every Thursday l cost beans will collect the rubbish at the door of my house that's an agreement and we agreed that I will pay them every week so much yeah we agreed about the size of the bin from their end they look at those kind of conditions what size of the bean did I put today is it their Bean or not their Bean huh what did I put inside the beIN what time did they they come did they come this week now I look at those so we hold each other accountable that's a worldly or an Earthly agreement right so but with God there's a different Covenant it is a covenant but I'll show you now how it works and then also I wrote um you know it must give effect to something things must happen in in a covenant it cannot just be a silent agreement we love each other but nothing is a penny amen I never tell her that I love her I never take her out I never tell her she's beautiful she never tells me I'm strong so what kind of a covenant is that one huh oh boy is that is there a it's silent it cannot be silent our covenant with the Lord is not a silent one amen there are things that must take effect there there is things that I'll show you now that in that Covenant there are built in the Covenant there are the benefits of the Covenant you know when they give you when they give you a de of sale a contract of a land or a property they certain covenants that they write in there they call them covenants that you know there are certain boundaries and there certain agreements that you know you must allow people to pass through your plot if it's in the way that's part of the Covenant you can't one day come and say no even if the road is passing on my property no one can drive through no there's a covenant in the agreement of of sale that we must go through the baes yard and drive through there it's a public road but it's bailees yard you understand what I'm trying to say that's part of the Covenant so now um I want to read what I wrote here if you don't operate and live according to the spirit of the Covenant then you are in Bridge you are Bridging the Covenant don't be afraid I'm going to show you now that your part of the Covenant is very light that's that's how beautiful this our covenant that that we WR we write about here is the of this world is heavy we must be equal you do your part I do my part if you are taking the Lion Share of the covenantal prophets you do more that's building into the agreement you can't expect me to do more but but you are taking more profits and vice versa huh so it's heavy I hold you to the letter the Covenant although is unconditional our covenant is unconditional we have been given an unconditional Covenant it's not going to be based on he because he is I'm going to go ahead of myself because God his omnicient he he knows the end from the beginning he already saw you and knew you and buildt you accordingly so that when you are here on Earth no matter what the devil can do you are going to fulfill the conditions everything about the Covenant you are going to believe God you are going to do everything that he expect from you to do why because he'll give you a heart and a spirit to do that if the enemy makes you to reject you will do it because it's part of his Covenant this Covenant is not like the one of Moses and them that was faultless it was found wanting in other words it was not enough it was it was a negative of our covenant our Covenant is a superior better one it is the One That Forgives your sins and they remember no more with that one you part of that when you bring your sacrifice according to that Covenant you'll do it you'll bring the sacrifice every year right that's that was that was part and pzle of that Covenant every year and you'll inspect so even next you still remember I beat my wife she probably didn't forgive you but you said no no I took the sacrifice to the priest the the lamp was clean so do not remind me but with this Covenant you beat your wife you repent you you you repent we talk to you as the brothers God forgives you your wife remembers no more she forgives you completely and unconditionally I'm not saying Brothers must beat their wives I'm just or let's say let's say s the sister beat the brother let's say if your wife beats you and then she repents then you forgive you unconditionally after she slapped you she the brother forgives her with love unconditional actually this is the appropriate example how we offend the Lord Jesus Christ how we offend him and we repeatedly do it because of this guy the prophet saw a vision and every time one of us Sinn here on Earth you know he goes he goes like this almost like we are Rec crucifying him that's what that's what our sins do to him yeah but he still forgive you that's the pattern and the the type of a covenant which you are under it's no more an an a hand for a hand an eye for an eye it's no more under that kind of laws right so I wrote as well here that Covenant this Covenant cannot be amended it cannot be changed because God made it me and you cannot change it as and when we go along we can't we cannot as we feel this way or we feel that way or we think this way or no this Covenant it demands of us to love one another and there's our part and there's his part I'll show you that's why God doesn't want us to interfere with this Covenant rather to live according to it and the spirit of the Covenant and the provisions of the Covenant of the of this law of this word because God is eternal omnicient I I already spoke about that so he knew it from the beginning so I I've got this thing that I want to show you why God had that Covenant I'll show you this so I didn't have that notice board to lift up this thing like this I can ask one of the young people to who doesn't mind to hold it for you and then you can see see can you see nicely Dave I love you my brother so this is this is how they used to do agreements in the old Chinese you know way in the olden days and they used to have you know an agreement whether for you take your drling in or whether you take then we have an agreement and but the agreement is that when you when you come to fet whatever you want to fetch um you must bring the same receipt that corresponds with you so I want I want to show you that God and us are going to be the same God want me and you to be like exactly like him to fit because he made us to be Co equals so who can tell me where where will this this portion fit between these two why not the bottom but why are why are you judging why are you judging this one why why can't it be this one or maybe even this one how can it be this way this way how I feel like you are judging the other part why do you choose this [Music] one you're not judging it what I what what can someone tell me why are we choosing this one brother Andy [Laughter] predestination so so that's that's a powerful answer man brother in school he mustn't get 100 he must get 200% what but but what's another reason why why are we saying this one best is the best fit I feel like it can go here come on look look the line you see look look at this line look at this line can you see that why is it mag you don't so the Lord wants you to fit the way he saw you from the beginning from the Min that's how he wants to see you sorry from the beginning that's how he wants to see you that's how we say beginning in my house he wants you to come this is the Lord he wants to prepare you to reflect him so that you and him can you can fit exactly means to the the perfect Feit it means in my language to Feit exactly perfectly like no no no comma can you see that that's how the Lord wants you to feed and what is interesting about it is that I wanted to show you with the other one is that this one sorry Dave this one that I wanted to show you wanted to make a small and a big one because we are the smaller part but he wants to make us part of the bigger part he wants to make us part of the bigger hole but right now we are still in a smaller for format but he wants to make that teaspoon of the ocean in us to be exactly like what is in the ocean and the fit exactly when they test everything in there even the waves are in are in the spoon yeah you can't see them but they're there look at this one imagine if we say no no this one must must feed that's how the devil want us to be the devil wants to match us with him like this you know to force it and say no no this is upside this this must be like this you see he'll show you that you see this this pattern here it goes with this one that's the devil's Doctrine he show you and he will then give you a reasoning why this line is on the left you know when you write is on the left and then this is the top right right and he blind you not to see the because this is another seron for some another time you we need to be able to pray for the knowledge and understanding of the word of God to know ourselves to know our Lord that uhuh me our lord said is in A4 format this is how our lord said a format it must be exactly the same no corners it must measure there there there this way you you telling the devil you the devil can't tell you that no it's 30 cm from that no no no no I my father in his weight how can you do that if you not eating the weight this and this and this is a perfect format how the Lord want this is exactly how God want us wants to see us to fit with him and his weight now thank you so much brother I love this brother if no one da just know that I love thanks man I challenge you okay Dave sorry let me not tell them all right so that is how the Lord want us to be there my part she's my life and there's the Lord okay I'm ripping up now God's covenant is a love Covenant is a love Covenant his components are his words his word sustains us his word is the one that gives us salv gives us salvation there's so many benefits the list is endless what I wrote there is is is just maybe a drop in this Covenant he promised us so many things he's going to fulfill them and he know he's going to fulfill them and there's another part of this Covenant which is my life our part of the Covenant must also be a love Covenant there's no way we are going to say that we love the Lord and you don't love my brother or you love my brother but you can't love the lord it's not going to fit in that it's not going to fit it's going to be a misfit and you completely surrendered Hearts eating his word on a daily basis praying brother Armand was preaching to us praying every day surrendering brother Tess was telling us so all these elements all these things are for for they form part and parcel of the great new better Covenant which you and me are under the question is are we playing by the spirit of the Covenant we are and we must keep on confessing believing Lord here am I amen sacrifice my heart amen circumcise my heart this is the attitude we need to come to the Lord with every day this is what should be occupying our minds more daily Amen in the book of of Philippians that I may know him don't have to to open it actually we have to open it this version that I've used I don't I I don't I I don't I don't appreciate it I'm finishing I'm 24 minutes now so mustn't be tired and wrap up and just just to encourage you that brothers and sisters you have been purchased with a great prize so don't unell yourself don't un don't cheap don't undercut yourself huh your behavior your thinking your judgments everything that you do they must not reflect you are UND discounting yourself a lot you are Bridging the contract you under selling yourself you have not realized who you are realize who you are by the time by by thriving and asking the Lord to fit within this Covenant it's a superior Covenant amen one of the things that is interest me a lot let's jump let me give you a task to go and read that scripture at home Philippians 3 the only thing that I wanted to highlight there was verse 10 that says H I'll just read it anyway that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering there's also sufferings in this Covenant huh there the the sufferings as as and those sufferings and persecutions we take with joy did I take you we take them with joy we are if you take them complaining you're going to be repeating the guys that came from Egypt to to to Canaan they took them maming they said now we are thirsty come on now and we want watermelon and garlic they are not here imagine saying you can't enter the promised land because you you they didn't give you watermelon and garlic on the way so let us not be spoiled I'm sorry to say that let us not be spoiled let us strive towards the High Calling The Mark of the High Calling amen that should be our desire that is burning in our hearts every day amen cuz this Covenant is great brothers and sisters there you have not seen some of the things that are in store waiting for you they're waiting for you brother was telling here that will be working on gold that we have not begun to speak about the engineering of that town of that City you have not started you have not heard how can we you complain or you hear if I die I die here on Earth if I die I die another brother made a statement and said oh you say you are afraid of the witches The Witches no no no no no if they kill me let them if God said no you're going to be die by through Witchcraft and they'll kill you bring them on yeah let let me die for the Lord because the Lord said it how can I change it if I die through that let me die but I'm on Coss I cannot sacrifice and say ah oh which no no no no no you need to know your place your position you disase go out and I'm commanding you this week I'm commanding you we want new new new new KES period am period and the devil needs to know that we we have to claim it and help one another to claim it my boy was in a pool Brothers prayed and they prayed in the middle of the night they prayed and the boy survived here he's 17 years today the Lord saved him when the doctor peditrician who was helping him said I don't understand and there's many testimonies Among Us why can't we claim it why can't we align ourself our lives for them yeah amen that she get no no we didn't marry them to to to to to our sister to Ser we want you amen the Lord said that ask amen we don't and it didn't say ask once and forget ask and let's cry as if it's you you see the day you cry as if it's you if You Weep like I weep then you know let me just stop come on Proverbs 3 lean not unto thy own understanding you see if we if we wanted understanding of a human being here all of us brother KU intellectual brother mishak intellectual brother fish intellectual Brother Andy topnotch intellectual if we could live with the understanding and bring it together here do you think we were going to agree and Sister Louise she's F don't look at imagine if all of us were going to be using each other's intellectualism and mind and understanding that's why he said no no lean not on that one amen lean on the my understanding the Holy Spirit lean on that one everything that we do we must lean on the understanding of the lord we must we must lean on his understanding otherwise our ideas our views my views will mislead you the views of the Lord and the Holy Spirit are the ones that are going to make us one Mind One voice when we speak that's why the prophet when he shot you know the Lord made him a prophet until when he shoots he was not happy it was like the world is finishing if you didn't shoot that bullet one hole 10 of them maybe one hole because the of what is accurate so let's finish by reading these two quotes and and we just go home God's church is to be run up by the baptism of the Holy Spirit then if we have this baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is going to run the church then it doesn't take too much intellectual doesn't take education it takes the Holy Spirit that's God's program end of story amen now the church doesn't need a group of intellectuals the church needs the birth the church needs to be born again if the holy spirit is going to be led to to to lead the church then the holy spirit will lead the church not according to to the ritual culture whatever we think we are the best to do and better than who for that matter we are not no one is better than no one we are all God's children and the Holy Spirit must be whether you you think you studed let me stop it there so this Covenant is great brothers and sisters the musicians can come but this Covenant is powerful this Covenant is huge it's not a small Covenant it's an expensive Covenant oh yeah very expensive no amount of money can buy from this Earth so I want to leave you on that note and I was targeting 25 minutes but I failed again so I'm 31 minutes that's good definitely just record this send it to the brothers and sisters group I'm joking thank you my sister okay um in the spirit of that Covenant please go and read Hebrews 8 go and read Hebrews 8 and Hebrews 9 for me just those two then maybe the Lord will inspire you just to get more from what I failed to to say to you but hey tonight we we we want to demonstrate and protest to the devil today today you want to protest and say no no no no no let's not just say it with our lips let's go home and and find that pain that our brother Mario is feeling and cast that devil so many people we we can do it the Lord said we can do it I look here I come to church I look I check and the Lord said to me look at the children children can go around and sit with one another
