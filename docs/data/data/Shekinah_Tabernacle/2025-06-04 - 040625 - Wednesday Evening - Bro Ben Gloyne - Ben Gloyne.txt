Thank you, musicians. Amen. Good to see everyone here tonight. Amen. Praise the Lord. Trust you all well tonight. Amen. Everyone's well. Praise God. Amen. Let's just go to the scripture tonight. Uh let's have a um small thought here before we go to prayer. Um so we're going to go to uh Luke 5 and verses 1-9. Amen. So Luke 51-9 it says, "And it came to pass as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of uh Guinness and saw two ships standing by the lake, but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets. And he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust uh would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people out of the ship." Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, "Launch out into the deep, and let down thy nets for for for a draft." And Simon answering unto him, said, "Master, we have toiled all night, and have taken nothing. Nevertheless, at thy word, I'll let down the net." And when he had um and when they had this done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net break. And they beckoned unto their partners which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." For he was astonished and all that were with him at the draft of the fishes which they had taken. Amen. What a scene. Amen. Let's bow heads in a word of prayer tonight. Amen. If you have a need, I know we're going to pray tonight, but you want to lift up your hand even now and say, "Lord, come by my way." Amen. Gracious heavenly father, our hearts desire as we give ourselves to you, dear God. That you can use us. You can live through us, Lord. You be glorified in our in our lives. And as we have read your word, we're asking that you would anoint it, Lord, to our hearts, Lord, both speaker and hearer. And I pray, dear God, as as this as this meeting goes along, Lord, I pray you would fill us all with your Holy Ghost, dear God. May you touch every life. May you have preeminence, Lord. Come take control of all of us, Father. Lord, that when we come to pray, it would be none of us in our humanity praying, but it be you using our vocal cords, our lips, our tongues, Lord, to pray through us, Lord God, what you would have prayed. Father, we so glad we can bow our heads and our hearts in your presence, asking that you'd be merciful unto us, Lord, that your blood would cover us and may you come and take full control for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Lord, we also especially want to remember those who could not be here tonight. Lord, be their great abundant portion. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. And God bless you friends. You can have your seats tonight. And just want to just want to have a bit of a a just a small thought here from this from this um line where where Simon Peter would say unto unto the Lord, nevertheless at thy word will I let down the net. And I just want to ask this question. What could Jesus do with what you give him? It's amazing that everything the Lord would be given, he would multiply. He would make it a great thing out of even a little thing. And we have this scene here where where Jesus was uh pressed about by people and and and and there's the um two ships there by the lake and you know Simon Peter and and and the others fishing with him. They had already given up. They had already been fishing all night. They had already been trying and they hadn't caught a single thing. They hadn't got a single bite if we could say it that way. And they were already uh defeated. They had already given up. They washing their nets on the shore. But then the Lord asked if if he could borrow one of their boats. Now, brother Bram says that there's nothing the Lord does not borrow, but what he what he pays you for. He says he says, "Can I use your boat for a moment?" And he just got in the boat. And they pushed out a little bit. Then after he got through speaking, he said, "Come here, Simon, and you all." God never borrows nothing from you unless he pays you for it. Is that right? Jesus taken what faith the blind man had or what faith a woman had that was deaf and started with that building faith. See what I mean? He had he takes something to do something with. So he took Simon's boat and Simon I doubt very much he was excited to be on the boat again after being there all night. And sometimes we can be laboring and we can just be walking with the Lord feeling like we're not getting anywhere. But I tell you what, you're on the breakthrough of a miracle. Amen. God is about to do something miraculous. Like Simon Peter, it's amazing. He wasn't even under expectation for God to do anything, but yet God did something. And sometimes, you know, we can even get to a point where the devil uh gets it in our mind. What's the point in trying? But you know, but there's always in those moments, that's when God's about to step upon the scene. When all hope seemed gone, when you know, when trouble is just up to your eyeballs in trouble, that's when God steps on the scene and does something even greater than you could expect. Because I don't believe that they ever caught this many fish in their lives. Amen. But you see, they were obedient to the word of the Lord. They had the Messiah in their ship. They had the right ship. They had the right equipment. I'd say they had the right faith. The faith just had to be put into action according to his word. And then what happened? And God created the fish in the net. Hallelujah. Cuz I doubt very much before they dropped the net in the water, they would have seen a nibble or no no seagulls or whatever birds are on the Sea of Galilee gathering around where the fish are. But God, when the net went in, the fish got created in the net. Amen. So, see, they just put their nets into the hands of God and see what God did with it. Did a far greater thing than they could ever do just naturally fishing. And you see, so whatever God borrows, he pays back. Amen. He's no man's debtor. He will pay back and more. So, amen. You think of the great things that await those that love him. Yeah. It hasn't even mentioned, it hasn't even come into the mind of man how great that place is. You know, brother Bram would try and describe being past the curtain at time and he, you know, described that blue blueg grass field and how everyone looked and all those things. But when he came to try and describe the atmosphere of that place, English words couldn't even touch it. sublime. Couldn't even do it justice. How great it was to be in the just perfect love and no no sickness, hardship, pain, sorrow, nothing. Just to be in that atmosphere and because, you know, so so heaven is going to be far greater than we can fathom. Amen. Cuz God, you know, see the devil does the opposite. He'll use someone and throw them away. But God, God asks, uh, you know, can he use us? Can he step into our lives? Can he use us for his, you know, for the finishing of his plan of redemption? And then he doesn't throw us away. He takes us home with him. Praise the Lord. So, here they are and they and they said, "Nevertheless, Lord, at thy at thy word, we're going to let down the net." So, Lord, at thy word, we're going to we're going to follow your word. What you've commanded us to do, we're going to do it. We've been trying all night and we've given up, but now because you've commanded us now, Lord, this is what we're going to do. Amen. And so the great and you know then and then there's also a time where you know where where Jesus had a had a big meeting and then he asked his disciples to you know we need to feed these people and they said it's we don't have enough money it's impossible and and then and then you know there was a boy walking along that was going to school but he heard the sound of the crowd and you know brother dramatized it and he says you know you know this boy's going to school but then he heard hears the cries and the hosanas and the glory hallelujah over the hill so he decides to skip school that Okay. And he, you know, goes towards the meeting and he crosses the hill. He sees all the people and he sees the prayer line up on the top of the hill. There's the Messiah there and, you know, all these things are going on. He finds himself somehow around where the disciples are because it's good to get close to where the Lord is. You know, you don't want to be in the back. You want to be really where his presence is. So, he, you know, is just drawn up there and then, you know, God times everything perfectly that when he came and kind of came into uh, you know, the, you know, what do you call it? hearing distance or whatever of the discussion of what's going on is the Lord is saying we need to feed them and where's the bread and all these things you know he just came along and you know and something in the boy just caused him to hold up his lunch something in the boy was responding to the need of the moment and he just lifted up his lunch to the Lord and you know and and and when the Lord saw it he said it's enough cuz he was the creator and he took those took those two loaves and f five loaves and two fishes rather and he and he began to bless it and break it and you know then it became you know, broke off cooked fish and cooked loaves and, you know, he, you know, fed that multitude of people and he made leftovers. I like that. Jesus makes leftovers. Amen. He makes He gives you more than enough. Not just enough, more than enough. He doesn't just He doesn't just balance out the ledger, he puts more than. Amen. So, I believe in leftovers. Amen. So, anyway, you see, praise the Lord. So, so, so there he was. So, so Jesus So, so the boy gave him his lunch and the Lord fed a multitude. So you think about, you know, the boy did not really fathom what was going to happen that day, but God knew the potential of what the boy was carrying. It's the same thing with our faith. You know, if we just give our faith, cuz many people, I think we wrestle with do we have enough faith or not? That's really not the question to be asking. Where have you placed that faith in or who have you placed that faith in? If you place your faith in the revealed word of the day, Jesus Christ himself. Amen. Then he can take your faith and multiply it. Amen. To do what his word says it will do. Because remember, it is God that fulfills his promises. It's not it's not the preacher that fulfills the promises or even you. It's he that performs his word. It's he that fulfills his promises. And he's the one that gave the promise. Right? You think of the body change, the rapture. Who's going to fulfill that? Well, the one who gave the promise. It wasn't a preacher. It wasn't the seventh age messenger, brother Brand, that gave the promise. It was the Lord. It wasn't the Apostle Paul that penned in the Bible. No, it was the Lord himself that gave the promise. And if he gave the promise then therefore he has the ability or more than enough ability to do it. Amen. Amen. So so so the important thing is what who who are you placing your faith in? It's not even a question of do I have enough faith or not. And you say even if I'm even if you feel lacking you be like that father with the son who had the epileptic spirit on him. Lord I believe but help my unbelief. So Lord take me the rest of the distance cuz I have a need in my life Lord and I but Lord take me to that place where it comes into manifestation. He will. He did it for the boy with the epileptic child. Do you think he'll not do the same thing for you? Amen. He took the boy's lunch and he fed the 5,000 and that's just the men counting the women and children. Do you not think he can take your faith? Amen. And multiply it, make it greater when you place it in his hands instead of you trying to humanly trying to work everything out, you place it in his his hands and let him fulfill his word. Isn't that beautiful? Amen. I'm so glad that whatever we place in his hands, he can he can meet the need with that thing. Amen. But you see, it's it's it's really the question also is not do you have enough faith cuz that's the devil's question. Oh, you don't have enough or and how does he know by the way, but it's actually our attitude towards the promise that matters. Amen. Cuz I think many times we focus on it. Maybe it's just me. I focus on myself too much. Turn the mirror onto the Lord. Look at him. Right? Stop looking at yourself and you. I know this is the selfie generation, but let's not be selfie Christians looking at ourselves. Let's look at the promise. Look at the one who gave the promise. Keep our eyes upon him. Who's the one who sent the message? Jesus Christ himself. Look at him. Amen. Look at his word. Look on this. Amen. Don't, you know, don't look on yourself or your track record or where you've been. That doesn't matter. Look at what he has said. Amen. But you see, it's the attitude we come. And this boy came with the right attitude. Here you go. Now, I remember being a young boy. Lunch was one of the favorite times of the day. the ending bell was the most favorite time, but lunch was the, you know, second favorite time. And I need to eat. Okay. So, this boy, I don't think he would part with his lunch for anything. But he saw something in him. Said, "Here you go, Lord. I'll give you this. I'm not going to be selfish with this, Lord." And so, he came with the right attitude. He didn't come fasting. He didn't he didn't he didn't kick up and throw a tantrum because he had to give his lunch away. He came with the right attitude. And it's the same thing when the Lord comes to us and says, "Give me. Can I borrow you? Can I use you?" It's not a tantrum or, "Oh, yes, I'm going to be a great person." No. Yes, Lord. You have the right attitude. Come with humility, love, and reverence. Right? Because Brother Ram says, "Before we pray for the sick," and we're going to be praying for the sick tonight. I mean, there's a lot of sick, you know, of us, there's sicknesses going around, all these things. So, he says, "But before we pray for the sick, we've got to get the people in that attitude." ude it's the attitude that always brings the results. I thought it was the music. I thought it was the dynamic preaching. I thought it was this or that. No, it's the attitude that brings the results. Amen. It's the attitude that you take towards God. What's your attitude? Well, Lord, you're more than able. Lord, you're in control. Lord, you're supreme. Lord, my life is in your hands. Whatever direction you want me to go, I know you're going with me because you're my shepherd. You're not going to send me away just by myself. You'll never leave me nor forsake me. So Lord, I know you know what's best for me. Hallelujah. Amen. Here's a woman that touched his garment. She was healed with a blood issue and a and a soldier spit in his face and put a crown of thorns on his head and felt no virtue. It's your approach. It's the attitude is what it takes. And that's what it is tonight, dear friend. It takes the attitude. We are and we believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ. But it's your attitude that brings the results. The dynamics is here and so I mean sorry. The mechanics is here and so is the dynamics. If you can just get started, God will do the rest. Well, how do you get started? Lord, I submit all everything into your hands, Lord. You're the supreme one. You made, you're the alpha and omega. You're the king of everything. Lord, I submit myself under your mighty hand. That's how you get started. Lord, I love you in every situation. I love you. I believe the Apostle Paul could have would have said that in the prison. Said that on the ship. Said that being on the run. Lord, I love you. I'm so thankful you found me on the road to Damascus. Lord, you turned my life around and I'm so glad that I'm your son and you're my God. Hallelujah. Amen. So, you see, Amen. So, so, so it's our attitude. But you see, we've got to we've got to uh surrender something, right? In order for him to get something, someone had to surrender something. So, the boy had to surrender his food and Peter had to surrender his boat. What if we and God just did those things with those things? What if we surrender all our life? What could he do? Amen. I'm just putting this. You say, "Well, I'm fully surrendered." Well, that's good. But what could he do through your life now if if we're in his hand? Amen. Amen. It's it's unlimited what he could do. Amen. Now, John Wesley said this, and I and and and I hope you can read this, but but this is what John Wesley saw in the potential of a surrendered group. He says, "Give me a hundred men who love only God with all their heart and hate only sin with all their heart, and we will shake the gates of hell and bring in the kingdom of God in one generation." That was John Wesley's conviction of the potential of a 100 men fully sold out to God. Amen. What could happen in this generation? You say, "Oh, that can't happen." Yeah, it can. We're living in the generation, by the way, the word's fully open. I mean, we're not under a partial reformation. soon under a full restoration. Right. God God is in his people once again. That's right. Amen. So, praise the Lord. Lord, there's great potential in my life that you can use me. Amen. To be a living witness to this generation. Now, the nice thing is it's not only things like boats or bread or our lives or things that that that we can give to the Lord. Okay? It says, it says here in in in 1 Peter 5, he says, "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God that he that he may exalt you in due time, casting all your cares upon him, for he carth for you." Amen. So you can give him you can give him your cares. Now, he doesn't multiply them, but he but he carries them. You know, like brother Ram would say, you know, his yoke is easy. His burden is light. And he says his yoke is actually lined with eagle feathers. I mean, there's a joy in being yolked with the Lord. Amen. you keep Calvary before you and his, you know, what he's done to you. His yoke is easy, his burdens light. Amen. And you can cast all your cares upon him. You know, I'm so thankful the Lord is not, you know, uh, he's not made like many husbands are that when that when their wives begin to pour out all their needs and their troubles and their trials that he doesn't say just toughen up and be quiet. He's not like that. He listens to all of our needs. He takes them on board. He doesn't get upset with us when we get overwhelmed and begin to just pour out our our, you know, needs and our problems and our vent our frustrations. He doesn't get frustrated with us. He doesn't even get annoyed at us. Amen. He cares. Amen. Our value in no way diminishes because we get overwhelmed. Amen. Here is Elijah and he's, you know, just had his great victory on Mount Carmel. He's now running for his life and, you know, he's sitting there under the juniper tree. He's all discouraged because he's running because Jezebel threatened to kill his life. And there he is. He says, "Lord, take my life from me. He requested for himself that he might die." And said, "It's enough, oh Lord. Take away my life. I'm no better than my fathers." He's just he's just pouring out his frustration and trouble. And he's overwhelmed. And you know, God doesn't tell him, "Be quiet, Elijah. You shouldn't be talking like that, Elijah. Harden up, Elijah. This is the facts, Elijah." No. No. He took those cares. God took Elijah's cares upon himself because Elijah was giving him something. Praise the Lord. And was he still the prophet of God? Absolutely. Was he going? Now listen, look at this. He's praying contrary to the will of God. Cuz the will of God for Elijah is he goes in a chariot ride, right? That's God's ordained path for Elijah. He's got to find Elisha. He's got to do different things, but he's not going to die. He's just going to take a step onto a chariot and go up into glory. But here he is praying completely the opposite to the will of God. Does God get upset? No. What does God do? He sends angels. He feeds him. He puts him back to sleep. He rests him. Amen. Because remember Elijah's going to uh the mountain where Moses was visited by God, right? This is this is his plan. And God doesn't tell him, "Don't go there." He doesn't intervene and say, "Look, where are you going? You're going the wrong way." He He knows that Elijah's overwhelmed. He just knows Elijah needs a break. Praise the Lord. Says you can cast all your cares, all your troubles. There's nothing you can't tell God. That he will get upset with you about. Amen. I I'm sorry. This is just how I view God. My God's a rock. He's stable. He can take anything. Amen. If he could take the sin of the world upon himself on Calvary, he can take my frustrations and my troubles and my confused mind and my thinking and all these things. He can take it all. Hallelujah. Why? Because he's my burden bearer. Amen. He can, you know, and what does he do? And I don't have it here, but the next few verses, you can read it. Go away and read it. Maybe this is homework. He sends an angel and he and he searches through heaven. He finds the best baker angel, right? Feeds him some cakes, puts him to sleep, I think, wakes him up again, feeds him again, and then gives him strength for his journey to the cave, right? And then and then when God then when Elijah's in the cave, God comes down, you know, you know, there's a whirlwind, there's a fire and all those things, but he comes God comes as a still small voice and says, "Elijah, what are you doing here?" Was he mad at Elijah? No. He just knew Elijah was overwhelmed. Praise the Lord. When my heart is overwhelmed, Lord, lead me to the rock that's higher than I. Right? You can cast all your cares. You can, this is a very stressful age. You can cast all your stress upon the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. And he doesn't multiply it. He takes it upon himself. Right? Like Moses was showing there when you the burning bush, how God tell him, "Take your hand, put it into your bosom." Pulls out it lepous. Put it in again. It became normal. So what is that showing? God saying, "I'll take your sin and your troubles. Put it into my bosom. Pull it out and it's gone." Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. So we can we can cast all our cares upon him because he cares for us. Amen. Aren't you glad? How I'm so thankful about that? You know, we can to me that gets us in the right attitude. Lord, you care. Lord, you're interested in everything. What I'm going through, I may be going in a cycle, going around the mountain, but yet you care about me, Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. I just want to finish with this. This is from uh the uh Africa Trip report. what he says. Now look friends, you might have, how do you say that? Sained. Sained. It's like, you know, when you fish, maybe Maron, you can help me. Do you know these kind of words? When you're like fishing and there's virtually no fish left in the lake or whatever, you're sing I think is what it is. Through every doctor's office in the country, you may have been in every clinic there has been there at the very best of our beloved doctors might have given you the last prescription they can. You've done everything. You might have been through this prayer line, that prayer line, this prayer meeting, this Why do you say tonight? This is Saturday night, tomorrow, Sunday.
