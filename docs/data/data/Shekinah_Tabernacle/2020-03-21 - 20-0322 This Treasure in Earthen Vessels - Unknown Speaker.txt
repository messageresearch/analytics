[Applause] [Music] I'm a nun you granny give you a piece of classical understanding I mean thank you musicians amen god bless you all let's just let's stand I just want to let's go to first Timothy chapter two we're going to want to talk about a few things first of you know they want to go into the scripture really but see is here in 1st Timothy 2 and 1 as we know we're facing unprecedented times he says I exhort thee therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all those that are an authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty so the scripture instructs us I mean you can have your seats now that's true yeah you're the scripture instruct us we should pray for those in leadership you know we need to pray for our government that they make the right decisions to stop this virus from spreading you know remember the most powerful force that brother Brahim seed the most powerful weapon that God has placed in the hands of man is prayer and you think about how God has washed us in his blood he's made us joint ears in Christ I mean the blood puts us back on speaking terms with God so our prayers can change governments right so because remember you see the the the the crisis that's unfolding in Europe is because the government's made the wrong decisions right so we need to pray for our governments that they make the right decisions when to shut the country down whatever you know that they need to do they do it at the right time right brother Brahim season and in the message why in 1961 he says and I thank God for every serum that they got for the Salk vaccine pray constantly that God will give us something for cancer for poor suffering people anything can do to help I'm for it yes sir I'm a hundred percent for it and if we Christian people would pray more for such things as that would be off the whole country would yes great men they give their lives just trying to fight back at those things that crippled children and everything he says certainly she says I thank God for those things so we should pray for those things right you know we know that our help cometh from the Lord but brother and says I pray for he said who know that you know he prays constantly that God would give us something for cancer vaccine for cancer so I say we should pray all that because the medical people are doing all they can and they are God's instruments as well right so we should pray for them we should pray for our hospitals we should pray for our doctors for our nurses that the Lord would anoint them and use them and that they themselves would be protected from all sickness because remember it's not just you know it's not like all the other sickness just went away and now it's just this covert 19 there's still cancer there's every other sickness under the Stunner sill they're still having its way so we need to pray for them and we also need to pray for the lab staff doing the testing now as I'm sure you all know I work for a company called ESR and it's not my lab but the lab and Wallace field that does the testing for the cove at 19 so I know the people that are doing the testing and they are already busy that they're not just sitting there watching the world go by now they've got something to do they're busy anyway now they've got all this laid upon them so we need to pray for them as well they meant we you know we need to pray for these people now as was announced on Wednesday we have towel dispensers in the bathrooms we also have hand sanitizer which has actually always been on the wall but there's this one by the front door and there's one in the kitchen that has hand sanitizer in them and sister cares also brought some that she has made or something that's in the spray bottle on the on the table there by the offering box so and if we know as always you know if your children are unwell or you're unwell you know please stay at home we have the video streaming now we know that this may be may be one of the last services we'll all have you know in this present time we don't know we want to take advantage of every service we can come to but we have the video streaming available right so you know we have the technology and we voice had this technologies not that we suddenly wrecked it up because this has happened it's always been there so please always you know use your discretion as we always do remember we do our part but God does his part right so we need to be sensible you know this is a time we need to be sober-minded and also you know if there comes a time where you know because we want to do our part because we don't want to be a stumbling block to anyone right and also I want to look into it maybe we should set it up even now I want to set up either Skype or zoom for video streaming conferencing that it's not just say me preaching to an empty church and then you're watching it but we can actually interact so we can actually have service in real time and someone can sing a special someone can play and we can just all actually have church together right that's what I'm gonna try and see it up we have the technology so we should I think we should set it up now you'll try to at least before because you know we have to be realistic they may come a day without will raise the alert level to level 4 or whatever it is and I'll shut the country down because they have to so we should be proactive in this right I'm not trying to put fear and you remember our help cometh from the Lord we have the City of Refuge you know we we shouldn't be worried about any plague any pestilences coming around we do not need to worry about those things because the Lord is our strength in our shield he's our protector right he's our deliverer so we don't need to worry about these things you know the world is gripped by fear but we don't need to fear right but well I'll just say it now I'll coming to it later but if you are very fearful about these things you pray until you meet God until he takes the fear away right because this is member this is an hour where we need to be sober-minded you know I remember when the earthquakes happened in Christchurch Christine and I were living down there when the first one happened right and we were there until the day before the February 1 where the people lost their lives but people you know when when when the first shaking happened people got real sober people who are in church and indifferent and just looking around and watching the world go by they got really shaken up excuse the pun but it's unfortunately many people it's like in Noah's day many people hung around the ark and they but then as time went by they just got relaxed and they just went off to what they're doing but there came a day where God told them to go and the Ark and God shut the door and if those hanging around the Ark only went in they would say you know their lives would have been preserved so we don't just want to hang around all what's happening and there's this trouble in the land rule and you know because this may go away yeah that may go away it may not right the rapture could happen right now we're in a rapture cycle anyway right so you know so we don't just want to hang around all there's a sickness and I could die and get into Christ whatever we do because it says in Hebrews 10:25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the Day approaching so if we can't meet physically we're going to meet virtually we're gonna have church either way I mean so that's what I want to try and put in place we have the technology you know we can do it I mean so let's just just on that note you know it just be sensible friends peace don't be caught up in the paranoia and the fear sure it's there but there's other sicknesses as well I'm not diminishing what's going on in the world you know remember the world may never go back to what we once knew it may never go back right but God is in control of everything and so we don't need to worry I mean but this is not out of God's program he's not he's not stressing he's not worried he knows his has you know he's on time he knows exactly what's going on right so we have to look at the right thing sure that doesn't mean we should just close our eyes and ears and say it's not there but we need to be aware God's in control and if your life is in his hands it don't matter what happens to you you can be sick with this thing you could have stage 4 cancer and the doctor gives you up but they can be such an assurance in your soul that I know where I'm going doesn't matter what happens to this flesh I know where I'm going I have such peace and joy you mean I'm going to go to where my Lord is now hallelujah and that's how we need to be right that's the condition we need to be in it doesn't matter how we feel you know it doesn't matter how sick we are how well we are how good times bad times rich poor doesn't matter but our soul should be in ready condition I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb ready to go I mean so let's um let's stand shall we and just just on that note let's stand and this read now Hebrews chapter 13 and and verse 5 and then I just want to go to 2nd Corinthians and chapter 4 so Hebrews 13 and 5 I pray by the end of this day you'll appreciate what you have what you're packing I appreciate I mean I pray you'll appreciate with all your soul and you'll be the most thankful people in all the world to recognize what God has done for you personally I mean Hebrews Hebrews 3 and verse 5 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content for such things as he have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me amen let's go to second Corinthians and in chapter 4 and I just actually want to take a a the first part of this of this verse of of 2nd Corinthians 4 and and verse 7 I want to take the first part of the verse but we have this treasure in earthen vessels I mean that's buried in a word of Prayer gracious father Lord we thank you for this day Lord as your prophet would say it's the grandest of Ages Lord where our people will not taste death but they will be taken lord they'll walk with you and shall be not because you take them and they did in Christ shall rise before them and Lord will go to meet go with him to meet you in the air it is the grandest of Ages look Lord every believer down through the ages Lord I believe they were looking for this hour and if they could they would trade places with but you've had you have allowed us Lord you've predestinated us to this moment and Lord I'm so thankful sure the world is in chaos and there's great darkness but Lord you are the one leading us dear God there is a light that has never shone so bright as this day that's more than a song to us Lord it's a reality father we want to thank you we can assemble for this one more time maybe Lord I pray you just take the service Lord these these brief moments as we are here Lord anoint your word like never before father let's want to get myself out of the way may you have your way among us Lord and don't just anoint speaker but anoint here as well father may you grant it dear God just move every barrier out of the way every stumbling block of the devil every complex every pain and hurt and worry move it all out to one side Oh God and maybe there just be a free Channel father have your way among us Lord we thank you we love you with all our hearts and Jesus Christ name Amen amen amen you may have your seats god bless you all this treasure we carry that's a great treasure sickness see as I said everything could go back to normal but we must remember that our lives God has allowed this to happen nothing's out of cater everything see God allows things to come upon the earth to get us into a position that is word we would be fulfilled in our lives see even viruses your people I don't need you I haven't even heard anyone these days say well if God's really God why does he allow these things it's like there's no consciousness of God in this country no more but you know even viruses we know that when when yo why does why does God allow this is because man was God over the earth and then he fell and sinned and then the devil took his position and then we can see even everything in nature has come out of kada because man fell from being God over the earth see even you take even the housefly that had its place but now it's out of its position rats mice vermin we call it they had their place but now they're out of their position even viruses I was looking at viruses because I'm a you know I'm in the scientific field and and and people have actually done research and they have actually proven that viruses actually have a beneficial place in nature amen so because God made them and now they're for a purpose we know everything he made was for good it wasn't for negative but because of sin nature's become perverted it's fall and it's come out of cater so now you know viruses are for death amen so we don't need to worry about nothing you know it's amazing when many people think you know when when God's hand is in their lives and and he is leading them they think of great bolts of lightning thunder voices from heaven but you know many times it's not that way but it can become a very natural thing now we see if we go to Luke chapter two and verse one that we're where we'll read about there came a time when where Jesus was going to be born and and an inspiration came on Caesar Augustus that he would tax the world now you would think that this would be a very great and convenient time because Mary's about to have the baby well journey they've got a you know journey from Nazareth down to down to Bethlehem with that where we are where Joseph was from now if first acts never happened they would never have gone to Bethlehem who would who in their right mind would put their full-term wife honor on a donkey and then I don't know how many days journey that was but even if it was just a day's journey who in their right mind would put their full-term pregnant wife on a donkey and take their take her anywhere but you see Jesus had to be born in Bethlehem he could not be born in Nazareth because the scripture could not be broken right so it looked like a very natural thing all this is going on now there's this tax and people have got to move this way and all this upheavals got to go on but the scripture had to be fulfilled right and it's the same thing amen with us we've got to understand oh this is your this via the others covert 19 is going on in this shutdown of economies and all these things are going on God's allowed it because he wants us together he wants us to get into our position that his word would be fulfilled in our lives see nothing is out of cater me because in our natural minds we think well the church will grow maybe we'll build a church and things will just expand and get greater and we have greater camps and greater conventions and greater meetings and greater and greater and then we'll take a rapture that may not necessarily be the case but that's in our natural thinking don't we think that I meant already making plans we'll need to take that office out maybe take that wall out you know we're going to find a bigger place people are going to come and now they might but they might not but where are you many times we get our minds are on the wrong thing and see the same Lord lead us through this time hallelujah so you know their whole lives were tipped up you know they would come to a desperate place where you know I doubt very much that you know Mary and Joseph will come maybe walking into Bethlehem you know Joseph would have been worrying all all husbands would would you know she'd be able to recognize this you know your wife was full-term maybe she's you know sweating she's uncomfortable you know you can see that the babies dropped it's on its way and now they've got to find shelter and he goes to the end tries to say look can you have a bit of sympathy for me and the Incubus is no and unfortunately in these days I don't think there's a lot of sympathy people fight over toilet paper you know they're all now it's all about a survival mentality there's no really love for each other right why is this now oh no we can't you know I'm sorry I need my toilet paper I'll fight you over this toilet paper you know it sounds ridiculous and maybe maybe last year if I said you know people are gonna fight over toilet paper you think that's crazy but it's happened it's happening people are panic buying all these things and you know we shouldn't worry sure we should prepare you know if your cupboards are empty you're not preparing even for tomorrow you should have food right you should be prepared in some fashion that doesn't mean buy the whole of stocks fairly new world and pack it to your house you know you need to be sensible but you know so so here here here this is going on joseph has no doubt he's getting a bit worried about his wife and her condition because he's got to look after her and then finally they find the stable Jesus had to be born in a stable he couldn't be born in the end he had because he was a lamb he had to be born in a stable see God's Word is perfect right and God's fulfillment of his word is perfect you know that was not the ideal situation maybe Joseph you know in his in his house there maybe they were getting a place ready they had a baby room maybe they had everything lined up in Nazareth but God said no you had to have it in Bethlehem and God orchestrated the whole he caused the whole Empire to be taxed just for two people to get to their place that the word would be fulfilled if that was the case amen for Christ to be manifested in that day what about this day and everything is and-and-and-and-and everyone's worried don't be worried you don't need to worry God will look after you God will if you have given your whole life to him now I'm not just talking about hanging around the Ark and seeing what's happening if you've got in he will look after you those are just hanging around don't just hang around get in I meant it a little it'll it'll save you a lot of sleepless nights Amen if you're in so they had to they had to move that gods were to be fulfilled we must be very aware that God is fulfilling his word in this day this is not this you know we should live like us today it could be not be today but it could be today that's why I say it could be now this virus is going on the world shutting down everything Jesus could come take his bride away now or he might not but you should be ready you should be ready this is this is where we need to be sober because now everything is being stripped away from the people what would happen if the internet went down we're in lockdown in the Internet's gone now every single comfort is gone what's going to happen see the problem is we have layers of you know basically things like it'll be okay I'll be okay I've got this up just like food for example I'm not saying it's gonna run out but here's an example my pantry is full I'm okay my guest bottles full I'm okay I've got stuff in the freezer I'm okay there's water in the tap I'm okay but what if the guest bar runs out or we can still maybe get some wood cook a fire I'm okay the electricity goes out you know and eventually all those things are stripped away then where's your security see if your if your if your confidence or your securities and natural things I wouldn't put my confidence and natural things because you will end up struggling worrying stressing over the doctors have got it in hand you know I pray we don't have an another Italy but you just travel to the other side of the world and you can see that that's a horrible things are going on there and they're stretched to the maximum and it's terrible people are suffering and the government doesn't have the answer we sure yes I said pray for them pray for them but our confidence should not be in anything natural it needs to be in the Lord Jesus now John would John would be on the Isle of Patmos that's amazing he gets thrown in a vat of oil they tried and they try and they try and cook the Holy Ghost out of him they can't do it you know they can't kill him they say well he's a wussy but which tit so they put him on the Isle of Patmos he had to be there sometimes we go through very very heavy trials but God has to get us to a certain place and John would have to end up on the Isle of Patmos because God was saying I can't have you here and give you the book of Revelation you have to go to this place you've got to sit on the snake-infested Island I remember now I'm going to open the book to you I'm going to show you from now to the time of the end hallelujah God was actually fulfilling his word by getting him there on the Isle of Patmos because because you know it says there revelations chapter 1 that that that's where he was and we know before this word was ever pinned down by John or whoever it was written down God knew he had to be there and God caused things to move for him to end up there yes the same thing with thee you know you know the yo you take the early church they sold all that they have now not advocating that but they will lead that way they sold everything they had they gave it to the church that when they when the persecution rose they had no place to stay and they had to go spread the word and and some people say that the church made such a big mistake by selling everything before the persecution said and no but God don't make no mistakes he led them to do that right so I'm not saying sell all you have right but he led them to do that because God was going to move them amen to to take the word everywhere you know because you'd think they'd have Pentecost well 120 in the up room that's how big the church is now the church goes to 3,000 and then you see you know they go from house to house and people are added to the church and Jerusalem's becoming a whole bunch of believers you think my the the millenniums going to see it in because because because the glory of the law is going to fill this place and you know that wasn't God's plan don't say no no you got to spread this word around but in the natural mom people might think what is going on I thought we could have this we have this big church now and you know you know your people are coming in it's incredible now you know what God's it what happened here we are but no no that wasn't man ideas they had that that persecution came in that they would spread the word everywhere so we have to have confidence God is in control remember we have our plans God has this planet Lord changed my plans to match your plan because your plan matters my plan don't matter right hallelujah so so the world was taxed to get Joseph and Mary to where they needed to be to fulfill the Word of God and I say this virus has been allowed to come to get us into our position that we will fulfill the Word of God amen you say well what is what is our what is our what is our purpose I mean you know what does the word we must fulfill God has to be fully tabernacled and man the power the third Paul must be manifested power of the spoken word must be manifested everything Adam had has to be manifested into people in this day not not in the millennium when the Devils bound but when the Devils here raging a mere people have to come to their position in Christ I mean that they know who their God as they know what he has done for them and they can speak as Adam spoke I mean in the winds and waves have to obey everything must obey their voice but we know the power of the third pulls not a public show amen so God is getting us in our position that he uses you not your favorite preacher not your favorite Church on the other side of the world but you right he wants to get you into that place but we must understand that persecution is not going to get us into that place I'm just going to read this and then I'll get down to where I was going to say so this is from the this is from the Patmos visions from the church age book no human being could stand in the full effect of that vision yeah John said he fell down as a dead man his strength that League gone John fell at his feet as though dead but the hand of the Lord and love touched him and the voice of blessing said fear not don't be afraid I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore what is there to fear the judgment that fell upon him at the cross at the grave and when he descended was for us he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen I love that see for a for a surety our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge has judged the case of settle that is finished there is now there is now therefore no condemnation why should the church fear what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us why should at fear punishment or death it has all been overcome here is the mighty Conqueror here is the one who conquered both worlds of the seen and unseen not like Alexander who conquered the world at the age of 33 and you no other way to turn for further conquest so he died a victim of sin and righteous living not like Napoleon who conquered all Europe but finally was defeated at Waterloo and banished Hill Elba only to find himself conquered but nothing could conquer Christ he that descended has now ascended above all and unto Him has been given a name that is above every name yes he conquered death Helen and has the keys here of what he loses is loosed what he binds is bound there is no changing of it there is there was no Conqueror before him and there is none beside him he alone as the Savior Redeemer he is the only God and the Lord Jesus Christ as his name don't fear John don't fear little flock all that I am you are potin says yours as i stand in your midst and we're going to just check up and say who's been walking in our mitts for these past however many years I mean as long as you've been a believer who's been in your mitts who's been walking around so Lord Jesus Christ if we could just look at the unseen realm and recognize the God that walks among us I mean he hasn't left us in this dark time he hasn't left us in this time of trouble and the time of trouble thou shalt hide me and the tabernacle of hyperbole and the secret place hallelujah I mean Sam's twenty sevens going to become more than a nice sum to you it's going to become a living reality and I pray through this time it will I mean of the word that you carry the treasure in earthen vessel will become more rich more important more vital than ever before hallelujah I have not come to bring you fear and failure the Lord has not come to bring you fear and failure hallelujah but love courage and ability I mean all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and I'll perform it that my covenant that is my covenant and it can never fail police has come to give us love you know what is a virus you just boil it down it's a devil all sicknesses a devil I mean and we have the power the authority of the name of Jesus Christ to cast out Devils I mean what we need is mark 16 in action the name of Jesus Christ in action these signs shall follow them that believe I mean I trust you're a believer right now not a make-believe or not a maybe believe it but I believer I mean a blood wash redeemed Ransom son or daughter are gone hallelujah this is what the world needs mark 16 and acts in the name of Jesus Christ manifested upon the earth you know brother brand would say that that that Martine is the true church that Jesus claims his own all houses false it has to be hallelujah it's amazing people say that that part of mark 16 is not inspired I'm sorry too late I've experienced that that is true laid hands upon the second of show recover cast out devils speaking new tongues I've seen those things happen hallelujah and you know it's just like our brother Barry gives the testimony there's an old lady and then enter and and if some was away at Bible School and and and you know the son got this telegram come home quick you know your mama's gonna die and so he packs up but then he didn't hear anything and you know then eventually he came home and his mother was healthy and well she said mom what happened you know you'd send this telegram there nothing I didn't know was going on and yeah well I said she said well praise the Lord you know there's this woman came out from here that corner mission there all shouting therefore the beating on the drums and the tambourines and yeah here are those people those noisemakers down the corner yeah yeah those people you know there was a woman from that group they had a prayer meeting and and and she felt inspired to come up and talk to me because she knew that I was sickened and and and she said you know can I get our pastor to come and pray for you and so he came up and he and he and he read us mark 16 read me mark 16 they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover and you know and and and then and then you know and then so they came and did that and you know what happened I got well and and you know but but then the son cuz he's a Bible school too much intellectual learning of the scriptures his eyes Oh mom you know that part we've been taught that that part of mark 16 has not inspired she says well hallelujah and and then he says mommy you're starting to sound like those people and and and he she just says well if God can heal with the uninspired what they do with the inspired I mean answer me everything's inspired hallelujah amen but we should not worry about nothing amen Oh Lu you know brother bran was saying recognizing your day in its message because you we have to understand national forces are moving I say already people are planning how they can re-engineer the world after this is gone people are planning people are planning doesn't matter if the virus was just a transmission across species or planted or whatever that don't matter but countries are now planning how can we exploit the change of the world because it's all about control remember the Chinese and the Russians are still going to fight America I mean the reason there is the EU and NATO speak I want to kick back against Russia so it's not like people are suddenly quit their national and your animosity you lived you know we're all friends now let's rally together maybe on the outside they're doing it back see deep down to know they're gonna settle some scores right because those national spirits are still there right so people are already planning how can we exploit this thing how can we we realign trade routes and commerce and how can we control these things you know we can't be you can't you say that's far-fetched no no when world war ii was going on the allies were scheming how can we reject while the war was going on people are proactive satan's product of but god's more proactive i mean so we don't need to worry but so national forces are moving to unite people and and you know but we must understand that national force will not put us into a rapture well the ban was say in recognizing your day and its message 1964 and basically every quite you knows like i think by the crust seeds something about all these quotes i'm using her before after the seals but i just say every quote he used was when brother brown was a prophet you know so I think I think brother Danny Steven see it I think that's pretty good cuz people that isn't after the seals is before the seals knows when brother Brown was a prophet okay so okay that's nice I can take it then I can I know I can I can trust that I mean son recognizing your Danis message in 1964 he says the church has not recognized heard a member as you go through the message remember the book the word was coming open to the Prophet as God was walking with them it's the same thing with us you when you meet the Lord you don't know all things right but as you walk with him he opens his word to you you begin to realize who you are in Christ you begin to realize more what the Lord has done for you right you realize what he's given you and you realize more where you're going you have greater assurance right you just take the book of Ephesians they are spirit filled people you read Ephesians one whom you trusted you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise whereby your seal to the day of redemption but then Paul now because to tell them Christ's position and now their position in Christ you once walked according to the Prince of the power of the year but you've been quickened right you now sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus so he begins to tell them what they what's happened to them but now what they have in that position right so before the book of Ephesians came open to them they didn't understand that fully right so that's why the word comes up is just to stabilize us now walk that we know who we are we know what Christ has done for us we know our position in Christ we know the devil's position under our feet hallelujah we know we're going in a rapture it stabilizes our walk Amen so it's the same so as God is unfolding the word to brother branham we see early in the message he basically just joins the church and the bride together as one group but then he divides it out right as the wood comes open so you take the first seal for example he says I no longer call you church I'll call you bride that you'll understand so he actually he actually differentiates the two just like Abraham and lot there's a church spiritual Abraham and there's like the church nominal right so both both receive salvation that's why there's yo not even will be bright but not you know but that doesn't mean everyone else will be lost right there's different covenants we understand that we're under the bride Calvin er we're under the Abraham Covenant right somebody learned it a lot covenant but they still they're still safe from the burning they mean so you know don't throw everyone out right if we can encourage someone just to take one step higher and they walk with God I say praise the Lord right they may not come all the way up and as long as they take a step higher hallelujah right amen so now he says this so the church does not recognize your day like Israel back in her Promised Land she didn't know how she got there she's just thought just automatically back there why national force put her in her place now I'm going to say something now when he says that I kind of listen I'm going to say something national force put Israel in her homeland national force will put the church in the World Council of Churches but the power of God will put the people in the bride right though the world forces this way the world forces that way but God forces up with the Spirit of God which is the Word of God my word as spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ then Christ will put her in her place no national force will do it but the national force dead driver's role to the homeland the National forces of the World Council of Churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into glory out of it hallelujah I mean so this national force is pushing pulling putting people around but that won't put it into put us into the rapture I mean the power of God will lift us up into the rapture the Word of God will put us in our place Holies as I say are there shutting churches down and whatever more no no this virus is causing that to happen this is not an ecclesiastical pressure of a squeeze right it is it is national forces showing down because of the pandemic right but that will not put us in rapture and condition the Word of God will in our lives hallelujah I mean many people are waiting for a squeeze to come the squeeze has already come right I can't walk into a hospital and pray for anyone I can't go into a prison just pray for anyone I can't minister the there's already a pressure or limitation put upon us I mean that we can't just freely go on minister hallelujah so there is already a squeeze de menthe that's already coming it's already here yeah so you know but many people say well when the squeeze comes on then God's gonna really add not my life and things are really going to happen cuz of the squeeze no it's cuz the word of God in your life remember the squeeze on the manifest what's in you you take the book you take the first church you take the first church they were in the you know that day Pentecost Holy Ghost filled them and now the devil's going to come against them right after the gate beautiful remember brother bran would say the devil didn't even roll out of bed when the day of Pentecost happened but when they walked past the gate beautiful and picked up that crippled man and said such as I have give IV in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk then all of the guns of hell were trained against the disciples so now a squeeze is going to come on them and they were brought before counsels the pressure has come upon them don't preach in this name whose authority he's speaking in all those things and now beaten whatever more but now what was then then was going to come out remember before the day of Pentecost thee the leader of this group would cower under just people that he was warming himself by a fire as his Lord was being you know examined as the beaten and all these things and people came along and said aren't you one of them aren't you aren't you one of his disciples I don't even know who you're talking about but your own speech betrays you how you speak amen the words you use betray that you're a believer I know and these swears and curses and you know because the pressure came on just by a couple of people by a fire what the Sanhedrin it wasn't all the dignitaries of the church it was just a couple of people come along but what was in him came out a squeeze came on his life and he miserably failed but Jesus said he would hallelujah but God knows how to get pride out of our lives right God knows how to get us in condition remember I mean so now it says so here he was he buckled under it Peter did I'm talking about Peter if you know her you know and then so suddenly but then the day Pentecost came and he received a force in his life he received a life of God himself hallelujah not a part of the God here the God he came into full of Sagada body was in Christ and everything that God pulled into Christ he pulled into the church I mean so was God now separating himself into the believers so now here he was with this life and now he's staying before the Sanhedrin not by a fire with a couple of people the same counsel that crucified Jesus Christ he was standing in front of he knew what they did to his Lord and he just said well see it brings out what's in you he says should we serve God or men that was there wasn't eloquent it wasn't well put together didn't come with the conclusion and a maybe hook in the year no sure hey should we do whoever they tell us and they beat them they threaten them what they do that went out rejoicing because they were counted worthy a mentor suffer persecution because of their Lord they just wouldn't they were happy they weren't chilly they had bruises they had beatings for though just rejoicing hallelujah then they had prayer and God came down shook the place gave them boldness and they went continue preaching the word why what happened cuz the squeeze came on but what was in them came out I mean the annoying girl was in them just manifested upon their lives hallelujah it's the same thing today that's why I say if you are panicking about this virus meet the Lord Jesus Christ pray through till you meet him amen so they had a squeeze and it just brought out was in them the bride has the goods if you had the Lord Jesus Christ in your life you have what you need Allu yeah he says in Christ in the mystery of God revealed and his church stands alone she is not hooked up with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt and speaking of our Lord Jesus and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing amen you know it's amazing you pick up this book you read the things that God did and then you look in your own life and you say Lord I see the same life and me he see it Moses was a very proud man before he met the burning bush remember he was raised in Pharaoh's Palace he had as he was basically the next one to step on that throne you know in Egypt the Pharaohs was considered gods they weren't meek humble look no I'm Ferro you know my very print meat coming into the room demands respect and my word is absolute I'm God over you that's what they would death do you think the kind of persona that that that they would carry they wouldn't walk along like this and so nice to meet you and you're so you know how are you and like what they can't know I'm Farrah do this do this kill him do this do this right away that was how Moses was raised but when he met the pillar fire in the burning bush he had the right of himself is the meekest man in all the world because he met God his nature was changed because he had a visitation with God he had a meeting with God and that was attribute of Christ character being manifested in Moses life hallelujah and then you see the Lord Jesus the meek lonely man from Galilee right and you see Peter gets a sword tries to be gung-ho miserably fails but then he meets the Lord his characters changed Saul Saul of Tarsus becomes Paul I'm gonna kill these people I'm gonna put a squeeze on this church and I'm gonna stop it happening and then he meets the Lord on the road to Damascus his whole life has changed yeah can you see that it can you see that God has done something in your life I mean the the character you now possess is not your own natural character as the character of God hallelujah I mean why cuz the word has put on flesh Amen hallelujah see it's his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days that's you shall I say that again she is his body remember that we are the body of Christ young she is his body the manifested truth of the office of his promised word for the last days and she and she stands alone by it that's why the devils howling these great organizations to set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen and the power of the vindicated word promised to her by the power of the vindicated word promise to her amen so she won't be closed up be taken up well when will the churches be closed up in the tribulation when the devil has full control over the earth oh there's gonna come a boycott sure but while the bride is here while the bride is here she has a ministry right so don't worry oh is this the big time without clothes churches this is a pandemic we don't need to worry she'll be taken up now when did he say this after the seals opened when he was a prophet okay because we can't we can't live in such a way oh there's gonna be a boycott the church is going to be closed up and all winds it's going to happen and basically we're like looking for a train wreck to happen you know imagine people who live in fear that I'm gonna get hit by a car when I cross the road they'll never cross the road they get so fixated on this disaster that may happen because statistically you can't get hit by a car crossing the road unfortunately happens to people I don't mean it lightly but you know statistically you know stepladders are they're dangerous things so does that mean I shouldn't use a stepladder no you just don't be afraid don't be so fixated on the negative maybe off but you know statistically you know your toaster could electrocute you I don't know you know I know it's ridiculous but these things can happen does that mean we stop using toasters no I like toast I'm gonna toast them I'm gonna use a toaster I could die driving my car doesn't man gonna walk over it no I'm gonna drive oh you know I can drive the Lord's giving me a car I'm gonna use it you know what I mean but we can't just live in fear oh the World Council of Churches are going to come and close this up and all this is going to happen and we're gonna kind of bunker away and just kind of survivalist mentality and just you know survive we don't heat just to survive we hit overcome we're here to be a witness we're here to be the light of the world as we heard on Wednesday year the salt of the earth amen you're the salt of the earth you are the salt of the earth I mean so we should live such a life you know there was a it came back negative but someone they thought had the coronavirus had the at 19 in my corridor at work in my in my group they went to Australia they came back they were sick but they were sick before they went to Australia and and this time of year they get sick you know but because of the symptoms are so close to everything else they're like well you go home for two weeks rest and I think why can't I go home for do you know anyway yeah you know but if once everyone's panicking and and that doesn't mean I'm blase no we're not blase about this right you don't be blase be sensible but you know now we can't you know we've got a social distancing and you know there's a meeting room we have and and and because of the meter apart thing and you know I respect these things sure but they took the so we're only allowed five people five people in that room now and all the extra chairs they've stacked in the corner and table cut cable tied them together that we can't use them no no no but they're taking these things seriously but you also got to understand that the organization I work for we are we actually have they've set up the like a crisis meeting in our seminar room with if that they're setting up a crisis meeting room over the scope of 19 because my organisation is testing for it you know but people are scared we don't have to worry and you can walk into your school or into your workplace and you can create an atmosphere around you you're not denying it's there sure but you can walk into your school your into your workplace and you can create an atmosphere around you everything's going to be alright you can actually lift people that the prints of God in life actually lift the fear off people but be the salt of the earth don't just get caught up here yeah sure it's bad sure you know it is a terrible thing but don't get caught up in the paranoia and the fear about it amen be the salt of the earth is that okay remember God's in control I mean the devil ain't in control he wish he was in control but he's never going to be in control never never never Amen so hallelujah so they'll never see they'll never close her up she'll be taken up not closed up amen now now a bride holds that promise he told me he would return after me I'll believe it uh-huh yes sir to meet her headship her redeemer her husband her king her Lord her lover who save you in the provided meeting place he's got a place to meet him you know the bridegroom don't leave out nothing he's got the ring the identification who's carrying their identification the baptism of the Holy Ghost is identification he's got the the robe that she wears her clothing she he he's got the provider place to meet her that's in the air everything has provided he's got the wedding supper already sick guests already invited already chosen all the angels of standing around his servants at attention hallelujah he's he's you know you really think the Lord has everything in control you know he is the perfect project manager the perfect one nothing nothing is left undone nothing kind of just works it works I mean we're gonna have so much Scott we're gonna have just confidence brother Brahim seasons countdown 1964 now look he says I've seen some pretty rough things about the airplane automobile but remember they are horsepower - speaking of my lutheran and weasly and Pentecost all that is horse power the church is just moving up the Holy Ghost power is the Holy Ghost power that we're justified by you ministers know that don't you the Holy Ghost sanctifies us the Holy Ghost fills us the Holy Ghost gives us rapturing faith amen as we move up amen so the Holy Ghost us in your life gives you rapturing faith hallelujah let's just walk on you know let's just go hallelujah why you like this because my life is in his hands and that's not some fatalistic you know God is not some we're not interested in human life right here is actively working in our lives right we're gonna look for his hand amen soon as I said you know the world is gripped by the fear of this covert mind 19 but we should not fear it I mean there should be such an assurance see this is a chick up time this is a chick up time this is not just a hang around we go to church his mum and dad do or maybe I do cuz it's out of habit you know but this is a chick up time do we really have what we believe we should have right see there should be such an assurance in our hearts I mean that control that virus no virus trouble no trouble whatever we're going through in life I mean I'm redeemed my life is hidden away in Christ I mean and even if it does strike me or even if I got stage 4 cancer remember everyone in life I just want to say this if times you go on you'll come a stage in our lives with a doctor say I'm sorry there's nothing more I can do everyone has to come to that point and they'll either say it to you if you're conscious or though your family right that unfortunately you know praise the Lord for the medical field we have my sister as a nurse and I see you at Middlemore Hospital at Auckland we got brother Anini as well yes Oh God god bless the medical field god bless the healthcare workers and everything we have right but there will come a time in everyone's life if time should carry on where the doctors will say I'm sorry there's nothing more we can do but even if it comes to that place there should be such a joy and peace there should be no I'm not saying about saying you just mentally woke up there should be such a joy the sickness take my life I know where I'm going and I know that the one that I have loved and I've walked with all these years is gonna carry me through the door of death up into glory I mean that's how it should be Alleluia that though this thing take me I don't need to fear nothing because the one you know brother Brown win win when he would go speak to his wife hope when she's uh I think she died in any and he spoke to her and she came back to life and you know you know she said to him you you know it's such an amazing place because she went up into glory but you know so little about it this Holy Ghost you speak about how great it really is how great you know we think about you know many times people say well how horrible the tribulation will be how horrible being in Hell will be sure but we many times I think we neglect the reality of how great heaven will be how amazing it will be amen to be in a place with no sickness sorrow pain no worry no no bad days just perfect peace yeah when brother Brown was taking pastor Curtin a time he says it's so sublime he can't describe how great it really is and even Paul he says I knew a man that was lifted up into the third heaven he couldn't speak about if I know how many years there was himself but such a great place holy I think many times we we don't focus on that how great heaven really will be and really is hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if you don't have that assurance this morning there is a Lord Jesus Christ here to give you that assurance right because heaven is such a great place you know myself I do not serve the Lord Jesus because I don't want to go through the Great Tribulation I'm scared I'll go to hell I don't serve him because of those things I serve Him because He first loved me I serve him because I love him I lived this life because I loved him because he loved me he redeemed me he took my sin upon his shoulder he paved away from me I mean he's my light in the darkness when I was his enemy he redeemed me on the cross he's washed my son I mean that's why I serve him it's not out of fear or worry or what's going to happen I'm not worried about what's gonna happen he said well you just being blase no I'm not being blase I know who's a if you know the one in control again said Lord I've given my whole life to you every and although I am Lord I've done everything hallelujah according to your word amen and then I can you know what more can we do now brother brother Brown makes a statement and the token message and many people use this as a as a fear I'll read this one then I'll go the next one this is in the token remember this is the message the messages you must have the Holy Ghost what is the message you believe you God's gonna dwell in you you got to have the whole you gonna be born again that is actually the myth that's 1,100 tapes in a nutshell that's the Bible in a nutshell you got to be born again that's the message right that's the message people say how do I explain what I believe you gotta be born again that's it you really gotta know the the author of the book you got to know him right hallelujah a simple a real simple real simple amen now he says and when we display the token of the Holy Spirit well let's just draw back a bit there's a worse plague today then this covered might 19 the last plague destroyed Egypt before they left was death spiritual death is striking people in this world and people seem unconcerned about it they're they people start panicking as soon as the viruses is broken out upon the community but what about your spiritual life what about what about the real virus that's striking the world we should be more concerned about that now as I say doesn't mean you turn a blind eye to what's going on in the world we do what that you have the government says we can't gather we won't gather we respect what they say right they are here to look after us you know we elect them into office they're here to serve us you know that right they're here for the public good just like the police force I'm scared of the police no they're here to look after me I mean anyone I don't know I'm going off on that but you know sometimes all they see the beginning me no no no no no no no no God's allowed it this just relax about it let's just rejoice in our Lord let's not get all tense amen anyway he's so the last plague to strike Egypt before they left was death and now but they were but the Israelites or anyone was told if you just take a blood of the lamb and put on the doorpost door and lintel the death angel cannot strike you a man that's the same thing today if we have now we know we don't have the literal blood of Jesus Christ but the life that was in the blood can come into US and that is the token I mean when God sees his life and you death could not strike you hallelujah well how do I know death hasn't struck me he's still concerned about your spiritual welfare amen is there something in you saying Lord I want to live for you want to serve you all I want to know you I say well then that means death hasn't struck you because many times we panic or what's going to happen under just walk with God he says and when we can display the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we've been accepted in Christ that is our token that all that we have need of his already purchased by him we are identified with our token the token must be ready the blood the covenant blood is not recognized without the token the word assures us of the promise the token is the sign the purchase has been made for us he says full obedience to the full word of God and titles us to the token no other way is there that we could even be entitled to the token until you fully obey the word not what somebody has put into it or added to it but what God said about it now many times when people use those things they people were going to make a checklist in their lives am i dressing right as my skirt long enough as my hair long enough as my whatever you know do I do i do I conduct myself the right way do you know it's all about it becomes a list of do's and don'ts yeah but then he says and I've gone to another token message and show this even clearer but he says now when he said that you must be born again so he's saying a full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to the token he says that now then when he said you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down at the altar that doesn't mean walk back here and shake hands with a pastor that doesn't mean all this fullness just that we've seen done it means putting your name or and you know don't mean putting your name on a church book it means death to your first being your first life and life to the second being so the old you is dead amen because just like baptism were buried with him in Baptism they will come for the newness of life so the old one of you is dead and beard and and is a sign put on it no resuscitation do not resuscitate right and you come forth and as new creature in Christ but I remember because when we say when you creatures in Christ it's not something we just grow into now our life comes into us that changes us right it's not to some learn behavior or I'm a believer because I've learned a behavior no it's not that it's when God Himself comes and dwells in you I mean and by the blood of the Cross he can come and dwell in you and that's what the messages you must be born again God himself must dwell in you hallelujah amen and that the blood is being applied and you're identified by the life of Jesus Christ so if you have the Holy Ghost in your life the Bloods been applied if the blood has been applied all sin has been scrubbed off of your account how Louie everything held again she's been scrubbed off Amy because the Bloods been applied hallelujah and you're identified by the life of Jesus and if he be the vine and we be the branches the life that's in the branch is also in the vine it'll be a fruit I mean if that first branch brought forth that branch out of that vine that wrote a book of Acts behind it if that branch ever puts forth a vine puts forth another branch it'll write another book of Acts behind it because it's the same life if one of your grapevines outs here brings forth blue grapes let's pour forth another branch it'll bring forth blue grapes same life and the Viners of the same one in the branches that's why I use the example of the first church squeeze came on them they overcame it they fulfilled the word in their day if that bronze put forth that that vine puts forth another branch squeeze comes down life and the people overcomes it hallelujah amen hallelujah now it is in a different token message he says now when we want eternal life we receive a token showing that the price has been paid it isn't the blood but it's the token of the blood it's the life itself I mean he says full obedience to the whole Word of God to God's entire word will entitle you to this token and I said before people now have a checklist and their minds but then he says now how do you do it Peter see it so he's saying how do you do it so how do you have full obedience to the full word of God I'm glad he answers his own question Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost touken I mean for the promises Antion to your children then there are far off as many as the Lord our God shall call so you saying this is how you actually I have full obedience to the word and that you can receive a token is to repent be baptized name Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you shall receive the token it's that simple hallelujah Oh amen is that lovely ye so happy how could I not be happy because ya get people this big list oh this is full of billions of all wanna go he answers the question I love all fear just to leave right now all worried to go just to such an assurance of the peace of God to cover us Amen so now if I've fulfilled God's requirements I have a token I have a short token a full repentance holy baptized the name of Jesus Christ remember it worked for the first church it'll work for the last church hallelujah if the medicine worked for them I said it before to work for us holy a vaccine works for one person work for me it was the same vaccine right Allu you Amen when we see when when they seen that wonderful display the power of a resurrection he Peter got up and quoted the scripture of Joel and so forth give the promise of that age ensured the requirements of that age had been met in Jesus Christ and then he sent back a token of his death and that token was upon him and he said the token is to you and to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call we'll have to have this token Amen not they ought to have but they should have it I mean they shall have it they shall receive the Holy Ghost when you fully obey the word of god and full surrender to it you're entitled to the token yes sir obedience not here that says Lord Lord but he that doeth the will and when we pray we must have the token to present with our prayer a little amen glory glory this is hell he says he says the 1953 I just I just read a couple of quotes then we'll close and God's provided way speaking of when the Death Angel is about to strike Egypt I can hear him say a little later after a while I look window little boy does looks these two great big black ones moving through the year that's death and if there's any time that the black wings has struck the country today I mean is struck the country day we've had earthquakes we've had pestilence weather all kinds of things that could come to this land and on like they did in Egypt but the last plague that Egypt before destruction was death and the last plague that hits the church is spiritual death that's the last thing they're dying the churches are dying out oh we've had we're having protracted meetings but no revival no revival they say the great revival in America tell me where it's at where it's at we've been struck we've even struck the first phase of a revival in America the reason of it is as we're trying to teach me in theology and things instead of bringing them back God's provided way by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and send them back to God by the way of Calvary well we're trying to get them into the church and join them into the church baptize them into the church shake their hands into the church and pack their leaders into the church but they've got to be born in the Church of the Living God that's the reason we haven't got no revival so we have a pestilence before they had the Spanish flu 1918 there was the polio polio epidemic 1940 I believe it was there with a pestilence before you say well this will just be another one it might not be I don't want to just say just walk on no no this is a time to check up this is a time to be sober-minded say Lord do I really have what I need to have he would say in the Easter seal he says remember there's only one hope get this quickening power it'll hold you when everything else has give away it'll hold you some of them said did you keep your religion brother branham I said no it kept me it keeps me I don't keep it ain't weather I hold on or not it's whether he held on or not he is what held on for me he didn't have to and he's his angels were sitting every tree just pull your finger loose just point you don't have to take it from you don't have to take it from the cross just point your finger and watch what see that mocking bunch but if he had did it I couldn't but but because he stayed on the cross he held there and that's why I hold with him on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand hallelujah so it's not whether I hold on that's rather he holds on that is the big difference but if you know him you know he'll hold on so I want to leave it there this morning this may be the last service we have in this church life might not go on but what about you what about you and your walk with the Lord do you know him have you really I really met him if he's alive member before I met the Lord I thought well if he's alive the Bible says he's alive is resurrected therefore I could meet him I'm just a simple guy if he says he's alive forevermore well where is he I can meet him right I meet him it was more than hearing tapes brother Graham said you know yo people say - he sees in the token but brother brim I believe every word you say he says that's good but that's just being able to read and many people have just taken people say you got to believe this prophet that's not enough you must have the token you must have the Holy Ghost I believe the message that's good that's just being able to read but you must meet the Lord Jesus Christ remember the messages you must be born again amen but if he's here to meet and he still is then you could meet him and there doesn't matter what happens there could be another virus cabina whatever well I don't know what your worst-case scenario is it could happen but even if it happened if you're sealed in the rock of ages' if you're sealed until the day of your redemption by the Holy Ghost in your life it doesn't matter you can just have a blessed assurance Jesus is mine yeah so let's just bow heads in a word of Prayer shall we we'll have the musicians to come gracious Lord Jesus Lord I'm so thankful Lord I just want to pray for each one here I asked Lord that if one here would truly be sober-minded doesn't matter what age we may be we may be old we may be young but father I pray dear Lord that Lord Jesus I believe that this this virus though it may sound strange but I believe it's it's your grace to the earth in a way because now it gets people to really check up what would happen if I got it what would happen if I died and because Lord we get caught up in the busyness of life and people have plans of what will happen but now our plans have changed Lord because the world has changed even if it is just temporarily but now lord I pray that a soberness will come into our hearts Lord Father that we would think about think on our ways and think do I do I really know you lord have I really met you have I really been born again or have I just had a church experience just go along because others go and or I was raising it Lord I pray father you'd move on every heart by your Holy Spirit now and Lord if there's anyone here who doesn't know you Lord Lord I unfortunately there's bound to be but Lord if there's some who have not really given their whole being over to you Lord and you've sealed them into the kingdom by your Holy Ghost Lord I I pray father Lord as your word says as the goodness of God that lead us to repentance lon so father I spray it Lord I pray you'd speak to every heart Lord like only you can and Lord those who don't know you Lord I pray you just speak to them Lord and they just give it all to you Lord Jesus you and you would make them new creatures a new father Lord it's not a it's not a think so that we know you Lord it's a no so Lord I pray you give such an assurance and D every heart father Lord that Lord that their lives are hidden away in you Lord may you grant a father you know anyone who may be watching now or will watch later Lord I ask Lord that you'd move on their hearts as well Lord Jesus may they not bury that conviction that that hunger and thirst for you and other things but Lord may they just fleet you while they can Lord we don't know Lord this this may be the end but Lord of it's not Lord I don't know but if it is Lord may we be ready Lord even if or maybe ten more years before the rapture goes or now but maybe we'll be ready Lord for how that's what we want law I just pray Lord you take these chopped up words this morning and me compel take up by your Holy Ghost and compel everyone here Lord into that Ark of safety into Christ Lord may you grab that Lord truly may the may the blood be applied to every heart Lord as your Lord as as as we read Lord full obedience to the full word of God and titles us to the Holy Ghost to the token it's as simple as repenting giving our whole lives to you turning from our ways and walking with you and being baptized in your name name of Lord Jesus Lord that assurance Lord that our souls are saved lord I pray for each one here Lord I love them all my heart Lord I pray you just keep them under the shadow of thy wing Lama they're not fear nothing Lord
