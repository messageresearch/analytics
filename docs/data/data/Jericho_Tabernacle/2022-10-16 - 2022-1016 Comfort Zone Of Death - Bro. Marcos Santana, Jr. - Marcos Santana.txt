to speak to you all once again and once again with my nerves like always but uh just wanted to give a happy birthday to my wife you know we had probably the best birthday gift we could ever have uh our little baby girl Nina praise God he still does miracles he's still working and he still loves his children how many love him this morning yeah I'm just so happy it feels good to be here please stand with me con Migo uh I don't know if I'm going to be short this morning or extra long this morning so please please forgive me if I might go over my time but uh we're gonna try and go on a little trip this morning and something that really blessed me I opened my eyes to the scriptures a little bit more for me and I pray that the Lord can do the same for every one of you this morning I wanted to continue on the topic of agape love and last night those things went left and they went a different direction but we're going to title the message today the comfort zone of death I don't want anyone to get scared this morning but just just trust in our Lord God Almighty confidence if you are of him then he's got your back this morning let's use the scripture we've been taking for example love and we're going to just read Matthew 22 37. if you could say Amen when you have it amen Matthew 22 37. and Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy Minds I don't think it gets more and more easily explained than that that's my everything that's all my mind that's all my heart and I'm gonna love him with every single bit of it let's bow our heads for prayers Lord Heavenly Father Celestial we love you this morning Lord we wouldn't be here if we didn't love you Lord we just want to hear a little bit more of your word this morning you can reveal just as more portion of your word this morning Father put me in my interpreter aside and you'll be the one speaking to your people this morning take this simple theme this morning and amplify it in the hearts of your children today we give you all the honor and Glory Gloria and we put our trust in you this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] you may be seated Brothers thank you for bearing with me like I said this morning uh the title is uh comfort zone of death is somewhere where I don't think anybody any one of us would ever want to be in but if we can turn to the scriptures in John 12 verse 3. and I might be going a little quickly this morning so if if you need to you can just follow along on the screen but I want to just go through an entire story today and and we're going to start right here in John 3 John 12 verse three says then Mary then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikner very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor and the ointment Jesus is one of the disciples Judas is scary Simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 Pence and given out to the poorest so here we have this woman married he was about to anoint Jesus to perform a service to Jesus and it said it puts a cost to this oil this all happens to be a very very very expensive oil and then it tells us about that character we know why don't you sell this and give it to the poor instead why are you wasting it on this now my question is who is Judas is I think it's not so much the question who is he but the issue is that we already know who he is because we've read the story you know the book we know what happens at the end of that story We Know What Judas became and then how it was that he failed but have we seen what and who Judas was at that momentum he was hand-picked by Jesus Christ out of everyone here he said Judas I need you as my disciple there was good traits good qualities about this man Judas that he was needed in the ministry of Jesus and the disciples even the book of Acts it says when speaking about Judas that he was numbered with us the 12 of us and he obtained his part of the ministry so he performed in the ministry he had his part in that Ministry and he was identified as a disciple clean he was a Believer it was an upstanding Apostle right at that momentum more than just that he was the treasurer of that church the treasurer of that Ministry so I can only imagine that the other 11 disciples they already had a sense of trust in Judas a confidence in his character and who he was and then when they see that Jesus gives him the money back and the the responsibility of a Treasurer responsibility well they only trust him even more but because Jesus had him as a treasure he had to keep him close right by his side working together because he trusted him so it sounds funny but it was Judas because we know who he was and what he was going to do if we can go to that moment in time if we turn over to Mark 14. and verse continuing the same story but from a different gospel it says and being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper as he sat at me there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious and she break the box and poured it on his head is verse forces and there were some that had indignation within themselves and said why was this await why was this waste of the ointment made now this scripture says there were some but the other specifies it was Judas so it sounds like Judas had some poles he had a little bit of influence with the rest of the disciples hey why is she wasting this on on on on this uh anointing of Jesus and him and the disciples it says that they got indignant so indignation in the dictionary is anger or annoyance provoked by what is perceived as unfair treatment and in the Greek it says to be greatly Afflicted so they were annoyed they were Afflicted Judas felt that this wasn't the right way to spend this expensive Alabaster Box in oil but there was a pull inside of that woman there was a d like my brother said there was a deep calling to a deep in that woman she didn't even know what she was doing but she was doing it she was going to to anoint Jesus Christ perform a service unto Jesus Christ and here Judas is saying you don't need to do that you're wasting your time you're going too far you're being too religious you're being too extreme Mary was willing to take that oil that expensive oil that prized possession that she has and break it and offer the entire thing to Jesus use it completely without sparing a single drop on Jesus she didn't care about the money for tomorrow I don't care what people thought of her she didn't care that Judas and them were criticizing her murmuring about her YouTube is you don't have to give it all up for Jesus you don't have to give a Full Sacrifice Lord Jesus you don't have to give up everything don't give up everything you don't have to surrender your entire life you know Judas was only expressing the feelings of what it was lying inside of his heart in his mind in his soul just expressing it verbally with that indignation that was flowing through his veins because Judas wasn't willing to go all the way Judas wasn't willing to give it all up for Jesus that when he saw that there was someone that was it would go all the way is he had to call it a waste you're wasting your time why'd you take that less pain job to be here on Sat on Wednesday and Friday okay sisters why did you stop your career Hermanos to be a stay at home mom you're just wasting your time [Music] you're wasting your time that was calling a pure genuine believer and the worship that they were doing calling it just and there were some that had indignation within themselves and said why was this waste of the anointment on ointment made for it might have been sold for more than 300 Pence and have been given to the poor and they murmured against Heroes I like looking in different versions of the Bible and there's a version of in fact two or three versions that when they specify the cost of this oil this Alabaster Box in oil could be sold for a Year's wages Daniel I think minimum wage is around 30 40 000 a year okay if you're doing pretty good maybe you're making 60 70 000 a year maybe we have some brothers and sisters that make a hundred thousand dollars a year in here but here Jesus Judas is looking at the money aspect and say well you can sell this for sixty thousand eighty thousand a hundred thousand yeah and give to the poor and help the poor yeah wasting it on Jesus Christ if you get in the seat it seems like a noble thing to say something just and respectable to say it's a gift to the poor but uh but they murmured against us no it's like him saying yes you know you don't have to get rid of the Netflix why don't you better use it just watch the Disney movies and the kid movies you don't have to dress all fashioned you know you can just tone it down a bit you know just do it in church you don't have to stop cursing and doing these dirty jokes just just tone it down and try not to do it while you're on Church property [Music] she was willing to go as far as she needed to with Jesus Christ let the spirit move her and take her where no amount of lost money could stop hero didn't matter the criticizers or the murmurs the first thing was going to stop her not a co-worker not a brother or sister in church the spirit was leading her and if the spirit is leading you is for you to go all the way foreign and kind of like how we we anoint uh for prayer with the oil and she just grabs a dab and puts a little bit on Jesus no she broke that box foreign she didn't take the TV and put it outside so that you know later on if she wants so she can plug it back up took that alcohol and put it in the freezer in the garage so that she could look at it in the fridge she can go grab it and drink it foreign [Music] she wasn't going to turn back if we go back to the Book of John chapter 12. forgive me for getting emotional again John 12 4 it says Lisa then saith one of his disciples Judas Iscariot Simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 Pence and given to the poorest this he said not that he cared for the poor pay attention not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and he had the bag and bear what was put there in okay he was a thief remember Judas was chosen by Jesus even still Jesus said one of you is a devil is Diablo Jesus still chose him knowing that he would betray him but Jesus walked with him walked with him laughed with him he ate with him kissed him he hugged him they slept side by side Jesus loved him loved him with an Agape not a filial love beyond that a Godly love knowing who he was knowing what he would do that's okay okay I'm gonna trust you with my money I want you right by my side I love you I believe it's brother Billy Pauly Paul that shares the testimony and our brother Jesus outside he shared it with me the other day that he didn't know the difference between his daddy's friends and his daddy's enemies we know brother Branham had people that hated him and we surely know that there were people that loved him is laugh with them just the same crack jokes with them just the same yeah just like Jesus would do to Judas not making a distinction attention but giving that true agape love Jesus didn't hold a grudge against Judas if you notice Jesus didn't even drop little hints that Judas was the evil one he was just the same as the rest of the 11 disciples now we all know that the spirits don't die the individual might die the spirit will circulate lives one and enters another is left I want to jump into another like when we were about 15 20 years ago that a rampage of mass murders at school and you'd hear like one every three weeks this high school and in that state and in that state The Same Spirit murdering those kids in school is after it blow their brains out the spirit said up off to get another one to find a new host somewhere to dwell foreign [Music] [Music] that was saving a harlot Gomer today he rescued her time and time again and the Holy Spirit is still here today okay do we believe that it's still here today then the betraying Spirit of Judas is that one is also here today it is still here today and if it was right at the hip of Jesus back then it's right at the hip of Jesus today that's why we say wherever God is there is first one in the church is Satan himself see who he can deceive and who he can get inside because he's on the job 24 7. that Judas spirit is still working today this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had and had the bag and bear what was put therein but so Judas was stealing money here but that he was a thief his confirmed the thing that was the nature of the thief stealing from Jesus's Ministry of Jesus but let's not forget and I know I keep saying he was a hand-picked disciple of Jesus Christ out demons was given in office knowing who he was on the inside I want you in my presence I want you to be surrounded by my anointing I want you to always feel the presence of God because you won't have an excuse on that day I didn't even know that there was a holy ghost I didn't even know that there was a new birth I didn't know there was an end time message I didn't know about allowed to say in the Rapture no I've got you right here yes you do know and have you ever noticed when people go to church you know I see it all the time they go to feel good you know not always that someone dragged you it's not always the you've got these big problems but sometimes people just want to get that feel good feeling that Band-Aid on their conscience they get a little comfortable to feel a little bit of that security that good news gospel that was preached to them foreign when just last night about six hours ago they were posting in the club dancing naked I still even hear it in the barbershop today oh man I just went to church yesterday you know I'm feeling good I'm ready for the week not knowing what they're going for since not knowing what it is that they're hearing since not knowing whose presence they're in since not having a revelation it makes me think of something my father told me when I was little is about our precious brother burning and how it is that he would he would come out of service and you know people would be smiling and laughing and looking at him and they would you know congratulate him oh brother tremendous message you know I'm so sick of that the people didn't even understand what was just preached they don't even know what was just said if they would have had the revelation of what was said I would have understood what was being preached they would have been hiding their faces in shame they would be scared for their lives they would be surrendering themselves to Jesus Christ but in other words it just came out all nice and happy with a nice kind in other words seated in the presence of God I'm having zero conviction on the inside feeling like everything's okay well it's not okay feeling like you're clean on the inside when you're not clean on the inside just like Judas who spent all his time with Jesus you've been called out already Judas was called out at one point it's been placed in the ministry and Judas was placed in the ministry you you walk with God like the theme of our campaign Judas walked with God he walked with him but Judas was still stealing doing things in private taking that money in private is someone it's here today you know in the privacy of your own home in your own lives is probably still dressing unladylike probably still got that foul mouth it's probably still watching pornography in the privacy of your own home in life somebody is probably still wearing makeup still drinking still using drugs in the privacy of your own life someone is probably Alvin kisas still lying to themselves on the inside it's all right it's okay estabien because I'm going to church because I go to Jericho Tabernacles because I don't miss a single service during the week I know I'm doing those bad things but I'm still right next to Jesus so it's okay Judas was doing those things while standing right next to Jesus Judas had a Ministry and still stealing right next to Jesus but God had a purpose Judas was serving out that purpose and Judas today is also serving his purpose that Thief that betrayer that liar is still has to be next to Jesus today to fulfill a purpose and he has power he does the signs and wonders preaches in Jesus name things in Jesus name without demons in Jesus name but what does the Bible say sorry get away from me you never knew me I never knew you you might have been using my name they might have been going to church he says you might have slept right next to me and kiss me in the morning but that's not the type of love that I wanted I needed an obedience to the word a hundred percent and it was the spirit that betrayed Jesus the spirit in him that betrayed Jesus and it'll be the same spirit that betrays him today but the Bible repeats and repeats itself who was it that gave Joseph the hard problems those trials his brothers his own brothers who wasn't then Moses had these trials with it with his own people of Israel that he had to deal with and sometimes where do we face the biggest trials from our own brothers and sisters in church the murmursiones the criticizers the finger pointers why does it have to be our own family because the word says the we in the tears they grow together but one's going to grow tall and strong and it's going to wither off and die because there's no life in it but the other one grows and the seed of life is flowing through it and life continues because it's a genuine seed of God says this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and he had the bag and bear what was put therein is you know no one suspected a single thing we suspect things we know the story foreign not to put our Treasurer on the spot how can we blame the treasurer we trust him with the entire Church's income and financial decisions how can he be the one to deceive the church probably it was Peter you know that loud enough Peter short-tempered feisty guy is just always so aggressive and ready to jump he didn't have a good resume you know if anything that would be the guy to choose but then Jesus tells everyone I'm going to be captured one day I'm gonna have to go through the suffering I'm gonna be crucified Peter did something that didn't help his case they're already looking at him like I don't know I think it's him he said no no Jesus I won't let that happen no they're not going to take you I'm going to stand next to you no no I'll take him I got to kill them all kill them all and then what did Jesus an answer and told him straight up calls Peter satanas you know anyone that was present there I'm just trying to paint a picture for everybody I hope you're sitting in that room that room like I'm sitting in that room right now they're probably saying well good thing I'm not best friends with Peter because because I always knew there was something rough about that guy I know he just got the keys to the kingdom and that was a good Revelation but Jesus just said you're you're Satan Diablo I'm gonna go take my food and I'm gonna go hang out with Judas the rest of my night with Judas because he's the good guy he's the treasurer he's the one that that Jesus Christ loves and trusts but our carnal Minds cannot comprehend the things of God foreign to anoint my body to the bearing this is willing to do it all but Judas wouldn't do a thing this woman would give it all [Music] what did Judas feel like the first time that he stole how did you feel the first time you did something wrong in church if someone is still doing it in church maybe you can go back to the first time you did it and maybe Judas was nervous when he took five dollars out and then Jesus comes by and says here's another 500. does it doesn't uh rebuke him at all and you know Judas is probably thinking well you know I'm the one that collects the money is also got to preach the gospel watch over the church no I think I deserve my cut okay he took that my brother Peter knows this one right you put it right in that pocket he took that money right they put it right in that pocket because he felt he deserved something he needed a little bit more uh I'm running the music department I'm dealing with the deacons I'm doing this I'm doing that I got all the youth on my back I think I need a little cut okay it's humor there was a first time for everything and it was the first time that Judas but once he did it and was it rebuked you know foreign and the grace of God and nothing happened so he felt okay so that's Sinful Nature has started growing and growing and growing and those excuses as to why he does the sin that he does kept growing and growing well I I still wear pants but I've got an accident yet I still cheat my employees or my businesses I'm a thief is struck me dead yet and I go to church and I sing every Sunday and I pray every Sunday God's with me God loves me because that's what Judas thoughts Judah said how Jesus called out Pharisees how he would expose the sin and discern the hearts so he knew Jesus could do that to him because of the love he had he he got in the comfort zone the love that Jesus was giving him the comfort zone of death foreign and growing in him sin after sin after sin because Time After Time Again the people were healed people these Miracles that happen in them we've all seen those Miracles happening I'm proud to be now having a baby which is a miracle for me he knew how to go to Jesus might be hiding but you also know who you can go too you also know how you can go to here and you've seen it more than enough time so set me free against I said no no no no no not that but this woman we can say this ignorant simple-minded woman you didn't ask questions she didn't use her mind to think about it she went and she performed that service she broke she put it all on the line right there because it's always a woman it's a bride that's going to do it it's a bride that's going to be anointed it's a bride that's going to wash his feet it just wants more and more of that love from him this simple woman that's so much Revelation because she didn't even know it she couldn't even explain it she didn't even know why where she that she hath done this shall be spoken of her as a memorial for her they would always remember what she did because she surrendered she was the washing of that lamb she was the anointing and there was a showdown right there between the make-believer and a genuine believer the one that wanted to take the money for something else and the one they wanted to give it all for Jesus and it wasn't a large rebuking but simply telling her why don't why don't you give to the poor he lifted her up and put him down he said she's going to have a memorial well you go out and give to the poor from his pride was struck at that moment and it's something so dangerous that Pride yes because in the very next verse is when he got struck his his project got hit so hard he turned around and betrayed Jesus Jesus you know if I had to pick between the the rebuking and Peter God and then the rebuking that the Judas God is I would probably take judas's rebuke him Jesus embarrassed Peter Jesus and he called him uh Satan in front of everyone but the difference between the two people is that Peter wasn't going to turn around and betray Jesus we knew that sometimes love comes with a little spanking versus so like the Alexi the elect price brother Eli they get up here give us a little whooping this is [Music] that was too much for him oh that's it this is the last straw now I'm done I'm gonna I'm gonna betray Jesus Jesus says in Judas is one of the twelve went unto the chief priest to betray him the make-believer could not handle pure worship that's too much for him he couldn't take it like brother Brandon said he didn't have that real face the faith to know that was the son of God foreign [Music] says when Jesus said that he was troubled in the spirit and testified and said verily verily I say unto you that one of you should betray me Jesus and the disciples look to one another who who does who does he speak of is and now there was leaning on Jesus one of his disciples whom he loved Jesus and Simon asked to ask of him who is Jesus talking about yes and he said Lord who is it and Jesus answer Jesus so whom I shall give us up when it's dipped when I dipped it and when he had dipped us up he gave it to iscaria the son of Simon Jesus and after this and after the sap Satan entered into him it is Jesus said unto him thou doest what thou doest do it quickly and then verse 28 says but no man at the table knew for what intent he was speaking of even then they still didn't know who it was you named him by satanas and they were still looking who could this be for some of them because Judas had the bag that Jesus had gave unto him by those things we need for the feast he should give them to the poor okay they were still thinking that Judas was the the righteous one but both Vines grow together they grow together they come up together in the church they thought it might have been Peter might have thought it might have been this one or that one of the disciples all along they were looking with the natural eyes when they had that deceiver right in front of him we're going to be closing in the message in 1965 January 20. says now wait he can take care of himself I've seen him in great battles and here Jesus was talking about Judas Jesus I know that he can take care of himself so I know that I could make some money maybe get like a little retirement so he did to Jesus what the scripture said he would do now for the sake of time going through Matthew as it starts to explain when when they took Jesus you know Judas never expected to happen what it was that happened you know brother Brandon said that he's won many battles some of which like when Jesus was going to be stoned uh he wouldn't have another opportunity I ask for forgiveness to fix what he had done that it was too late but you know at the same time when Jesus was being crucified if the musicians want to come forward at the very same time when Jesus is being crucified there was another death taking place when Peter had fallen no that was like a mistake you know he it's like he backslid for a momento he landed in a trap and just made an honest mistake foreign at the expense of the life of Jesus Christ because he thought Jesus would Escape but he didn't have the Revelation Jesus Christ had to die he had to be on that cross because he had a group of people that he needed to die for the personas he was going to save one day he was going to fill with the Holy Ghost one day he was going to Rapture one day and when Judah saw that there was he himself hung himself because he couldn't take it it was too much for him that sin it overflowed inside of him there was no turning back at that moment all your honor and Glory know that you love me get out of that comfort zone you might be him foreign [Music] we're gonna continue
