of jesus christ amen amen amen brothers if you can go to our scripture and joshua the first chapter starting from the sixth verse [Music] a very well known scripture amen if you can if you have it you can please say amen i don't think we should be embarrassed to say amen in the house of god right right i don't know we shouldn't have joshua 1 verse 6 and josue be strong and of good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear on to their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not turn out from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whatsoever thou goest yes this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success bless the remnant of his word you may be seated i'd like to thank the musicians for their hard work [Music] amen are you happy tonight this evening we would like to speak on a very simple subject would like to entitle it how can i have success i think that's a very interesting subject for young people today because i believe that every single one of us would like to have success and perhaps maybe even the adults would like to have success and whatever you do or whatever you're doing but the key thing is that they don't they want to be successful they don't want to be unsuccessful i believe that your goal is to be successful and i believe that our job as a ministry how many of you like to be stranded on the side of the road [Music] want our our christian members to be successful success in their natural life getting an exit video and their job in their school [Music] but also be successful in their spiritual life spiritual brother branham says it says these thirsts are just natural esta solamente is natural they are natural for the christian cristiano they're natural for the human being if you could put that slide for me there sister the message thirsts there is also a thirst for success so we have a thirst to be successful amen amen so many people today and we go down there and people will spend thousands of dollars to send their children to the school and universities colleges and so forth to get an education but now i have no i have nothing against that and still haven't found the right success because they that will just temporarily make things a little easier for you here porque go get a job be successful in life sexy because things are hard in life now but keep in mind remember this this is just to make things a little easier for you whether you're here on earth says we thought about being successful here on earth and that's awesome right there that's enough to go home that's enough right there that quote right there if you read that quote about a hundred times you can get so many revelations out of that one quote i tell the young people memorize the tape until memorized even when brother braddon coughs as you as you remember where even when brother ram is what he's going to say next hasta punto de capua this is because that's only temporary right now as we live but those you might have three thousand dollars in the checking account some of us in here might have a hundred dollars in our checking account doesn't matter how much you have in your checking account [Music] and all the economy we have we leave it here amen amen brother braham says in the next slide brother brahm says but men wanted to be like they compare or they copy after pero sombras see a lot of a lot of people today there's a spirit of copying they want to be copycats you should be genuine be yourself there's a lot of impersonators of elvis presley i've never been to vegas but i heard there's a lot of impersonators amen go they go like they go like the world does el mundo and say the things that they do i hope the young people are listening make a success the way they were a success we can never be a success doing anything the world does we can only be a success as we follow after god's statues and his way of doing things so how can we have success not patterning ourselves after the world patronage we can never be by patterning after the world if the cigarette company has met their greatest success by television and the beer and the whiskey crowds has made their great success he has a contribution of television that's no sign that the church shall make it success by television the success of the church el cito de la iglesia lies within we cannot say because the television done such and such for the cigarette company [Music] but that's not what god ordained us to do perez causing great colorful things to take place that that is a success we are we are dying daily on our feet estamos muriendo spiritually speaking espiritu we do well to stand ten strong with the holy spirit with us they have and you should try to have a successful life here on earth that shouldn't be your main goal your goal should to go look for the spiritual things in life says when they come out of egypt they were led by the king of heaven god was their king that was the secret of their powers that was [Music] what was [Music] [Music] what happened to israel once they settled down israel [Music] that's [Music] but they wanted a big eloquent man pero que [Music] you want to be successful in life that's close to church don't look for something far out look for god first look for god first moses oh he learned [Music] human weaknesses real quick he learned them real good he learned it so well then when god called them he had seven weaknesses did you ever study in the first part of exodus [Music] he had one he had seven the sixth one was exception imagine having a weakness in your weaknesses not being successful [Music] [Music] [Music] about the word amen i think that's a challenge for the young people and every single one of us here today we know who the president is we i'm not sure if you don't like this message or what no but you should know god you know you know how you could get to know him is there was a successful young man in the bible whatever you decide tonight whatever you decide tonight right now [Music] you don't think this young man and you can find it in saint matthew the 19th chapter man was asked to forsake all. but he refused to do it and sometimes if we apply prosperity and riches and so forth and still didn't have eternal life success doesn't always mean that that's a blessing from god there's two types of success success of the and then there's a right success with god this young man had a question yes just like every single one of you happens what's after this life but this young man was raised up in church he went to sunday school and all the all the commandments that moses put down he told us he you know when you're [Music] but you know that there's something missing and you start hearing something they shouldn't be hearing maybe a little tick yo i don't know what it is he found out that there's something missing within him imagine he's living a clean just like he lived the commandments that joseph that moses but he could not lie to himself you're [Music] but what i like about this young man [Music] is the word made flesh martinez [Music] not just in the spirit but in the flesh but this young man he did not go to just anything because he preaches he went direct straight directly to jesus he went straight to the world that there was something special about that man he went and he said good master why do you call me good only good one is god even jesus christ [Music] he said and he said i have a question how can i have eternal life if you want eternal life he said if you want life follow the commandments if you want to be perfect sell everything and come follow me so then we see that the young man it hurt him he said [Music] the prophet tells me [Music] i'm gonna focus on what when his gift is is mature his talent has a challenge and whatever customer comes and says no matter what kind of hair he has he's not thinking oh this is very thin hair no here because his talent is already matured amen so once somebody has mastered their talent it doesn't matter if he's in phoenix if he's in china or if he's in china and he can trust in his talent amen amen you can open up a barber shop where there is no one we'll bring people in so then this young man he was a very successful he didn't want to subject himself to another the money didn't hurt it didn't hurt me the business what hurt him subject himself that's where it hurt him the most [Music] [Music] do you think his businesses went to bankruptcy what happened the not because he was afraid that he wasn't going to be successful anymore it was because he did not know he didn't want to humble himself to follow another man amen and they rose early in the morning [Music] believe his prophets so shall ye prosper so if we believe that we have prophets let's follow what the prophet said prosper to be able the scripture says that if we have a prophet then let's hear the prophet for what to be able to do to be successful what the prophet said that's what we should do they have given us the key to be able to be successful what my servant moses has commanded you el propheta the prophet of god almost here in san lucas capitolo this is uh this is we're going to go to saint luke chapter 16. ivanov now we're going to find out what happened to this young man we're going to see what his end result ended up being okay because remember everything that we do here on earth there will be a consequence there will always be a consequence in san lucas this is ace in saint luke 16. verse 19. there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day [Music] el cuales in verse 20 and there was a certain beggar named lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores so we see there that there's the rich man and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels on into abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried so then we see here that it doesn't matter how much money you have in your bank account death will come at your door and in verse 23 and in hell he lifted up his eyes so then there is a hell so then there is a hell estando en los tormentos being in torments and we see that the rich young man went to hell abraham and he cried and said father abraham maybe we can stay right there for about two years this young man abraham still said father abraham wow how many of you believe do you believe that every single child of abraham go with god right here the scripture's telling me that he was a child of vaporum he said father abraham abraham where did you say it in heaven he said it in hell amen what a bible study huh wow [Music] i'm your they said father abraham then recorded me have mercy on me yeah and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame but abraham said son very quickly we're going to switch over to romans i hope that you have your bibles tonight romanos romans chapter 9. verse 7 and here paul is stating to the romans ni abraham neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called that is that this no they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god will be moving do we live in the flesh let's be born again but the children of the promise are counted for the seed they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god it's very tremendous what verse 7 says here neither because they are the seed of abraham are they called are they all children so we're going to turn to saint luke we're going to turn back to the story that which we left so he was abraham's seed will determine our destination in verse 26 and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed so then we see heaven and we see hell and they could see each other but they could not enter interchangeably just meditate on that we which are on this side cannot cross over to that side and those that are on that side cannot cross over to this side then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou would have sent him to my father's house they also come into this place of torment what did the rich man he said if you can't come over here to be able to refresh my tongue so then please send somebody to the house of my father abraham they say and abraham said they have moses and the prophets let them hear them who said it he said hear them hear them that's the key there's the scripture yeah who are the prophets of today [Music] process listen to the prophets they must point to him who is the same yesterday today and forever so then in verse 30 he says no and he said nay father abraham but if one father if they see someone that was buried and resurrected and it goes to their house and say repent because he's not in heaven he's in hell and people still don't believe god raised [Music] if i see a demon then i'll get baptized was [Music] now that you have heard the word anchor you you know what the bible says about this young so sometimes success don't mean that you've made the right choice you know what he did he went out and had all big times fiestas and throw big parties and spend lots of money and then he got married and possibly had a family maybe had a family and he just increased so much yes so he had to build new barns and things and he said no jesus you see i didn't follow jesus no no yes [Music] [Music] well look he's blessed me no see and after a while his barn swell to even he said and i'm such a and i have the riches of the world in my hand i own great songs of land a very fine person to be peros but you know the bible said yes that night god said unto him i am going to require your soul then what did it doesn't matter who you are that does not mean that god is with you because you have a house and you have a knife it does not mean that god is with you but i do believe i believe that you hear what i'm saying i believe that the believers of this message the prophet has given us the key to be able to you [Music] is is the only thing you can take is say lord i accepted you over there yeah i accepted you and i loved all of my brothers that's the only thing that you'll take would always say everybody has a tail for somebody stepped on el primerito the very first one that says him everybody has a tail for somebody but we have a god you could play sister that it's that's rich in mercy and that he can wash all of our senses it doesn't matter what you've done if you have something in your heart bitterness in your heart if you don't like this brother or that brother don't worry about that person and let's take out that root [Music] want to be successful raise your hand if you want to be successful [Music] i know that maybe some of you might be ashamed and that's okay but within your heart i place these brethren in your holy hands that you may bless them father father if there's somebody amongst us something in their heart that's not correct father may they surrender into your presence your presence burn that which is evil end [Music] the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music]
