way that they can understand and father may you please bless each and every single one of us that we're going to hear your word as well the name of Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] amen if you could open up your Bibles with me to the book of First Timothy Avenue amen like to think our pastor as always for giving us the trust to to speak to the to the young people today and each and every single one of you that made the effort to be here it's nice to see some of the young people here and it's nice to see the parents also bring their young people with them as well amen may the Lord richly bless you first Timothy the fourth chapter and the 12th verse says let no man the spies thy youth but but be thou an example of the Believers in word and conversation in charity in spirit and faith and Purity this is till I come give attendance to reading to exhortation to Doctrine [Music] neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy which the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery now this is meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that thy profiting may appear to all says take heed unto thyself and onto the doctrine continuing them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear Thee thank you is may the Lord bless the wording of his word once again it's really nice to see all of your faces amen tonight if we could place a little title to our message this evening we would like to put it as take heed unto thyself amen we hope that uh the young people brought their notes and ready to to to to read or listen to God's word you know I I tell this as a joke sometimes and I know this is not the place to joke but I tell the young people I said you know one of the good help I think to help you when you know you're in service you don't fall asleep and you can at least write something down and you can not fall asleep [Music] especially when you're you're hearing a boring preacher like me but this this evening we like to put it as take heed unto thyself you know that's a very interesting subject that the Apostle Paul is telling Timothy so if we break this down verse by verse we're going to be we're going to read a good handful of scriptures in his verse it says let no man the spies thy youth this is and I know I I'm when I was in school I like a lot what is English class but it was literature and writing and so forth so I really learn that every comma and so those little things like that means something you read it in a certain way you don't just read it just read it and read it and read it but you give it when you see a comma you give it a pause and it adds to what it's saying so may the Lord help us how to read God's word so here it says let no man the spies so in other words they're saying let no man look down on you because you're young you know there's something special about you even if you're young but there's there's there's also a scripture that the Apostle Paul says don't reject the old man don't reject the Elder no rechases we need the elders we need those with the I could say with the white hairs on their heads so here it says let no man look down on you because you're young but pero there's a scripture that says don't reject the elders to the Believers in conversation in charity in Amor and you can take it and those both ways and conduct when you finally let your guard down how do you Converse we have to be an example Even in our conversation that we need God in us that when we're having a conversation and we stay away from the dirty jokes from a dirty group chats because if you're in the group chat okay and someone uploads an appropriate photo or says an appropriate because you're in the group chat foreign [Music] what God has called us to do but I said Paul is telling Timothy neglect not the gift that is in you know it's already in you God give it to you God gave it to you you know maybe there's some somebody in here what says brother I don't have a gift I don't have a calling yeah yes yes you do now all these little gifts if I can say like this playing an instrument of interpreting and so forth these are all attributes of the gifts amen amen so there is a gift what is that that gift it's the gift of of the Holy Ghost if you obtain the gift of the Holy ghosts you have a gift amen amen so you can't say I don't have a gift you can't say I don't have a calling because God called you well brother the guy hasn't called me to anything else but he called you to his presence he called you to his kingdom that's the best calling you can ever get in my opinion in my opinion that's the best gift you can ever get is the Holy Ghost and so when you have the Holy Ghost can maneuver those vocal cords to make you sing amen God can make those fingers so flexible so you can play the piano flexibles well brother that's impossible for the Holy Ghost say nothing impossible but you have to get that gift of the Holy Ghost in verse 15 it says meditate upon these things now one word in Spanish it says get busy or occupy yourself in English it says to meditate to study it that's the same thing God told Joshua yes meditate upon these things stay on them you just follow me we're going to get to something in a little bit there's a reason why we need to get busy in God's word we need to meditate on God's word and notice what it says and it says and give thyself holy to them completely to God's word not just a portion of yourself not just a certain fraction of yourself give thyself holy to it how many can do that but it's so hard but if you notice something if you surrender yourself holy to God's word amen he says now on 16. here's the subject take heed on to thyself amen take care of yourself now we have to take things also like in the spiritual uh we have to take him in the natural take care of yourself take care of your testimony take care of who you are you got to take care of yourself now you know when I was a little boy does every single one of you you're all infants at one time there was a time in our lives where mama had to give us a bath there was a time where Mom had to give us a spoonful to our mountains but then we have to grow amen now and it says and it is unto the doctrine the teachings to the word of God take care of the teachings and continue in them for in doing this thou shall save both thyself and them that hear this now let's go to Deuteronomy um Deuteronomy the fourth chapter cuatro fifth verse here's Moses is one of the one of the one of the books that Moses wrote Deuteronomy the fourth chapter and the fifth verse this is like this behold I have taught you statues and judgments even as the Lord my God commanded me that ye shall do do so in the land whether you go to possess it is now if you notice what Moses is saying he said I have taught you statues as the Lord God commanding me to teach you so you can go and possess the land guys now keep therefore do that brought us these statues and the judgments and stuff that we need to know that God spoke through him and it says keep them and do them he said for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the Nations which which shall hear all these statues and say surely this is a great nation in a wise and understanding people so hear the scriptures say these other nations these other people are going to hear what a peculiar people you are interested that they have the word and the the people are going to say surely this is a great nation and wise why because we have received God's word for what nation it says for what nation is there so great who have God so nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for they said if you notice what the scripture says it says what other nations what other people is has God so close as our Lord Our God and all of our things when we call him we are so blessed that we have God so close that when we call him then we go we approach him by his blood that was set on coverage siento why don't you feel him you got to stay in his presence not just when you're in church once we leave church we get into bad conversations apart from the presence of God and we don't feel him anymore it's not that God left us we left him but if you stay in his presence you can feel them everywhere you go man verse 8. and what nation as they're so great and hath statues and judgments so righteous as the law which I set before you this day is notice verse 9. in the first verse it says the first phrase it says it different in Spanish verse 9 it says only take heed to thyself care of yourself take care of yourself m e keep thy Soul diligently is no it doesn't say keep your soul whatever keep your soul take care of yourself diligently carefully this is less thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen so we don't forget what our eyes have seen we've been in some tremendous Services tremendous services do some tremendous things outside of services take care of yourself you don't forget the things that you have seen God do before you will notice sometimes we stay away from God's presence and that atmosphere of the world that we were so quick to forget how God how God is we forget about his grace we forget about his mercies if we forget about all the things we have seen all the Miracles we have seen because that is what that atmosphere does it grabs you completely it's emergency submerges you in that presence of the world the world or that or that that adversary makes you forget makes you forget how God provided you or God has given you so many gifts that's why it says care of yourself what it is foreign foreign wow so what do we want the holy ghosts amen amen we gotta take care of it that's what that's what the Apostle Paul is telling Timothy that's what Moses is telling to the people of Israel take care of yourself because you have seen the Red Sea open you've seen the plagues and they're so quick to forget about what God has done for them in the desert yeah may God help us and it says but teach them to thy Sons so it's my job and this is me trabajo to understand what God has placed here make it a revelation Revelation keep it in my heart keep it in my soul and to keep my testimony clean testimonial so I can tell my son and show him that's what it's saying right here to teach your son notice young people a couple you know several time ago I was sitting in the piece too I wasn't married I didn't have a little boy like I do now I never thought in a million years that I would have a son I thought the Rapture would have happened a long time ago now I have a little hijo and that the Lord tarries I gotta teach that little boy so he can be the next one man amen you might say Nah The Rapture is going to happen by the time but you know before I get older no one knows the day or the hours a man amen maybe you might be the next father what are you going to teach your son what are you going to teach your daughter whatever amen how many you love how many you love God's word now let's go to Proverbs the fourth chapter the 23rd verse know that our pastor was preaching us a message on the Proverbs now it says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life now in in a different version of the Scripture it says above L Above All Else guard your heart oh God what does it mean you protect it you put a fence put some cameras all around make sure no one comes in and steals something is amen now forever everything you do this is flow from there from everything in there comes out oh I wish we had a lot of time from there in the heart Todo Sally where does it come out is it here it's okay where's the outlet Salida right here okay you want to know what's in the mentor that's why it says take care of your heart foreign let's go to Matthew Matthew the 15th chapter 18th verse amen are you awake tonight amen not a lot of amens but as long as you don't snore it's okay man if this is the only place you can rest is but those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart and defile the man is for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications thefts false Witnesses blasphemies now you can study those little items that I just said verse 20. these are the things which defile a man it says on 18 verse those things was proceed out of the mouth come from the heart this is man let's go to Genesis Genesis 5 genesis Excuse Me Genesis 6. 6 must be in six five and God saw the wickedness of man was great on the Earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually much now this is this isn't a time of Noah when God looked down upon the Earth he says and he saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughtsamientos of what the mind or the heart I didn't say the mind no this is right here so he saw that in the heart it is there was this wicked and evil things in the human heart is Jeremiah Jeremiah 7. excuse me seventeen seven blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is you're a blessed people if you trust in the Lord and if your hope is in the Lord do we trust in the Lord do we trust in the Lord oh brother I I trust in the government I trust in Joe Biden and Joe Biden I don't trust them no other man no Nation only in God's word amen amen so you're a blessed people if you trust the Lord notice how he types you if you trust in him for he shall be as a tree planted By the Waters and that spreadeth out her Roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh but her Leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of the drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit this is just by trusting in the Lord that's what you got to do is amen if you trust in the Lord you're going to be like a tree not like these little trees from Arizona trees in Arizona rains a little bit and they tip over but you're going to be like a sequoia big old tree planted right there by the water it doesn't care if it's hot your leaves are still going to be green there's a food shortage no matter the banks are closing down your leaves are going to be greens grocery stores you trust them a lot it's hard to trust when things are going wrong because people tend to panic is foreign foreign but if God is not in your heart but if God if God is Not There is a deceitful thing is amen amen and it says desperately wicked if you say in English that's why young men and young ladies when that young lady should be so hid away in God's heart away in God's heart has to enter God's heart to find that young lady she has to be so hid away in God's heart that young man has to get in God's heart now I hope that God can give us a revelation of these scriptures in Spanish it says a little bit different in Spanish I the Lord search the heart in English now those who are bilingual watch this I searched the heart and I try the range it's the Lord trying the rain the Lord searches the heart is what the horse has a rain that's this little rope that has it the writers on top and the writer holds the rain so stop it slow it down foreign [Music] even to every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of its doings now let's go real quickly we're running out of time I hope I get right time to read the quotes in x acts 7 representative acts 7 51. now this is a nice little scripture if you go home and you can read this you can read the whole chapter 7 foreign memorizing his message he says use stiff-neck and uncircumcised in the heart and ears the service he do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so deep so do he Siempre a spirit which of the prophets have not which of the prophets have you not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which they sowed before the coming of the just one of whom ye have seen now and betrayed betrayers and murderers who have received the law by the dispensation of angels and have not kept it is so he's speaking a little bit harsh now notice on the 51st 54th verse what the people are doing what the audience is doing okay he says when they heard these things they were cut at the heart in in English and in Spanish they were angry they were Furious in their hearts [Music] so they're not just angry at their heart because what's in their heart is being produced on the outside when Stephen is preaching and they're just doing this to their teeth just gnashing their teeth just rubbing their teeth together that's kind of tough this is but what's in the heart comes out Sally now let's go back to Proverbs how many of you love God's word man good to hear that Proverbs the 22nd chapter is the third verse Proverbs 22 3. a prudent man forsieth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished Maslow simplest there was a scripture that I wanted to read before the scripture says clean my heart give me a new heart because we started to notice what's inside the heart nothing but wrong doings in there and it says I'll give you my spirit so we have to come to God to get a new heart and now here on the 22nd uh 22nd chapter verse three again this is a plural man for sea of evil we say in English what is a prudent man someone who's wise who knows how to think when they see evil when they see Temptation they get away from Temptations that's why it says a prudent person this is when they see Temptation they run away from temptation but a simple pass on this is foreign that's why in Proverbs says a wise person foreign well Pastor I got so close to it I didn't even get bit Hallelujah you know you know what it says well how far can you get away from it then you got close to it how far can you get away I believe that every fiber of a Christian body is controlled by the holy spirit this is I believe that your your eyes are controlled by the Holy Spirit you can't help when you look to see an evil but if you lust after it you already committed adultery that's what the prophet says you turn your head hurts I always had a cross in my car foreign pecado that's where I sometimes before I'm being tempted Lord forgive me Lord forgive me foreign Ramen you can't be tempted Christ was tempted like we are Christopher never sinned he was tempted but he never fell to that Temptation what was Jesus response Jesus depart from me satanas that's what we have to do is Temptation is not sin but hearing to your temptation is sometimes we think that we're sinning because we're being tempted we say God forgive me for them tempting no what we should so the holy spirit is God that helps us bear out the truth of God and we are written pictures notice a question how many in here are born again how many are born again raise your hand it's good that's a real good number says praise the Lord for that is how many was tempted cuantos and went through Temptation immediately after you were born again every one of you those who Rose their hands and those who did it every single one of us are tempted even after you're immediately being born again oh so all right may God help us now see if you've got every son that cometh to God first got to be chastile chastise child trained no exception to every son every single one of us through his word through or through our pastors condescending amen amen God can send an angel but it has to be through a man when like brother Marcos read that scriptures but the angel didn't have the germs that's why the angel commissioned Philip to go to the unit that's what we have now I hope God can help us I really hope I really believe God I hope God can help us it says what do you believe old he says do you believe old men then when we were boys our boys have gotten 10 times the Temptation that we had they said that again there was Temptation when when our fathers had but now it's ten times more worse all right and it gets worse and it gets worse every single generation it gets worse if they struggled if you struggle what do you think about your boy and your daughter is peor sister do you realize that your daughter has the 10 times the Temptation you had when you were a girl this is what will your daughter have look at the things the pictures the devil is painting so is there a solution brother Louise Your solution to this temptation is getting worse and it's getting worse oh they say we need to pray this is we need to pray now we'll go back to you again brother do you realize we don't pray as half as much as our fathers did this if they didn't pray as much of the time as brother Branham which was a moral decent time do we still pray take care of yourself take heal of yourself there's Temptation take care of your heart you got to keep God's word you need to pray that's why we feel weak at times foreign how's your prayer life and many of you young people have already gotten to that point I already reached my limit my time limited I'm conscious of it let's come to a time where now your mom and dad can't watch you every day and every hour now it falls in your hands what are you going to do take care of your heart take care of your soul take care of your testimony take care of yourself because you are gonna have to teach your son and they're going to teach their sons oh what prayer life do we have okay classes I'm almost done sometimes we golf on a tantrum somewhere and not think about God this is sometimes we get mad and we don't even think about God that's the last person or last thing we think about foreign well that's well that's the more excuse me that's that more that's the more of a sign that you should pray this is more than ever read the Bible every day every day don't make any decisions too harshly or too quickly decision I'm going to say that again don't make any decisions is it your will for me to do this is it your will to do this is foreign if see if you're sincere sincero ask him oh God I love that quote when the inspector goes through respect your life to see if you're not just a little loose about some things a little loose on your prayer life put a loose on your temper um to talk about others he is never going to seal that card some dirty habits he cannot seal the car we got to get sealed foreign but when you ask God foreign don't want my will to be done don't change my mind excuse me I don't want to change your mind um it's Revelation how you approach God oh young people I hope God can really help us tonight let's pray that we don't change God's mind say God changed my mind I want a new heart I don't want the same heart I want a brand new one and I want you in it I speak the holy spirit because whatever comes out of the mouth change my heart God oh Lord to come inside open all the windows open up all the doors and you can please take that away from me I don't want to do that anymore I don't want to wear makeup anymore I don't want to cut my hair anymore Lord I don't wanna I don't want to say nasty jokes will you help me turn my head I'm gonna turn my head to the other side I don't want to see those things Lord you know my heart I don't want to do that [Music] Lord I want to pray another minute every day I want to pray another minute every day and the next day another minute yes oh Father until I come so close to you father but father when you tell me to do something I'll do it help me be obedient tell me the subject myself to your words [Music] I don't want to cut loose in prayer oh Father I want to pray Lord may you give me the time to pray tell me to turn that TV off to pray father I placed all my decisions in your hands decisions Lord I don't want to change your mind changed my mind I raised up my hand say Lord we have mercy on me have mercy on me Father help me to take care of myself Lord I place these young people in your hands take care of their testimonies oh Lord [Music] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
