Lord Jesus Christ to each and every one of [Music] you and I would like to thank our pastor for the [Music] confidence and the trust that he had towards me granted me a few moments to be able to speak God's word from this place from his [Music] Pulpit I will also like to send a greeting to all the brothers that are watching online [Music] there's a lot of people that watch on YouTube they uh they watch the [Music] messages so one way or another the Lord is able to reach the hearts of the people even through the [Music] internet uh many times the internet is used for other things but in this [Music] case it helps us to be able to spread God's [Music] word I I've prayed for [Music] that and if you don't mind as you're standing we'll be reading God's word you open your [Music] Bibles [Music] we'll be reading in the Book of Psalms chapter [Music] 103 verse 1 to [Music] 4 just to be able to lay a base for this [Music] message and if you have it God's word says bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy [Music] name bless the Lord all my soul and forget not all his [Music] benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy [Music] diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender [Music] Mercies if we'll be praying if you can please bow your heads we'll be praying to the Lord this [Music] evening I just ask that you pray for me and our brother The [Music] Interpreter so that God's word can be spoken the way he he wants it our loving Heavenly Father blessed God Almighty the maker of the heavens and the Earth the sea and everything that is therein we approach your throne of grace this evening Lord firstly to thank you thank you for all that you've given us especially for the health that you have given us in our bodies we thank you for it for our jobs and everything else you gave us a house cars and trucks businesses and so many things [Music] that sometimes they even get in our ways to be able to serve but here we are Lord still thanking [Music] you because in what Manner can we pay you Lord if everything belongs to [Music] you and when you give us out of your hand we give back to you Lord as as King David [Music] said so father we put this message in your [Music] hands we pray for your [Music] guidance and may everything be done according to your will in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen and amen gracias thank you Brothers you may be seated our musicians as well they may be seated thank you so much I really appreciate the brothers that dedicate themselves to the music department if I were to mention that I have a guitar in my room and for several years I've been trying to learn how to play it and even until now I've been I'm haven't been able to be able to learn it and with that you you can understand the [Music] rest and I don't want to be convinced that's not my gift that that is not my gift I can have a guitar a piano uh in the drums as well but it's not my gift it's really hard for me so the the shoe maker goes to his shoes everyone to it to their own office now if you'll excuse me if I do this just as you are seated I would like for you to open your Bibles we'll be reading in the book of First Corinthians chapter 13 and I would like this to open the hearts and as well to break the ice that sometimes lingers in First Corinthians 131 it says though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol is it and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I can remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profit me nothing love is p charity suffereth long and is kind charity enth not no is oh am no is charity vth not itself is not puffed up do not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked think no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and endureth all [Music] things we'll read up to there I apologize uh now you know that in my testimony I wasn't in the denomination for many years and in the denomination they teach us more uh more about the New Testament such as the Epistles of the Apostle Paul and the Apostle Peter the book of Acts the first church the first Christians and they would hardly ever get into the Old Testament when I barely got started and was newly baptized I asked there in the denomination I would ask about the Book of Genesis the Book of Joshua and all of that and their only reply was not to try to be so complicated uh just keep it simple just go through the letters of the New Testament and just to have my life follow that so what I just read and it's something that touched my heart it's something that we really we live we really lived through uh while we were in the denomination because Brothers you must also understand that this serves as a base for every one of us because it doesn't matter how much of a good preacher you are if you don't have love then it won't work if you play the piano or the other drums or well but if you don't have love then it won't work it won't have the outcome that you want all things must be done in love and if you don't know love that's where you have to start I apologize if you think otherwise I'm sorry and the ones that are watching online if you also think otherwise then I apologize but love comes first so we'll be uh laying this as our base so we can get into the message that way we don't take so long I wanted to say that we really uh uh enjoyed ourselves on Sunday with the preaching that our pastor brought us and with the songs and if on that Sunday you didn't leave this place being full of the spirit I don't know what then will be able to fill you but that day the Holy Spirit manifested itself it was just for you to say Lord Heal Me from this or give me this that I need and the Holy Spirit would have given it to you there obviously if you first believe it well so the introduction to this message the title is uh disease and afflictions uh I would like to First mention the great uh breakthroughs that there have been in science first so many new medicines to heal have been found like never before even about thousands uh thousands of years ago uh today we have the greatest breakthroughs or advances in medicine if you didn't know open heart surgeries are performed now they uh they perform organ transplants as well uh organs like the kidneys the liver the heart the lungs and something that's very cheap there's a actually a waiting list so if there is a donor to be able to get a kidney or something similar and I also want to mention that currently thousands of hospitals have been built thousands of clinics uh there's red crosses blue crosses uh throughout the entire world there's thousands and millions of doctors infas nurses laborator uh lab uh doctors you know they draw some blood to be able to check your blood to see if you have high cholesterol or you know so on uh thousands of years ago there was no La physician neither would they draw your blood with the needle to be able to check if you had high cholesterol now all that today uh is something that is checked they make all kinds of tests it's an entire Army that is fighting against diseases uh nevertheless I was reading in a very reliable article that said 90% of the worldwide population dies every year and is sick it's so many people that die uh because of cancer obviously it uh shows itself in different ways some say that calling cancer is the one that is at the very top and then the list goes on the list goes on and there's no need to mention every one of them uh there's a lot of people that have strokes and with the covid-19 virus I believe that every one of us at our homes we went through that experience if you never had co9 well then praise God for you that you didn't have to go through that experience but 19 even uh infected me and I do thank God I wasn't infected but it wasn't that severe and we know that millions of people have died worldwide and still this disease is uh unable to be eradicated it's something that's very uh latent uh in our midst and it has a lot of variables that can can affect us and so I ask myself the question why is uh what's the use of having so many medical breakthroughs what's the purpose of having a lot of hospitals with so many floors High everywhere in every city and every country if there's no nothing there's nothing that you can heal covid-19 with they make up vaccines and those same vaccines they have after effects or side effects because they've made a vaccines even for vapor a vaccine has to be in a time frame of 10 20 years testing with people until you can finally eradicate the disease I'm sorry the first question that we ask ourselves is why does disease come have you ever asked yourself why is it that disease Jesus come you'll learn tonight you'll learn tonight William Bram in the message diseases and afflictions from uh the message of William Branham paragraph number 23 this is it says like this he says diseases and afflictions are all the results of sin maybe not in your life but in someone but in somebody's life before you the devil is the author of sickness and afflictions I I'll repeat it the devil is the author of sickness and afflictions before we had any devil we had no sickness or afflictions but when Satan came he brought with him sickness and afflictions brothers that's the answer now there's characters in uh the word of God uh like in the case of job that we can see here that it was God's permissive will that he God allowed Satan to come into job's body because the Lord said there is no one on earth that is so perfect and so great as job he's fearful of God so then what did Satan reply he says uh job fears God because you put a hedge around him he has so many things he has cattles and so on but take that all away from him and he will curse you before your face so that's where God's uh permission came that he gave to Satan to be able to touch job Regard in his infinite will and wisdom he knew what he was going to do with job you know that the lord gave everything back to him and uh even twofold amen amen Let's uh corroborate all of this uh let's go to the Book of Romans 6:23 the Bible in Romans says for the wages of sin is death for the wages of sin is death and now the question is how does Death come it comes through diseases and why do we get sick because of sin Adam and Eve they were Eternal they didn't have any diseases or anything they lived such a happy life but Satan using the serpent or the serpent rather being anointed by Satan deceived the woman amen amen how many can say Amen to that GL so he deceived the woman and then the woman gave uh to the man to gave to eat to the man now remember this very closely the woman was deceived by the serpent that was anointed by Satan but Adam was not deceived did you know that Adam was not deceived he willfully sinned because he could have very well said you're wrong to his wife and could have stopped sin and and sickness there all of us we inherited diseases all of mankind it was for everyone in that moment that's when we all fell we're a fallen race because of sin it was something that was Universal we all died little children uh grownups uh religious people with a high morale and as well them that disobey and have are depraved they also die that's the uh the outcome of Adam's sin many were established as Sinners because of the transgression of one condemnation for all men came and that sinful condition is our inheritance that we have received from Adam but Grace is what makes the difference between Adam's condemnation and justification that is in Christ Jesus amen amen so we are therefore Justified if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ if you're born again you have the forg the forgiveness for that sin the uh Lord says that your sins are sent to the sea of forgetfulness to the abyss and now you can go in directly to speak with the Lord amen you can once again have the connection that they once had in the beginning Adam and Eve with God that's where we go back to when we accept our Lord Jesus Christ when we believe him because that's very important Brothers we must believe him and the brother the brother in the back is going like this does that mean my time is up no okay okay gracias I'm fine thank you uh the second question that I would ask myself is the question is when you receive your healing Your Divine Healing from God how long does it last we're going to go to paragraph 27 to get the answer in the same message of these uh diseases and afflictions paragraph 27 says he says they last as long as Faith lasts he says but when Faith fails then your healing will fail he said would you say every person came to the Altar and got converted would be a Christian all their days that's a question that brother Bram is asking and he says he could be a tonight A Child of God and tomorrow be a child of the devil it's when he loses his faith in God what sends him back and in paragraph 28 he says and any power that could heal you here at this platform can keep you well that's the reason I made this statement that nothing comes here but what is delivered here outside here it's according to your faith whether it stays I hope that we're able to understand this very clearly if you come to Elders prayer the brothers and sisters that come up to the altar so that the ERS can pray over you for a a disease or a trial or something that you're going through you have to be sure that God exists sure it's here present in our midst and you're fully trusting in Him because you must come believing as God's word says if you remember Hebrews 111 faith is the substance of things hop for the evidence of Things Not Seen because if your faith fails your healing will also fail and the disease will come back to your body this is something that the prophet said and the prophet brought us the last thing for this age on behalf of of God and none of us is able to deny the gift that God gave the prophet amen amen now the number one disease in the entire world Brothers is cancer and it's in its different variable uh state stages or form in the organs of our body tumors uh cataracts ulceras ulcers pneumonia pneumonias tuberculosis tuberculosis there's H so many names that uh science has given to these diseases that doctors have named them nevertheless the Lord Jesus Christ has said that they're demons diseases are demons spiritually speaking we'll be reading in paragraph 36 from the same message because it's really important to know what the messenger says canc about cancer he starts off by saying there are three that bear record in heaven he says now when we're our conversion the element came from Jesus Christ's body when he died there was water blood and spirit and these three things make up the new birth is that right ministers these three elements make up the new birth water blood and spirit that make up the natural birth when a baby is born what's the first thing water blood life all the Natural Things type the spiritual and a cancer in the natural in the spiritual he's a devil he types the scavenger and a Buzzard eats dead things the cancer comes from a bruise that's what the prophet says he says cancer comes from a bruise for instance my hand it hasn't got any cancer on it and it may have sometime well what causes a cancer is some cell germ in my body backslides gets bruised or something sets in and from that germ or cell it starts a multipli multiplication of cells multiplying and it forms the cancer and it starts eating into the body now all every life and every kind of life doesn't matter how small it is it comes from a germ you yourself you come from a germ you on one occasion you came and when you came you were a single germ tiny little germ that cannot be seen with a natural eye you came from your father you don't come from your mother's blood at all the blood cell comes from the male sex and then from that germ cells begin to multiply and uh every fourth every seed according to its kind a germ from the dog will bring forth a dog from a bird a bird and a human a human if nothing interrupts that God's program nothing interrupts it it'll bring forth a perfect normal child and it will grow to be a perfect normal adult if nothing interrupts it but when something interrupts it then it's bound to be the evil that interrupts God's program God didn't intend you to be sick God Made You in his likeness can we read in Genesis 126 if you open your Bibles genis genesis6 oh Christ [Music] Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and all and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth amen so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him mailing female created he them so in paragraph 41 of the message that we're currently reading the prophet said God didn't intend you to be sick he says God Made You in his likeness he wants you to to be well he's done everything he can to keep you well and he says and Satan is against you therefore this cancer he starts or tumor whatever it is from a germ he begins to multiply like a tumor becomes malignant and so forth It's a body just like you just like you're of a body it has a spirit just like you are a spirit it's a spirit only it it has not a soul a cancer is a germ that it starts multiplying itself cells and it starts eating up the body and it's a soul rather it's a spirit amen amen and we also come from a single germ but now the difference is that we do have a soul cancer does not have a soul there's only two Realms that that product can come from God's kingdom or realm or Satan's kingdom so this cancer it comes from Satan because God wants you to be well for you to be healthy for you to live an Abundant Life what the Lord Jesus Christ comes to mind what he said he said Satan only comes to uh steal destroy and lie he says but I have come so that you may have life and life abundantly amen amen he wants you to be happy from you not to suffer with any ailment for you not to have any pain there's no reason for us to accept any kind of pain you can turn it down with all your strength whatever pain headache or kidney pain whatever it is you can reject and you to Satan that's up up until there that no more I don't want anymore this is not something that's for me I am a child of God my God wants me healthy my God wants the best for me so you with your mouth you know that your mouth it carries the power your words are very important amen because if we're complaining every day and we're just uh petting or or just being uh very sensible to that pain that pain will become more excruciating instead of going away but if you reject it and you keep rejecting it and rejecting it and rejecting it it's going to go like this amen believe [Music] it because that's the first thing that you must do is believe it because we live by faith we're here by faith as long as you're declaring that you're a child of God and you're a holder of all the promises of the Lord with you saying by his stripes we were healed and you stand on that word Satan has to flee he has to flee he can't stand or be against the word the Lord Jesus Christ said to him it is written Thou shalt worship and serve only thy God he says well I'll offer to you all the kingdom of the world if if you just uh Bow Down and Worship me the Lord Jesus Christ said it is written so it's very important that you in your heart and in your mind you remember God's word because God's word is your Shield that uh Shields around you and the Lord will be the lifter of your head as it says in Psalms chapter 3 he is our Shield he is the lifter of our head no one else maybe you have uh faith in home remedies you placed your faith in some doctor or some person no one else will heal you only God so uh just memorize only he can heal no one else can heal besides and the prophet said it it's something that you can clearly see in his messages he only have the gift that God gave him but the angel of the Lord had to be there because if he wasn't then brother Bram would say if the angel isn't here if I can't feel him then I'll just go home because God is the one that heals amen amen as our Pastor said on Sunday everything has to be orderly there has to be order set in the church there has to be order in our homes order in our jobs amen there's uh things that don't require too much you are able to realize yourself I must have my house in order not necessarily with good hygiene and have it have it nice and neat but in our interpersonal relationships with our wives children grandchildren great grandchildren and so on your very conscience is dictating that to you now our time is up Brothers I I wasn't able to get to the point that I wanted to get to and tell you but I hope we learned something tonight I I personally learned a lot and I'm hoping that the brothers that are watching online we're also able to learn and if you want to come come to this place and surrender your life to the Lord Jesus Christ we're here that's a Great Commission that the Lord left us to take the gospel to Every Creature if these few words have impacted you we'll be waiting for you here with open arms just a few uh lines seek ye the kingdom of Christ strive to enter in you that have not come into the kingdom search Christ as your shelter as long as there's time and you have the opportunity we all know that one day the door for Grace will be closed and even today we still have this opportunity amen amen if you would like to stand we'll be praying God's word is very extensive and it fills our hearts fills our spirit and it gives us counsel we thank our brothers the musicians I appreciate every one of you let us pray our loving Heavenly Father blessed God [Music]
