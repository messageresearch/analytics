========================================

foreign you call 10 000 angels when one could have destroyed the world but he died just for you and me that's something like the basis that i want to have my message for sunday morning if the lord willing on what was christ and now we're expecting maybe these little girls could sing that song again for a sunday morning brother wheeler i certainly want to say that you sure got two fine little ladies there and they're dressing and all makeup and everything they look like christians to me and sing like and then act like that it's very fun crazy i believe i said to my wife of the day we have certainly a clean looking bunch of women around here i appreciate that they're long hair and clean faces and dressed decently i admire you every time that i i come in creon i said to media i'd like to get them all in a row sometimes take their pictures showing sure other churches where our church is here where we speak these things they they obey and we're glad it does something for us where i know that when we we have our petition if our heart condemns us not we know that god hears us beneficial this morning a friend of mine way away from here was laid out hauled him away and just barely living thought he'd be dead in a few minutes the call is about daylight i got out of bed on the floor and started praying for the old fellow and was able by the grace of god to contact that spirit you'd come back got all right come back again you see living with us tonight yet glory god passed 21 years past the time of his life's journey but the lord is good and full of mercy so we're grateful for it in la brother neville we look around at one another and i know i just got a little about one more service to be here and happy sunday and i i don't want to take my pastor i just love you hearing preach sunday night when he preached i tell you i went up here as a friend to this little drive in to have a sandwich afterwards brother evans and sister evans running brother and sister southman up there brother sophman all of them was remarking about that wonderful message and i'll tell you i've lived on it all week almost and some of them remarks and how that the ostrich thinks he had hit himself now that's true when he sticks his head in the ground but the most i mean still looking out so that's about the we try to hide our head behind something there's always they we're still showing you know he sees every bit of it she said so i really appreciate that is and i thought well i like to talk to the church well i uh brother neville gets to talk to you all times while i'm down here maybe drop down i don't want to be hypocrite enough and not out on a caller nothing's set up there at the house and church open down here i got want to be down here because i love you and the weather here doesn't agree with me and the country doesn't agree with me and i'm allergic to the air of the chair you know just as soon as that air strikes me i just breaking highs right over see and there's nothing you can do about it and we don't feel good none of us when we're here we hardly one of us has been really feeling good since we've been here because we kind of got used to the high climate nosotros but now one thing that draws me here is you all hey man you all know you find lots of friends i i'm so grateful i guess i i just kind of personally people i know be maybe millions around the world this one's estimated by someone probably in personal knowing of about 10 million people but there's something about about home about a certain people there's just everybody's got these special people in your life especially you know i believe that if there isn't then why is our wife special to us you know why is our see where our wives our husbands and so forth it's special especially and you have that with friends it's something other that you just love to meet with them just talk with them these little spots i think of this old swamp here where this little church stood and where before it stood here there's nothing but a pond that's reason that road set way out there to get around that pond is this is actually the property the street comes right by the door there and uh but it was a pond and i remember getting out here and trying to find a place to build a church to the lord and just a young boy and i listened these this young fellow southern over here praying a while ago with all that enthusiasm i thought you know i used to be able to pray like that without catching my breath hardly and then you get older you kind of slow down a little you know you're still moving but you're in second gear as i told brother you get down into low gear when you get about 70 or 80 i guess but you know then you're still moving as long as you can move what difference does it make just a little more time to get there especially i remember how was praying and right here in this weed right where this pulpit stands now just about where it's at that's what drove a little stake where no to put the pope lord god give me this place now right there in a cornerstone lays my testimony of a vision the morning i laid it when i hardly could think man said this is not your tabernacle but do the work of an evangelist he said when i looked out and seen all the world during the bright blue skies and people coming from everywhere it's laying in the cornerstone there how little did i think that would happen even though the vision said so but it doesn't fail it's going to be there anyhow i've been a lot of interviews this week because sunday the gracious presence of the lord came down and i supposed to have left monday estadon muchas entrepreneurs we haven't took a vacation yet the kids my vacation comes later a little later on but i want to take the children on a little time they got to go back go to school now so i thought this week would be a good time facing chicago next week in that meeting there is a but then the anointing of the spirit i thought now is the time to have interviews now is the time of these i can get caught up on a few of them i see some of the people sitting present that was in the room they know where the lord met with us or not um everyone besides some woman that billy put in just a space just before some lady from louisville she had a little girl and we shared i think they really belonged to church of god in louisville or something todd but every case every one of me come in before i left home the holy spirit told me who would be here what they'd asked and i wrote down on a piece of paper and said just what they'd ask their questions the way they'd asked them and how they'd be answered and i tell them i said yours just watch you look now a few minutes ago i hear what the holy spirit reach over on the death say he he told me this before he ever come see but what is up in the house who would be there and what would be what their attitude would be and all about poor even left home this year i've seen the time many times when it could be coming down the road praying i'd see that prayer line pass before me and no every name that would be in the prayer line before i ever got here know where they were sitting in the church and what the how they'd be dressed and what they look like [Music] orlando you don't tell people everything like at you these things happen you just don't tell them it's not necessary to tell them i just tell people things that i think is going to help them when the lord presses me to tell them say say this you want to tell everything you seen because that wouldn't be right you see you just get in trouble and everything else like that you have to know how to handle those things by the spirit of the lord i've had people stand before me and ask me questions i know exactly i wouldn't tell him because i just felt constrained not to do it remember i believe was last wednesday night i preached on a prisoner see see you want to tell that person but something says don't do it the spirit says don't do it don't do it yet a gift is looking right at it see don't do it don't do it so you better not do it then you're in trouble with god [Music] now we don't come down here tonight just to stand here we want to hear the word of the lord you've been praying we've had a wonderful time and i always want to come down i know bring this little book of text because he's uh sometimes brother neville is so gracious he just keeps asking me will you do this or do that or speak and i looked through here to find me a text of some sort and then we started from there and i'm sure now be sure sunday now i don't we never know we cannot tell you see i've come here at times with with the text in my mind that i was going to speak on again here and change it completely around yesterday and i've had scriptures roll down i say i'm going to use this text or use these scriptures as they come down and we'll say this that or the other yet i'll write down this like uh first corinthians 5 15 and second corinthians 7 1 and matthew 28 16 so forth just put it in like that down like this and write them scriptures down and look down there i know what the scripture says there sometimes i never even touch that goes all the way around a different way altogether and we just so now um if the lord is willing i want to speak and closing these little series of services since being here sunday morning on a very important thing so now come early prepare to stay at least a little bit late maybe about two o'clock something like that i got around about 30 or 40 scriptures already wrote down on the subject but i think what it what i'm going to try to do if the holy spirit will help me to catch the message and the place where it's at now and build it right up where it started and build it right up into the present time ways is so that when i i'll leave for chicago then i got to go straight to arizona and then on on and on and it may be as far as i know it may be next year again maybe next summer before i get back again the tabernacle is passing across this way again because it got meetings on billy right now is working on overseas for a complete world tour beginning right immediately after christmas and i'm all booked up until around about december and uh well maybe the first week in december dallas so then then in january we want to start on complete world tour all the way around completely and we're working on that now finding just where the lord will lead i'm so grateful to the even to the people and ministers as much as i say against their denominations and things like that you know on the books lane right back there now brother roy borders takes care of the invitations and since christmas the first year there's been over a thousand invitations around the world the principles of a thousand invitations has come in back there so the lord just has to direct me on which one of those to go to and what to do we just depend on him you couldn't take them all you couldn't take over uh eight or ten of them in a summer if you had to in a complete unless you just go one night here and one night there and that's they're asking for two weeks and three weeks and so forth as long as you can stay here some of them says as long as the lord will lead and and all like that so you don't know just exactly where to start or what to do in today so we're just laying them out before the lord said now you tell us heavenly father and you help me pray with this matter see you help me pray that we can thought after having healing service last sunday then maybe this sunday if we just take the teaching and bring it right up and show what what the time where we're at what what's what's what's up the threefold purpose of god's great plan since before the foundation of the world and bring it down to the day the threefold plan of god a plan i'm working on the second part of it i'll get the scriptures out and hunt them out and place them on now let's see let's bow our heads just a moment lord jesus the great shepherd of the sheepfold we have symbol here tonight in thy most gracious holy name senor jesus congregates we love the lord and we thank thee for this prayer meeting night for the hymns of the church as we've sang them with joy in our hearts and i heard him as they come in clapping hands and we went out on our knees and all poured out our hearts to you and thanks you for what you've done for us and i asked you to continue to walk with us now the hour has come for the reading of the word and for something to speak on to the people direct us in our thoughts father and get glory personas and say something tonight through us that will help all of us to go out of here with a purpose in our hearts to live better and closer to you than we ever have that's what we're here for lord we are here to know more about you and we pray that you will unfold your great being to us tonight in the revelation of thy word that we might know how to be a a better christian and how to act in this last days we asked it in jesus name amen in the revelation come my uh sight falls upon a picture of isaiah isaiah 38. let's read over to isaiah isaiah 38. in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah the prophet the son of amos came unto him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shall die and not live in vermont and then hezekiah turned his face towards the wall and prayed unto the lord and said remember me o lord i beseech thee i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i've heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days 15 years may the lord add his blessings to this reading it's a very outstanding uh subject for a short message here i believe i want to call it god doesn't call man to judgment without first warning and we are we're we're we catch the the background or the platform of it here and this text tonight god warning man before bringing him to uh is death inosotros now every one has this we might say well this fella died without a warning no no no god never you don't know what was that man's heart you don't know what's been going on in his life see god never brings any man to his death without first warning about it tell him it's something of preparation no god is is sovereign and he he knocks at the heart of every man giving him the opportunity to come now he might ward away and turn it down and shake his head to it and walk away so it's just a funny feeling i'll get over it but anyhow it was god god speaking to him and god never even brings judgment upon the earth without first giving the people a warning god never does nothing without declaring it first what he's going to do is and he gives people a choice and you can you can do right or wrong that says see god can never change his nature his program can never change from what he started with because he's infinite in his program and his ideas are all perfect hamas so if he would change it that would show that he'd learn more so being infinite he cannot learn more his his first his first decision is always perfect and there's nothing can ever change god before man ever was put uh had a chance to do wrong god put him on the basis to where he could accept our deny he could receive our or not opportunity by the way if that minister in here brother baker uh i believe was on the the interviews the other day i've got these questions that he had rolled out for me on the serpent seed i got him laying back here now hermano baker if he's sure why well i don't see him anywhere right at the present time but it's sure he and his wife a very fine man and a woman but they they couldn't understand a few things about the teaching of the serpent's seed moment said in and sermons beyond that and and talking about the the impregnation and so forth but uh then it's just like a brother a fine man just a christian for a couple years or two but just didn't understand you see us yes it's hard if you don't you have to depend on the holy spirit because this bible is rotten riddles you just can't sit down and read like a newspaper it's head yes sir how would you ever justify god when he told moses up there said now don't you make any engraving images in his commandments don't you make anything like heaven any any angel or anything else don't make any engraving images and yet on the same day told him to mold two angels out of brass and put him right at the mercy seat where mercy's at you have to know god in his nature before you can understand his word he he he has the key to that word himself and he he's the only one can handle and open it and so he's the one has to reveal it is and now we find out that is nature wash here there are always to warn a man before judgment to warn a nation before judgment and so forth is he always gives his warning a reminder to we of a responsibility we are responsible and god is punisher on the earth for a reason and that reason that he is punisher for we are responsible to him for that reason you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do el if you don't if you went to work for a man he'd give you a job on a ranch or something other than you just went out to the barn and just sit down out there and say well see you must go ask him what he wants you to do and then do it if you're working for a man find out what your duties is and then if our life is on the earth here then we should go to the one who punisher lord what would you have me do what what what must i do why am i here it is to be a housewife dishwasher if it's to be whatever god wants you to do then you do that the very best that you know how to do it no matter how little no matter how little it is you must do it no important significante you say well the trouble of it is each one of us wants to do the next man's job we all want to pack the ball as we say you see like this watcher now every little movement in there has its place now every part of it can't be the hands now i only look at the hand to see what time it is but if one of them little wheels in there gets out of order that won't keep the right time that's the way it is with people we've all the body of christ has got to be in their position and harmony see and then we can look around and see what time of day it is then the worlds are looking to see what it is see but they're watching you and if you're just a little hairspring mainspring or whatever you are you do the very best job you can at that end now because we have a responsibility that we've got to answer to god someday for every man that come on to face the earth has to answer to god for our responsibility and to many of us a stewardship we have to answer for response this responsibility is a stewardship that's been committed to us by god i don't care what it is as i said a few moments ago a housewife then be a genuine housewife that's right if it's to be a farmer be a genuine farmer nosotros whatever it is that goddess but you do you've got a stewardship to that you've got to answer to god for because it takes all these things to do it is was told to make ready to get ready because that he had to meet his maker hezekiah was a king and a great man you notice this plea here lord i beseech you to consider me i i've walked before you with a perfect heart what a testimony that is to to us today this should be a man that walks before god testimony even death was pronounced upon the man and yet god changed his mind about him because hezekiah wanted to do something and god said he would give us the desires of our heart you got a cancer on him or something other and they call it a ball in that day but we know barrels don't regularly kill you they just get well but it's perhaps the cancer and it opened up like a boil normally and god told isaiah said go up there and tell him that he's going to die and hezekiah had something he wanted to do yet yet when you plead anything to god you got to be a reason for it it's just like this scripture that is so often referred to if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you said now that's all together controlled on motive and objective thing see you just can't go out here that's where many of us makes uh many mistakes is going on saying i'll show you i got faith to do this now you're wrong to begin with god don't give you gifts just to play with it ben solo just to play with that's nothing to play with that's sacred just use it in as the lord will let you be a prisoner to him comedy no matter how much you want to tell that guy is wrong and what this the other you hold still to god says so then when god says so then you can come with thus saith the lord and tell that just forget about it the world today just like hezekiah was then it's been warned it's constantly being warned the church is being warned and now these things just don't happen by by chance they've all got something behind them now hezekiah being sick having this bar that wasn't by chance god sent isaiah up there and told him to set his house in order now because he's going to die hezekiah wept and told god i walked before the perfect heart and i i pray you spare my life for a cause a good cause the cause of god god told the prophet said go back and tell him yes isn't that strange hezekiah was the greatest man in the land hezekiah was a king and a godly man he was a real man if he could plead that before god and god didn't rebuke him far i've walked before you with a perfect heart now that's a saying a whole lot important and god never said no hezekiah you didn't do it but he admitted he did do it and he said i'm going to i'm going to spare your life a little longer see i'm going to give you a request see because he had been a just man he had been a a real servant to christ and then we feel that we have a right to ask something if our objective is right and then our motive to it important now we see today that for the past many years i'd say for the past 15 to more years that constantly there's been a warning out across the nation repent our perish you notice i was talking today to the wife just early this morning and i early breakfast we were setting a table talking before i left i said wife uh she's talking about billy graham and about his wife is how common and everything they tried to live i said that is a real servant when he tries when a man maybe makes 2-3 million a year out in his campaigns but he doesn't receive it his foundation takes it placing it back into the work in the broadcast and so forth and billy gets about 25 000 here received she said how would he ever spend 25 000 here i said he he takes just what he has to have that's all he's got a home to pay for everything that went on i said i've got lots of respects for billy graham i said because he has a message and that message is repentance and i i'll tell you there's nobody and i know of in the lands today that god has used with that message like billy graham oh he's got a down pat he just stands there and i mean he calls them politicians and church members to repentance but that's as far as it goes and here comes brother oral roberts another great servant of the lord and there's nobody that comes out there and compare with oral robbers oral roberts that bulldog grip of if uh you're just casting out evil spirits and calling the name of the lord and and little sensations and so forth about divine healing that's exactly right there is a messenger to the pentecost there is a messenger to the church denominational world see and the coal world and then look around at our own little humble ministry standing jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever you see hey hey what's that doing calling that bride group you see hallelujah it calls from both those groups it's taking a wheel out of the wheel see what i mean and then god confirms that message that billy graham preaches god heals the sick by oral robert's prayers and god produces the things that jesus proved that jesus christ is the same yesterday and forever and it's calling those things it's messages of the and each one of those messages is calling repent or perish that's right or perish there's no hopes it's all gone world's warned of his coming each one of the messages speaks and warns of the coming of the lord jesus both through the church denial remember god's always in threes like father son and holy ghost and justification bap and sanctification baptism holy ghost so far these and threes and of them one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them hallelujah one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i am one of them they were gathered in the upper room all praying in his name they were baptized with the holy ghost and power for service came now what he did for them that day he'll do for you the same i'm
