this evening is The Interpreter this evening brother Emmanuel Santos is can you please stand with me let's go ahead and sing the song on the wings of a dove [Music] [Music] is [Music] has but not from our minds God gave them his songs [Music] thank you [Music] Jesus are safe savior came to Earth one day he was born [Music] God gave us a song all the wings [Music] on the wings of a Snow White aside from above all the wings oh on the wings foreign [Music] to see what our Prophet had to go through to write that verse of the song is I believe that we could all put our our lives in that song that without that snow white dove Paloma Blanca I don't know where I would be at I don't I don't know what position what place I would be at today brother I I've always known the the blood of Jesus Christ and I've always known that Jesus loved but it was when when Jesus became a reality to me [Music] when Jesus became a reality in that snow white dove Jesus then my life changed foreign [Music] turn with me to First John De Juan chapter 4 and verse 19. I'm going to be going to two scriptures tonight first one is in John the second in Ephesians 2. thank you first John 4 19. the Bible says we love him because he first loved us I'm going to repeat that again we loved him or we love him because he first loved us I have this marked in my Bible this is the Bible that I get I used when I gave my heart to the Lord and I made sure to mark this scripture down because I had to be reminded that the only reason I love my Lord is because he first loved me I encourage all the young people and everybody too just Mark that scripture down and remember it I love him because he first loved me Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 8. now this is another one that I I have it marked down because I based my salvation on this is fundamental it says for by Grace you are saved through faith not of yourselves it is a gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast let us bow our heads heavenly father father Celestial Lord we're thankful that you brought us here this evening Lord father we come here unworthy father unworthy in our flesh but Lord knowing your word father that Lord you brought us back with the price you did everything you could to bring us back lord so we come here boldly to your throne of grace knowing father that whatever we ask Lord it shall be given Lord I ask that your presence be known here tonight father that your presence be known to each and every person that is expecting father Lord that you may help us and give us what we need so that we can leave here different fathers Lord we put ourselves in your hands father your capable hands we thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen amen amen God bless each and every one of you okay we love him because he first loved us that that is um such a simple yet such a tremendous scripture to me because to realize that God's love isn't like our love is his love is not a reactional love see every every person that I've out I've Loved ever in my life has been caused by a reaction and building of a relationship that's that's how we begin to to love somebody before I was able to love my wife I I had to talk to her first I I had to see who she was and I had to see her character and she had to see who I was and then over the time of our relationship love began to come on the scene but with God God always loved God didn't love you because you became a Christiano God didn't start loving you when you said I'm going to give my life right with the Lord the Bible says God is love is Amor so even before the foundation of the world even before the world was even made God loves you oh in my condition oh with my issues that I'm going through my mental breakdowns with my hatred that I have in my heart with the things that I've been doing God already loved us because his love is not Performance Based God's love isn't just it isn't based on how good you're going to be or how good you are but God's love is an eternal love and it has never began or never ended so it's such a beautiful scripture to me to know we love him because he first loved us that's a reaction to his love is why we're here today I I first I I want to express what a beautiful thing it is to be here in the house of the Lord to be with people that believe in the truth to know that God's presence is in this place what a reality it is to know that Jesus is here Jesus is here tonight Jesus man if that can be a reality in our hearts today that Jesus is here mostly every place outside of this church there's bad spirits everywhere at the stores at the gas station wherever you go there's bad but to know that there is a place a place that that the presence of God is here and it's called church when I was a child and you know where I would have my best sleep set is it was under the bench and I just remember having the most beautiful dreams and sometimes I remember my mom carrying me I I don't know how I remember I must have been two or three I don't know but I remember my mom carrying me to church then in a in a twinkling of an eye I remember her taking me out of church and I would think to myself it's like we just came to church why are we we living already I was sleeping under the presence of the Lord I was enjoying myself yeah and whenever I was a teenager I've said this story before and whenever I was a rebel and I would do things out in the world and in school I would come to church and I would feel such a presence of the Lord oh man when the preaching would go forward the conviction would hit my heart every song would just hit me and hit me but I knew I knew there was a fact that if I left those doors if I left those doors I would go back to the sin that I was in let me stay here and let me just stay here because if I stay here I know I won't sin anymore I knew if I left this church or the church that I was in I would go and sin again and it reminds me of the disciples that were with Jesus it reminded me of Jesus what they they said about him they said that he was God With Us that when he was with his disciples he was the Emmanuel is the disciples they rejoiced with the Lord because the Lord was with us the Lord was everywhere they went they sat under him as he as he preached and he taught the word they saw him do Miracles they felt his presence the Bible said that John slept on his chest what a beautiful thing to be with Jesus Christ see it was a beautiful presence when he was there and I feel sometimes that that's the feeling of whenever we go to these great camps that we have yeah that we go and we have such a walk with God we feel the presence of the Lord we feel so close to him that we could hear him talk to us but but every time I would hear stories I would hear stories of whenever they would have to leave when they left [Music] the world hit them like a ton of bricks see Jesus was with them they were with Jesus see I was with Jesus in the pews but I left him at the doorstep I didn't I truly didn't want to serve the Lord all the way because I love the world a little too much so so every time I would feel the presence of the Lord I would Rejoice I would give God all the honor and the glory adios but then I would leave him at the doorstep the disciples they rejoiced with the Lord but whenever he died what did they do whenever he was crucified crucified Peter rejected him the disciples they ran away Jesus was gone and he was out of the scene Jesus what did Peter do Pedro let's look at into Peter's life real quick Jesus dies okay of course in the third day he rises again but Peter being Peter Pedro he says I'm going to go fishing again he says you know what Jesus is gone I'm gonna go fishing and it's very interesting for me to think about what Peter did because Peter he was a fisherman that's the best thing he could do that was his profession that's what he excelled in so when he left Jesus now think about it when he left Jesus Jesus when Jesus was off of the scene Jesus he did the thing that that he couldn't do the very best he went back to his profession he went back to his he went back to fishing this is the best thing that he can do he was a fisherman he was a professional is but after he leaves Jesus he goes fishing and he doesn't catch anything now think about it the best thing that that Peter can ever do his best expression is a fisherman yeah when he leaves Jesus he cannot catch anything that's that's the feeling of when we leave Jesus that's the feeling when we feel when we leave the camps and we leave Jesus at Camp yes sure we leave Jesus where we left or we leave Jesus at the pulpit or at the at the altar Jesus and when we try to go and live the world in the world it's not going to be the same anymore and and uh my my concern is My Cry is that that this the thing it doesn't become normal because they went to they got a point in my life when I was out in the world that leaving the presence of the Lord in church became normal to me that that I could I could do my little religious thing and then I can go to the world I I could I I had um church clothes in my closet I just had to pick a suit and I had I looked just like a Christian um and it becomes normal after a while leaving Christ at the door is the situation is what brother Branham says that that when we leave these doors we leave the the doors of the church this is a hard reality that we either get better or we get worse so every time we leave Christ at the door stay the same but it gets worse and worse and worse if if we continue to grow our relationship with the Lord it gets better every time we leave those doors is so um my title this evening is Jesus wants a relationship not a religion Jesus very simple topic but I just I I want to speak from from my heart and from my experiences and the the one thing that Jesus hates Jesus is religion is now religion let's I'll break it down what religion is in the Merriam-Webster it says it's an organized system of beliefs and practices practices rituals and symbols designed to facilitate the closeness and sacredness to the Transcendent God higher power or ultimate truth or reality is so it's a practice or a ritual in order to get closer to God now there is a True Religion I don't want people to walk out of here and say ah religion is bad okay there is a True Religion there is things that we have to do do you remember what those things are those Commandments baptism those are religious acts but that's true religion there is even the way we get baptized there's a certain way we get baptized in certain in one name is says there is a old-time religion there's an original religion this is but religion without relationship that's no bueno no good religion relations religion without relationship is not good for by Grace you are saved this is not of yourselves it's a gift of God not of works because somebody might boast because somebody might Elevate themselves because we begin to play the comparison game because we begin to clothe and hide ourselves in religions we don't want religion we want relationships good works brings a a comparison but but when you get saved it will humble you know religion is what what we can do but relationship is what God already did what can I do for the Lord what can I do how can I make myself look more righteous but the grace of God is what he already did his righteousness I don't lay on my righteousness I'm no good if if I I go in in in am judged by every single one of you I might not be a good Christian in your standards if I judge you fleshly by your righteousness you might not be in my level and and religion it begins to compare and to see ah well you know what I do this and I do that and they don't yeah works and acts and all those things and if I do those things and you don't do those things something's wrong with you they might not be safe yeah something's wrong wrong with them because they don't do exactly what I did exactly that's religion that works by Grace you are saved for gracias what a reality Grace I am safe I don't I don't have to try I don't have to pull and push it's what God already did for me we judge a people by their morals instead of looking at them through Christ Morales have you ever felt better about yourself when you see somebody falling have you ever felt like oh man see I'm a good Christian look at them that's religion have you seen a marriage that that's struggling and it may it validates your marriage that's religion have you ever seen anybody that's just not right and it just elevates you just a little higher that's religion because the grace of God you can't find it it's impossible it's impossible it's impossible to please God by my works when the grace of God finds you entonces something happens you realize how unworthy you are not how better you are if that's the case something's wrong and when you find the grace of God we realize how below the mark we've been living and how grateful we are because Jesus Paid the price Jesus that I don't have to live off of my righteousness I live off of his righteousness so so I I'm I throw my righteousness away Isaiah it says we are all as unclean thing and our righteousness has filthy rags that's that's a good thing for me that my righteousness to God is filthy ragsia that makes me feel good it might it might burn but I realized one thing that I don't have to carry the burden of trying to be righteous to be saved I don't have to carry the burden of trying to be good to be safe because everything I do and anything I do paradios it doesn't work you can try you can try you can try it does not work and what happens is when we try to do that when we try to be righteous we begin to lose the Christian the characteristics of Christian Joy characteristics because we begin to think that we have to save ourselves we begin to lose our joy because we try to appear goodness now I I just want to be real here today I want God to speak to us today it's it's all right if somebody's going through that is it's okay if somebody's trying to be religious it's okay to let go of that religiousness it's okay to let go of that righteousness God doesn't like it it's filthy ragsia you know what is we it seems like the churches they they celebrate good morals is they celebrate uh the way people act and the way people do things now we've seen it everywhere that brother uh he ties that brother oh definitely he's going to be saved oh well those people man they're good we begin to judge people by their good works instead of or we begin to celebrate their good works instead of celebrate their Brokenness now Jesus came to save the broken this is a hospital I I don't if what if this was a hospital and all of you guys were fine and healthy history what are you doing here this is for the broken is we come here to fix we come here to help we come here to you something's wrong with you let's bring them in let's bring them in but we come to the point where we say well you know what all of you guys are good but they're bad they sit in the back of the church and we begin to celebrate good morals instead of celebrating the righteousness of Jesus Christ now it's just a good thought I've seen it many times everywhere you know I've been guilty of that yes I've been guilty of comparing myself I've been guilty of thinking I was less than somebody and I've been guilty of thinking I was better than someone we got to be real but but we the Bible says we have to judge people by seeing them in Christ if we see somebody falling instead of seeing their works we judge them by Jesus Christ in this message leadership it's uh preached in 1965 I believe in October October 31st Halloween um and he's preaching he's actually speaking to uh the young people here and so it's a beautiful message he says your priest Your Leader or so forth can teach your religion foreign [Music] none he's here right now you've got to accept him here right now he's here he's a Persona in the form of the Holy Ghost you have to accept the person of Jesus Christ you understand that all of you got to accept the person of Jesus Christ to have eternal life now I could teach you I could teach you how to live right brother we can get some speakers to teach you how to learn social cues how to look good as a Christiano what to wear when you come to church something I could teach you how you gotta hold eye contact to be respectful to somebody conversations I could teach you to look good as a Christian but we're here to preach Jesus Christ we're here to preach Jesus Christ and his righteousness alone it's only him it's only his righteousness I could live here knowing that I am safe no matter what anybody says no matter what I even say how critical I am about myself how unworthy I feel that doesn't matter Jesus died for you so that I don't have to worry about my righteousness anymore you don't have to feel pressure to to live under these certain codes man living like every day is uh uh what is it called um New Year's resolution today's the day okay this Monday is this Monday I'm not going to cuss this Monday I'm not going to look at any women this Monday I'm gonna walk in the spirit and then we try we get under the pressure of religion de la religion I gotta do this I gotta be like this and then by Wednesday yeah we're kicking our dogs we don't even want to talk to our own family members why because we're under the pressure of religion under the pressure of self-righteousness get that off of us let's get that off of us what a uh enslaved mindset that is what a burden that is to carry righteousness for your own salvation salvation and that is a big burden to character that's big to carry brother Brown says religion won't give you eternal life he said he said instead of trying to hold on to God let him hold on to you every day we're trying to hold on to our religion hold on to God when it came down to brother branham's worst day when his wife and his daughter passed away and they were there at the tomb and and the preacher was preaching ashes to ashes and dusted us at his lowest point is didn't know what to do Branham brother Brandon wanted to take his own life think about it but then here comes the preacher Here Comes this man he said after everything you've gone through right now you lost your dad you lost your brother now you lost your wife and your daughter esposa you have to take care of your son by yourself after all of that can you still hold on to your religion they said this place my religion has got a hold of me after where I brother Brandon says when he wanted to let go when he wanted to say it's over it was God holding on to him that's Grace that's not merited that's not something that I can work my way to that it's by grace and grace alone we are saved by grace if you don't feel safe it doesn't matter if you believe it you are saved by faith or by faith what did it say you are saved by grace through faith all you got to do is believe it I don't feel it my life doesn't walk according to it believe it believe that you are saved and you are right now Jesus doesn't love you because you may you turned a new Leaf Jesus Jesus doesn't love you because you've made your decision today Jesus always Jesus loved you at your worst Jesus Jesus loves you at your worst conditions well how do I begin to have a relationship with God how do I take them out of the the church and take them with me understand that Jesus loved you first and when you realize Jesus we'll love him because he loved us I love him because he loves me first what a beautiful thing there's this brother I don't ever I don't know if anybody knows who he is he's not from the message he's a Baptist preacher his name is Paul Washer is Paul Washer I came across this quote and I just want to quote it to you he says a lot of people think that Christianity is you doing all the righteous things you hate this is and avoiding all the wicked things you love in order to go to heaven no that's a lost man with religion he said a Christian is a person whose heart has been changed and they have new affections it doesn't it seem like we when we're not serving the lord we should that um the way we should be understood that we're doing everything that we don't want to do ah church again dragging our feet to church putting on the Christian faith Christiano I gotta do my duty thing okay do you think do you think somebody somebody in the weekend today is Friday oh yes anybody that's been in the world knows what Friday means to a worldly Persona representative it's the weekend I don't have to work tomorrow let's say his buddy calls him hey there's a big party over here in soso's house so and so is here and we've got so much drinks here and we're playing really loud music yes come on man let's go bente you think somebody that would be in the world do you think that would be like ah I gotta go party again oh man I guess I gotta go drink and act like a dummy again yeah I'll be there right now hey can you pick me up do you need help you need help buying some beer do you need help doing this why that's his nature that's what he loves to do so why do Christians drag their feet to come in churches there's a different nature going on oh you're not different I gotta go to church to Worship the Lord to fill his presence no it's not about them church is not about everybody else we focus on on oh I gotta I gotta look good and I gotta be good and I gotta act good myself I gotta uh I gotta go over there and talk to these people I know they're talking behind my back I'm going for Jesus whether so-and-so leaves whether the whatever happens I'm going to church for Jesus that's what church is about church is about Jesus we take our Focus out sometimes and we put it on somebody else oh I don't like going to church she worships too loud whatever happens I don't care I want to see Jesus man when we get that relationship with the Lord rain shine good bad I don't care I want Jesus Christ what a beautiful what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once enters into into with Christ dead to the things of the world get away with God and the veil dropped around them and all the world I don't care what my neighbor does I love them anyways I don't care what's going on I love them anyways I'm here for Jesus I'm shutting with him brother Brown says Christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer then this is today people just have religion just to make them miserable just enough religion to make themselves miserable this is knowing they ought to do it they're trying to escape hellos it's not don't be a ble to serve him and don't say nothing serve him because you love him get that relationship with him then it becomes easy to serve him every single day and if you happen to fall is dust your feet and go again because it's not based on your righteousness it's based on the blood of Jesus Christ and what he did for you therefore there is no more condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus Christ when you're in Christ there is no more condemnation Oh what a beautiful thing we're happy and safe when we're in church but let's put him inside is don't leave them out there in closing yeah Jesus told the disciples Jesus said you the world shall see me no more he said after a little while you're not going to be able to see me anymore what was he saying he was physically leaving the scene the disciples said don't don't go don't go you they were focusing on God with them but he said after a little while the comforter shall come down for he will be in you then wherever you go he will be with you Jesus Jesus after he died and he rose again he found Peter fishing he found Peter broken he found Peter the way he saw him when Peter denied him do you think God Stopped Loving Him Do You Think Jesus said you know what you failed me Peter Jesus oh Jesus loved him because his love is not based on our performance Jesus the start of your relationship with God is God loving you first he goes to Peter right before he leaves Peter do you love me Elizabeth Peter do you love me Peter it is yes Lord I love you we can't love Jesus if we tried foreign Peter was saying yes I love you but he was using the word Ophelia Jesus knows that he you can go so far just as yourself until he received Christ in him if you like to stand with me and the musicians come up it's the Christ in us it's Christian Nosotros do you love Jesus it's because it's Christ in you working inside your life it's your your maturity as a Christian is all relationship based and nothing else your revelation of the word is relationship based he typed the religion I'm sorry he typed the Revelation Revelation to him and his wife loving each other so much that whenever she would write him a letter she would say yeah I just put the kids to sleep I'm sitting next to the fire it was such a simple text but he loved her so much that he began to read in between the lines and he knew exactly what she was saying relationship it brings a revelation to God to the word to Jesus Christ you know what I've realized I can't explain the message to people I can't explain the Mysteries to people why porque because it's only given by Revelation Revelation and it's only given by Revelation through a relationship with Christ the maturity of a Christian is adoption to Sons think about it well we're not matured into these these great formal Christians but we mature to children to God saying Dad Dad adios that's our maturity it's a relationship and it's a it's a closed tight relationship with our Father God he loves you today he loves you more than anything you can think of and maybe we don't know it maybe we're still out in the world but remember there's somebody that is watching you I don't know if my brother he thought this thought this wrong but I I told him Jesus is like a jealous boyfriend yeah you can see yeah wherever you go maybe you left him at church maybe you left him somewhere said where is she going oh she's sleeping oh why why is he talking to them over there he gets he gets mad because you're out there in the world he gets he gets angry when you do the things in the of the world why because he loves you why because he knows that you are his child you are his bride and one of these days one of these days you're going to give your heart to the Lord today could be the day all you can all you have to do is say yes I believe you Lord Heavenly Father Celestial Lord we love you so much father Lord if it wasn't for you where would we be this evening Lord if it wasn't for your grace Lord where would your children be
