foreign [Music] [Music] speak with you what you put in my heart and not just to just to say but to live it Lord [Music] put ourselves into service we thank you for everything Muslim our Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] a little nervous tonight [Music] we can fight in the Lord right first of all I want to open up a scripture for scripture yeah and the the the scripture is a little extensive it's a little long but we're going to read it it's the word of God right okay Envy means murders drunkenness revelings and such like of which I tell you before as I have told I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God indeed us but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith is temperance against such there is and they that our crisis have crucified the flesh with the affections with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be Theory the serious of vain Glory provoking one another envying one another Gloria I also want to open another scripture um Corinthians First Corinthians 13 4. and it reads charity suffered suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaneth not itself is not puffed up La Caridad is [Music] doth not behave itself when seemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil noise Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in the truth bear thought things believe in all things hope with all things endureth all things [Music] charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail where there be tongues they shall cease where there be knowledge it shall vanish away so those are the first two scriptures that I want to read I'll be reading a little bit a few more scriptures a little later and I'd like to title my my small thought that I that I had it's called the fruits of the spirit versus the fruits of the flesh now um I looked a little bit in a dictionary and I wanted to see what what uh what they said in the dictionary first of all obviously you know we believe the word of God and that was that that's more important to me but what a few of the things that explained to me and you know what I want to speak to the youth and and whoever's here tonight because I do I feel it it's something that we all go through as human beings we all have to go through this we're born speaking lives so I'm going to read a little bit of what I what I read in the dictionary and this is a this is some of the stuff that I that I heard that I read this is the The Works of the flesh are evident is and I'm speaking about the flesh right now I'm not speaking about the spirit um and it reads uh sexual immorality impurity idolatry sorcery enmity Nvidia Strife Plato and and the the one that I want to kind of uh point tonight is jealous um there's also fits of anger yes uh uh rivalries contras the sentience separation divisions divisiones envies El celos drunkenness and all these other things and it also it also said that I just want to say there are some signs of of when somebody's Envy envious and I want to kind of sit on that a little bit um some one of the signs of of somebody that's envious of a Persona you're not happy for others when they achieve success contentos I'm going to say it again you're not happy for others when they achieve acceptance you know we should we should uh here as a family of God anytime that God blesses any of us and I believe He blesses us all the time we should be happy for them you know uh another person's success another another sign that a person is envious and jealous their success makes you feel unhappy Alexa you feel the need to diminish someone else's success you judge others negatively negativa you're happy when others face setbacks I can ask uh I might not even have to ask I know we've all experienced I could say my in my part and um you know my desire is is to serve God I believe everybody here is here for that purpose to serve and love the Lord so I I know I I'm gonna harp a little bit over or over jealousy before before I go into that I I do I've read in the Bible where it says God is is a jealous God he's the reason that he's jealous is because he loves us the only one that can really be jealous is God it's the correct way the other way as our Earthly us being here on the earth that jealousy is is not good that's human jealousy and that's something that we battle every single day yes and it reads uh I noticed something also here says the root cause of jealousy and envy are a connected to a person's inability to see what God has provided in their life is [Music] so I want to repeat that again it says the root cause of jealousy and envy are connected to a person's inability to see what God has provided in their life is I I believe that sometimes that's why we have problems on a personal level personal you know we will hold something a grudge or you know you feel some things you feel negative towards something and that's that's not the correct way you know yes we read we read um actually I have a few definitions of jealousy from the dictionary also definition and I want you to listen to the words that I'm pronouncing attention and tell me if it's not uh describing a human being envious in media covetous resentful grudging the grudginess suspicious distrustful doubts insecure protective defensive mindful ultamente you know I I and um I always would hear my dad would tell us we're we're a mess okay you know we're messed without God you know sometimes you know I if we were to take inventory on our lives and and see if we have any of this that I described those those are those are horrible words you know nothing but negativity negative and negativities just brings more negativity all this describes our fallen nature that we're born with man I believe that everybody on this Earth comes and and has these battles and you know we as Christians should be like teenagers that are in love or a young athlete committed to their game A True Believer who was on fire for the Lord is hungry for his presence and eager to learn and grow and I don't believe that's just for the young people it's for us older I feel like I'm older so you know I always uh I always pray that God doesn't allow me to have any of these um anything to do with this jealousy is without the Holy Spirit and envy are abnormal are not abnormal [Music] see as a human being you know you can experience I had an example to an example um say a brother buys a new car at church you're still driving your clunker yes [Music] and um if you don't have the love of God in your heart you won't be able to see the blessings that God gave that brother are you going to see us through your carnal eyes and that's why I I titled this this small talk you know we will bear fruits they're either going to be carnal fruits or there of the spirit of God and I and I read a few of them of the spirit of God so I wanna I noted also a little bit of something else I wrote I says I'm still on jealousy human jealousy uh people will false Praise You insincere compliments that's I've experienced that your experimentality I'm pretty sure everybody else has it here so another thing is jealous people want to let others know that they are in fact not jealous of you la Gente is I'm not jealous of you it's there yeah they wouldn't say it if they're not so when the good news comes in your favor they do the same thing and acting supported and giving you fake lip service they act supportive and giving you fake lip service then they roll their eyes in the stain once they're all clear oh that's a jealous person is so I think you guys kind of understand a little bit of why what I'm describing right the human jealousy the the the human element the Fallen nature just just a mess without God Amen so now we want we want the answer right I'm pretty sure that everybody knows the answer is and but I I want to read it I read it one of the one of the quotes here that I have a small quote it says uh raising jarius's daughter 69. it says what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost yes [Music] is that right that's the Holy Ghost what's a little apple tree how do you know it's an apple tree because it's got apples on it how do you know you got the Holy Ghost because you bear the fruits of the spiritos is that right that's the Holy Ghost amen so this is what we want in our lives this is looking love okay you know it's it's very it's very um when you look at both things what do you want do you want the neck the negative or do you want God do you want it's either the devil or God right so you know my my uh my message is not very complicated I'm just reading what brother Branham has brought in some scriptures that I want I don't want an ounce of jealousy or Envy in my life and I believe I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not telling anybody here but but if it helps you to to understand that when when you're so negative in life you're going to end up with a lot of problems so I want to read another another little quote and it says uh this one is question and answers on Hebrews one is I said watch bless our thou Simon barjones the son of Jonas Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you amen amen see it has to come spiritual Revelation spiritual Flesh and Blood never told Abel that he was wrong and then in parenthesis it came that he was wrong he made a correction never told Abel that Cain was wrong it was blood we're coming into that question in a few minutes it was blood not fruits that took us from the Garden of Eden it was blood and Able by spiritual Revelation was revealed of God that it was blood and he by faith Hebrews 11 1 says he offered God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain God accepted the sacrifice see he offered it by Faith by Revelation revelation so it's by faith that we're able to to stay away from the the negative jealousy and envy it's by faith reveal that to us as human beings we're we're never gonna attain that without God so never there's another quote that brother Branham also reads it says fruits of the spirit her he said what what she got what is the fruit of the spirit joy joy of her heart know that he's coming soon a man and a man and amen amen amen Peace of Mind tranquilidas why would you not want peace in your in your heart why are the problems because of our carnal eyes foreign [Music] don't make a bit of a difference atomic bombs can fall Las Vegas you can build Rock shelters bomb shelters will [Music] so we want the spirit of God right as well I'm going to read some more quotes that's all I can do I want to thank you Brothers for giving me the opportunity I forgot to get it I was a little nervous but all I'm doing is is reading the word of God this is do you see the carnal comparison can you see the Cardinal church today it's done the very same thing notice now they're they're both going to have profits the only difference was Moses was the prophet of God and his his King was God that's where we got his orders the word of the Lord he also he had a king and that King was balak yes and that's where he got his orders and His blessings come down or Balaam said come down and curse me these people for they cover the whole face of the Earth they just come and lick up everything like ox licks up the grass said come down now and I understand that you can curse you can bless whatever you do is recognized is now we want you to know that this man was a prophet ordained of God but he sold his Birthright for political reasons just as the church did today like Luther Wesley Pentecost Wesley Pentecost and a whole group of them sold it out for polls in their organization organization under God [Music] yeah both prophets were called the man of God and both spirituals notice the difference Moses notice how the spirituals applied and this is where I want to read to prove that the natural is wrong this brother Brian I'm saying this is hear how the spirituals applied to prove that the natural is wrong or natural human beings we're not good without God man amen so we we need the Lord Jesus in our lives every single momento amen you know sometimes I I get up in the morning and I forget to pray and man my days messed up when I don't pray um either I'm late to work [Music] um and it all starts with a prayer in the morning you know it's uh it's important it's important that we do that and um I have another little part that I wanted to read I won't be too much longer [Music] well I just read it I guess I have a little bit of time I'm gonna go to it's in uh does God ever change his mind about his word cambia I can be a cambia cemente a circle and here it is I'm going to read from 122. and it's speaking about Balaam you know the story of Balaam and um now that after he got God's clean-cut decision don't you go no Vayas instead of doing it was the same thing like Cain follow me like Korra he was jealous and he wanted a reason to go anyhow they told us how many times have uh in our lives we know you know when we we sin apecamos we know we sin but if we continue sinning and we know that's iniquity how many times in our lives God is clearly telling us don't do that don't you know don't go that way and you and you want an answer that you want and that's where we fall yeah if we don't trust in God that he's he is a almighty God Kelly says he's the one that answers all our prayers the only one that answers our prayers you know and uh we love the Lord um with all our hearts we're here battling every day every single day we are battling and we've we've got to fight through every inchada and envy Nvidia jealousy celos Strife All Leads so we pray to God we want to uh to live in in God's way and [Music] um we want to thank the Lord for that I'm going to read I think I haven't read this so I'll read it it says uh Cain's sacrifice to God was not acceptable where his brother Abel's was God clarifies the king that he did not give his first and his best to God he did not give his best to God and um I think I'm I'm I'm guilty as as a lot of us are I don't know not giving God our best I've I'm determined to give God my best it doesn't matter if it's um well wherever you're at at work give God your best put God first and everything else will be settled man amen I what does it mean to abide in him bearing a fruit the fruit of the spirits can only come forth by abiding in Jesus and walking in the spirit to abide in Jesus is a very active lifestyle it means to live in such a way that I'm always found to be in Him Live according to his words [Music] I think I've read every all the small notes that I had what's in my heart is and I think I said it already do not have one ounce of Envy jealousy yes um it's it's something that we all battles it's something that we have to go through and Only God will Deliver Us from from the hands of the devil the devil has no power I don't want to say that he has power but we've given him the the right in our behaviors and I and I pray that if I've offended somebody else and at any time um I believe it's correct to make things right you know I I would always my dad would always tell me you know he would always correct me and he would uh uh I never said no no you know I would just listen to him and take it in my heart and you know all my brothers are very different you know I've I'm my character's a little bit different from one of my brothers I remember my dad always told me but I was his favorite but you know I I I feel like I was an obedient son you could okay you feel obediente but I still needed more that's just not obedience you know I I need to obey the word of God so where the God is the only one that's gonna get us out of here that gives us that gives us the Holy Spirit by living his his word and we know that he sent a prophet and I believe that Prophet is you know sometimes I'm at work and I'll have conversations with some of my customers as soon as I I try to lay it on them a little easy you know as soon as I mentioned that I believe in a prophet I've lost some customers you know but it's okay God's blessed me with with a lot of work and I just want to say that I love you guys tonight and I pray that God takes every anything that's there in your heart that's that's not allowing you okay that does not allow you to serve God fully 100. young and old um repent of all your sins you guys remember that song if I can have the musicians come up even if they don't know the song I want to
