evening we've been having a lot of baptisms amen that's that's the that's the word a promise to us you're saying repent can you say repentance be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost i want to give a testimony this evening of what god has done for me my mom my mother my dad my father my family my family they know what i've been through pasado and we'll talk about it a little bit this evening i grew up in the church yo christine iglesia a lot of you guys know i'm brother johnny's uh second to the last song i'm not the baby i'm almost the baby no soy el bevito pero ya casi so i got a little bit softer of my dad i got a different dad growing up my dad was married i had kids i was going to church eva iglesias song leading yo de gea los cantos serving the lord the best way that i thought that i could serbian senora mejor manera podia thought everything was okay what i didn't realize but the devil was going to hit me with something that i wouldn't expect believe the devil hit me with a gut punch it's not a hit that just kind of staggers you no no like maybe you lost your job or maybe you know you're you've got some uh troubles where you need something and you can't figure i think this was a gut punch that really took the air out of me and what it did is it it started messing with my mind in 2015 and my world that i thought was a perfect world ese mundo me okay yo pensa perfecto and i thought that i was serving god yo pence and i thought that i was doing everything that i could to please god [Music] the devil caused something in my life el diablo where i ended up getting divorced probably one of the they say one of the the bigger stressors of life there's a couple other ones but divorce cuantas pero divorcio there came a time in my life i didn't know what to do i felt like i was completely lost yo yo why did you serve god all your life why did you every time when your friends would go out and do something and drink and smoke and why did you hold back [Music] i started doing things that i had never done in my life you start drinking why because the devil has your mind so wrapped up el diablo i dragged myself through the mud lodo talking to my mom there was one thing she told me she said don't stop going to church she said no pares did iglesia and my dad said don't stop listening to the tapes i think that's the two things that help me from going totally insane i listened to the tapes over listen to them something maybe way deep down inside of me i would shut it off well bueno two years went by and uh i believe that through my trials god is still working somehow even in sin even in a club in la disco in the world in el mundo it doesn't matter where you're at if you're son of god he's going to call you so this evening [Music] the son of god miserable we're going out we're spending time with each other we're getting getting to know each other and uh on one occasion i started thinking well maybe whatever but i'm to keep hanging out with her marriage not for me that's how the devil had my mind wrapped up yes and i noticed her she was uncomfortable talking and this is where uh i believe god works through people sometimes it's the most it says and all this whole thing in my mind the whole time when i'm not with her i listen to tapes and brother branham and predestination and mark of the beast and all this stuff and and listening to all these tapes that person is a persona is my wife the next morning she tells me she goes hey i'm sick and tired yesterday living like this i want to surrender my heart to the lord jesus christ and if you don't want to do it then i don't know what we're doing together so i believe that every time god calls a man and if he's married he calls his wife with him so i'm gonna have her come up because this is where my message really starts i wanted to say maybe five minutes if you could take a west side somebody that knows what he's supposed to be doing but just can't get it right because the circumstances of life then i believe she is a big part of it i want her to say a little bit about what god has done yeah you can just come up right here but i do feel like it's really tremendous what god has done for me as as my husband said i am definitely like i come from the world i had you know piercings in my face i had colored hair i listened to rock music i knew who god was i loved god you are marios i said i loved god but i never lived for god you know it's two different things to say that you love someone and to show it so i would go to church my mom would beg me to go to church with her and i would go and it would be in one ear and out the other peru and that's just how our lives were yes and so i had also gone through you know my trials of my own and i was also just ready to throw in the towel just tired no no intention of ever getting married and when i met him it was obviously by god's grace or god's mercy and i knew from our very first date even though it was you know in the world i knew that there was something very special very different about him but i just didn't know what it was and and like he said we had been talking and we had been dating and it had months had gone by and has he's right it was over a period of three days that were very significant to me on a thursday on a friday and on a saturday we tried going out and dancing and doing what we always did just having fun in the world and i those three nights i couldn't have fun i was in a bad mood i i didn't want to be around him i thought oh he doesn't like me anymore and then on on the third night on a saturday we were out at the at the dance and and i look to him and inside of the inside of the club i start crying and crying and crying i grabbed his jacket and i wrapped myself in it and i said don't look at me and i didn't even know what i was talking about i had prayed to god i said lord change my life lord i'm sorry i'm so lonely lord and i said lord i have all these friends and i have this wonderful family and i can go out and meet people easily and i'm so that night i i go home and i just cry and i cry and i cry yes and i cried for a whole week straight i couldn't even talk to my mom i couldn't talk to my kids i just cried and i just stayed in prayer that whole week and i didn't know what it was to stay in prayer like that thrown on the floor crying out to the lord and just thanking him and just praying to him so then so um that's when we had the conversation yes and i grew up you know 20 miles down the road and i never heard of the message i had never heard of brother branham and i thought yo pence is this right and i thought is this a cult how come everybody's so nice and how come everybody's hair is so long and how come everyone's face is so clean with no makeup and that was after the first service i went to at phoenix tabernacle yes and that's when i started to ask him more questions and that's when he started to show me the things that would change my life and we started to listen to tapes and i started to find out who he really was and i found out the big family that he came from and who his parents are and growing up i had asked god always always always for a big sister ex i cried to the lord when i was little for her big sister named sarah so when i met sarah my my sister his sister i was blown away if we if we uh i was like how could the lord answer my prayer 30 years later comes and give me a big sister that i cried for when i was little named sarah and as i grew closer to the family he gave me another sister named rachel mario and they're both they both have been such big blessings in my life but um back to like our story so i wanted to get baptized about this army and when i was when it was my turn to get baptized in the back brother michael tells me you said sister be ready the devil's gonna be mad and and i said okay and he said just you guys stay strong in prayer and i said okay okay and that was a very hard thing to go through in our first year of marriage but it's still glory to god and we're very thankful for everything that god allowed from both of our parents my dad was able to walk me down the aisle my father-in-law was able to marry us so we're very thankful for everything that god allowed and in death always comes new life and right now i have a fire inside of me that i can't explain to just keep getting closer to the lord and i i like i said i grew up and i never heard of this message and now this message is something i can never forget and i can't even remember being in the in the world and i i asked the lord i said lord if this message is for me lord help me and that was the night i asked the lord just help me lord help me if this message is for me help me lord yes yes so i had a dream that i was walking at this park and there was a and there was a river that was or there was a a pond and it was really dirty and as i'm walking the water's getting clear and i can hear brother branham talking with me and we look down at and it went from dirty to clear olympia where i could see straight to the bottom and for me that was a tremendous dream tremendo because it just signifies how clear my life is right now that even though there's some moments that i can't see through a moment and i'm very thankful to be a part of this message and to know what we know that god is good thank you gracias is man is that better okay so we'll start now the mess title of the messages the greatest battle ever fought and when we start understanding that we're in a battle and it's not just a little uh a little gunfire here and there it is i'm going to start reading by reading some quotes i don't know how far i'll get no so if someone in the back will let me know hey your time's up i'm gonna just go entonces okay the first quote i'm going to read it's the message that i'm going to focus the majority of the the message this evening is called the greatest battle ever fought and it's re i'm going to read it reads like this now if you sit down when you get home and you draw three little rings you'll find out that the outside body has five senses and it's contacted by yes contact and you see c albert taste el probar that's the thing that controls the soul esos but the spirit pero espirito it only has one sense the spirit oh let's get it the spirit has one sense and there's only one avenue to it is growing up in the message i've listened to it my whole life told me that i heard the tapes every single day at my dad's house there was a tape going on i hear i heard it but i never god took somebody that would go out to the clubs and dance just try to i believe i gave my heart to the lord jesus christ when i was probably like 19 years old but through the devil diablo using powers usando poderes to uh bring doubt in my mind [Music] i started like a baby again and i started looking at messages that i could understand i got away from the demonology big and the bigger messages that i really didn't understand and i started to focus on uh scriptures and messages that could really bring some practicality to my everyday life so i listen to easy messages i listened to the greatest battle ever i listened to thinking man's filters and i listened to how to overcome yes and with those three messages i believe that's what god has brought me here tonight to talk a little bit about it i'm going to keep reading it says god won't force you he said god doesn't force man to do anything you do it on your own he says he'll warn you maybe god will even throw a barricade across your path but you walk your own self with your own decisions in his presence and supressencia to make him your savior salvador but guess what you know what the the quote says it right here la sita love it says but satan has perverted god's plan pero satan the bible talks about a time where it's not me no more doing the sin but it is the sin that dwells in me so i couldn't do anything to help myself i didn't understand there was something from the inside out that was making my body do these things when i was in the world drinking but there was also something see therefore satan begins in the principle part to cause the spirit of man to doubt god's word god begins at the principal part to lay his word in that spirit diosco means there you are i estas that's what it does eso and brother branham says right here commander brandi he said if this church right now siesta iglesias could put together and that every person would be in one accord with not one shadow of a doubt anywhere there would not be a feeble person in our midst this next quote i had a mental conception of what god was but i hadn't let it drop down into my heart wasted wasted time without allowing god to come into my heart i accepted god in my mind satan approach is on this inside but so is god's i put that at the top that's that's what it does that then what does it do from the with the true word god comes to your mind he wants to accept the spirit the spirit of what spirit the spirit of fame you get a problem in your life none of those spirits can fight against your problems espiritos that's why you see millionaires with money coninero blowing their heads up that's why you see people with so much money miserable miserable he wants you to accept the spirit of god with faith confess faith in what even in his word ensue and the promises that he's given us the devil also comes to your mind how can we overcome this como podemos venceresto brother barnham says it's free moral agents live it's whatever you decide so when i was lost in the world and this girl yesterday that knows nothing about god comes to me and tells me a son of god malachi 4 5 believe it it says jesus said unto them i am the way the truth and the life jesus no man cometh unto the father el padre but by me si no poor me what was happening why all of a sudden repented that something come into my mind and want to drop down into my heart i don't care what you've done there's not going to be an excuse and i would hear that and it's like i could hear brother branham saying it to me directly yes and what did he say blessed be the lord the lord giveth the lord take it away and here was i with a divorce one little thing una cosita throw it in the towel something told me you got to make a decision it's free moral agencies it's whatever you decide from this point forward i felt like god was going to give me one last chance to do good like i had done before no no to allow his spirit but come into my heart come from the inside out i want to read a scripture it's romans extend romanos 12 2 and 3. you don't have to go to it and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind what is that good for i say through the grace giving unto me that every man that is among you academic according as to god hath dealt to every man and god also let me allow me to step into the life of somebody else and use her as a tool to wake something up that was just way deep down in there for your little kids six seven eight years old bring them up the right way i don't believe that see i'm going to keep reading another quote god's working on the insider those things are respected but jesus said except the man be born again what is that there's got to something to happen inside and there's in his heart so he is as yes you see ben god kept pointing me to the same words moral agency i've heard about it my whole life i've seen it with my mom a lady from a ranch in the middle of mexico god brings her gives her an experience baptized with the holy ghost here's the message doesn't doubt it accepts it of the world so god knows exactly what we're all going to do he knows what we're deciding he knows how our mind is working well what's the matter today but he's trying to keep you away from a real testimony that's what the devil did to me he pointed me to a bunch of make-believers and i found myself lost why do i serve you guys look what you've done look what you've allowed me to do i could be in the clubs one day in los angeles what is it but the devil's always pointing at us to somebody's failures haciendas place brother braden says romano brandon says that in the soul there's a little place there that god put for himself and what he wants to do is he wants to put his spirit in you spirit and when he does that he wants to sit at the control rooms brother branham says and then when that happens then your conscience is your emotions [Music] see it's not just a mental conception it has to be something real he says it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with the heart entonces and the body is just scored out with the holy spirit there's no doubt anywhere no i do that there's nothing that can rise up i'm going to skip forward i'm going to just keep reading a little bit god wants to fill you with the holy spirit and the devil wants to fill you with every other spirit diablo free moral agency but i didn't understand how god works he says you've got to get the soldier and he says the holy spirit placed at the battlefront el espiritu where's the battlefront there's nothing can no nada every one of the other channels is cleared out just like an old boiler flutes the flute the flute stop uh uh that's the matter with so many blowed up christians cristianos it's because they don't clean they but the circumstances of my life the devil didn't let me el diablo he had a grasp brother branham tells the story hermano bryant and he talks about this little girl she had hodgkin's lymphoma lymphoma mom took her to the doctor and she said uh take her home she has like three months to live hodgkin's lymphoma so she calls brother brandon brandon brother baton what should i do what i said well i'll bring her here to prison i'll pray for her so the bringer la train and when brother branham sees her economy and he sees her with a mini skirt paint it up and he asked her how can you accept god on those terms so what did you ask her do you accept the lord jesus christ as your savior salvador she said yes that they say she asked the mother do you accept jesus christ as your savior yes go in peace shall be healed see i didn't understand way back yatras that if unless i have the holy spirit in me there was no way to receive anything from god not healing no and not my salvation salvation i want to read acts 2 1. it shall come to pass says god that i will pour out my spirit on all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see visions your old men shall dream dreams and my men servants and my men's maids servants will i pour out my spirit in those days and they shall prophesy and i will show wonders in the heavens and signs before the coming of the great and the awesome day of the lord 21st verses and it shall come to pass that whosoever calls on the name of the lord shall be saved i believe that with all my heart there's a battle going on god wants to place his spirit he says a thousand people can go through the prayer lines and they can all die you have to believe that you're the one i'm going to just skip forward what do we do in the word of and if i repented of my sins you would give me the gift of the holy ghost it's faith on his word brother branham says he says before you sin and escus you actually have to take the word of god you have to put it aside that's what i was doing i didn't have any faith the devil had deceived me but we have so many scriptures acts you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost those people that are sick isaiah 53 5 and 6. bias all these things are promises some promesas that god's giving us brother branham talks about romano brandon in ephesians 6 11 and ephesians says and he talks about putting on the whole armor of god and he talks about and he tells him how your loins should be girded above us and how you should take the shield of faith and that would be the only thing because that would quench the fiery darts of the wicked [Music] what are these things what is this to us when something is when you allow god to come way down deep into your soul and your spirit becomes one and he pours his spirit in you know then that's when you could start taking god at his word before that i couldn't do it see america dresses their soldiers america whatever they've got located armored tanks cones the spirit of the sword the word of god amen the word of god is sharper than a two-edged sword i didn't understand no no that even though i had given my heart to the lord jesus christ the devil had the ability to attack me el diablo and when he attacked me he attacked me in my um in my mind if you want to come to the piano i think my time is up see the piano yes i call me tiempo you attacked me in my mind brother branham says this is that we got to start doubting our doubts tenemos que pesara dudar i'm believing god's words do you want a change in your life do you want god to make everything different for you differently you see when you allow the spirit of the lord jesus christ and he comes way down and sits in the control room of your heart it is controlling then brother madam says you see different hermano brandon says you see people differently different he places love in your heart the hatred you had it changes everything the holy spirit el espiritu santo is what overcomes es lo everything and what is the holy spirit of the lord jesus christ planted in the throne of our hearts just because porque because you've given your heart to the lord jesus christ that doesn't mean the devil won't attack you yes if the devil attacked jesus christ himself what is the only thing that the devil will listen to questions what did he tell him he said man shall not eat by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god he fought him with the word he told them he responded to the devil with the words so this evening it's not what the seal of the living god is local then you will know sabran the bible said in ephesians 4 30. once many places throughout the scriptures no matter how intellectual you are no important intellectuals how many big denominations that you belong to it doesn't matter no important there's so many spirits trying to attack us right now that are trying to bring doubt that all the other spirits have to listen to latin spirit of the holy spirit the word of god that's telling us take god at his word god wants to fill you what does he want to fill you what does he want to fill you with he wants to fill you with himself the holy spirit filled with the holy ghost jesus said in luke 24 49. you shall receive power after this this was this the holy ghost has come upon you el espiritu jerusalem in judea and and into the uttermost part of the earth and brother madison that's not when you receive a bachelor's degree anything else in phoenix in phoenix and tucson at your job at school no matter where you go you're a witness a written epistle he tells us the world can no longer know who god is and i want to say that the lord also loves you if you'll bow your heads [Music] it's it's not through a sensation forgive me if i'm emotional but it's a decision brother ma'am says you could receive the holy spirit without sensation received the only that you gave your my family my family my my mom my mother my brothers miss hernandez the members of jericho in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen and god bless our brother boaz [Music] i don't know about you but that was a blessing for me amen let's worship the lord [Music] you can please stand up [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] i [Music] my [Music] foreign [Music]
