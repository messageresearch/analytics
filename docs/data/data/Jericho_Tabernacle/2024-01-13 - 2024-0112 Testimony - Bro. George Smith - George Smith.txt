[Music] [Applause] Lo [Music] [Applause] [Music] know I SP this must [Music] [Applause] [Music] R know [Music] [Music] good evening Saints can you hear okay it's good to be here tonight and we're thankful for the invitation if you have your Bible let's open the Bible to Acts chapter [Music] one and we'll read from uh verses um 6-9 when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord will thou at this time restore the again the kingdom to Israel now these are some brothers that are looking at a resurrected being for the first time in history but they were humans just like us and the best thing they could think of was was a political question and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his own power but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you should shall be Witnesses here in Jerusalem over in Judea in Samaria and uttermost part of the Earth all the way to Phoenix Arizon phix the gospel didn't come in a parachute it came on a donkey there was man that came on foot over here to bring the gospel and we are the result of all that work let's pray precious Heavenly Father we thank you for your mercy to us we thank you for bringing us here safely we thank you for each one of your people that you brought into the Tabernacle here Lord we pray that you'd bless this small reading of your [Music] word give us Grace Lord as we speak the truth and love bless each one we ask in Jesus name amen you may be seated so I'm here for three reasons first of all brother oron invited me I thank you very much and number two I felt inspired of the Holy Ghost to be here today could have been here a long time ago but this is the time we can't fix what already happened and there's no need to worry about the future we need Grace for today and number three is that you know God deals in dreams now I'm not a dreamer and so other people have dreams and they tell me and so a friend of mine had a dream uh in the last few months and he related it to me and he said he was in uh well he he the scene was brother bram's living room and he was like a fly on the wall and so in the dream he could see sister [Music] brandom and he could see brother Neville and they were sitting in the living room talking and then uh Rebecca and I were sitting by the fireplace and so the the conversation went on and so then brother nille got up to leave and then sister brandham went over to the door to say goodbye and so they're they're talking there by the door and they said to Rebecca come over here so I'm still sitting by the fireplace and they three standing by the door and they said to me keep doing what you're doing that's why I'm here tonight I I could be a lot of places for the first time in my life I took a vacation this year I went to Europe where nobody knew who I was we had a good time so I'm not an Entertainer I'm only here to give a witness to a great message now from our scripture we didn't see anything about an attorney Jesus Christ is the only righteous one he is our attorney and it doesn't say anything about a judge because as much as I love you but nobody qualifies now you know when you're walking through the airport and people have this little thing in their ear and they're just talking and there's nobody around so I can only hear half of the conversation and then I can judge the case based on half of the information we do that but we need to uh be a little more careful and so we're only here as a witness we trust that somebody can learn something from what I'm going to tell you I'm the eagle that was born in the Baptist chicken yard we trust that God can bless you and see that it was God leading you from whatever chicken yard into the church tonight because see we're Overcomers and as Overcomers there's things overcome and so we must find balance in our Christian walk it's just like in what you eat how you take care of your animals it's all about balance now in our world today there's over 6,000 known languages and some languages still don't have any Scripture or any writing even in their language now only 487 years ago a man a man by the name of William tendale William T he was his interest was to get the scripture into English but it was illegal he was burned for that purpose so today we have the English Bible every house but the scripture has come at Great cost now in 1944 my parents graduated from Bible College in californiafor my mother was from Tucson Arizona mother and my dad was from Kansas City Missouri Kansas City Missouri and so as soon as they graduated they H felt a burden to go into Mexico and find this tribe and translate the scriptures because just like I said there's all these languages but there's not even any writing in some languages we live in the 21st century it's hard to believe but everybody doesn't have a cell phone on the planet some people do not have a written language yet so my parents moved up into the mountains of Chihuahua now there wasn't a highway like there is today they drove as far as they could and then they had to uh hire animals to take them four days into the mountains now here's two white people that don't even know Spanish and Newly Weds and they're up here in the mountains and they're looking for this tribe and when you find them then you have to be a friend to them and and you have to start making a dictionary because they have a different word for everything you're going to point to that takes a long time so uh as happens in newly Read's homes eventually there's going to be a baby born and so they came out of the mountains and instead of coming up to Arizona where grandma lived they they went down to Mexico City where the where the headquarters was and that's where their first child was born in late August 1945 that was me now eventually I became the first of 10 children there was five boys and five girls now today two of the girls are already uh in heaven but next weekend the eight of us are going to to get together in Flagstaff that only happens every 10 years or so so we're looking forward to that and back to our story so to do this work of trans of making a dictionary and then Translating that can take up to 20 years and my dad didn't have that kind of patience so he moved the family over to the East Coast of Mexico and that's where he established a bible school and it's still there today and that's where I began in the first grade so all the first uh all all Elementary years the six years I took in Spanish all the numbers in my head are all in Spanish now my mother had a big job because she's raising these children and so she one of her rules was now in the house you speak English outside you speak Spanish now that was just one of her rules but it was very handy years later so being the only American in this school and so I don't know what the parents told the kids at home but one day when I wasn't paying attention this little friend of mine got a very sharp point on his pencil now we didn't have pencil sharpeners everybody had a single Ed razor blade and today they put you in jail for that but anyway he got a very sharp P point and uh when I wasn't watching he stabbed me in the arm and when he saw that I had red blood like his we could be friends so that was my first battle scar so anyway being the missionary's child I was always on the front row at least three times a week and so uh eventually by the time I was 9 years old I realized that the gospel wasn't just for all these people back here it's for me too because the scripture says all have sinned that's all the Brams and the Smiths oronas all of themth all have sinned and they come short of the glory of God but who whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved so I received Lord as my savior and I was baptized on Easter Sunday and that was in the Baptist Church in Mexico INX now just be patient we're going to get to the good part here in a little bit so by 1958 I was turning 13 and my parents decided I need to go to American School and so from 7th to 12th I was in English schools and we moved you know they moved us several times but in January of 1962 I was a teenager and I had a closer encounter with the Lord Jesus and then I moved to Tucson halfway through the 10th grade and I lived with my grandfather and I was in mine high school high school and I was the kid with the um with the reputation because I didn't go to the dances and I didn't drink and I didn't smoke and so I was kind of like the Oddball you know and um then in 1963 my family moved to Tucson and turns out that one day A friend of mine in school she uh said now we know that you're very very picky but we know just the girl for you and so I said well fine where is she well she's way over there getting on the bus and so the next day she introduced me to Rebecca brandham Rebecca Bram and sure enough the most beautiful girl on the planet and she said now my dad's a preacher and you have to meet him well they didn't scare me because I knew a lot of preachers and so that day after school I went to their house and met her dad now they only lived a block and a half from my house and um so she introduced me to him in the backyard and he didn't have a shirt on he he was working with the plants and I wasn't offended but I never heard this name before see I was in the Baptist Church now we knew why we were right and we knew why everybody else was wrong that spirit's still around you know and so at at that time I had a used Ford pickup and U but it was clean you know and her big brother had a brand new red Chevrolet but I thought this is going to be a problem but he was a skinny kid like me so it didn't matter but her dad drove a fort have on for and so we're talking in the backyard a little bit and I don't know what he said but I was there for a reason I wanted to get closer to his daughter now at that point i' had already read my Bible all the way through and I didn't know what this conversation was really all about but he was very nice but later I realized that during this conversation he was scanning the hard drive and he could see the whole picture I didn't know that but when we finished talking I had the Victory and he had the problem because there were some other guys waiting but they knew who he was and they were scared of him but I didn't know who he was all things work together so now when they moved to Arizona they just brought their clothes they didn't know how long they were going to stay at that point Rebecca was halfway through the 11th grade and over in Jeffersonville they they had a relatively normal lifeon they you know had the church they had the school and the piano teacher lived across the road and every day Rebecca came home she would practice the piano but in Arizona there's no church and a new school and no piano and no trees and so teenager gets nervous and she found out that the girl in the corner had a grand piano and because her mother was a piano teacher and so one day brother random is getting the family ready to go to supper and he looks in the back and there's only two children he says no wait a minute there's one missing where's Rebecca and uh the mother says well she's at the corner we'll pick her up on the way so when brother random stops the car on the corner and he goes up to the door to knock on the door he hears the piano playing but it wasn't down at the cross and it wasn't bethoven it was rock and roll rock and roll and there was two girls on one piano so it's a miracle that they even heard him knock on the door and you know his heart is breaking my my my girl you know piano and so then when she comes to the door he didn't jerk his belt off he said it's time to go and so they left and she didn't hear another word about that for two months that when brother tells the story in August of 64 it it sounds pretty serious about the piano but he said then she met George and he's a Christian and it's the end of the problem so what was the solution I was taking her to the Baptist church every Sunday and he was very happy about it and sometimes he went with us so you go where you can be fed and so in early June of 63 was the first time I was in a meeting where he was preaching now we had we had visited at the house and uh everything he said in in everything in this service is all scriptural so people ask me well what attracted you to this message well the young lady was de bait on the hook you know but you see I had already read my Bible and so talking to him here's a man that is living the Spirit of the scripture the other people I knew they had learned the the scripture but he was he was living the spirit of the scripture and so then people asked brother R how can I get closer to God every day you read your Bible and you pray but see we got too many people that are like non back in the Old Testament yeah we already knew that but just do the simple things I mean here's William brandom he knew who he was but yet he stands in the Pulpit on all these tapes and he's he's telling the very simple Bible stories and one place here in Phoenix he said one day he said The Minister's job is to make Christ real to the people so I would just like to give you a little glimpse into what I call the prophetic Dimension and that is that prophets speak from eternity with prophets it's always present tense and sometimes it's hard to distinguish between actual time and the prophetic realm just like just like Elisha with the Assyrians so Elisha was in the house with his helper and he said now go look outside see what's happening so he comes back trembling because all he could see was was Soldiers with with swords and they were looking for Elisha now Elisha didn't get mad and slap him he just put his hand on the young man said God open the young man's eyes so then he went out and looked again there's all the same soldiers but on the hillsides there's Angels everywhere I see that's the prophetic Dimension so in 1950 brother ran was preaching in Houston Texas 10 nights and during this time there was many people being healed and they were in an auditorium that held about 6,000 people there was a Baptist man that thought it was his job to prove it was all wrong and so it was in the newspapers and brother Bosworth was helping brother brandham and he said now brother Brandon we got to do something this man's making our life impossible he wants a debate and brother RM said we're not going to waste one night with this guy when we got hundreds of people need to be prayed for but brother Bosworth convinced him that it could be done very nicely so then when the word got out that there's going to be a debate they had to move the meeting from the 6000 to a bigger place to held 30,000 and so they're going to have this debate and brother Ram said I'm not going to go I'll sit at the hotel I'll be back tomorrow night but the holy spirit said no you have to go to church tonight and so he comes to church with it's him and his wife and his brother and little Rebecca four years old and so he's he says he camouflaged himself disguised himself somehow and he came in nobody knew he was there so he's way up in the balcony and for the first time Rebecca is sitting with her dad in church because she could see the other little girls sitting with their dads but her dad was always up here and so she's very proud and they're watching the the uh activity on the pulpit and so brother Bosworth said now I have one question for the Baptist pastor bsta now in the Old Testament we have seven compound names of of of um Jehovah and he said now can we take these seven compound names of redemption and place apply them to Jesus Christ yes or no well now the Baptist had to think about it because if he says yes then that includes Divine Healing but if he says no then there's there's no salvation and so they had a bit of a debate you can hear about it on tape so finally brother bosor says now I think brother brandom's in the audience if he is here he can come down and dismiss the audience and so he starts to get up and his brother said don't get up we'll have a riot here but the the wife says it's okay he knows what he's doing and so he gets up and he puts Rebecca in his seat so she could see all the way down so he comes down through the audience down to the pulpit now the Baptist preacher had hired some professional photographers and they were taking pictures and so when brother Ram comes down to the platform he um said a few words and he said I don't need to say anymore he's present and that's when this picture over here was taken and when they went to develop the film and that was the only picture that came out everything else was blank and regarding the picture brother Bram says it's better if you have the photograph than if the than if the light came in the in the audience here because your eyes could fool you and in another place he says that he um he was he had a prayer line coming in anyway this lady comes in the prayer line and she's holding one of these pictures that she had bought out front and he says now let's talk about that picture and um he said now on my desk at home I have a testimony and the testimony is that this lady was laying in the hospital dying and she had the picture on the stand beside the bed and she said that as she was praying she saw the light come off the picture and hang over her and she was healed and went home and we've had many testimonies since then very similar but you know while brother Brown was coming down through the audience I see there's less than 200 people here today but if you have 30,000 brother Bram said there was cases there that were very serious he said it make the heart of an Iron Man melt and he said but there was 500 ushers helped me get down here so years later when Rebecca's hearing the tape like we do she asked her mother wait a minute did you did you see 500 ushers and the mother said no dear those weren't ushers those were Angels so they're very real and there's many other things that we could tell you about you know as far as the uh prophetic Dimension at the end of 1963 brother brandom went back to Jefferson B to preach at Christmas time now all you young guys know how it is when your girlfriend goes away for two weeks it seems like it's a year and so they're far away I'm in Tucson so I got a ride with some other people and surprised them on December 29th so I'm in the church for the first time and it's it's very new and everything's different so between the services we went to lunch my brother R knew that that I was in school with Rebecca and he knew that I was the assistant choir director at the Baptist Church and so he said now George this evening in the service I want you to sing see that was a long time ago and I've got a bit of a head cult so we're not going to sing tonight but anyway I said want me to sing at the brandom Tabernacle and I said yeah he said uh and he said in fact tonight we're going to have a a prayer line and I said well what would I sing here he said it'd be nice if you could sing then Jesus came I never heard it but I learned it and so sang it that night and he was very proud for the first time his daughter is playing in church and he came out and preached Look Away to Jesus okay so moving forward in 1964 uh Rebecca and I graduated together from High School and brother brand said finally a brandham I was graduated he was very happy and uh then in July he was was preaching in Philadelphia and when you went to church with brother bradam in the car um he would get there in time to step in the Pulpit now this is Rebecca's story I wasn't there and so they got to the service and all the seats were taken and so Rebecca and her friend Betty they found him a seat up in the mezzan a little higher they could see and so when brother R came in it was was a long table behind the pulpit and his seat was right beside the pulpit and brother Roberts was speaking first and so while brother r sitting there uh and brother Roberts is speaking brother Brandon reached out reaches over and feels his coat and so then he it's his turn to preach and he he noticed that his it didn't even match his coat didn't match his pants and it was a great service but then when they're leaving and going back to the hotel Rebecca said I saw what you did he says yeah that was a fine fine suit he had on and and mine didn't even match so brother BR probably paid you know $49.95 for his outfit but brother brother Robert suit probably cost $1,000 but here's here's two anointed men but some things just didn't matter brother Brandon was preaching the word the little stuff like clothes didn't matter so much okay so we have to tell you a little bit about the courtship we couldn't have any dates during the week cuz we were in school Sunday we had church and so we was you know we had to be careful now we only lived a block and a half apart but we were just like the kids today we we like to talk on the phone but we didn't have these little guys and brother brandom didn't live in a gated community he you know you could drive right up to his house so in my house there was you know a lot of activity we had a black phone on the wall with the ringer you know dial and my dad had some rules he always said yeah we have a democracy my house said I have the vote yeah it sounds like Mexico doesn't it and so I had to you really gauge my time when I could talk on the phone and at Rebecca's house uh they had uh a phone but by then they had the push button phone but it was still hooked to the wall had a cord but brother random got tired of people calling so he's looking at the phone so on the back of it there was a wheel you could turn if you turned it one way the ringer got louder and if you turn it the other way the ringer went off so he turned it off so Rebecca said what are we going to do it's very simple he set your watch just like mine okay now when it's 7 o' I'm going to call you now thanks to your dad this doesn't ring but I'll be there so 7:00 she picks up the phone and there it was and it had a long cord so she would go in the closet and shut the door and I had we had privacy you see love conquers all well um brother bam had a Cadillac and back then Cadillac was like a Mercedes today it was very nice now he didn't go buy the Cadillac somebody gave it to him and by the time I knew him it was already almost 10 years old but it was a big car and had a V8 engine and it had two four barrel car and it had air [Music] conditioning it's hot in Arizona and so he would let me use his car sometimes but you see his car took the expensive gas that means that we had to pay this guy 36 C a gallon to build the tank but we only bought $3 at a time and um so anyway that's um story about the car but you know we would we would go to the Baptist church and we were in my pickup and so I'm driving and then there's Rebecca and then my sister and back then we didn't have four-door pickups it was very simple and my brother and sisters are sitting in the back and so sometimes brother and would come out to tell us goodbye and he would say my what a fine load of young preachers you have here I didn't see any preachers I saw little brothers but guess what they're all preachers today we're all going to be together next week so there's a lot of other little things here and there but you know God knows what he's doing and you you learn as you go along and at the end of 1964 God says to brother Ram now you're going to be staying here so look for a house so he starts looking he looked in Phoenix Pho he looked in Tucson and he found the house that he liked down there and so he said the Holy Ghost led him to the place and that's where he built the den room and uh so all that uh year of 65 he's he's building on that house and so in in May of 65 uh I was out of school for a year and so I didn't have a job didn't have any training I didn't have a car yet and um didn't have the Holy Ghost I wasn't baptized right but I thought I needed a wife so I go to talk to the man and um and so I go to talk to him and he starts telling me all these stories about places he's been and after a long time I said to brother B this is all very interesting but I'm here for a purpose and and what would that be sir well um you must noticed that I really like your daughter and I said I'm here to ask for your permission and your blessing to marry her and then his eyes got very narrow I mean this is his firstborn and he says now look I'm going to give you permission to be engaged but don't even think about marriage until you both have the baptism of Holy Ghost and that's good for today also and so a smart person would have said okay uh I'm going to kneel down here no that wasn't me I said Thank you and that was over so again they took off for a couple of months to uh Jeffersonville and I don't know how I got there but I went back for two weeks and I was there when he preached like the nor ones at the end time what's the attraction on the mountain and so he preached on August the 1st and I knew that he was going to be driving to Tucson during that next week and I already had a a seat in the car but I said now before we go to Arizona will there be time for you to baptize me correctly well he was very happy because he'd been waiting three years for that waiting for the light to come on you know so on Monday afternoon August 2nd he um took me down to the church and baptized me and as it turned out that's the last person he baptized so then we go to Arizona this is in August of 65 and by then I I had the the girl under contract and I had the baptism and I had a car so making progress so he's riding in the car with me I'm driving and out of nowhere he says now George if you ever get to go to Israel your Bible will become a new book now first of all he never went to Israel and I wasn't thinking about Israel I was thinking about the girl and um but you know prophets look into the future and those that have been over there with me know that it's true your Bible becomes a new book and so from when he said that in ' 65 then we made our first trip in 73 and this past June was trip number 48 and maybe we'll never go back I don't know but you had your chance so um so that was August and then in September uh brother Ram was preaching up here in Phoenix and so we drove up here phoen and I let Rebecca out at the door and I went to park the car and you know how girls are when they're engaged somehow that left hand is always so she and so she comes in into the into this big hotel and so there's her friend Sharon waiting for her and so Sharon saw the ring and and she says Rebecca are you are you serious is it that Baptist guy yeah but daddy likes him so that was the of the discussion but we've been friends ever since but you know um in September is when brother Ram had the encounter up in subo canyon and I remember seeing him that day that he came back from Sabino Canyon he was a very happy person very different now at that time brother perig green was in town from Texas because his mother was a seamstress she made curtains and they had made the curtains for the new house in Tucson and brother Perry was there to install the curtains and so I didn't know but brother brandom said to brother green one day he said now look it looks like this kid's going to be my son-in-law would you please take him home pray for the Holy Ghost so he invited me to Texas now some of you probably remember brother the green and he made things bigger than they really were I thought I thought I was on vacation but he lived in a very small little house and my room didn't have an air conditioner but anyway I'm over there in Texas and uh the next day he had a brother from Louisiana came over to use his phone to call brother brandham so when they called brother Bram was already out of the house but they said Your name's on the list when he comes back we'll have him call you so there's the two brothers waiting for this phone call and I'm over in my room but somehow I felt inspired okay they're dope there's two preachers maybe we should pray and so we go over there and we're kneeling down at the bench praying and while we're praying in my mind I can see uh like a cloudy sky but there's breaks where the sun comes through like in pencil and so all of a sudden the phone rings and brother green goes to answer his phone so it was brother brandom calling for the other brother but he said before I talk to him let me talk to George so I greeted him and uh he said now George let me be the first to congratulate you on receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he knew I had a hard head and he wanted to identify what had just happened and so all these years later that that was very good that he told me that but God actually did something for me and I can be here tonight testifying about it so the next day I get a call from my mother also and two son and she said we have a letter here from President Johnson they need you in the Army you know the scripture says give to Caesar what Caesar's So within a week I was inducted into the US Army so I was a US Soldier with the Holy Ghost in November of 65 brother Brandon was preaching in streetport Louisiana and um he preached one of the sermons was God's only provided place of worship and so on Saturday morning I had a few minutes where I could talk to him I I had just finished basic training because see where I was stationing was only two hours from where he was preaching and so um I said now brother Ram I'm I'm a bit worried I don't know what they're going to do with me what I'm going to do in the Army he didn't even take a breath he said don't worry George the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord so he's quoting Psalm 37:23 and so when I went back to the army they made a cook out of me yeah for 500 people well so then um we get to uh December of 65 and remember when they moved they didn't they didn't bring furniture they didn't bring a piano or anything and so one day brother Ram says to Rebecca now look I promised you a piano he said I've saved up $900 let's go down and look at pianos because he was interested in Furnishing the house and making it look nice and so they go down to the piano store and she knew kind of things what things were worth but he didn't and so he's wondering through the store looking at all the nice pianos and she's looking over here at the the Thousand pianos and so about then they open the big doors in the back now comes piano about like this one here they just restored it it was beautiful of course it caught his attention and so he says hey Rebecca come over look at this one well she knew it wasn't a th000 piano no no Dad we don't want she didn't want to embarrass him well finally he gets her over there and so uh she comes over close and she sees it's a Steinway oh no dad no let's not get involved well just just play only believe let's see what it sounds like so while she's playing he's dealing with the salesman he says of course now he's almost taking the other position he say how much would you take for that piano right now and the guy says well we'll take $1,100 we'll take it he writes him a check he says I'll find the other $200 so they delivered the piano and that piano has been with us in all over our moves and in 1992 we thought you know we need to get this refinish because it's it's getting kind of ragged so we uh we called the store and uh Rebecca said you know we got this piano there and we want to see I get it restored he she said and the guy said fine what's what's the name so he looks up brandom we sold you a Steinway for $1,100 yes sir you see the check and I've got the piano and so he said now the man that restored that piano in' 65 he's still here because the piano was actually built in 1926 and so he's got time for one more so we'll come get it well anyway they finished it it looked beautiful and that refinish cost us $3,500 well we thought you know we might want to take insurance on this C thing uh so we had an estimate made on it so in 1992 it was worth 25,000 so you see God has ways of blessing but anyway um brother Brandon was anxious to get furniture in the house I helped him put some of the furniture together he never he never actually lived there but he got it all ready and so uh the idea was that they were going to go back to Jeffersonville he was going to preach pick up his new car and come back now he traded cars every two years because of high mileage now they were going to leave Rebecca in town so that she could move all the stuff out of the apartment into the new house and then they could come right to the new house when they come back and so they're going to leave very early on the 18th of December and brother Brown had some very uh specific ideas when he was traveling if he was traveling by himself or with Billy he would just wear blue jeans and you know some boots or something but if he traveled with the family he would dress up a little better and he liked to leave very early at six o'clock he's already moving it's okay if everybody goes to sleep but we got to get there and when he's packing his stuff the Bible was always the last thing in the suitcase because he didn't want anything on top of God's word and if you listen closely he says on tape not even my books and so he's going to leave very early so I wasn't going to get up you know the middle of the night I was going to go back say good night goodbye to him on the 17th so I go up on the night of the 17th of December and we're alone in his room and I noticed that by the door there's a chair with his boots and his blue jeans and I said what's this all about he said well Gody never knows when he might have car trouble but I knew that he never had problems with the car he kept his car in perfect condition that didn't say another word he didn't say another word but within 24 hours he'd been in a very bad head-on collision and so uh it would take another hour to explain that but it was um God's way of taking care of things I don't know if you've ever been over there to West Texas but it's very flat country see he knew something was coming up but he didn't know what it was and he had to stay in the in the lane he couldn't leave but anyway eventually after two days or so he's in the hospital in amarelo Texas all bandaged up and he had the the tracheotomy in his neck so he couldn't speak and I got got in to see him once but you know there was no cell phones there was a phone on the wall there's a lot of activity with the phone and there's all these people had come around to pray and Give opinions and things but you know there's one Mexican family sitting over there and nobody's talking to them so I went over and talked to them well it turns out they're the parents of one of the guys in the other car because see the other car that hit him head on there was four drunk guys one died at the scene and the other three were in the hospital and I just remember talking to them for a few minutes and their son was was one of the other three but it turns out that that that guy got better and eventually became a preacher and his grandson is now a preacher over in Texas and maybe I'll get to see him one day but these guys lived under This Cloud for all their life we helped kill William Brown but while brother brandom's in this ICU unit there's 12 beds in there and during those six days that he's there the other 11 beds got better and moved on but on the night of December 24 God said that's enough and took him home now we were like the early disciples this isn't the way we planned it there's got what's going on here brother Ram says one place he says you're going to find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you're still right here in a faster Dimension so they're only as far away as you put them now in the Catholic Church they're taught that we can we can have conversation but that's not true so as it turns out um they're going to they took the body to Jefferson to have the funeral so they had a funeral on December 29th I couldn't be there because there wasn't a blood relative I had to go back to the Army but sister Brandon was very injured and the wck she couldn't decide where the burial should be and Billy couldn't decide so there was no burial and the funeral director said I can keep him you let me know when you when you decide now you know the word says in second second Timothy God has not given us the spirit of fear power love and a sound mind and in Philippians phans Paul writes and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus now I was in the Army so I missed a lot of things were going on but you know we learned to pray we learned to listen to what he said and because see with God there's no surprises God got everything lined up so the missionary work began in Earnest and um things things were moving so by um March of 66 is three months later the family decided that the burial would be in Jeffersonville and so I in the Army in Louis and I knew what God had done for me and I knew what God had done for Rebeca so I called her one day I said hey let's get married next Tuesday so we were married on the 30th of March of 1966 right there in Tucson in a private ceremony and we took a go back to Indiana because there's going to be a burial so the burial was on April 11th and all through Billy Paul's life he always had a relationship with his grandmother but that was Hope's mother and but this woman was very difficult very hard he had never never seen her cry she never been to church but when he went to the burial he left his two little boys with grandmother and it was a rainy day and you know just kind of sad so then when he came back to pick up his boys the first time he sees Grandma wiping her eyes and she said you know even the heavens weep for that man and so later that day we left to go to californ and on April 15th of 66 I flew off to Vietnam for one year there was no phone no vacation only letters that was trial by fire but I knew knew that God had given me a spirit he kept me clean he ke me kept me balanced so after I came back and finished my two years in the military and so then I began with the translation work with the messages in Spanish the first track we translated was while he was still living he he said that's good and as you all know it's not so easy to take Kentucky English and put it into Spanish you almost have to put it in English first but we got to fast forward 40 years we only got a few minutes left in October of of 06 Rebecca was very very sick there was much prayer much faith and she wasn't just anybody this this girl had spent 19 years with God's Prophet but she had um kidney cancer and then it went to the lungs and so it was difficult we were in a lot of hospitals and going through lot of stuff and I can see no matter what we did she was inching closer closer to going and I said now God can raise you up the next 10 minutes but if he chooses to take you then you get with your dad and wait for me there and a few days later we had a a call from a sister back east and and she just she was a single sister and we knew her for a long time she said I was getting up from lunch today there in my house and right there was a vision and there was brother Brandon preaching to a lot of people and the prayer line was there and while he's preaching he says and you little sister thank you for praying for my daughter Rebecca and tell George not to worry everything's going to be okay so when you hear your name from the other dimension you pay attention Okay I knew things were going to be okay maybe not the way I want but they were going to be okay so then on November 28th the Lord took her home and so after the funeral in early December of 60 of 2006 I was praying I said Lord keep me busy keep me focused and keep me balanced my focus is beyond the curtain of time and I'm staying very busy traveling to many countries simply trying to encourage the bride I don't have any shortcuts uh your picture with me doesn't Mount anything but balance is very essential so for every one of us there's a line in the road now you don't know where that line is that's why you got to stay ready so we were married just over 40 years and uh we have three children we have three grandchildren and one is married in Tucson and the other grandchild another one's going to be married next in March in Louisiana now a lot of times we have time for questions and answers not here but I was in Africa in a big church about 5,000 people and they're translating into French and so as soon as I got through speaking the pastor jumps up and he says now we don't know when brother George is coming back does anyone have a question well they asked the question and it's translated and then you got to translate the answer they're not in a hurry to go any place there's there's 5,000 people there's 10 cars outside and there's about uh 200 motorcycles and maybe a thousand bicycles everybody else walked so time doesn't mean anything and so the only question I remember this sister asked she said well since the Lord took your wife why are you still wearing the ring I thought man these people see everything I said because my commitment to Rebecca wasn't until death do you part it's for eternity so we're staying very busy and uh my advice to you married people make her laugh every day if she's only laughing at your corny jokes now we have a formula in at least in this country the 50/50 you know uh you bring your half like in Spanish we say the the half orange you know but the better formula is 8020 each of you give 80 expecting 20 so it crosses works very fine but you see every day people are watching you watching how you live your Christianity and sometimes they see us good and sometimes they see us bad see Jesus said in in John 13:35 by this shall all men know that you're my disciples not because you have a little sign says I'm Elder somebody and not because you have the right belt buckle or because you're carrying your Bible just right but when you have love one to the other because they're watching us so we're busy today with translating and printing we're printing in Mexico and South America printing in China in the us and we're helping to to send money for food and rent in Venezuela they are very very bad off down there really bad but you know the gospel has reached some of the highest drug people many have been converted and baptized but we'll close with this one item this this brother had a a dream and so he says he's in heaven speaking with brother brandham I said no wait a minute you don't speak English and he doesn't speak Spanish he said I know but we could we spoke perfectly so they talked about a lot of things and um and so he noticed that on brother Ram's arm there's this this girl and so he looked at her real careful Ah that's young Rebecca and she gave him a big smile and she said you tell George I'm right here waiting where he told me to wait so may God bless you thank you for the [Applause] opportunity [Music]
