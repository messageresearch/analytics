morning amen i want to go straight to the scriptures if you would like to turn with me to romans 10. yes [Music] whenever you have it just go ahead and say amen the bible says if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thine heart that that god hath raised him from the dead and shall thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation in hebrews 10 23. says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider apost the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus christ let us bow our heads lord we're here humbly lord but boldly in your throne of grace con confiance knowing lord you've paid a price so that we can come and lord and ask anything that we need father lord and that you can give to us eternal life you can give us the words of life i asked lord that you may just take control as you have been of this service lord that you may bless the one that is listening and you can bless us father that you may take full control lord jesus control we thank you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen amen amen god bless you you may be seated amen my title this morning is the authority of confession in romans 9 10 it says in and we believe unto righteousness but then our salvation comes from the confession we make the confession from us declaring out of our own mouth our salvation is made because of that now when we hear the word confession that's how our english translation translates we uh confess our wrongs and our faults to admit something that we've done wrong but that english translation quite doesn't uh translate the way it should but the word that's the greek word for it the word homo means the same la palabra significa and logio means to say now the word logio is a is we know that in the beginning was the logos in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god in the principle so confess doesn't just mean i admit to my wrong entonces confess when he professes something to you professor whenever you read your bible and it says by his stripes you have been healed you take those same words you believe it unto righteousness but then you confess those same words yes lord i am healed and you are saved because of the confession you so confession means to say what god says and i understand i'm a no good sinner that's saved by grace but then there's a time when you're saved then there's a time when you're sanctified you're born again you say the noah and you go on and on and on you go you say it but jesus thoughts aren't our thoughts anymore he thinks of us and whenever we're born again or we're trying to receive more of god yet we're trying to hold on to our old confession of our faults and our failures to being humble doesn't mean to beat yourself up well i'm just humble brother and he's professed that he was god gael professor he said i am the son of god didn't he say that and and today the bride is is being accused jesus he thought it not robbery to call himself equal to god jesus we do not say anything outside of the word i do not say anything other than what has already been established by the word confession means say what he says and they went to jesus and say you man calling yourself and he said and he said that he was saying what the bible says he says didn't the scriptures say that you are gods and you get angry at me because i say i'm the son of god confession means to say what he says not what you feel confession many times we are not even in the place where our confession is a confession brother branham says in uh jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now you don't now you don't see it ain't wait you've uh confessed it first and act upon it then the feeling comes afterwards my hair didn't obey my confession i i was still bald you know my paycheck didn't obey my confession right away me i look like i was yes from the streets and people might have said oh eli is just the same if he said but something happened within me but you and me and i began to confess and my body needed to catch up to my confession i'll tell you right now i still struggled with things i still struggled with with certain things while i was giving out my confession but i knew something supernatural happened in my life something supernatural can happen in your life and nobody could take that away from you well brother you still have the sickness but they just haven't caught up to your confession when god tells you you're healed try to take it away from you you cannot take it away it doesn't matter no important what your body tells you it doesn't matter what the outside sources tell you no important you are saying what the lord jesus christ says the bible says that he is a high priest of our confession this is wherever you was you accepted it and began to confess and people and tell people you were saved you kept with your confession and after a while it worked righteousness confession all your neighbors and everybody knows you're saved because you believed it and confessed it he's the high priest of our confessions at the right hand of the father making good what what your confession what you're confessing that's the same thing with healing that's the same thing with everything you renounce your feelings david says in psalms 1 16 10. i believe therefore i have spoken confessing isn't just telling people how you feel el confess or telling what what you believe but it's something that you send forth you release something we we believe in our heart we confess that's uh truly amazing for me is you know when david was there in front of goliath when he saw him blaspheming all those uh israelites and everybody was scared everybody didn't know what to do david says how do you let this uncircumcised philistine blaspheme the lord but david began to say what the lord said and did in his life he said i don't need any of what you have for me el dij he said there was one time a lion came and took away my sheep and i grabbed it and i took it out of his mouth and i slayed it [Music] when he faced that giant in his life that he began to declare his victory before the battle even started that sounds backwards to me i usually tell people my victory after the battle is done how was it when you went through this oh by god's grace but maybe we should do what david does david look straight at that philistine david miro directamenta que el filistero and he said you come with me with the sword but i come to you in the name of the lord of the host of the armies of god of israel and i will kill you and cut your head off and i will give the dead bodies of the philistines to the birds and the wild animals and the whole world will know that there is a god in israel and everyone assembled here will know that the lord rescues his people this is the lord's battle and he will give you to us can you say that to your sickness today declaration i'm going to stand on your dead body i'm going to be victorious over this yo victoria i don't care how much this sickness rides over me i'm going confess for what you're going to speak por lo custeva did you know that they're waiting for your confession do what david did again okay is you're gonna you're gonna die in your sins that's what the devil wants to say oh you're not gonna overcome the sickness oh your children aren't gonna come back to the lord that's the giant the uncircumcised philistines you know what david did he went back to his testimony he went back to what god did for him before sometimes you got to go back and say if god could heal me then it is you take them with those testimonies you take them with the word us and say what god says now now this is a simple message all right brother daniel said something tremendous at the end of his testimony tremendous we are coming to a climax of times the bride is getting herself ready [Music] the third poll has been from genesis to revelations it's not something new that the prophet showed us he just revealed what has been hidden in the scriptures the whole time when you confess you confess your salvation your body has to the bible says we were made in the likeness and in the image of what did he do the bible says in psalms 33 la bibla in salmon [Music] he gathered the waters and the sea together as a heap el junto como monton las aguas del mar and he lay at the depth in storehouses let all the earth fear the lord let all the inhabitants of the world stand in all of him for he spake and it was done he commanded we were made in the image of that began us to understand what we talk about what do we say in our everyday lives what do we talk about when we talk about ourselves and the spirit went above the waters and begin to create beautiful things that's what happened when he spoke john 6 63 it says and juan says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life that's why we we hold on to his word there's a book that has stood on the test of time no other book has stood like this book has no iotro libro que se libro no other words have been heard from all across the world like this book has ningunas you cannot update it you cannot change it you cannot do anything but keep it the way it is because when god speaks when god speaks it's intentionally intention now forgive me but this is a saying that we say when somebody talks too much and talks reckless i hurt people's feelings and i don't mean to la sentiment i i say things that i'm not supposed to digo and we don't even know we do it but god what's amazing about god the bible says that he thought for eternity and when beginning started was when he spoke but he thought before he spoke and he didn't only think for a little bit of time but he thought for eternity because he knew how powerful his words were what does the bible say it says quick to hear slow to speak and slow anger sometimes we just gotta think before we say something we just gotta do what god did he thought before he spoke because he doesn't say anything he wants to say or he doesn't say anything he doesn't want to say por que el di everything's intentional isaiah 55 10 it says for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh forth a bud and it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater porque como de siendo de los be that go without forth out of my mouth and it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it void it doesn't come back empty no but it will accomplish that which he sent it for bro not only that and he expects something in return he expects progress or or or something to happen when he speaks it's a creative messenger what the word is it's a creative messenger the bible says that the word is a sword what we use a sword for parallel we try to accomplish a goal with the sword right the word is bread the bread is to accomplish something especially so that we can eat it the sword is a tool so that we can use it the seed is made to be planted and so that it can produce when he speaks it has to accomplish something now if i could just sit here for a few few minutes before we stop when god thought in his mind did he think words that's a funny question right i was there in the behind his mind but i wasn't there in words i was there the bible says where were you jobs when the sons of god were shouting for joy letters and words cannot shout for joy they were images in the backside of his mind so when god thought of us he thought of images he started people he thought of what he wanted but when he expressed it it was words and the words are not to be void because they're not the end products the words [Applause] but when he thought of adam and eve and how they were going to be and how they were going to be uh kings and queens over the earth sand and he took dirt and he took the elements of the earth and his word did not come to him void but it accomplished what he wanted it to accomplish it manifested what is what what was in his mind manifesto amen amen they are spirit and in life so what are we thinking in our minds mind what are we thinking in our mind is there evil or is there good malicious because when we speak it's what comes out of the mind it comes out of the heart and it's going to produce it cannot return to it [Applause] brother branham says that our words are go out into the airwaves and he said that it's like a leaf falling on the on the water that leaf will make a ripple and even though you don't see that ripple or that wave anymore it continues and continues and continues until it hits the shores brother branham says that our voice will be played back in the day of judgment this is and one day it's going to hit that shore of the judgment bar um and then it's going to show what we have been saying what our confession is whether it's good or it's bad what have we been saying about ourselves what have we been saying about others what have we been saying to our families what have we been confessing about christ what have we been confessing about our salvation and our beliefs it's going to come back the bible says in proverbs 18 21. death and life are at the power or in the power of the tongue la muerte la vida estan en poder de la lengua wow that's heavy death and life are in the power of the tongue brother branham says in the except um in the message accept god's gift from you go right back straight into the same rut that you was in the beginning there's not a man or a woman in here that is baptized with the holy spirit but what would start your confession i believe i've lost the holy spirit amen amen jesus is the high priest of our confession is that right jesus christ now in hebrews 3 1 now any scholar knows that the same word profession is confession to the same translation translated now sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercessions upon what our confession he can't do nothing until first you confess it it's done alright his name is jesus christ the bible says that my words are spirit and life and jesus is waiting for you to speak jesus his spirit is waiting for you to speak el spirit because when you speak and you confess god's word there is an agent or a high priest there to make intercessions for your [Music] so life is there waiting jesus christ waiting for you to make a good confession he's waiting for you to confess his word not confess on how you feel but confess what he already your body will begin to change your life will begin to change your situation will begin to change but the bible says to lay a hold of your confession but continue to confess what you need to confess on the lord and leo hold on to that confession to that word that you believe and say lord i believe god has to fulfill but just as much as the holy spirit is waiting death is waiting also death and life are at the power of the tongue and there's devils waiting for you to speak bad about another person there's devils waiting to say i'm not i'm not saved anymore yo i i diagnosed i don't think i'm saved anymore because i did this be careful what you say because there's a spirit in life behind your words the bible says that your tongue or your mouth is a door and they're waiting there at the door waiting to be dispatched because we know that the devil cannot enter into so he uses god's children's words to create because he knows that a child of god can create and can produce it'll create a life of depression it'll create a life that does not know if they're saved or not anymore you remember the time when brother branham had this uh a prayer line and they had a videos videos and there was this woman that came up to her or her those one that came up to brother branham while in case i said branham and he began to discern her and when she was about to leave he said hold on wait el dij he said i see a dark shadow over you a black hood negra he said oh it was a lie somebody told on you yelling he said it was your pastor he's he's saying that you're a witch right it was the words that they spoke to her foreign and because of that she was hooded with something attached to her life that was tormenting her okay because somebody spoke evil on her album what are we speaking about each other the bible says god's a tongue of gossip it's like wildfire they say la villa que la lengua all is i'm just saying what i feel led to say you know the scene but when we talk about what are we saying to our families what are we saying about our own life what are we saying about our brother our sister our neighbors what are we saying about our situation it was going to produce whatever that seed was produced and in the end is the third pool which is the same thing as the beginning the spoken word is [Applause] we're waiting for those things to happen but yet we curse our brother and our sisters is it's the law of confession we cannot say speak and be amazed because it happened because that's the way the bible made it that's the way god made it amen amen now i just want to talk about job just a little bit before we close he was afraid that his children were going to sin and he told the lord he said i want to sacrifice just in case they sin elijah and the bible says that what he feared what he feared the most came upon him fear doesn't mean you don't have faith [Music] it means that you believe the lie more than you believe the truth and you believe in that that's going to happen more than what the word says and when you begin to speak your fears then that's your greatest fears are what's going to come upon you do you believe that adam do you think he spoke anything he wanted to speak before the fall uh was intentional with the speaking advance because he knew if he told the wind to stop it when he would say something it would have to happen and that's the same thing with us begin to speak life into your lives us big blessings in your life maybe everybody told abraham abraham you're too old man hey you're too old to do this sarah she's her woman is dead already too old yesterday but god told me i was going to have a promised child god told me i was going to be this god told me i was saved the bible says let the weak say i'm strong speak into this uh speak to the and it will happen he spoke and it happened that's the same thing we're going through today you speak your own salvation into existence in existence you believe in your heart unto righteousness and you confess unto salvation you say allah salvation we gotta get ready the times are almost there it's already here and what we gotta do is begin to speak he look positive have or the bible says that he'll have a sword in his mouth that was the same sword brother branham was holding us he grabbed that sword and he said this is the third pool and when jesus came down he had that same sword in his mouth what was it the spoken word everything is the spoken word the whole bible is the word jesus said you say in my name it's and it shall happen he said speak how let's be careful what we say about our brothers and our sisters brother branham says that we can kill somebody's influence by what we say about them [Music] but what if we start speaking good things about them what how what would happen if we begin to pray for them those people that are only hanging by because that is the word of the lord once you begin to speak in the authority of jesus name it's god himself speaking this is yours hey man let us bow our heads [Music] that you have delivered those that need to be delivered father yes lord you have healed those that need healing you've given those that need the holy ghost the holy ghost you have strengthened your bride lord father we are getting ready lord we're here with you father whether our situation is is contrary to our confession lord independent situation is different we confess your word knowing lord it has to bring everything to pass confess [Music] the name of the lord jesus christ [Music]
