[Music] [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen i'd like to go to revelation chapter 3. verse 7. we thank the musicians and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shut it and shutteth and no man openeth it i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name is him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name now we want to go to leviticus chapter 25. the word says then shalt thou cause the trumpet of jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your lands and you shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family a jubilee that 50th year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of the vine undressed for it is jubilee and it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this evening we're going to continue on the year of jubilee this is uh part number 10. israel and israel in the homeland part too not i like to read a quote from brother branham in the message is your life worthy of the gospel says now now we notice and in the old testament that was when all the people that were slaves could go free when the jubilee sounded if there was some excuse he could give por la cual no que here that he didn't want to return to his land that he could never no more come back as a citizen in israel hamas no more queso what did he do he rejected his he could go right back to his homeland position and get his own possession but if he refused to do it then he wasn't lauded no more with israel and his possession was given to another so the trumpet today is the predication it's the preaching of the gospel is the preacher that comes to preach to you the good news that christ paid the price for your sins therefore you don't have to be a slave to sin the trumpet today is the preaching that's why there's ministers they're the ones that are playing the trumpet that lets you know and you've got the decision to stay safe if you want to stay in your condition or be free and christ has a homeland the inheritance that was left for us is what christ left us in his bible that's the position he left us predestinated even before being born again god already knew who you were that's why when you hear the preaching of the jubilee you can go what's written in the world can never be fulfilled hasta que la persona until the person dies we know that right for example a father that has many possessions he makes a will and then everything written in that will is fulfilled foreign la sangre this is the blood the minuel testament of my new testament but now the things he spoke never came to pass but he spoke in that testament until he died that's why he needed to die for he is the testator but what's written in the testament is never fulfilled until the testator dies that's why christ died he resurrected him and then he sent the holy ghost which means the self-existing one it was just him but brother branham says that we were with him in his thoughts we were in his mind and then we go brother branham says in the exposition of the seven church ages in the smyrna in church age yes and that is exactly what we have been saying estos the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the design in the designated a medida as each member came forth so it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride young feminine destination though she is though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called for that she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him now it's manifesting god and cuerpo de he's got an earthly body and it's the same spirit of christ that was in those bodies so the same spirit of christ that was in the earthly body of jesus now is the same holy ghost that's in the mystic body of jesus christ and that body is now here on the earth but it's the same body it's got the same spirit remember primarily first of all they're just thoughts and then they become acts the same thing with god he first had thoughts and when you're let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus and i enjoy how it says in english it says that this mind is it's got different manifestations it takes you to the baptism of the holy ghost to the revelation of jesus christ unto the rapture unto the new jerusalem and unto the millennium it was of the supreme deity of jesus christ not being the second person of a trinity but being god himself made flesh dwelling among us and the revelation now if you notice in just a minute let's just read a little bit further then brother branham reads the scripture we just read this it says shut it and has little strength and has not denied my name is and luther come out with a name that he was alive and was dead that's right father son holy ghost jesus here comes out the name of jesus again in between the in between these two ages in between the open door is una revelation now it's a revelation what he was that the first revelation someone needs at the day of pentecost and that manner you can receive the revelation of the deity of jesus christ that's why that's the first revelation you need i was studying and i really enjoyed this part here i'd like to go to matthew chapter 5 verse 18. so for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled what that means also and i'm going to show you how this connects onto the jubilee in lucas cuatro in luke chapter 4. verse 17. and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance unto the captives and recovering of sight to the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord which we know is the jubilee year now i've mentioned it before but i'm going to repeat it it says here that he took the prophecy that it was in isaiah in isaiah it's chapter 61. to stay by elect if you to preach the the year the year of the lord in isaiah it has a comma there but right here it has a period is the second coming of the lord jesus christ what she says is the day of vengeance it's not the year of jubilees it's the year of vengeance but right here in luke jesus jesus only reads one part and it's demonstrated right there in the prophecies in isaiah there's just a comma representative that that comma represents millennials a period of around two thousand years where it talks about the first coming but it represents a time period of 2000 years yes and that was back when jesus only read one part era la transition it was the transition from law unto grace even being in the law why because the bible says everything must be fulfilled not just the words that are written within the grammatical but even the grammar in prophecy now in the prophecy el espirito now i really enjoy the translations in spanish it says the good news in english and in english it uses the word the gospel now we know that the gospel is the good news is maybe to be able to share it unto other people so the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor everyone anointing expressed in five different ways but that anointed the spirit of christ now in john 132 i records saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it aboled upon him juan mismo so john himself was a witness jesus of how it is that john was jesus was anointed to preach the gospel so that anointing of jubilee juan puedo john could see it and that's when the holy ghost when john baptized jesus [Music] how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went out doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him [Music] he was given a warning jesus it was to oppress it was to heal those uh broken hearted a pregnant libertado to preach liberty unto the captives and sight unto the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised that comes upon the preacher freedom from the devil that's what the jubilee produces but everything begins with you if you decide that you want to accept christ if brother branham says christ is the mystery of god revealed says what is it noah personas not ten people the headship and the bodyguard that's the reason the husband and the wife is no longer twain uno they're one [Music] his name the anointing is also for the mystical body of christ and through there god works his threefold manifestation yendo asia el reyno going to the kingdom says risen hate the prize estas we're redeemed because grammar grand period a great period of time just like in jubilee representatives it represented almost 2 000 years from the first coming on to the second coming before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children coma comma and the heart of the children to the fathers lest i come and smite the earth with the curse the anointing of elijah complain fulfills this it turns the heart of the fathers unto the children it represents somewhere around two thousand years that and he says those are also the apostolic fathers pentecostals the pentecostal fathers the spirit of elijah millennials it represents a time period of 2000 years for it to be completely fulfilled there's still people today god knows who they are they've got to come back that's why we haven't gone back to where god is literally literally because we're waiting for those that still they're still awaiting to hear their day of jubilee media my day of jubilee different may be different of your day of jubilance maybe today is the day that i hear the trumpets and i decide i want to be free and maybe next month or the next year next week you decide that's going to be your day of jubilee media jubilee my day of jubilee difference can be different from your day of jupiter because you've got to accept it el calvario what christ did on calvary who leon so represents the time period of about two thousand years and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when zechariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for for your before thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine or strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb now quickly i just want to touch this point on verse 15 it says shall drink neither wine or strong drink do you remember brother branham when he was a child and a voice spoke to him out of a little whirlwind because a job awaits you when you're older juani lemon brown tuberose john and brother branham had the same experience they could not defile themselves contaminate themselves in verse 16 and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god has he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready of people prepared for the lord now this is an angel of the lord this is not the devil this is an angel of the lord of malachi 4 5. and he only said to turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children and he did not quote the second part where after the comments where it says and the hearts of the children unto the fathers because only the first part pertained to the first election to the first four runs of the first coming of jesus christ then a period of about 1900 years passes and returning of the deity of jesus christ they received the holy ghost and it also says those were the apostolic fathers both apostles and that's brother brandon that's taking us back to what they had that's why we believe in this message it's taken us back to what was already written in the bible and i know that works behold i've said before the an open door and no man can shut it for thou has little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name now throughout the ages they started off right with that pentecostal doctrine that the person has to be born again and they also have the apostolic doctrines which were the revelations of the mind of god and as the time passed the devil entered in and started to give them wrong doctrine those wrong doctrines they weakened and killed the church philadelphia for god has not denied my name god's name is very important in first john 5 7-8 for these are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are won jesus now remember when jesus he commissioned the disciples he said to go into every nation to go and baptize in the name of the father son and the holy ghost but there's no one here that has the name father is there anyone here whose name is son is there anyone here with the name holy ghost so those are just titles but he said to baptize in the name of pentecost and at the day of pentecost peter had the revelation what was originally left with the apostles i want to go to joel 1 4. this is that which the palmer worm hath left the locust eaten and that which the locusts has left half the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm has left half the caterpillar eaten explicit manifesto brother brandon explains this was manifested throughout the ages these were the foreign they entered in and they started to kill the tree of life because when christ was here on the earth he that's in christ and i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the caker worm the caterpillar the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you it speaks about what these demons of the devil did even what they started to take from the tree of life what they started to take from the church of christ now notice what brother branham says and the message the restoration of the bride tree this is four messengers of life restores the tree lo captain do you get it john wesley baptism of the holy ghost what was the fourth la palabra the word justification justification sanctification three what the word he said father sanctify them with your truth for your word is truth but then the third stage came which was pentecost then come along wesley stronger sanctification after wesley came stronger than him pentecostal baptism the baptism of the holy ghost in another great prophet but in the last days of malachi 4. elijah is to come with the very word la palabra restore vino de lamente de vios that came from god's mind que vino de la caveza that came from the head because we were always in god's thoughts now we've which is recorded in the message what is it that holy ghost bunch sieno pulido para que pueda cuadrar con la misma clase de ministerio being honed out so it can fill with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the rapture just where the justified sanctified the baptism of the holy ghost will stand again the house of god will live again it takes you to baptism of the holy ghost that's why we have the stature of a perfect man in form of pyramid in the form of a pyramid that's why the new jerusalem it's informative it's in the form of a pyramid representative the it will take us into the millennium millennium showing in the millennials that you accepted the trumpet and decided to the possession that was that you want to eat of that tree of life which is christ see that pyramid will once again we'll stand again the house of god will live again the tree of life is growing again now notice this and we're ending an apocalypse in revelation 3 12. this is and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh down out of uh from heaven of my god and my new name remember the trumpet of the jubilee is taking you back to a possession today it's taken you back to what the apostles had la el bautismo del espirito santo the baptism of the holy ghost the revelations of jesus christ now in ephesians 2. verse 19. but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god represent the place where you'll live in the future and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets and what foundation did they have jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone apocalypse now in revelation 21. talking about that great city that's in the form of a pyramid spiritual and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god now it's talking about this city in verse 14. and the wall of the city had 12 foundations and upon them the twelve names de los dosse apostoles del cordero of the apostles of the lamb usted you today you're being built upon the revelations of jesus christ that's the foundation that you need is the position that's the possession where malachi 4-5 esta in the spiritual natural but in the natural gondola when it talks about that city says it has twelve foundations which are the twelve apostles so as you can see estimated because today you live in christ you're now a citizen it's not that on that day you'll become a citizen you already are and the foundation it was the revelations of jesus christ so that we do not get discouraged because there's great things that await us in the future help these young people to be able to understand what is the position what is the position they have if they decide to accept jesus christ of the lord for we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Applause] [Music] me foreign [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] god [Music] is [Music] okay [Music] i can't take care [Music] of it [Music]
