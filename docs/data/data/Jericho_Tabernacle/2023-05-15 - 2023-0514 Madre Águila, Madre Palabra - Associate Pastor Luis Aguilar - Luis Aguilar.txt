Brothers for the trust and as well to the Lord for the life and the health Deuteronomy 32 11. this is Plumas says as the Earth as the ego stirth up her nest fluttereth over her young spread it abroad her wings taketh them buried them on her wings now we're going to the book of Saint John chapter one versions verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now we will be bowing our heads our Lord Heavenly Father Lord this morning we thank you Lord for this day that you've given us it's a very special day which is Father we want to thank you for the mothers that we have here with us and maybe there are mothers that have passed on from this life is and father we thank you for them Father because there is no other love that is close like to your love then the love of a mother father we ask that you bless them may you give them more wisdom may you give them more strength we the children that are rebellious so sometimes we don't pay attention and then our mothers become gray-headed and father we thank you for those great-headed mothers father may you bless every one of them may you take care of our mothers father we thank you for your word we thank you for your presence that you help us in this morning to express your words in the way that you gave it to me [Music] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be Cedar Brothers amen are you happy this morning Brothers the first slide uh I'm gonna ask the brothers this morning we want to speak on a lot of subjects we want to title that mother ego mother word how many of you know que la palabra is that the word is our mother amen God is our father and the word is the one that gives us life and we just read the scripture in Deuteronomy it says just as the eagle the eagle let me open my scriptures as the Eagles stirth up her nests foreign the prophet speaks a lot about the Eagles [Music] and he's spoken about the mother Eagle how many of you have heard the prophet when he speaks about the mothers because the Prophecies of God types the eagle as the word or as God just like the the ego takes care of its eaglets the Prophecies of the word Eagle the in itself means the one that is fed by its its peak and God like himself to an eagle because God because the scripture tells us that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out the mouth in other words and God feeds his church by his mouth and the prophet tells us something very beautiful about the the Eagles he says that the ego builds her nests in the highest part that she can yeah currently I have an issue at my house I have problems with pigeons and the pigeons they want to make their own and I've realized that I can't really do anything about that and that's what the prophet says he says starts come to your mind we can't stop those stocks he says but we can stop them from building a nest amen is not a pigeon the eagle reaches the highest Place cannot reaches because that bird will burst open before it reaches but God made his makeup to be able to withstand to be able to withstand the height foreign we through uh trials and problems we can withstand the pressure we know that God is taking us Higher and Higher and Higher and then you think he's going to release you like this but that's how the ego is she releases her eaglets but the ego is able to withstand that pressure because she was made like that because it's maker God made her like that in a very high place in the highest mountain that it can reach there's no uh there's no coyotes had enough courage to go up there fall and he's going to break his neck because he's not able to withstand the pressure of that but the mother ego goes up even higher Protege to protect your Eagle take care of her from the Predators says that the ego builds her nest so high for uh safety protection and protection and they come out of the shell for how long is the eagle in the shell in the egg for around 21 days and the prophet speaks about the 21 days I don't have time to get into that he says but once they hatch out of the egg the prophet says that the eaglets they mount upon the wings of the mother eagle and then drop down to the grass and she lets them to walk and roam through the grass and then she goes up high you know and you would think that the Eagles are alone now and the Predators that are nearby they think that the eaglets are alone but the mother equals he's in the highest part of the mountain watching over her eaglets waiting just for one Predator that has enough courage that's the reason God likened his church until the Eagles because the Eagle's Nest which is the church I'll say it again upon upon the Rocks she builds her nest on that rock yes he is and it's the same way with the church it's not founded on the on the branch of a tree it's founded upon the rock is built far beyond the cares of this world and we see that when they hatch and when they begin to grow yeah and it's very precious when you can see a baby but that baby must grow a minimum amen Brothers if it doesn't grow then there's something wrong they have to start teething they have to start talking you don't want your babies to always remain babies all we want [Music] for them to come out of the nest [Music] just like the ego that stirred up her nest it's a time when the eagle that her little ones have matured plenty enough so the eaglets they have to grow [Music] they can't remain as English there's a time when they have to come out of the nest so then the mother ego now reaches the time now remember it's the mother Eagle it's the mother word she has to stir up the nest the word and God does the same thing in his church that is right there it's right there in the green and he says in God does the same thing in his church he begins to stir up the nest Mr kilo Vera is that right this is when we have all settled down on something then the mother word he begins it begins to stir up the nest Amos once we're nicely settled down [Music] we've conquered everything everything is nice and calm now and then God said all right I came away we got to stir up the nest now he says he brought Martin Luther from Catholicism [Music] and he says and they got so starchy that he stirred up the nest Wesley and said Wesleyan then Wesley got so starchy he stirred The Nest is when God is sending things we begin to get accustomed we begin to get adjusted but the prophet says that God does not want us he wants us to keep moving not to remain Idol or just to remain in one place God makes us keep moving and moving and moving because the mother a word knows what's best for her eaglets so then the prophet says this old mother eagle flies into the nest one day all unexpected to the Little Eagles so these Eagles were not expecting it was a day that was out of the normality they just thought it was just another common service it was just another common day but the but the mother Eagle came on a day for them and that's what the word says that the Lord shall come as a thief in the night there will be no calendars there's no scheduled date saying I'm coming at this time we have to be ready at all times I've been out Barber for eight or nine years state board I've never had the Barber State uh the board come to my Barbershop and then all of a sudden and then you can see all the Barbers they're they're rushing they're cleaning everything and says why are you such in a hurry you have to be ready at all times because you never know when the Lord will come [Music] a regular service maybe one of these mornings we'll be here in such a rush cleaning to get the oil for my lamb you must already have the oil this is your chance to have oil in your lamb oh it's because so and so in this person keep oil in your own lamp yes and this mother girl came in an unexpected day yeah yeah and then she flies into the nest and she'll take those big wings and she begins begins to give him a great gush of wind she begins to Flap her wings he says it shakes every loose feather out of them because we shouldn't have any loose feathers something that's too late just let it goes comes and flaps her great wings so whatever is tied to us can be come out that those lose friends with her great wins I Supply [Music] you shouldn't have any loose feathers Just Let It Go a man amen [Music] we're here at church and then we're we're now alone and then a time comes what we feel alone oh God is so cruel he left me alone even nature itself the mother Eagle leaves her eaglets they have to mature they have to fly it says to give them their first little solo flights and you can't have loose feathers when you're solo flying yeah she flies in and they have a mighty rushing wind they never felt it before why because they were English but now they're growing up he says because they were born in the cleft of the rock their Eagles but God changes it does God change God changes it's because brother I'm so comfortable I'm nice and warm here God doesn't want to settle down he wants us to move well we have to be ready and then he gives us some something new [Music] and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in a cliff of The Rock and I will cover thee with my hand while I pass by that's where God puts us nice and safe and nicely taken care of them oh okay it's time and then God will say you have to get out of that rock okay okay I want to see how you do in a Solo flight amen amen yeah are even more precious than gold it's a deity you want to buy gold you have trials so then now the economy says we have to buy gold because the the value of gold is diminished you want gold then God said I'm gonna give you more problems Brothers I don't want any problems every one of us we have problems we have trials we have struggles gives us the trials it's not Satan is it Satan is God that gives us the trial now the prophet says that the mother Eagle is equipped to take care of her little ones that their experience is right to see that their experience is right amen amen the prophet says like a true eagle would be successful people [Music] [Music] [Music] because God gave it to you the Spirit came unto him in the wilderness I guess why it went to go test his experience even the Lord Jesus Christ himself had to be baptized the Lord Jesus Christ himself had to go through the world and the Lord Jesus Christ himself had to be tested and God had to know the mother words had the right kind of experience he took him to the wilderness to tempt him the Lord Jesus was tempted he was tempted and he overcame Temptation now notice a trial that you have the Holy Ghost is that you have trials [Music] the following week another trial sometimes I tell the pastor I think I'm done yes and then the next day here comes another trial that we are legitimate children if we overcome the trial aura oh Lord uh brother I don't want to hear about the trials I want to tell you something so that uh it can encourage you let's go to First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 13. you're the Lord Brothers First Corinthians 10 13. it says there hath no temptation taking you but such as is common to man he says but God is faithful amen Brothers but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able so then we can see that God will not give us more than what we compare something that we are not able to Bear he gives us exactly what we need did you see and he says that we will have a wave Escape because of it that he may be able to bear it is there's the bomb s God gives us charge but God is faithful he's not Unfaithful he's faithfulness and he gives us what we can pair not only does he give us a trial but he also gives us the Escape he also gives us the way out then praise God he puts us but he also gives us the way out because he gives us what we can bear and he gives us what we can bear then blessed be God lord I want to be rich in your grace amen that changes your Viewpoint When Trials come to you okay because it's more precious if God puts you in a trial the same way he'll give you an escape from it amen Brothers ego is supposed to be a bird that renews his youth ah okay so then there's a key that lies there the best every so often no important no matter how old he is oh brother I'm old I can't change no more and turn you young again amen Brothers one glorious say there comes a time when she thinks the nest should be stirred she runs in Paris there seems to be something wrong with her sometimes we think that the word is mistaken is those eaglets stopped that there was something wrong with the mother there's something wrong with her yeah and then sometimes we think there's something wrong with the words but the word is perfect it says she looks over her baby she examines them [Music] he reaches the highest place I don't know if you notice that the uh the prophet says in his messages he says he says I can see it that the time came when Jesus crossed over and this is where the Prophet began speaking he says he went to gadera he said he says but he went over there at the Cry of one person how great is God Amen he can stop doing everything else just to go to you that he went over there at the Cry of one person this is one poor Maniac lost his mind perhaps a good man one time walk upright before God but notice got in the wrong crowd that has a lot to do never get together with the wrong crowd let me have a be quiet my bee started drinking or something and it lost his mind and he lived out in the tombs where the demons lived foreign he had an old gray-headed mother somewhere in the Bible that they would time and change he had a mother and then [Music] he started drinking foreign [Music] she took God praying for him she said I'm not I'm not losing any of my eaglets there is no other love that is closer to God's love than the love of a mother doesn't matter the condition of that son or daughter it's me he's still my son amen Brothers is that the same goes for God regardless of who of who you know it doesn't matter if you curse him he says you're still my child nothing to do with it but you're still a child of God for you to come there was another mother a colored woman the prophecies that she had a son yes and this uh this young man went astray you took the wrong path but this mother stayed in her position and she prayed until her prayer until her faith [Music] stopped a plane of the age just imagine you have enough faith my question is if you if do you have enough Faith to stop a plane where the Prophet is at help us Lord have mercy on us this mother to a colored a mother that woman is such a tremendous woman for God to honor us we have to be in our position we have to be praying amen brothers and the prophet of God was going to Dallas Texas and he stopped it in Memphis Tennessee the pilot said there's an emergency we have to land the plane there's an emergency this mother had an emergency in her and then the prophet got out hello the plane kept getting late and late and late and he said walk yes and that obedient Prophet started walking because he was asking God why are you taking me and then he began to sing those songs where are you taking me turn here turn here go through this corner keep going forward that is being led of the Holy Ghost I need you to turn here I need you to turn here and turn here and then he found himself a color sister waiting on the fence of her esperando waiting the seventh angel messenger not the first one second I'll send you the greatest one of those the seventh one so then the woman stood there Parsons how do you know I'm a person the Lord told me you are Parsons I'm here waiting for you well the Lord told me to keep walking and I ran into you and she says don't you hear about that shunami woman I was that type of woman being led by the spirit and she said let's come inside my house well the brands I've never been so welcome and ever in my life they're the doormat said God bless our homes it wasn't a mansion and have big ceilings but it was all ruddy's shot falling apart foreign [Music] Cristo and then the prophet says he saw the big boy he was around six feet tall he was lying on an iron in bed say Mom Mom it's dark in here Mom it's dark esta she said Parson he said he's he's rolling a boat if you say uh he can't get out it's dark brother random grabbed his feet you're a cold yes I'm frios he says Parsons doctors gave up on them but I've been praying God send me someone I want to save my baby oh the prayer of a mother stop the seventh angel messenger towards that seventh angel messenger yes it was a little home with Angela a lot of people would have want to have that privilege muchos uh but that woman had Faith Buffet the prophet says she said she uh Drew closer and she kissed him on his forehead she said God bless mommy's baby I thought mommy's baby that shows the love of a mother [Music] no matter how demoral and the Bots and old okay whatever it is whatever it is a mother's love Wades right on through it I thought if a mother's love would do that how much more will the love of God [Music] if a mother may forget her suffering babe but I will never forget you for your names are engraved on the palms of my hands and I thought she kissed them and now down well I asked her I asked her lord I can't do it anymore fight against you anymore she raised up her hand and the prayer is your sins he says I just cried like a baby holding the foot that little old foot sorry of that little old bed that little old iron posters I held to that bed and cry when that Old Saint poured out her heart to God the prophet cried I have never heard such in my life she said notice the prayer of this month I've done the best that I could you know I washed over the washboard for the white folks she said and I tried to take him to church but he got with the wrong company now dear Lord you taking him home and don't let them die a sinner don't let them die as a sinner Lord let me have some consolation in my heart let me have peace Lord give me consolation in my heart and my baby is safe and that you've taken him again and she said your Parson is here now she said Lord I just pray that you'll do it but like that and when she said amen wiping those old black cheeks reached over and reached over and kissed that boy again brother something swept through my heart she hugged him in her arms like that and said mommy's baby that's a mother's love and then the prophet grabs and began to pray for him Christian not only did he heal him but he also sent his Prophet through their way amen Brothers all things are possible if you can only believe you have to let go of the loose feathers if you have any loose feathers I'm asking for my son I'm asking for my daughter Lord bring them in give me a consolation in my heart I don't want them to go I want peace in my heart there was another young boy in the Bible that asked his father for his inheritance he said father um one day this boy he said I want my cut of the inheritance and I want to leave this place the father said well that's fine if that's what you want the father sold everything gave him his inheritance and he gave him his inheritance and the mother went with the father her husband and he said what are you doing why are you letting him go I don't want him to leave he's still too young the father said I can't stop him he's of age now he knows the difference between goodness he knows what's right you know what he know what's wrong I did everything I could to instructions I can't do anymore and she asked what can we do the husband said well we have to let him go um we know that he's called The Prodigal Son he wanted his inheritance he went and he went to go spend all of his money he went with his friends but then a Time came when he lost his mind and that's what happens when the Holy Ghost leaves us in the Corral of
