glor [Music] said my for more [Music] spe [Music] Lord bless each and every one of you this [Music] evening the last couple of words really touched my heart reflecting Your Love unto this world or one way or another the message for tonight that's what we want to do reflecting the love of God unto this world uh when we're on the back the brother prayed what beautiful words forgive us Lord that we may be clean before your presence thank you [Music] Lord with the right [Music] spirit and that's what I'm asking for this evening may the Lord bless each and every one of you once again it's a great privilege to be here once again and I give thanks to God for this opportunity and also for our pastor for this privilege you will have to forgive [Music] me you know that sometimes I try to calm down all of my [Music] nerves but it seems like I've had a bit of a vacation and many times before when I've had a minister uh and I didn't do it we had precious brothers that came to visit us or we had uh very special testimonies and it fell on my lot that it was my turn to preach and in many occasions and though after that um my me and myself and my family got [Music] sick in the days that I had to preach and so the vacations are now over but now we come humbly and reverent behind this Pulpit to seek the Lord's guidance that he may speak to us once [Music] again and just as you're standing if you wouldn't mind turning to the scriptures on 1 John 4:19 verse 19 and the title of this [Music] message hate grudges and [Music] bitterness I'm a bit strong or sometimes a bit hard to swallow but let's see what the Lord says tonight and the scriptures read like this we love him because he first loved us amen amen if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar for that for he that loveth not his brother whom he ha seen how can he love God whom he has not seen amen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also let us pray if you wouldn't mind bowing your heads Heavenly Father once again I just want to repeat those precious words of our brother forgive our sins this evening that we may be clean before your presence so that we may be able to speak a couple of your words help us to speak and also receive and that we may also speak that only which you want us to speak help us to understand a little bit more about your word because there's only one motive in our lives is to be filled with that perfect love because with only that is that what is going to allow us to be with you over there and we ask all of these things we give you all the honor and glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated we thank the musicians and what a precious hymn that was [Music] uh I also want to add another scripture if you want to turn to it if not it should be up on the screen on Matthew 2239 and this was the answer that was given after they asked him what is the greatest commandment and he said You shall love the Lord thy God with all your might and the spirit and soul and then verse 39 he says and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself when I hear that word uh like unto it reminds me a little bit about Genesis that God created man both in His image and his likeness coequal so if the great commandment is to love God and something similar to that or equal to it is to love thy neighbor as thyself and in English it says to love your neighbor so I'm going to lean a little bit more on that word and we all everybody understands here what a neighbor is or in Spanish neighbor so there's different types of neighbors so your neighbor at home or neighbor at work or at school or even the brother that's sitting next to you a neighbor that's your friend or a neighbor that's my enemy so there's many different examples of a neighbor but we want to focus ourselves on our enemy that person who hates you the person that you hate oh brother don't you dare say I don't hate anybody all right so then the person that you kind of don't like [Music] amen but brother you're wrong cuz see I don't I love everybody well then I pray to God that that may be true because I also pray onto God that I may love each and every one of you with the love of God and not only you but even unto my own enemies well who doesn't say that we don't love or who claims that we love I could say that I love my wife and my kids that's the normal the easy thing I love my good friends or those people that are always nice to me the Good Neighbor the church members that are very pleasing or the preacher or the pastor who's also very uh pleasing and you don't need too much force to be able to love those kinds of people like the young person when he falls in love with the young lady well she's very beautiful and she talks so sweetly and she dresses so beautifully and vice versa with the young lady with the young man how is how are you not to fall in love with them and the same thing with the pastor and the Sheep a nice Meek sheep gentle who speaks cautiously and then very precise or vice versa a sheep that falls in love with the p Pastor because he's very Meek he's very gentle he speaks in a very pleasing way but what about those people that who we claim to love and they begin to what it says out in the world to show the real colors that little young lady and they say well in reality I'm I'm really afraid of the kitchen that young man that's so strong and and good-looking and he's behind closed doors he says I hate going to work so then now things begin to change a little bit so the Sheep begins to do something that maybe you didn't expect it or a minister begins to show you something that you weren't expecting or a deacon begins to behave in a manner that you weren't expecting and that certain thing that you were not expecting tends to turn out to be something very negative and then that's when we are going to truly find out if we really love that person as we read in the scriptures love thy neighbor if you love God love thy neighbor and he says here in Matthew 546 for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not the even the publicans the same well like we said it's very easy to love the person who loves us the one that's always inviting me to go eat with them the one that always keeps invied me to go over to his house doesn't the world do that and 47 says and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so and it's sad to see many times when the greetings between the brothers uh they kind of seem like they're a bit offensive the word or you could say the lack of respect I've experimented it and my family as well has has experimented it many times and I've also seen it Lord bless you my brother how you doing God bless you brother I lived it and I've seen it and 48 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and what is to be perfect god is perfect and who is God God is love so I'm going to read it in another way be ye therefore love even as your father which is in Heaven is love Lord bless you brother I love you how are you doing be love I was looking up for the definition of hate and I'm always looking up uh definitions because I'm very ignorant and somebody didn't believe me uh just not not too long ago SCH that I didn't graduate from high school and in reality I did threaten my teacher and I did a couple of Mischief things to be able to receive my diploma and I did not graduate and I am ignorant and the definition of hate it says like this right here brother I got right here brother a feel Intense or passionate dislike for someone an adversion or an extreme dislike and take a look at some of the words that are synonym to what hatred is intense passionate extreme and it's something deep the hatred and then searching up in Google and in the bottom I had a couple of words come up the greatest form of hate well I'm going to click on this link right here and then when it opened up the greatest form of hate is to uh abort abort abort which in Spanish I've always heard it but in Spanish when you say the word abore in English the the word is hate and it's very interesting to see what the the words and the meanings end up coming out when you go into the translations not only in Spanish does it express as hate but it also uses the word correctly uh detail the meaning of that word and it goes into the Very extreme which is the word abore not just the hatred that was just barely born or a mediocre hatred that it was kind of half and half no no but to abore intensely passionate and extremely and I know that I'm speaking to the Christians this evening and if they would ask how many of you have surrendered your rights I think everybody would raise their hand here because we have given our lives for the Life of Christ we've surrendered our rights to have his rights to have everything of Christ and if we are confessing that and we believe it truly from the heart if we lift our hands then we have no right to hate anyone if we are Christian if we have surrendered our rights I have not known that Jesus has hated anyone so then we have no right to hate anyone and it's a very dangerous Zone to be in that we should try to avoid at all cost whatever it takes to be away from that zone being in that zone means that you are now out of your position the minister that has now gotten out of his position and he's no longer ministering that Sunday school teacher that has now stepped away from their position and is no longer teaching and the pastor that was once pastoring is no longer in his position no no that's not it I don't need the holy Spirit to be able to minister I don't need the Holy Spirit to teach someone and you don't even need the Holy Spirit to be a pastor because there's so many pastors around the world without the Holy Ghost I need the Holy Ghost to be able to love to be able to love and to love and when we get away once we get out of our position of having that love to show that love right then and there we have removed ourselves from our position in Christ because it is our duty to love one another I could preach whatever I want and teach whatever I want but without love love I am out of position I am in a very dangerous position a p a pastor could teach he could correct he could uh pastor but without love he would be in a position of danger that's why love is the most important thing in a Christian's life and let's go up a little bit higher here for a message believer in this uh end time because everybody is claiming to have love but thanks be to God for a messenger that he came and he gave us the great revelation of the great love of that great agap love that we should have in the message adoption preached in 1960 brother Bram says I preach because I love him and I love his people and that's the reason I know I have passed from Death unto life because that I love them and I go after them no matter what kind of condition they're in no matter what kind of condition they're in Fallen Sinners uh self-centered murmurers I go after them no matter what kind of condition they're in I go after them anyhow go get them any anyhow and brother brand continues to say that's what we do go out and get them catch them anyhow no matter no matter what they've done no matter what condition they're in and brother B says reach grab hold on with all your might and this reminds me of Jacob when he was wrestling with the angel and he wanted his Blessing and when he grabbed on to him he said I will not let you go can you imagine a brother with so much love coming out of that when he goes and he rescues a brother I'm not going to let you go until the love that I'm showing you until the compassion love and grace that I'm showing you you may be able to reestablish you restore you and bring you back to the feet of Jesus Christ and brother brandham says you don't know who they are save them only save them that's because of love not that because I have to but because I love and the most beautiful thing is brother Brandon uh turns to the congregation because you lovec and then we find out that it's not only the duty of the minister but also the congregation it's both love from here to there and from there to over here because we are all responsible for that love that he showed [Music] us I think that each and every one of us here in our one point in our lives I'm not going to DARE I'm going to say that at least me in my life someone has come and pushed my buttons and they've pushed me up to my limit even up to the border that I'm almost about to say maybe you might be able to identify yourself with this even sometimes we say or we've said before Oh How I hate him oh how I hate her whoever it might be husband wife friend or relative oh I can't stand this person I just hate him no matter what kind of dangerous condition they might find themselves in that brother or sister and maybe I'm speaking about you acting a certain way or uh thinking a certain way about you we have no right to be able to hate that brother or sister we should turn our Focus around and put it in front of us like as to say to close the windows and uh put a mirror up so that when you want to go look at that person you look at yourself first return that Focus because then now you or a certain person is now in a very dangerous condition because now me myself I'm about to do a service with my lips to say that I hate them and then he keeps pushing me and if I'm not careful I'm going to say it from the heart when it has then now come into the most deepest part of my heart and then you begin to express hatred towards your brother and it is a very dangerous Zone and it's as far as our our own enemies and even unto ourselves how can hatred exist in a Christian if the present pardon of God exists if the grace of God exists if the love of God exists in this moment love and forgiveness should destroy any kind of root of bitterness any uh root of bitterness and whatever spot of hatred we might have see the story of uh go and Hosea how many times didn't go uh deceive uh Hosea and even he took her back he never had any hatred or grudge against her and Joseph when he was sold uh into slavery by his brothers he even loved them in in jail which would be something extremely difficult for somebody to do even Jesus being uh uh deceived or or betrayed by one of his being crucified by his own people he even said forgive them Father for they know not what they do that is love a love divine a love that passes all understanding an attribute of love that is called forgiveness that not only does it destroy the root of bitterness but when that seed is planted within this Earth a bitterness or hatred the Forgiveness can destroy that seed before it even grows any Roots before it comes out to be a huge tree trunk and becomes a tree that forgiveness can destroy that hate and in an occasion a minister can he develop a grudge can a deacon develop a grudge can a pastor develop a grudge can he Samson fell David Fell and then it comes into my memory that uh saying that my father used to tell me as a kid bigger Towers have fallen down so then if they fell and if they could develop a grudge or hate I am no exception to it we are no exception to that what about brother brandham don't you dare speak about my Prophet because brother Brandon was perfect that was Christ with us well however you like it what about brother brandham was he free from temptation of the trials of hatred of grudges what did happen to brother brandham that he had something against these Ricky and retas and I was telling the brother behind that every time that he would mention those names he would even say it before I could even finish it saying oh yeah he was very passionate about what he would say when he would speak about them now I'm not going to say and I don't believe either that he had a hatred towards them and I'm not going to say or think that he had a grudge against those Ras but he had something I'm going to say something I'm going to say that he there is something there that he had against them well how can you dare to say that brother brother Bram was never like that he was nothing but love no brother brandham was also a human being as I said you can hear in the in the tape he would Express himself when he would mention the Ries and Ras and just listen what he says here in standing in the Gap and and these Ricky and retas that I have so sass the word Rick that I've called them Ricky and Retta God give me to understand I shouldn't do that that I shouldn't call them by those names that I shouldn't disrespect them I shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children the Ricky and retas of the congregation they are still his children they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold formal churches has got them that that Spirit upon them and they're much uh in much in prison as Israel was in prison and brother brandham continues to say and I wanted to bring this to you so that you would see and see how you that the mistake that a man can make yet being oh I'm going to repeat it and I wanted to bring this so that you could see and show you that the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere brother BR speaking about himself and even talking about Moses Moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him can you imagine losing that love or that sincere for that for the people something so simple because they wouldn't listen to him brother brandham brother Bram here also lost that love for those Ricks and retas that God had to come down and correct him and continuing and I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have he's speaking about himself I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have until I can get that feeling there is no need in me going because I'd be a hypocrite do you begin to see how important the Love Is The Love for the people love for the brothers love for one another and all these years I've tried to serve him with a true heart and I won't go out there being a hypocrite I got to feel that that it isn't Ricky and Retta and they're not a bunch of liars they're not murmurers they're not backslid they're not womanizers they're not Ricky and Ras they're not this group and it isn't this Bunch it's God's children that's in bondage that I must go to and here brother BR says he realized that he needed to be corrected he needed to be rebuked because God allowed allowed him to see that which he was saying and expressing wasn't correct there was something that was displeasing him but he was a special vessel that in the same manner that God protected him when he was just a little kid so that he wouldn't contaminate his body because he had a purpose in his life God also protected him for him to not develop a a root of bitterness to not develop a a hate because it's very probable uh disagreement brother brandham with time that it might develop into a br of bitterness and then with more time that root of bitterness becomes into a hate but God had a purpose for that man he had to cut him there protect him at that moment so that he wouldn't come to that point of having that he wouldn't have that St on his testimony because it was a purpose for his uh Ministry and his and his life just how how I think that there's a purpose for your ministry and a purpose in your life God wants to restore you God wants to reestablish you God wants to console you and perhaps that cons consolidation might come through a hug of a brother a hug of a sister uh maybe throughout everything he Jesus even called Judas his friend Smith even George Smith when he came to preach to us that use a specific expression the prophetic Dimension and I've heard of Brothers with that uh gift that they express it as if they were on a computer and you open up one window and another window and then all of a sudden you got six windows open in a single screen so even brother brandham maybe seeing you sister with a maybe a window open and then another window open and then another one just like brother George Smith said that he was in a prophetic Dimension he was seeing who was murmuring about him those who were deceiving him who those that were lying about him but even then he still loved them that's the tremendous part that maybe you wouldn't even notice no the testimony was that nobody knew who was the enemy or his friend just like Jesus knowing the life of Jesus and brother brandom knowing the life of one another even then he showed them love and that's the love and that's the tremendous thing that I want and only the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to have that type of love and if you lost it on the first age if they lost their first love well in this one we will not lose because in this age we needed to be able to go in that Rapture it was needed in the first age it's needed at the end and that love is the one that I want nobody with the root of bitterness will ever make it into heaven nobody with a malice with a hate it's impossible and Matthew 544 says but I say unto you love your enemies right there everything ends I can't have hatred not to a neighbor but my enemy love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and there goes that word again hate those that really hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you pray for them which despitefully use you persecute you and I think that's one of the hardest things in my Christian walk to pray for those that really don't like me or I don't they don't like me to pray for those that I that don't like like me to pray for those that might be my enemies and show them that love of Christ this scripture is only for the Sheep only for the ministers for the pastors no this scripture is applied to every single one of us it's for each and every one of us and I believe and I'm going to say it that it begins from the pulpit and it goes from Pew to Pew to be able to have that kind of love and it goes from Pew to Pew to all the way to the uh parking lot outside to show that type of love to do good to those that hate us to pray for those that despitefully use us begins from the head to the toe it begins from the pastor all the way to the most insignificant sheep and just like the pillars and just like this the faces that come out on the screen and just like those figures that the ministry is always looking at the ministry that the church is always looking at they should be the first ones to preach that and not preach it from this beautiful Pulpit not preach it from these beautiful or from lips but that Ministry should be preached with that life to be an example from the top to the bottom because we're all equal in the eyes of God God makes no exception for your title he loves us the same way and he has the same requirements for every single one of us love your enemies and brother Johnny said and I'm GNA try to close up here that this message has a variety of plate or dishes that we can eat but perhaps this one might be one that you don't want to eat and I hear it in my ears and they it said that maybe today this message might be something that you don't want to swallow and I remember from my childhood fighting with my f with my parents cuz I didn't didn't want to eat my vegetables and then I hear a loud voice from my father saying eat it and there it goes a slap on my back and my then I began to eat it very quickly why because it's very health healthy for for my growth it's it's good for my well-being these messages that then we don't want to eat it's for our spiritual growth I have to love the one that has that's speaking evil of me I have to love that two faes brother yes you do have to love them brother B said yes you do because they are children of God could be your love could Your Grace the Forgiveness that you give them perhaps that might be the thing that brings them back and brings them and puts them back in into their position and then they begin to have that first love again and we're going to be closing now if the musicians could come up and that might heal your brother or sister that might be the thing that opens the eyes of your brother or sister that's not the Santana Doctrine those are not the rules of Jericho that is message and Bible that is the word of God and in the message Africa uh trip report if you wouldn't mind standing preached in 1953 brother brandham says and I love people and I love to minister to them and I love them because they love Christ and if they love Christ then they B then they bound to love me you can't love love you can't love Christ and hate me and it's not only just for me this is also for you let's repeat that once again you can't love Christ and hate me I can't love Christ and hate you you've got to love me too because I his servant and I have to love [Music] you because you're his servant as well not just the one that's up there but each and every one of you are servants and brother BR says and I happily say and with much Grace I love you with all my heart and that's true and now just to make a turn the corner [Music] here and questions and answers preached in [Music] 1959 and love is the most powerful force there is in the world now if you notice a devil is always hate a devil is always hate period and he repeats it once again hate is of the devil and when people hate someone remember it is a terrible devil to despise or dislike it's a terrible devil to despise or dislike our Brethren and brother Bram says you mustn't do that but can a person really know their heart who you really love or can you notice when you really love someone we should examine ourselves with the word love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and for me the most powerful of them all and pray for those that persecute pray for them with love place them into the hands of the Lord ask the Lord for guidance and direction not just only for me but also for my enemy the one that persecutes the one that curses me the one that hates me if you wouldn't mind closing your [Music] eyes I heard a preaching from our brother Johnny and he said he said these words I [Music] want that when when they hear about Jericho Tabernacle I don't want it to be known that we're so tremendous in the message that we know so much about the Bible I don't want this church to be known for [Music] that I want this church to be known for where everybody loves one another this is what brother Johnny said when this church was only 5 months old now we're at 5 years in this church I want this church to be known for where everybody loves one another Heavenly Father we thank thank you for this word that you gave us this evening we don't want to hate anyone Lord and we don't want to feed that root of bitterness even though it's so easy being in this flesh because the devil attacks us day and night and he uses our own brothers and sisters in our church [Music] but if we can recognize if we can see that it's not our brother it's not our sister but there are the Spiritual Beings they're the Devils from hell that anoint our brothers and sisters from the head to toe we are no exception Lord help us to love to love and love and don't permit any root of bitterness be grown in our heart so that we may fulfill those words that our brother Johnny used to say and even more than that to fulfill those words of the Holy Scripture the word of God to love th neighbor we ask you this even in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] [Applause]
