for uh for easter morning amen we're thankful for the lord this morning and estamos aggressive amen st john 11 25 san juan once jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though though he were dead yet shall he live in and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this now let's go to saint that same chapter but the 44th verse and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with the napkin and jesus said unto him lose him and let him go a via muertos convention let's bow our heads to the ground and let's just raise up our hearts and let's approach the author of the word we approach you lord with with humble or humble hearts father father just knowing that we have nothing good to offer unto you lord lord we were lost lord we were going straight to to darkness lord straight to hell father we've tried to to do right things and good things or but it's not good enough lord but father one day you came down lord you died for us sinners you looked you looked at us with love lord lord give us the revelation of your words amen amen you may take your seats i'm in sepuenzentar and this morning i would like to place a a small little title for a message this morning [Music] and let him go uh amen if you haven't been coming it's been a while that you haven't been to church or and this is the first time you're hearing the gospel yes maybe it's the first time you're hearing the word maybe this is the 100th time you've come to you're about to find out why we cry when we praise the lord you're about to find out why we raise up our hands when we come to church you're about to find out why we say amen to the words you want to find out why that sister that you used to know was a sinner esta punto enters why we're so crazy about the gospels in the beginning in the principle everything fell todo there was no hope for mankind we were going straight down the road that was going straight to hell no one was exempt from it doesn't matter who you are or who you come from it doesn't matter who your father was or who your grandfather was important it doesn't matter what you did no important you had one destination and that was to go straight to the pit of darkness yes all because of one word back in the garden of eden was messed up everything fell todo well the brand says now the roses had thorns uh or if you lost why we're so thankful with the that they know that the innocent substitute had to die for the guilty and then now they would offer a sheep a bullock or something and kill it throw the blood on the altar so there's not strength enough in animal's life to a tone for human life it's greater as human life than animal life so good it can never take those sacrifice could never take it take or make those people perfect how many times we try not to lie or how many times we try to do the right thing it was never good enough it doesn't matter what you do no important it's never good enough you might say well what's the point if you just follow me just a little bit we'll get to there bueno brother graham says decent amount of random now notice all the law having a shadow of things to come today paul was trying to say how they were circumcised the males by flesh pablo procuraba mentioned it was a type of circumcision by the heart of the holy spirit of this day how they kept the commandments back there como que ayanes entonces guardama we don't want the word of god just in the bible what we want in our heart god said it's in the bible it's in a table but in the future thou shall not steal you see if there's no law there's no sin no i was cutting this this police officer the other day he's a regular and he says louise do you know they're about to legalize marijuana in the states i told officer you know that back then adultery you can go to prison for adultery oh yeah that's right now you can adult her and nobody says anything oh there's no the crime rate has gone down frequencies because there's no law and i said now people murder aura because now it's with the law you just it's fine do you just wake up and you're wrong you didn't do anything and you're already wrong you're living and you're wrong doesn't matter what you do no important you're wrong there's no you can run a red light you can't do this why if you run a red light you haven't done wrong because there's no law to say so no assets and it wasn't sin because there was no law to say there was sin when law came on mas law was added until the perfection came a man has always tried to find something to save himself by all right he is still doing it the same thing today hasn't failed you start following me well brother what's the hope for us then trying to cover sin with his own merits whatever we do they're dirty rags to the lord whenever we come and we sin under the law we had to bring and it's still in my heart y'all next time because it's still in my mind i want to send me money do you want to do it tomorrow job was a perfect example of doing sacrifices for him and his family where is his kids were out there uh on weekends and so forth say he committed adultery or he stole or you look at the significance here last significance slam had to be blameless for a blame person says i hope you see it is he says when we when we're here stuck with the rules of the law there's no hope for mankind noah exists esperanza parallels god gave the ten commandments to moses god took that prophet and took him to mount sinai hey man i'm in you took them up there to mount perfect and not sent him to mount sinai he didn't send him to mount sinai to mount calvary calvary not to get the law no i told every single one of you stand right here in this line and if you tell me everything you've done wrong just by looking and standing and being alive you're wrong who oh brother just hold on what do you mean let's read the scripture matthew and behold there was a man which his hand has withered away and they asked him saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days and the the people started looking at him is he about to break the sabbath what man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day will he not not lay hold on it and lift it out el is how much then is a man better than a sheep wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days he said oh if you had a sheep stuck on a fence somewhere this is how much better is a man than an animal wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath day so they saw that this man that was called a prophet he is and man breaks his covenant how many times have we done that sometimes don't even come to the altar sometimes we're in our car we're in a room i promise you lord i'm going to start serving you now if you take me out of this one lord you did something great i'm going to serve you with all my heart man never kept his covenant with god we're always the one who leaves god the law was never kept completed they couldn't keep the law it is not there was no hope for mankind when jesus was there on lazarus graves jesus and he called them out by his name and that's what the scripture in the 44th verse says and he that was dead come forth how many of you have a scofield bible like brother branham uh romans chapter eight and romano el capitolo ocho what did jesus christ mean by saying lose him and let him go romans eight and romano for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus jesus had made me free me from the law of sin and death so when jesus christ told lazarus said lose him and let him go it was jesus christ himself liberating him from the law of death [Applause] just jesus christ sin and flesh now if you start noticing there's two laws that i just mentioned the greek word and deuteronomy means two different laws and that's just what god has yes two different laws those different one of them is the law of death and the other one is the law of life to follow him that is death to reject him if you're here this is your first time hearing the gospel you're 100 time here in the gospels that's why god have mercy on us [Applause] you know they go to the barber shops you see soldiers with their suits on the concentration in their haircut a man says i'll pay for his haircut because because we care more about a soldier and that's fine yes serving our country because i love him i'm not here because of an obligation i'm here because of revelation not because of a duty no give you grace two different laws those decent slaves now i was talking i i i was talking to eli habla that's why we need to fight for ministry they're two different laws different slaves and what does that mean i don't understand that law is a system of rules do this don't do this texas has different laws different there's things i can do over there that i can't do over here i'm in there's things i can do in mexico that i can't do in the united states two different laws some dos disintensely two different countries those different despises different states those different same thing in the spirit are you following me this morning the same applies to the spiritual elo spiritual god took you out from the law in death do this don't do this do this don't do this romans 6 14 romano says for shits for sin shall never shall not have dominion over you. for ye are not under the law esta is you don't deserve nothing but i was just born that's right yes yes just by being born to die doesn't matter what you do important yesterday you made a mistake this morning what then [Music] you just told me that i can do whatever i want and brother you just said you just said if i just sin this morning i'm under grace two different laws those because he took me out of that mess and you really repented of what you've done not because you're scared he's going to send you to hell or because he's going to condemn you you do it because you love him said even if he sent me to help because he loves me for killing me and he saved me when i didn't deserve it i don't want to do those things that's the true revelation that we don't just go in and do things because we're not under the laws god doesn't see what you do because of the sacrifice of jesus christ we love him for saving us and i wouldn't do anything to hurt him and i know he'll he'll still love me the same things in the world i love him so much to go back i wouldn't go stand fast therefore in the liberty with christ has made us free establish firms stand free be free that christ has made us free for christ you know what that is have you ever seen those out there in the ranches and farms or whatever where there's two bulls and there's this big woody thing right on top of them that's a yolk and that man that formers on the back and he's just pulling the ground on the ground i don't know whether i've told you or not it's just a little fiction story all right i hope you hope you're paying attention it's brilliant you know his ears were broken down his knees were knocked out what a horrible looking mess i am but if that mother could speak back to the little fellow you say wait a minute you can live back and get a lamb without a blemish on it and kill it so that crippled up looking milk and liv you see the priest never seen the mural it wasn't it wasn't whether the mule was perfect it had to be a perfect lamb it isn't whether you're good enough to be a christian or not it isn't whether you are good enough to be christian or not christian whether he is good enough god accepted him and his blood makes an atonement um [Music] then that little mule could stick up his towel up in the air and snort and jump and run around all over the field and have a good time he's going [Applause] but one day i accepted significant [Applause] i accepted but the realm says hallelujah hallelujah when god looked down on christ he didn't look down on william branham william brown didn't you look down on me [Music] amen amen and christ took my place in christ again in his name is the church doesn't matter what church you go to important if you stop coming here and go to another church whatever at jeffersonville have to be in christ in jesus christ as long as i'm in here in him out in the church not in my own marriage you don't have any he didn't make a mistake by choosing you he doesn't make mistakes he even chose you and you're not a mistake when he said told me brother louise that i can't be perfect he could be perfect by his perfect face resting in him remember required a burnt offering for his sins and job he hold not only for himself but for his children he made burnt offering brother bam says do you see amanda branham i hope you're listening hope you're awake yesterday oh you might say i wish that's all he required today i just do a sacrifice i wish that's all that's all i wish that's all he required today are you ready it's less than that [Music]

resurrection in the lies he that believeth in me and me no we were dead in our sins how he lives and whosoever liveth and believeth he you're under grace [Music] get away from those things and turn to
