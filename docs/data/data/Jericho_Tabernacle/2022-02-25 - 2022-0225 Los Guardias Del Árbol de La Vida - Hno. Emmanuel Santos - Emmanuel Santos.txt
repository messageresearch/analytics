that's here for the internet and everyone that's watching us through the internet may everyone receive their portion that they need we ask all these things in the name of jesus christ amen amen you can open up your scriptures in genesis the third chapter verse 21. when you have it and to his wife that the lord make coats of skins and clothe them is the lord god said behold the man has become one of us to know good and evil and now let us put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and to live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubins and at the flaming sword which turned every way to keep away the tree of life let's go to hebrews the 10th chapter the first the law having a shadow of good things to come and not to every image of things can every with those with those sacrifices which they offer year by year continually making those comers they're on to perfect may the lord bless you his word you may take your seats before beginning i would like to say estas san luis let's say that this past weekend we went to san luis obispo [Music] i believe it was a really good trip the lord helped us to get there and to come back with everything fine also received greetings from the brothers over there and from brother leyva into to speak the same topic that i spoke over there and speak it here let's go to isaiah the 6th chapter 1. is in the year the king of zion died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the surface each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly they have six unto the other and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory lost in the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with the smoke entrance then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for my eyes i've seen the king the lord of hosts being that the bible is a prophetic book it requires when the law was changed onto grace in the law los diese la villain genesis the bible says in genesis that says they guarded the way or they kept away from the tree of life says the tree of life is jesus christ but when jesus christ came el dijo yo soy el camino he said i am the way el mismo second he himself converted himself onto the way okay but those same guards were protecting el camino now before they protected the way so no one can come close if someone was to come close to the presence of god a la presence literally to the literal presence one can fall dead you can go with the book of revelations the first chapter hablando cerca de juan speaking of john di cuando el bio jesus you say when he saw jesus he said he felt as dead when you want the love of god to descend unto you it's a shadow of a shadow of a shadow literally it's not something literal of what john did we were going to fall as dead because this body is hybrid was not made to be in the prince of god they're there to have their face covered we will go on to his presence at the capacity you're going to see them over there revealed physically unto you guardians now those were the guards are at il now the job of those guards it was changed when it was law montenegro let us therefore come boldly onto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need in the old testament we have laws and by-laws and things that people had to do by the works of the law to be saved but god wound everything in the old testament right up and put it in calvary that the believer now only has one thing to do esmerarel and everything passed away with the shedding of the blood pressure now notice what it says here when my shadow was coming to me when my [Music] more that the image and the shadow mean the more they get closer and if you notice oscura the more darker sombra the and more clear or visible does the shadow look see it looks more darker until finally the the shadow disappears sila layla sombra there was an eclipse that's why there was an eclipse at calvary that's what the bible says in matthew 27. verse 40. that destroys the temple and build this in three days save thyself and that be the son of god come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking him and the scribes and the elders said autro salvo has he saved others himself he cannot save if he if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will and we will believe him confined he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have if he will have him for he said i am the son of god the thieves also which were crucified with with him cast them in the same as in his teeth now from the sixth hour there was darkness all over the land onto the ninth hour la gracia as more grace gets closer more darker does the shadow get dela which is the law foreign [Applause] natural sun rose also the son of god because darkness went away and the light of the gospel came in scripture of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now remember the bible is not a book of uh poetry poetry it's a liberal behind every word that god inspires every man with that he wrote the bible that brother says in the message the law having a shadow it's the valley of shadows not the dark shadows or the dark valley it's the valley of the shadow of death trying to scare him when there's enough life mixed up in it to show that there's light somewhere that's why the christian is not scared of death sombra which is a shadow la luz that takes you all to the light anos to our future home element says the message the angel of the lord all right come ahead lady aqui el esta di cernino here he's discerning a lady all right everybody rev red creos you believe sister i want you to look this way now have faith believe in god with all your heart what do you think about all this why is the prophet seeing it this way because that's how it's written in the bible the valley of the shadows of death god doesn't do anything outside his bible i hear with this prophet he's revealing him a vision that is perfectly aligned with the bible a woman in the past you're truly made up your mind that this is truly god's way of healing you is that right you believe that with is [Applause] of life have mercy upon this woman before she kissed his uremic poison and killed her senor satanas lord satan is determined but amanda closer was that shadow was going to disappear at the grace of the lord with this healing power comes close to you just because you have a sickness no significa doesn't mean you're going to die the devil wants to do that to send you to a premature grave but you have a light where you can run to puerto now remember before they were maintaining the people away alright now that the wave was provided those guards direct the people to the tree vamos apocalypse the book is a prophetic book the bible is a prophetic book then it requires a prophet to reveal the symbols and after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as they were of a trumpet talking to me which said come up hither and i will show the things which must be hereafter now the portion where i want you to notice that they put those guards al este of the east of the of the garden but the ram says says that there was a door came to offer their sacrifice so jerusalem blood of jesus christ necessaries all those necessary things to get to god's throne and not to die jesus were provided by jesus christ i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and once sat on the throne detras and before the throne there was a sea of glass like onto crystal and the midst of the throne and around about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind estos guardias these are the guards the first beast was like a lion the second beast like a calf the third beast had a face of a man and the fourth beast was beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts each of them had six wings santos santos santo es el segura poderoso and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come jesus now those are the same guards the isaiah says of isaiah 6 is in genesis 3 estos guardias these guards are all throughout the bible but they're very hidden the people are not can't see it and you notice these beasts were not out yonder in a lake or in the sea somewhere but they were at the throne of god yes and they were worshiping god estas those four beasts means four powers question and those four powers that were four gospels matteo marcos lucas juan matthew mark luke and john ningun and one of them as the gospel goes forth as a lion es firmes valiente comun leon it's stern it's bold is the gospel brave like a lion it's a king like a lion if it goes towards a man's face it's cunning and shrewd like a man it works like a horse that can pull is mark luke and john los cuatro helios the four gospels that ring out in the prince of god where god is guardians there are his guards to help him to make the people come close to him come close to his gospel get close to his grace and mainly pentecost wasn't the framework of the gospel los cuatro they four gospels are the framework to back up pentecost after they had this framework up pentecost pentecost we come into existence it's a c that right qualifies wrote first the book of the books of acts or the apostles jesus walked along doing works and predicting what will come in matteo marcos lucas juan and matthew mark luke and john guardias them four guards and was writing everything they seen coming to pass and here it comes matteo marcos lucas juan son la structura matthew mark luke and john is the framework or the guard work that protects the main temple el tempro principal now the main temple jesus when jesus was here it was jesus himself when jesus left there now there was another temple pentecost happened was translated onto the human heart now the throne is in the human heart and the guards are also and you can proclaim with an amen in paragraph 350. what to preach there's only one gospel one gospel four guards preach this gospel to every creature our remember he's taken in both all four guards matthew mark luke and john ben predicated preach the gospel to every creature they had to take notice to them because they were ignorant unlearned pedro juan [Applause] depending on what kind of test you have but depending on the pin of the type of anointment the guardian of the guard that's going to protect you through that test in the four and things that are still that was going to happen and he spoke it through his guards you know the future is they're in the four that's why he gospels about things of the future yes one of those things i'm going to bring an example in mateo matthew 28 the 19th verse all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and of the holy ghost in marcos now in mark the anointment of the ox in the capitol chapter 16 verse 15. they say illegal of pentecost is where the guards are at protecting the way towards the trees now there's another tree that's about to be presented to the people promesa de mi padres obosotros i send the promise of my father upon you but terry in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high es criticism and i knew him not but he that saved me to baptize with water aquel medicos descended the same said unto me upon whom thou shall see the spirit ascending and remaining on him the same as as he which baptized with the holy ghost they have eyes that they see towards the
