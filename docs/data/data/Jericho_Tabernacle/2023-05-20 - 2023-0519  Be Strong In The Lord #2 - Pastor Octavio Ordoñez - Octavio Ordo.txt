Ephesians 6 10 says finally my brother and breathe strong in the Lord and in the power of His might is put on the whole armor of God oh it's been a a really busy uh last two three weeks like to give you a short update actually we had those meetings and special meetings three nights and they were they were a blessing really enjoyed those meetings and uh after the meetings we we went uh camping the wife and I is get out of town you know when you're in the forest you try and clean your your mind a little bit walk around the forests watch the trees just get away from everyone I didn't get away from the wife too yeah I just leave and the wife goes where did he goes I like to go up to the mountains I've been doing that since I was a kid and well being up in the mountains you get to see a lot and I like to to hang out or look at the trees I had a video of a tree but I forgot to give it to them once you go up and hiking around in the trees you'll find all kinds of trees trees that have fallen down dead for years you see some real small trees and you try not to step on them you see some trees that are leaning over to fall some trees that have grown up real crooked but in the midst of all these trees the ones that stand out are the big healthy ones those are the ones that are attracted to you I like to go see these big trees sit around by the tree a little bit and relax a little bit is really good for you to get out and relax and and just be in nature to hear the animals animales it's just a blessing to be out there if I could I'd be out there all the time but even then you get tired of being in the woods and you have to come home well after that we went to a funeral a precious brother went to be with the lord well Tommy Perez he was a tremendous man the ministry about 55 years some of the testimonies that we heard tremendous yeah he he was able to do many things that we just dream about God was with this man the Miracles that were displayed with this man we're tremendous if you get a chance listen to the testimonies online he was a man of God and he produced children egos that are men of God is is his daughters married men of God so you can tell a lot by a man with his family so it was a blessing to be there a blessing to be with like-minded believers they must have been over 50 ministers and it was just such a privilege for me to be there well after that on on Wednesday night we went to Brother Israel Paul's church I needed to talk to him and he asked me to speak so I I spoke for him last night so it was a privilege to be there with him and uh brother Israel Paul is a good friend amigo but today we're gonna a follow-up on part two yeah be strong in the Lord this is from these messages here now these these messages are from demonology and what we're going to be doing is what we're going to be reading from the second book on here now the word is pretty strong demonology but the message itself was preached in 1952 is very February 24th it's called believing God well let's let's see what brother Branham says concerning how to believe in God our previous message uh we talked about how it's a struggle um there is a struggle between good and evil it's a tug of war is whoever is winning is a one-year feeding the most it's a white dog yes whoever's winning is the one you're fitting the most it's a tug of war is now in order to win this tug of war you need to find out who your enemy is your opponent your brother or his opponent your opponent the devil is demons you need to learn how to fight them we need to know how to fight the Devil he's a wise Old Devil is because God won the war already he's won the fight now we need to know how he defeated and we're going to read try and understand a little bit about his word brother Abraham said a key uh item here remember the story about the sister that couldn't be healed she was a nervous wreck what was the key there the key is that she didn't confess all her sins confess part of your sins even the prophet could not cast out that spirit because there was sins still there he had to sit with her to find out what was going on with her once he found out there was sin there yeah the person that's praying for her also has to be right with God both of them have to be right with God to be able to cast out that Spirit foreign some of you need this foreign on line 58 we can go to uh Genesis chapter 22. verse now we're going to talk about Abraham sometimes we think we're tested we don't get what we want no uh we don't get what we want uh he had to wait 25 years 25 years waiting for his son he was called up from the city of herb and foreign [Music] you're this or you're that right but it's okay I followed the words 8 chapter 22. how many know what Abraham means he's the father of Nations the father of Nations and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together it is he was asked to go sacrifice his only son foreign now 63 says now Abraham didn't have any great clouds of witnesses like we have today is 63 that's Hebrews chapter 12 for Abraham himself was a Chaldean yet father of the Jews but he was a kalian from the city of Earth and he was called out from among his people to walk in a Strange Land is beautiful that types the Christian walk today Christianity we have to come out from our Associates of the world to walk in a Strange Land or strange to the first land that we walked in united in the land that we call today is walk in the Christian way walk with Christo separate ourselves from the things of the world Divine promise was made [Music] when a Divine promises made listen God is solely under oath and obligated to take care of his promises God is solely under all and obligated to take care of any of his promises God is worth no more than what his word is if that word is not effective then God is not effective that is God do you believe it is God the Bible said in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and where it was John 1 1. in Juan Uno and I'm worth no more than my word you're worth no more than your word is if I had a handful of weed laying here in my hands it will be nothing it will never be nothing but wheat laying there is Jesus said or Paul I believe that's except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die a remains alone John 12 24. Jesus and now this is God his word and when that word anchors listen when that word anchors down into the heart or if I could just get you to see it when that word anchors there it produces just what it's said it'll do just it's God it has to yes well I know the word is there yeah they're just laying hands on you yeah it'll be dormant that's right it won't move because oh I read the Bible but until foreign when the word is there's a song called in English I like to read that yeah I have Journey Through The Long Dark Night This is oh and that open scene by faith alone His Eyes Were Watching The Anchor Holds oh the ship is [Music] the anchor hose I had Visions I've had dreams I've even held them in my hands but I never knew they would slip right through like they were on grains Arena but I'm older now and there has been Beauty these eyes have seen yes but it was in the night through the storms oh that's where God broke his love for me the anchor hole what's what is it holding on to yeah a solid rock Jesus Christ Jesus Christ that's what we're anchored to Ines we're not anchored to sand no Samos you're anchored to the Sun comes there goes the ship yeah anchored to the sun just making a group in the sand the Massachusetts [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is that Solid Ground I'm anchor is on the solid ground in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Alone those are lyrics by Ray Boltz esses 985 you can anchor that and say Yes Lord that's for me then something is going to happen it has to until that is just a written word that's right but when it's once anchored the outside is sin think about this for a little bit this is you know your body is sin that's the reason you don't try to perfect this body is and that soul is the same way until the soul died and then was born again of God is the soul The Sinner shall die John 6 47. then there is an immortal life you have to throw away your senses I never gave you this senses to trust he gave you his Spirit he trust you your sense is only to contact see tasteful smell in here so since and when that's been regenerated and the Old Man Died foreign creator then you can believe impossible things because you are made up of Miracle working God we got to hear some testimony some Miracles that you'd have to be there but I believe they happen I don't know if you've heard any of his testimonies they were driving down the road it was a firsthand testimony from the brothers yes brother Tommy hey yeah you're out of gas is you need to stop and put Gasolina and he kept driving yes and he kept telling them you have to stop and put Gasolina a whirlwind came over it had hundred dollar bills inside the Whirlwind got a few hundred dollars told the brother okay that's enough that's all we need yeah they were low on money on one of their trips they had their wallets and wow they were missing quite a few dollars the Wallets on top of the counteras well when they woke up brother Tommy asked them well how much money do we have they had exactly what they needed is it believable all things are possible the problem is do we believe do we actually believe this works on line 100 don't you see what I mean you get what I mean then in there there is a spirit and from there is your Immortal Life then a man that's born of the spirit of God does not commit sin you get the scripture straightened out then if he if the worshiper wants purged has no more conscience or desires of sin no more conscience of it Hebrews 10. in the Old Testament the worship were come in and offered his sacrifice went back out with the same desire to sin is but here here it is get it Hebrew said when the worshiper in his case in this case who puts his hands on the son of God's head and his sins are purged by the sanctifying power of God he said is there is no more desire in there for sin oh there is word is when you have no more desire to send when God has purged that Soul has cleaned that Spirit there is no more desire to sin yeah oh there's where life lays then that makes you an offspring of Jehovah and makes you an offspring of God [Music] now Abraham takes Isaac and they start towards the mountain and now in verse 9. how do you say he is and they came to the place which God told him and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wooden in order and bound Isaac's son and laid him on the altar upon the wood Abraham he tested them until he held them back and he said now I know you believe me Chris line 107. so therefore that's the reason said the prayer of faith shall save the sick this is an individual's prayer and prayer of a righteous man of baileth mucho the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man available listen Christ gave you the authority Christ gave us the authority by being Christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever known you can you know Prayer Changes Things you can be all upset you can be all nervous you can hate this or hate that but if you fall on your knees prayer changes you refuse to pray you'll keep what you have upstairs when you fall on your knees [Music] prayer changes things you can be all nervous and upset but when you fall on your knees the atmosphere changes it could be as soon as you fall on your knees or it could be later maybe you refuse to pray what can we not do enough oh okay it's okay Christ gave us the authority with his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever known prayer it even changes everything the mind of God after death was pronounced on the man he prayed and God told the prophetic go back and tell him I heard him see their prayer hold on Isaiah 38 and he said yesterday amen you know who the ram was that was Christ is Abraham called the name of the place Jehovah Jireh Abram said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen now you remember how many Redemptive names remember the picture uh brother Bosworth beat the brother the Redemptive names of Jehovah applied to Jesus Christ now he was Jehovah Jireh they say not down like that yes seven compound Redemptive names and substitutionary to a human life provided sacrifice that in Isaac All Nations will be blessed and through Isis and we've been dead in Christ foreign [Music] there you are and that brings not our bodies we are Gentiles in our bodies we're sinners in our bodies being born again with the same Spirit was upon faithful abrahamas that string down in there makes us want to trust God is the children of Abraham let's be asked father abrahamas Line 120 now you see when we as Christians don't look feel see taste smell or hear when we're speaking to God this is foreign [Music] now listen to this real quick here if we're born of our heavenly father god who caused those things which are not as though they were has got to be something in us like that see that's the reason that a real consecrated the solemn or dedication that's all out for God is look to what God Said instead of what you see or feel that's the Earthly man yet if we walk in the flesh we can't please God we walk after the spirit see Romans 8 is Ocho amen I'm gonna Skip Along here hopefully I can wake you guys up in a little bit that's it I put you to sleep so I gotta wake you up look let's go to line 150. I like let's go to 149. there you are faith in the word see you couldn't save no one and preaching the gospel of Salvation doesn't make you a divine Savior no more than preaching Divine Healing makes me a Divine healer but it's the faith in God's spoken word is and I know this that some of us has more faith than others and those who have abundance of Faith are supposed to pray for those but if you don't live the right kind of life you better leave away from it the devil will laugh in your prayers but when you live right and do right and act right faith in God Satan will tremble when you speak because God swore under obligation he will take care of that prayer that's true obligations now listen on on the 19th verse put on the jacket hold up the cup watch and being now we can Faith he considered not his own body now dead Romans 4 19-25 now if your father Abraham who your childhood through Christ consider not his own body when he was dead what about yours which is alive this morning and that was before Christ came that was before and any atonement was made that's before the great cloud of witnesses was gone on for the Holy Spirit Week of Faith he considered not his own body don't consider your sickness you see we have to trust in God's word it doesn't matter how you feel [Music] we have to trust in his word that God is painful to his own words but you know how it can be faithful to my word if you speak his words if you speak God's word he will recognize his own words and you'll be faithful to his own words there was a man he was a slave brother Brian talks about this musicians can come up in this uh slave yes he was scared he was trembling he had a hard time he was trembling and the man that was going to kill him said no wait up it's a straighten up what can we do for you before we kill you give me a glass of water uh so you gave him a glass of water he was shaking yeah hold on to the glass of water I'm not going to kill you until you drink the water you spilled the water so with that man that talked to him if he was a faithful man stuck to his word then he couldn't kill that man anymore God is faithful to his own words speak his word by his promises I mess up all the time it's his work that's what I'm relying on that's what I'm staying with this is a very important prayer important but before this prayer we have to understand that we had over 600 promises God has made to us when when there are 600 and something promises directed to the church in the last days that these things will take place and his power is yet the same is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them Mark 11 24. Marcos owns if you abiding me in my words in you ask what you will a little bit done unto you John 15 7. the things that I do shall you do also Las Cruces greater than this when I go to my Father John 14 12 Juan I Am With You Always wherever two or three are gathered in his name and agree upon anything yes they shall receive it Matthew 18 20. is God will to help you is [Music] but Satan is robbing you say in Italian don't believe it I don't like him don't don't believe him but with God's word we can tell Satan he's a liar foreign we have the promises we have the promises of God who need to be like Abraham is staggered not at the promises of God but was strong in the faith giving glory to God Romans 4 20. [Music] 184 I just I can just hit the devil in the face with that he said for three four 365 days a year you're a liar there's a word I am healed [Music] this is a very powerful prayer here you see God can't save you this is uh line 203 preachers stood on the platform and preached the gospel foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] is a spirit hanging over you that won't let you go out yonder and believe God's promise is that he's done it that's right now that's my commission that's what God gave me this is what he gave every gospel preacher who believes power the authority to break that spirit and I
