is Emmanuel my brother Luis Aguilar and his interpreter our brother from Emmanuel Santos thank you [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] came out here when I need a brother that's right next to you say God bless you to them give them a smile amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord Brothers amenor it's very good to be in the house of the Lord to be able to see our brothers and sisters we're here for a single purpose and that is to receive God's word every one of us is in different stages every one of us has different wounds so what unites each and every one of us is the Same Spirit itself yes it is and it's the Holy Spirit a minimum amen Brothers to be so kind we'll be opening our Bibles to the Book of Romans chapter 8 verse 14. this morning we would like to thank the Lord Jesus Christ for the life that he gave us to be able to be here before you and as well to our pastors we're always having that trust in US Aid verse 14. but before we read the Bible let's approach the author of the word a lord Heavenly Father Lord this morning believing that your presence is already here Among Us father every one of us have different desires that are in our hearts we have different struggles we come from different Paths of amen [Music] it says for as many as as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God remember this you may be seated God bless the reading of his word yeah this morning we can just place a little title to our talk I would like to call it led by the spirit the way that this message was given to me or the way that I was inspired and I was speaking to your brother and the brother used the phrase he said led by the spirit [Music] and this morning I would like to talk about that the Bible says for as many are as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and this morning we also want to be led by God no foreign amen [Music] not by building some great organization not by doing something else Iglesias making great churches Florida and Flowery altarsos and Flowery speeches but somehow he was led by the spirit of God um and he goes over and he gets a little lamb and wraps a piece of Grapevine around his neck and offered him on the Altar and then notice what brother random says and died on the same altar donde his lamb died on SOS that's a revelation Revelation now brother random says that he was led by God's spirit he got himself a little lamb he tied him with a little grapevine he led him and placed them on the altar Upon A Rocket is [Music] that Abel himself he died on his same altar SOS that's a revelation revelationismo when you die to yourself brother random says the word apocalypse foreign [Music] foreign [Music] and also says so the prophet tells us [Music] this is the first of all Revelations is the deity of Jesus Christ what is the deity of Jesus Christ he's not just merely a problem he's the god Prophet he's the alpha omega he's the Omega that's the first of all the revelations the prophet tells us Vision he says the first of all the revelations is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ when you understand he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the first one amen the statue is beginning to be unveiled and the prophet says he says You must know who he is when you hear the voice so there's a variety of voices there's not just one side there's many spirits so we must understand or for the first revelation to be revealed to us which is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ to be able to hear his voice so when the other Spirit then comes he won't get us out of the way sometimes it does happen like that or you might say brother Louise he sounds like brother so and so amen amen says sometimes sometimes voices are very similar one uh to each other but when you know who is Jesus Christ and when another enticing Spirit wants to come over how many know that story brother random he tells the story he says that Martin Luther was studying and he says an angel appeared unto him opposing as Jesus Christ and he said hey worship me Martin Martin I'm your savior so Martin Luther said you're not Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has not been crowned yet he says Satan depart from me amen Brothers says that his church his entire church is built upon Divine Revelations of himself he's not revealing something else he's revealing himself to his people is to reveal or to make a secret known amen Brothers no one else knows no one else knows that only you know Revelation that's a revelation [Music] no one else knows about this only you know about this the Bible said that Peter was an ignorant and unlearned man he was not a scholar nor a man so the Revelation he got the Revelation isn't learned Revelation is not something that's learned you're not just studying and studying no the Revelation falls on you when God it pleases God to do something so we're all here gathered and everyone here is listening and everyone here is the Revelation falling upon them he couldn't even sign his own name okay so now he's speaking to us then I'll give you a secret about myself uh sometimes I feel very bad because I didn't learn how to write English yes by the end it was already taken away so when I see the brothers that they have such a nice signature fake it till I make it right just don't tell anyone is but he keeps saying but it pleased God to give him the keys to the kingdom because he saw them and he knew his evidence he believes the word Pedro yeah and Upon This Rock I'll build my church so where is this church built upon upon Peter Pedro it's not on Peter Jesus is it Upon Jesus amen so it's yeah so this is his church will be built upon not upon Peter what does it say there upon his spiritual revelation of who he was how tremendous is revelation it's not upon Peter nor Upon Jesus but it's upon the revelations Jesus of who Jesus is amen flesh and blood cannot reveal this that's why he said to Peter blessed are you it is for flesh and blood has not revealed in other words my son cannot inherit my Revelations God has to give it to him when Isaac had Jacob and Esau they could not inherit the Revelation it was God who chose before they were in their mother's womb that's what the Bible says before they were in their mother's womb it doesn't matter if their father was Isis and their grandfather was Abraham has nothing to do with it their little grandfather was Abraham said Abraham had an encounter with God and with the angels being the grandsons of Abraham Revelation they could not inherit the Revelation that Abraham received because it's not by flesh or blood it's not him that runneth okay or him but to whom God showeth Mercy foreign they could not inherit Samuel's revelation that person goes to the hospital and they get operated and they take they snatch away the cancer some some way or another they remove that demon is when that person comes out of the hospital bed of the operating room they're still the same person they still have the same habits they still have the same struggles or mannerism why is that so they've removed the cancer they removed that demon so that person can be totally set free he will only appear to those who are looking for him are you looking for him we gotta we gotta wait upon him no other esses that's the reason John saw the light and he's the only one that saw it Juan yo testimonial John bear record saying nobody else when Paul saw that same light struck him down so when Paul had that warrant on his way to Damascus he was on his way he wasn't alone but when that light came when Jesus Christ appeared to Paul the Bible in acts as different it says three different things they said that they saw the light but they couldn't hear the voice it says you can look for it and search it out but here the prophet is telling us the men that were surrounding Paul okay unable to see or hear the thing that were coming out of that light amen Brothers it's the same thing this morning God's word is being voiced the light is showing itself but the Lord is revealing himself to them to those that are looking for him they want more Revelation they understand that it's not just a simple Sunday it's a Sunday that maybe it could be my last Sunday anyone I want to grab onto that Revelation from God I want to be a better Christian I want to stop doing these things I want God to reveal to me the light is already here but we have to because it was not for them it was for Paul that's the only way that God reveals himself that he's always done it that way and always will so we see that after Paul encountered that light there wasn't a change in Paul yes his name was no longer saw but it was changed when you encounter that lie with the Lord Jesus Christ your name will not be changed laughs okay okay what what is what does it do mean the Lord changes my name from Luis Jose Luis to Jose Luis right when I came to Florida just an example or Stephen I'll still be the same person what's the point of changing my name from Luis to uh to Brian abroad I'm Brian what's the point but what we want is a change of nature he changed Abram to abrahamas it's a changing of a different nature yes Revelation and it's revelation so we began to notice that when we begin to walk in this Christian walk a person that just was newly converted to Christ we see that that person struggles is different than in comparison to a person that's been in the way for 30 years that person that just came to Christ what do they struggle with fiestas they struggle with friends parties and social media Costas the things that to them that are already in the message it's a that's baby stuff right so when that person begins to grow and they begin to walk in the Christian path the struggles in a certain way they become a bit lighter because in a certain way you now have Revelations on what to do and what not to do to look for and to who is and I hope you're understanding what I'm saying and you say well I don't have time if I go to a party of a family member that's not a Christian I know that I'm gonna eat I'm gonna be with him but when the party the dancing starts yeah you no longer start to struggle with those things you begin to now a battle against Spirits enticing spirits now you're dealing with fears that seem similar entonces so then they get even harder because now you have to meditate you have to wait you have to pray you can't just run and hopefully because those are now enticing Spirits that's why we find Brothers on the Wayside brothers that are getting cold because they thought it was God's word but in reality it was an enticing spirit a I'm an user one you love the Lord Brothers the Bible tells us those Spirits were deceived very elected if it was possible trying to get them out of God's word trying to get us out of the will of course because when you're LED of God's spirit where will God's spirit lead us to the word it won't just merely take you to the word it's not only just going to take you to the Bible but what it will do it will reveal it to you rejects the guidance of God's holy spirit he says the Holy Spirit lives and then an enticing Wicked Spirit comes and starts leading you foreign and you apply to God's foreign to that Revelation amen ah he says and you know there are some of the stuff that look and looks so absolutely true and yet isn't true he says see it looks like it is but it isn't it so what must we do okay what is the counselor what is it that uh the prophet says the prophet says in the message conferences for the orders and then they move I'll say it again [Music] of what you read foreign good to come to church and receive from God and then when the morning comes and you don't want to get up but then Revelation starts and you say no I have a revelation I go to church to hear God's word the Gates of Hell will not win over you it doesn't matter what comes you come anyway even the car is breaking down because it's a revelation my car isn't working please give me a ride I have to go it's a revelation because the Gates of Hell will not Prevail over me doesn't matter what happens it's a revelation the demo with those little tiny things is trying for you not to come when you it's revelation aura El perfecta now the prophet tells us that we must uh pray and wait upon God's orders because those two Spirits are very similar like like now the pillar of fire of the Holy Ghost that's leading us will take us to trials it will take us to the furnace it will take us to the lines to see what you will do foreign of God you truly love the Lord amen I want you to watch something is just how many of you can say amen God is just he's Fair he says do you believe that audience absolutely he's absolutely just and if God only requires one religion was just as just as able was Bueno this is just as just as Abel was Muchachos both those boys come before God Kane wasn't a communist he wasn't an infidelo an unbelievera he was UN a believer have you fastened your seatbelts on it the brother Adam says that in every Church there's three kinds of beliefs now what are they in unbeliever make believer and the believer there's three kinds the unbeliever he doesn't even believe he doesn't do anything the make-believer he's here and then he's out but the believer there's two that's what the prophet says you have the weeds and you have the tears that the wheat and The Tear they seem very similar my brains my brains blow out because the weeds has the grain the tears it looks very nice but when you open it it has nothing inside the unbeliever I'm not worried about him the make-believer I'm not worried about him but the believer is where we have to be careful he wasn't like the Russians he wasn't an infidelity he was not an unbelievable he was a Believer and if God only requires a believer he would be unjust to condemn Cain and if God only requires a Believer then God Is So then there's something else then just believing you love the Lord he says now this is going to make you tighten up your ecclesiastical vest just a little bit if you say I'm a Believer so was Cain he's the first one that comes to church I believe the words but he built a church very beautiful the Book of James says the Devils also believe in tremble and those is not just enough to just come to church we got to go a bit higher it's not only coming to church now come up hither did cane I worship the Lord From the Bottom of My Heart so did Cain e Kane was a Believer a worshiper and just as fundamentally right amen and brother Adam says amen oh I love this I pray God steam our hearts President says [Music] they were fundamentally and scripturally right so where does this different lie he says one of you is a devil maybe I would think that Peter was that devil because Peter was always messing up and he was always screwing up the mistakes Jesus one time when he said to Peter depart from me the one that disciples Peter was that devil and Judas maybe it didn't uh it didn't even cross their minds because Judas would also pray for this but also cast out demons he would also preach like Jesus did but Peter had mistakes [Music] the Bible says that the the tares will be bundled up first of all then when the weed is taken out Anton says yeah very similar to each other maybe it never crossed their minds that it was actually Judas I don't know how old Judas was President says they were very alike cuando Jesus when Jesus was nailed the prophet says there was not three crosses what there were four crosses who was the fourth one is that in the Bible it said it was Judas Judas hung himself on a tree it was four okay Jesus and Judas is those two Spirits have been from Genesis up until now they're so similar to each other both believe God's word both were faithful members but when the time came to serve God when the worshiper God came okay what happened then he brought everything just as religious as able but look here's a little something I think I made it so look in the days of Cain and Abel notice Cain was just as religious as Abel was when he worshiped he builds his altars he made it pretty just like a fine big church he wasn't an unbeliever he bowed down in worshiped and God absolutely refused him foreign he made a sacrifice and done obligations that Worship the Lord that's a pretty good church member today and God refused them but look here coming here at Abel coming here not with working he didn't come with words that faith our works expressed but able to understand that we're not saved by words but if you have Revelations then that will produce words but the Revelation is behind those works the prophet says he says he tied the little sheep around the neck a little Grapevine yeah [Music] foreign he began to be his throw yes it's because Abel had a revelation the brother Adam says he says we're letting that soak just a minute it was a revelation what was the difference between Cain and Abel the revelation it begins the blood was covering April and then that's when God came down and God refused them and came was Wrath read the messages but only God's children are led by the spirit of God yes and it's by revelation he had a revelation yes and that's what pleased God please stand if the musicians the prophet says and the message is the Masterpiece he says that when he saw that vision and he saw the different churches passing and then he says when it came to the last one that's what he says to the last one he says then I turn to the right and he showed me every Church of the times of centuries the ages and the last one was this last Church age of these last days [Music] they were being led foreign by who brother random says by a witch is in a gray clothing just a paper not even clothing just some kind of paper Greece that was great which gray means deceiving and then the prophet says next and he and he heard enciente here comes the American group aquiven el Grupo Americano and when they were coming out the leader or their guide was a witch with a very long nose nose and a big mouth [Music] is the worldwide Council of churches because those two Spirits are so similar we're reaching at the end time we don't even know what is what anymore we're just waiting for the coming of the Lord but we have to go to the words go to the message what must I do because lord it's not just me I have my wife I have my children that I'm leading if I get lost but Lord I carry the responsibility of my family is something that's [Music] a demon you know may God help us may God reveal his word to us may God have mercy and me on me and on every one of us we love the Lord [Music]
