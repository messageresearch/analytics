every sunday every wednesday every friday and whatever need we have i greet you all in the precious name of our lord jesus christ it's always such a blessing to be here in his presence amen i would love to go straight to the scriptures if you would like to turn with me to exodus 20 verse five and six and whenever you have it just go ahead and say amen [Music] [Music] exodus 20 verse 5 and 6. exodus amen and it says you shall not bow down yourself bow down yourself to them nor serve them for i the lord your god and i'm a jealous god visiting the iniquity of of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me not inclined wow what a powerful thing god says i'll visit them and all the way to the third and fourth generations but then verse 6 says this is where our promise lies and showing mercy to thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments iago misericordia amigares alos to those that love me and keep my commandments amen let us bow our heads it's only by your grace we are here this morning father you pour your holy spirit down and you preach your word father that we may receive something from you lord we submit ourselves unto your holy spirit obedient to you this morning we want to give you the glory and the honor of the gloria la hondra the name of jesus christ we pray in the number of christian amen and amen amen amen you may be seated if you would like to turn with me to first peter 2 9. the bible says [Music] but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of the darkness into his marvelous light exodus 20 is showing us something that god deals with his people through generations he dealt through adam's generations he dealt with abraham and his seed that would follow after him he even dealt with the serpent's generation or the serpent seeds but today he gives us a great promise there's a chosen generation that god has seen throughout no matter what last name we have no importa every single person can go into this chosen generation so when i talk about generations the bible says you are a peculiar people when god spoke to abraham he said you and your lineage i'm going to bless and god blessed them throughout the ages and throughout the dispensations inherited or inherit character significa or equality or just disposition through the inheritance amen amen a strain that's passed down now i'm going to try to take my time and just trust that the lord can bless us and give us what we need now we know what genes are we pass them throughout our family the father the mother get together and they have a child and the child has both mother and father's genes the word genes comes from the greek word genos and that's the same greek word so what is what is god saying whenever he calls his people a chosen generation he said you are a chosen race of people you are a chosen people with a certain gene in them you are a chosen generation and so we see throughout the whole entire bible that the the devil has tried to attack the seed or the gene of god we see the battle of the seeds saw that the daughters of men the daughters of cain the daughters of the serpent were fair and they begin to mix the genes or mix the seeds see god deals with generations god deals with people through their jeans genes the bible says he was of that wicked one and because of that he could never please the lord and he would continue to do evil in god's sight he was of the wicked one so god he blesses and he curses through generations that's that's what he said he said i will visit all the way to the third and fourth generation of those that hate me it is but those that love me and my commandments i will bless all down to the thousand generations so he goes and he blesses through generations and just as god blesses and curses through generations now if we go back to this present time go forward to this present time this generation is the worst generation we've seen because over generations and generations and generations all the way down coming down to this generation behind they don't even know where they come from anymore in the in the 1900s or the beginning of those 1900s 19 or when brother branham was here [Music] they have completely rejected christ not just the message but they don't want nothing to do with christ or or anything to do with christianity or el christianismo they don't know who they are they don't know if they're male or female they are going back straight to the mud regression to where there is there is nothing that it's a gray generation many times brother pranam called uh the age that he was in a neurotic age muchas versus is neurotic why would he call people neurotic neurotic is is emotionally unstable neurotic emotional establishment juvenile delinquency he said it's parent delinquency some mothers have got away from their duties they want to run into the bar rooms and carry on and run all night and leave their children grow up no wonder they grow up in that neurotic age why because from generation to generation to generations we pass down those genes we passed down those characteristics and that generation will not stay the same as the one before yes this is what brother branham says i'm gonna quote a lot of um of my quotes from the message why are we not a denomination he says listen you young people today i don't know whether you come to this church or where you come from you young boys and girls did you realize the things that you are doing if there's another generation your children will be judged for what you do he says haven't you have no respect of decency you girls out there wearing those little old shorts and things around you know that's reflected on your daughter us did you know your grand mommy was a flapper and that's the reason you're a strip tease today yes yes sir god said he would visit the iniquity of the parents upon the children and their children to the three third and fourth generations so how i started to think when i read this condolences if the word says that i inherited a or adam's sin i inherited the sin of my father adam then i've inherited every single other person that's in my lineage i've inherited their sin also we are born there's a reason why jesus says you must you must be born again because we've inherited the dna of our fathers and our great great grandfathers and our great great grandfathers you know when i was younger i was whoever did way back hundreds of years it's coded into my dna it's coded into my genes oh well my my great great great great grandfather is pancho villa oh man you better be careful brother it's something to brag about but when you're a christian we have to be careful we need to brother branham said you know that he was a neurotic person he was a neurotic person he he said he had he had a temper once somebody called him a preacher and he was ready to to um knock him out now he says this is my father is strictly irishman my mother is harvey um only her her father married a cherokee indian my mother is harvey solomon and that broke the little line of the blood of irish yes and father and mother did not go to church this is the family he our prophet is now he said they didn't go to church they married out of a church and um they had no religion at all foreign back there in the mountains there was not even a catholic church so they come over in the early settlers two branhams come over entonces and sprung up the whole generation of branhams this the genealogy of the family is then he says in the message he careth for you i'm nervous i'm a nervous and upset person personally which would actually by birth make me he's he's not what god had him to do because of his bloodline but something had to happen to to awaken the siege gene of god because there was a gene of god before the foundation of the world that was but with the genealogy of the brahms he could not do that so sin and complexes are carried out through the generations depending on the life we live depending on that depending on what we do is passed down through generations that's why we see in the last day people with diabetes and with heart prone to heart attacks and strokes because all the good food we eat it's because all the the living we do all the whatever they lived back then well let's see what brother branham says branham i'm going to read a lot of quotes just so we can see what brother branham says he said and sickness is caused by sin it makes it very simple for us simplification that's right before we had before we had sin we had no sickness but sin or sickness is an attribute of sin pero el sickness came because sin maybe not what you've done but inherited it then he says in the message by in the message he swore by himself so what is the head and a cause of all that that were here this morning what's the head of all of it what made all the sickness and and sin and disgrace see before you had any sense sickness is an attribute you don't have no in other words in something it's something that come out of sin he begins to explain certain things here is where do we get our worries from amen amen he said no worries no nothing no no old age this it was perfect well what caused it was sin s-i-n then sickness followed sin broken homes attributes and moral livings and all those things followed sin if you kill sin now you've got to kill the attributes so sin sin sickness and sorrows broken homes all those things follow sin those are attributes of sin so you have to cut it at it's the source you can't fool with sin unless you're fooling with this and you fall in this the result already it's not just something that whenever we sin it just doesn't mean oh you sin now you're on the way to judgment or hell no significa that is the case because we break the law we have to face judgment but it's that it's just not a future tense of hell and judgment noise sickness sorrows broken homes the generations brother branham says this is you think cancer is something the bible said there is something there is a coming time when men will rot right in their flesh and buzzards will eat off of their carcasses before they even die cancer is a toothache to what is coming it's not the almighty hand of god causing these plagues of people but it's the sin and when the sin is here just like it is in this generation and it's going to be a greater sickness than we've ever seen that's why brother branham said itself within the dna of the people so when we're born were born in sickness and sorrows and sins that's what happens amen so it's now uh we we hear many times now there's a generation called baby boomers there's uh there's ones before that was called the greatest generation that was then you heard the baby boom generation or the baby boomers then generation x then millennials and then we all know gen z or generation z and you know when i'm working especially i used to work at a um at the mines but their work so the baby boomers they would say lost oh your generation is nothing but weaklings so the baby boomers would blame the genera generation blames the millennials for the the decline of their generation and now millennials are blaming gen z for the the decline of this generation now hour loss millennials uh women that don't do this or don't do that but brother where does the responsibility lie but responsibility the responsibility lies always to make sure the group of people or the group the next group of people are better off than they are uh so that generation can be passed on and passed on and passed on but there's a letting go somewhere in every single generation to where every generation will let go of something let go of christianity let go of god one way or another they wonder why why he was going to visit the iniquity of the fathers none of the next generation the sin we see now of the fathers he said i'm going to visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation that hate me but just as the generations they degrade or they decline in this world we see entonces a no letting down know nothing serve the lord now in second timothy 1 5. you have paul talking to timothy second timothy 1 5 whenever you have it just go ahead and say amen he says elisa when i recall when i called to remembrance the unfade faith that is in thee so that faith where is it it's in timothy which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i generations and generations of the fathers and the mothers down to the children by default it has nothing to do with them being born again it was passed down to her daughter timothy still needed his own experience but how beautiful whatever he's raised in a righteous home also how brother branham said that or how the the word says that levi paid tithes through abraham that's beautiful he didn't only pay ties but his descendants also brother branham says this eston he says do you realize my brother that every time you do that which is right it'll be visited on your children let's take hebrews the seventh chapter the bible said when melchizedek met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him and it said now levi he's talking about paying tithes he said levi had an order from the lord to receive tithes from his brethren because and levi who received tithes paid ties for he was yet in the loins of abraham when he met melchizedek received and abraham was his great grandfather abraham begot isaac isaac begat jacob and jacob begot levi abrams levi father grandfather great grandfather levi abuelo well and while levi was in the loins of abraham the bible said he paid tithes hallelujah now he we skipped to the next paragraph and he says now the bible didn't say he potentially paid he potentially he paid it [Music] the bible said he paid tithes when he was in a great his great grandfather's loin glory gloria now that's my lord oh he knowed even he noted even before the world was even formed he knowed everything and in abraham he paid ties that's beautiful so so now the actions of the fathers and the mothers affect the actions of the children affect the position of the children now now does this now we got to remember that brother branham didn't have a great lineage but whenever god can bless allenians it makes it easier for the children to turn to the lord why because the actions of the fathers and the mothers now there's a study that these uh the scientists have been discovered it's called epigenetics and epi means above genetics so we have our dna and we have our dna from our mother and our father and they they realize that your dna cannot be changed once your dna is it that's what it is so you have the dna of your father and you have the dna of your mother and then then you're born but they realize uh they discovered something tremendous it's called epigenetics to where your dna will not change but by the life that you live what you eat what you do the environment around you and your habits is but it changes the expression of the dna so you have strands in that dna and by the way you live yeah you can turn on and turn off different types of strands in your dna now that is tremendous because by the way we live brother branham his generations and his genes were were uh full of terrible people he said so that whenever he he had billy and he had joseph and he had rebecca and sarah abelia they were young well children the dna of being uh drunkards and and bunch of neurotics and sometimes we attach ourselves with our last name like oh man it's a cape of a superman cape all i'm doing is carrying that bloodline that would trace his back all the way to adam but it's it's the way i live if there was a family that abandoned you unfamiliar my dad and my grandpa and so and so all they were all like that and that's why i'm like this oh no we're we're stubborn by nature oh and we carry it we carry the stubbornness oh it runs in my family familia i'm this i'm so it doesn't have to be passed down to your children by receiving the holy ghost oh they were a bunch of adulterers all the way to me well you can they won't carry that that genetic gene or they will carry it but it'll be turned off because of the life you live it's a i i thank god for this grace because scientists are barely figuring out what god what god already knew from the beginning remember when whenever uh uh jacob's father-in-law whenever they made the deal and he said you know what i'll take the speckled and you take the solid colored ones uh goat would go and drink the water academy they changed their environment and whenever the goats begin to have more baby goats baby kids those goats begin to be spotted just like the other ones what was it changing the expression of the dna expression god has been doing this from the beginning creating and breaking cycles of generations you know one of the greatest ages that i see in the bible was the age when joshua took the children of israel on the other side to the canaan land for me that was one of the greatest generations you don't hear much of that generation finally they they've heard of the milk and honey they've heard of the goodness and now they are partaking in it this was the generation that walked out of the 40 years they saw the red sea open they saw they saw the the jordan river open they saw the giants fall to their feet they saw the great meteorites fall down and and kill every enemy that they have but if you'd like to turn with me to judges for me this is one of the greatest generations one of the greatest years that we see in the bible now this is joshua just passed away it says the joshua joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being a hundred and ten years old sir it says they buried him in the border border of his inheritance in the tim mathuras in the mount of uh ephraim on the on the north side of the hill of gash now listen to this part and also all that generation were gathered to their fathers and they there arose another generation after him which knew not the lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel via something happened after those that generation passed away one of the greatest generations in the bible they saw god fulfill his promise completely the baby boomers will blame millennials for how bad the generation is what happened to where they stopped listening to the word of the lord to where they kept saying come here son come here daughter let me tell you how it was when the jordan river opened up let me tell you how god saved me let me tell you how god gave me the holy ghost let me tell you how i saw joshua say sun stance and the sun stood still something foul something the the bars were dropped down somewhere algo de cayo in algon lugar to where the next generation they didn't know anything about the lord they didn't know something that really i wonder about what happened to the next generation to where they began they stopped preaching the words they stopped telling them of the works of god it was easy for the other generation to serve them because they saw brother bran or they saw joshua josue they saw the pillar of fire see the discernment of brother branagh they didn't see all those wonderful works and every generation someone drops the ball somebody lets the bars just the word but what happened there was a break in the cycle of generations through them to a 400-year loss the bible says [Applause] [Music] and we see that cycle all through the book of judges that's that's what happens when what we do with our generation now what i want to really go into before we close the terminal is the bible always says that the woman represents a church uh second adam and his bride the same commission he told the bride to multiply multiplication he told her to multiply and replenish the now this is what brother branham says and why we are not a denomination now what is she say w h o r e a something now who's who's brother man i'm talking to you i'm talking about the quinable branhams talking about the catholic church he says she begotten something a same thing as a w-h-o-r-e a moral woman asi como la misma costa that the bible talks about in revelation it says what made her immoral he says her doctrine what made her immoral her doctrine she was predented pretending to be a christian church but she was giving out man-made dogma pretending that's what made her commit adultery what's the act the doctrine by that false doctrine she bore children that's what made her immoral and that's what makes her a mother by her false doctrine and she bears children through it amen brother branham says on why we are not a denomination now there isn't a woman an honorary woman that is in this town but what could bring forth a virgin daughter existed she is when she is born now she can go her mother has been of that nature that girl nine times out of ten will act just exactly like her mother does this now you know that's right brother brethren says an old woman that runs out runs a house of ill fame could bring forth a bring forth a little girl she could be 16 years old just as clean and as moral as a lily says but if she remains that way but the thing is she does she goes right back and acts like her mother so it's how a church or raises the children and how do the children or how is the consummation of the the marriage how does it work it's because she picked up a false doctrine and what happens she begins to bear children through that false doctrine no matter how good that child is brother branham says nine times out of ten will go back to what the mother is versus that's why it's so important to stay with the word of the lord stay with the original doctrine of the lord it shouldn't be it shouldn't be well my church has this doctrine and this church has this doctrine no this church has the word of the lord [Music] [Applause] it will not bring forth more harlots it will not bring forth more people that are passed down with with the nature of that woman it will be children of god amen now in closing brother branham this is in the ephesian church age um the church age book is now this is a long quote i pray that you bear with me he says nevertheless i have somewhat against thee revelations 2 4 the spirit or jesus christ is talking to the ephesian church he says because thou has left the first love to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of ephesus alone this message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years it's message then oh man that just hit me hard so the ladies the lady will see a church age god wasn't just talking in brother branham's time where he says why because she has uh dropped uh he she's got herself naked she's left the word amen amen it's a message then and is all to generations in that span now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of israel we see a revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next quest in the third generations embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestige whatsoever in the of that original flame it is simply the manifestation of the truth that god has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth you start out truly with born-again believers and then the next generation comes along and they are no longer just plain christians but they have taken a denominational name now they are baptist methodists etc etc that is what exactly what they are to do what you have to be born of the will of god and not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together now with the will of man i don't say that some of them aren't right with god not for a minute but i do say but the original fire has died down they are not the same anymore now we know churches bear children now i would love to allow us to wander and think what children are we bearing what children you know when there's a child of god that gives their heart to the lord they're justified the process of justification sanctification and baptism of the holy ghost is that the child is still in the womb water blood spirit and that child is in the process of being born so there's children they they did the study of epigenetics the ladies that went through the traumatic experience of 9 11. they got these women that went through this traumatic experience and they saw how they had ptsd they had stress they had a lot of traumas in their life because of that de trauma the same exact problems the same exact stresses as the mother that went through that traumatic experience experienced the traumatic why through epigenetics she expressed her dna a certain way and it was passed down to her children and the way that the church is the bride of jesus christ it is the way whenever children are being born of god through them those children are going to be born with those same things why those spiritual genetics pass down through that church is things where they let the bars down all those poor children that are being borne of god are receiving that thinking it's okay as the bride of jesus christ the children of a god will be born you know the devil in closing if you'd like to stand with me you know the devil tried to hit the seed in abraham's time and gave its time why because he remembered the promise god gave him he said there was going to be a siege that was going to stomp on his head he was going to destroy the devil's works so he tried to break down those generations but when jesus was born he wasn't born of the flesh of abraham or the blood of mary el nacio de la carne de abram or de la sangre de maria he broke that bloodline it was the blood of god he died for my father's sins he died for all my sins all the way down to adam he broke the head of the saiyans he crushed him and then whenever he re we receive the holy ghost we don't receive somebody else's blood we receive god's spirit we become children of every single person that is born again of his spirit my uncle well he was a pastor also no once i'm born again then i go into the eternal generation where god had his thoughts on me before the foundation of the world it doesn't matter because now i'm in the bloodline of jesus christ and now whenever we raise our children we're raising them with the holy that they won't take my bloodline anymore lord we accept you this morning parents complexes so i don't have to stay a victim of the abuse of my life lord that i don't have to say well because they were this i am this foreign i can accept your blood lord i can accept your righteousness that those habits that were passed down from generations that are holding them down that you break it down and take it down and give them your spirit lord jesus amen and amen amen amen amen [Music] above all power above all kings above all nature and all created things [Music] and you were here before the
