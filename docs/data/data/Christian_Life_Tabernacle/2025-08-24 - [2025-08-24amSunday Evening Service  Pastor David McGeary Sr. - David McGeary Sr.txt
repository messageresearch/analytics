We want to sing a uh this song in uh thanksgiving to our Lord because he's been so great and so wonderful. He has helped us through all the journey and uh you know we may achieve a lot of things in in this world right a lot of good things but there is one thing greater than anything that we can achieve in this life.

I know brother Billy son Billy Jr. has been having some trouble breathing and we want to keep him in prayer. He's got to take him to the emergency room after service tonight. Keep that in prayer. And we don't have anything else. So, if you have anything on your heart that you came into the house of the Lord with and you want to make it known to him by the uplifting of your hands, please do so and trust that the Lord sees and he cares. He truly does care. Brother Mark David, if you want to come take these knees before the church and brothers that are taking the tithes and offerings, if they could please come up. [Music] [Music] Let us bow our heads. Our most gracious heavenly father, we are here once again, oh Lord Jesus Christ, to offer, Lord, our sacrifices of praise, oh Lord, to worship you, to thank you for everything you've done for us, oh Lord, if not for grace, oh Lord, where would we be? But blessed heavenly father, today you've known today before the foundation of the world that we will be here, Lord Jesus Christ, oh Lord, just to lift up our hands and to lift up our voice, oh Lord, and to hear, Lord Jesus Christ, from the throne of grace. Blessed heavenly father, we thank you once again. We bless your holy name, oh Lord Jesus Christ. We're here, oh Lord, God of heaven. May we hear from our theophony once again, oh Lord. You've been trying to get us in the right place just for us to understand what the vision is, where we need to go, where we need to be. Lord God of heaven, we just pray, Lord God, may that, oh Lord Jesus Christ, may it be clear to each and every one of us, oh Lord. And not just clear, Lord Jesus, but may you give us the power, Lord Jesus, to tread in that path that you've made for us, oh Lord. That's our heart desire. That's everything we ever desired. more than silver, more than gold, more than anything we can ever achieve in this world. Lord, that at the end of it all, Lord Jesus Christ, it would be worth it. Oh Lord, blessed be your holy name, oh Lord. We commit the offering, oh Lord Jesus, to your hand and the prayer request, oh Lord. God of heaven, there is nothing too big for you. There's nothing you cannot do. There's nothing man can bring before you that is too hard for our God to do. Lord God of heaven, we know Lord Jesus Christ just by your saints, oh Lord, making that request that you would meet them at the point of their needs. Oh Lord, that's what we ask for this evening. Lord Jesus, commit the offering to your hands once again. Oh Lord, may be used for the f for f forance of the kingdom. Oh Lord, thank you everlasting father. When we leave here today, oh Lord Jesus, may we go back home joy in our heart knowing Lord Jesus that we've heard from our theophony once again. Lord, thank you blessed heavenly father for we ask this in the name of our lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] Let's just sing this. [Music] Oh, it's greater than all I see. Is the blood that still cleanses me. It's the grace that still sets me free. and to praise him. [Music] Oh, I know that the Lord [Music] are walking through life. I cannot fall for is greater than all. The blood of the lamb greater than all my sin. Oh, gater than all I see. is the blood that still cleanses me. It's the grace that still set me free and to praise him. [Music] I know that the [Music] are you [Music] can not fall for is greater than all the blood Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With the sermon brother David preached this morning. This song was on my heart. I I I believe it's in scene. He is here. Hallelu. He is here. Amen. He is here. Holy, holy, I will bless his name again. Oh, and he is here. Listen closely. Hear him calling out your name. He is here. You keep touching. You will never be this. Let's sing it again as our prayer. Let's stand. He is here. Hallelujah. [Music] He is here. Amen. He is here. Holy, holy, I his name is here. [Music] He calling out your name. He is here. You can touch him. You will never be the same. Sing it again as we &gt;&gt; pass. [Music] Amen. He is here. Holy, holy, I have his holy name. He kissing closely near him calling out your name. He is here. You can touch on him, you will never be. Father, that's why we've gathered tonight, we gather under a promise, Lord, that wherever two or three are gathered together in my name, Lord. You promised that you would be there. Father, may we have Isa that we can recognize your presence. Father, may we have courage to lay at your feet and ask you of what that we have need of. Father, Lord, may we worship you and give you the honor and glory that you deserve. We ask you to bless us this evening as we fellowship around the great things that you're doing in our lives. We're grateful for them, Father. We ask you to continue to be merciful to us to shed your kindness and your grace upon us, Father. And we trust that we will always give you thanks. We ask these things in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's just open to a scripture this evening. And uh and uh uh one found in uh Mark the 16th chapter and the 15th 16th 7th 18th verse of this. I'm sure you all have this memorized, but uh you'll see how it fits in this evening. It says, "For he said unto them, go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. And they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Our gracious heavenly father, we ask you to bless your word to us this evening. In Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. May you may be seated. I I certainly enjoyed the uh specials and the harmony and the and the singing of the two specials. I thought that was uh really wonderful. We had a musician's practice uh this last weekend and and uh we've got lots of uh talent and lots of different instruments and things and we're going to slowly incorporate them in uh as we prepare the sound and get everything to have it and get the uh levels of sound all worked out. So uh um we just keep doing those things. We'll probably have to make the platform a little bigger. Never thought this platform wouldn't be big enough, but uh we'll do what we can. Amen. So we talked this morning and uh out of the message in his presence and we realized that uh we noticed certain things about uh the presence of God and uh we knew found out that it always had a great effect that people that come in to his presence there's just a holy hush about the presence. The presence of God causes things to happen and something always happens in the presence of God. And uh he said when man's conscious that he's in the presence of God, he feels very little. And uh he he realizes that he's a a a sinner. And uh uh and so we we listened to a little bit this morning of the effect that the presence of God has on a believer. So we realize there's an effect that when you come into the presence of God, we found that the presence of God takes control over the whole circumstance. &gt;&gt; When his presence is there, everything else stops. There's not another voice. There's not another answer. Uh you it's time to listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The presence of God is there. There's there's there everything bows to that presence. It it's the it it is it becomes the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; The presence of God does. Now we want to listen to a portion this evening of and it starts to lean to the fact that through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ we are now able to come into his presence. The the on the Mount Si they said if God speaks to us we will surely die. Let Moses speak to us. That was the first time that man recognized that they needed a mediator between God and man. And they was promised that God would send us a prophet like it unto Moses. And then we had that prophet come and and the Lord Jesus Christ, the lamb of God, which paid the price for our sins and allows us to enter in to his presence. Now, we're going to listen to the responsibility of the believer who comes into the presence of God. And so there's uh we just want to uh make sure that uh we pick up on some of these things. Something like this. He says, "Look at the little lady. She couldn't stay no longer. She went into the city and told the men, "Come see the man that told me the things I've done." Isn't this the Messiah? They could not deny it because it was scripturally certain. Yes, you've got to do it. a man when he's got a responsibility of telling others as Moses did, as Peter did, as Paul did. And after these things, if you've seen it and come into his presence, you're responsible for the message to get it to somebody else. You just can't sit still with it. You must take it to someone else. Let's listen as he expounds upon that and and we see what it is that we want to be. We want to be people full of his presence in his presence have the effect of that presence on our lives and to share that presence with others. Lord bless you. This is just uh it just take a few minutes. I think we maybe have about 40 minutes left of the tape, but I think you'll certainly enjoy it. It's full of nuggets. I mean, it's just full of wonderful little uh nuggets and sayings and understandings, and you reach out and grab a hold of something for your life that that you can take with you uh in your life's journey. And when you put these building blocks in your life, you'll find out there will come a time in your life when you're glad they're there, that you can pull them out of your heart because you've written them upon your heart and then they become your defense in the time of battle. So Lord bless you as we listen to our messenger continue uh this evening. And I think we're going to start right at paragraph uh 37, I believe, and uh start at the top of paragraph 37 and continue uh from there. He says some people will will stand off. Let's let's listen. I think you'll enjoy it tonight. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Make fun of it. Some will laugh at it. Some will call it fanaticism. Some call it mental telepathy. Some call it &gt;&gt; be elimub. &gt;&gt; Some call it one thing or another. &gt;&gt; As the old proverbs say is fools will walk with hobb shoes where angels prayer to try. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The fool has said in his heart there is no God. When he sees God manifested so perfectly by his own word, not by a creed but by his word and then walk right over it and make fun of it, he's a fool. Because as God is the word and God's made himself plain to him &gt;&gt; and he's a fool, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; what will it be for him when he has to stand in that place? It'll be a it'll be terrible for that man in that day, the ungodly. Repented sinners, old doesn't have any fear. Oh no. A sinner that will repent, he knows that there's a bloody sacrifice waiting and standing his way. That's what gives me the consolation. &gt;&gt; I've seen the glory of God. I've felt his power. I know the touch of his hand. I know the touch of his chastisement. I know that he's God. And I know I'm undone. But there's one standing there firing. &gt;&gt; There's one that stands there and says, "Father, lay all of his iniquity upon me because he stood for me down on the earth." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then I walk to the throne of God boldly having grace in my heart that know it's not by good works but by his mercy I'm saved. Not what I could do, what I could join, what I could say. But it's by his grace that he saved me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go the poet that caught that scream. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved the rest like me. Once was lost, but now I'm found. Blind, but now I see. &gt;&gt; How can I ever go to heaven? How could you go to heaven? We cannot do it. We need no way for us to do it. But there's one made the way. &gt;&gt; And he is the way. &gt;&gt; And how do we get to him? By one spirit, his spirit. We're baptized into one body which will be raised up like an orbit. We'll go out of the earth &gt;&gt; as astronauts of this last day of faith. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Sure. Repented sinners don't have to worry. Someone is there in their place. Oh, then after we have come into his presence now &gt;&gt; and we are know we've been in his presence. We've seen do things that he did when he was here on earth. &gt;&gt; How do you know that? How do you know the vine you're looking at? Because of fruit it bears. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you know the church you're going to by the fruit it bear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also." &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we see he never did ordain us to go make denominations. &gt;&gt; He never did ordain us to go make creeds but he warned us against such. &gt;&gt; For whosoever shall take anything from it or add anything to it, the same will be taken out of their part in the book of life. &gt;&gt; So we're not ordained to do nothing but stay with that word. &gt;&gt; And if a man is stand of God, he'll stay with the word because God can only stand by his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay by his word. Then when we come into his presence, when a man once comes into the presence of God, he's changed forever. &gt;&gt; If there's any change in doing &gt;&gt; now, there are those who can walk in the presence of God and pay no attention to it. He wasn't ordained to life. But if he was predestinated of God, as soon as that first move hits, he knows it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That catches fire. Look at that little prostitute down there that day. at Samaria. That woman, she's in a bad shape mentally and physically. We know that. But as soon as she's seen that sign done of Messiah, she said, "We know Messiah's coming to do this. &gt;&gt; Thou must be his prophet." He said, "I'm that Messiah that was wrote to come." She recognized it. She never asked one more question. She started right quick with the responsibility to know that if she had found that and come into the presence of God, she was responsible to tell somebody else about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Any man that comes into the presence of God is responsible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before God from that minute on to tell somebody else, &gt;&gt; look at Abraham. Look at Moses. Look at Peter. Look at Paul. The moment they come into the presence of God, recognize themselves sinners, and seal their testimony with their life. Look at the little lady. She couldn't stay no longer. She went to the city and told the man, "Come see the man that told me the things I've done. Isn't this Messiah?" &gt;&gt; They could not deny it because it was scriptural. Certainly. Yes. They've got to do it. And man, when we got a responsibility of telling others as Moses did, as Peter did, as Paul did, after these things, you've seen it and come into his presence, you're responsible for the message to get to somebody else. You just cannot sit still with it. &gt;&gt; You must take it to someone else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember an old sister used to be your brother Grimstein's mother. She used to sit right here in the church and she would sing, "I've just got over. I'm running running. I just got over and I can't sit down." She had just found something. I went over to a little colored church over here and lo and all of them stand up saying I'm running up the king's highway just found it and tuck up the highway. There's something about it. When you find Christ, you cannot hold your peace any longer. The rest of your days you are a changed person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For when life and life comes together, it makes a bright light. &gt;&gt; True. When the bulb connects with the wires, if it's a correct bulb, it's got to give light. &gt;&gt; When the current and the bulb gets together, there's nothing to do but scatter light. &gt;&gt; It has to do it. &gt;&gt; And when a man or a woman is predestinated to eternal life and they see the current of God catch that bub, it'll throw light everywhere it can. &gt;&gt; It might not be over a 10 watt, but you'll scatter what life you got. You're in a 500 watt scatter 10 watt light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give your light. Let your light so shine before man that they might see your good works and glorify the father which is in heaven. Yes, sir. When a man comes in contact with God, he recognizes himself no good. How can a man walk around brag about how big he is and what all he's done when he's nothing? &gt;&gt; He's nothing to begin with. One day down in Memphis, Tennessee, one I don't think it's Memphis is one of the places there. I was with brother Davis is having a a revival. It might have been Memphis. And we was went to a coliseum and they had a in there the not a coliseum, it's kind of a art gallery. And they had the great statues that they' got from different parts of the earth of different Hercules and so forth and great artists that painted and then they had the analysis of a man that weighed 150 pounds. You know how much he's worth? 84 cents. That's all he is. 84 cents is all he all the chemicals you can get out of him. He's just got enough white wash to sprinkle a hen's nest and he's got enough of just a little bit of calcium, little pash. It would all sell for 84 cents. But we just take care of that 84 cents and baby it around. There's two boys stand there and one looked at him and said, "Jim, we're not worth very much, are we?" He said, "No, we're not, John." I said, "Well, wait a minute, boys. You got a soul in there. It's worth 10,000 words. &gt;&gt; That's been could be redeemed by the power of God if you just let it. Man, when he sees these things, he's responsible to tell others. &gt;&gt; I saw it when I was just a boy. I spent my whole life at it. I only saw I got one life. Wish I had 10,000. If I had an eternity, I'd still want to tell people about it because it's the greatest thing I ever found. &gt;&gt; If you'll read in Ezekiel 33, 33rd chapter of Ezekiel, there was a watchman set on a tower. And this watchman was responsible &gt;&gt; for the entire city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, wake yourselves to your spiritual conscience a minute while I get to this scripture. That watchman had to be a trained man. &gt;&gt; He had to know what he was doing. &gt;&gt; For at any distance, as soon as it arose, the enemy, he could detect it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He could tell their march. Amen. &gt;&gt; He could tell their color. &gt;&gt; He could tell their rank and file. &gt;&gt; Just as far as the human eyes could see, he could see it. And he was higher than the rest of them. &gt;&gt; For he was trained to know the enemy. And God required the whole city at his hand. &gt;&gt; Watchmen for the night. Hallelujah. That's the way God's soldiers are today. &gt;&gt; They're trained to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; When anything concepts got a little polish to it that's got something else that's not scripture, they warn the congregation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anything that's not Bible, anything that's not it's not godlike. Such as having soup suppers, dances, and everything else to pay off the pastors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those things are wrong. Bo games and card parties in the churches. That's wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the real watchman on the wall who's once been in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he isn't on the wall, if he just to be on the wall, the wall may not be any higher than the rest of the congregation. &gt;&gt; But if he's a correct watchman, God raises it pull up into spheres that the rest of them never gets to. &gt;&gt; But he watches the flock &gt;&gt; and God requires it of him. The man of God who stands in the presence of God and knows God is God and know that God keeps his word and watch God perform himself and do his duty and keep his word. Then no matter how many organizations or denomination cause to tear it down, he knows the rank and file of the enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows what to tell the congregation. A real watchman. If we have confessed that he is in we've been in his presence and we have confessed our sins, they are blotted out the book of his memory. Now there's nobody but God could do that. &gt;&gt; Now you can do anything to me. I'll forgive you but I'll remember. &gt;&gt; If I do anything to you, you forgive me, but you'll remember it. But God can forgive and forget it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of that. &gt;&gt; Don't even remember it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That makes me feel good. &gt;&gt; When it's not even remembered anymore, nothing can do it but God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Nothing but God can do that. &gt;&gt; He said he would blot it out of his book of memory. &gt;&gt; I can't do it. You can't do it because we've only got these little finite senses. But he's infinite God. He can absolutely forget that it ever was done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; A young lady come from a country church and her father was an oldfashioned shouting preacher or member of the church. And so she moved into the city and she got all mixed up with the women down there. Got to acting like they did and the fashions. And one day she's kind of shamed for her papa and mama to come or a father rather. Her mother was dead. So the old man only thing to do get up in the morning, eat his breakfast and get the Bible and read it and cry and pray and shout all day long and up and down the roof. And she was a little embarrassed about it. So then then when all time through the night if he got a hold of the Bible and started reading it, get raised up out of the Ben heart. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Just stomping cry half the night. So one day she's going to entertain her church members to a little tea party like they always have, you know. So she didn't know what she's going to do with her dad. After all, it was her daddy. So she decided she put him up in an attic and say, "Daddy, you don't want to be around where these women are, do you?" "Oh, I don't believe I want to do that." He said, "Well, we're going to have the church women up here today and we're going to have a little meeting, a little prayer meeting. So I I tell you, Dad, why don't you just go up and add him?" Said, "I just believe I'll do that." So she said, "Read this nice book." And she gave him a geography, took his Bible away from him so he keep quiet. So know if he read the Bible, well, he would go to making a lot of noise up there. So he's right up over, you know, where he's having their party. So she gave him a jog and he said, "This is nice. You should read it, daddy, because it tells you all the truth about the word." Well, he said, "I'll be glad to read that." So he said, "Now you go up there and keep real quiet till these women leave and then I'll you come back down and then you can do whatever you want to." He agreed to do it. So he goes upstairs, sets up there, and they're all having their tea party, you know, talking about so and so and you know how it goes. Having all that big time about that time, something cut loose upstairs. All the screaming and jumping and the plaster falling. The old man running up and down through the attic just as hard as he could go, jumping up and down. Glory to God. Glory to God. The women didn't know what happened up there, what they had upstairs. So directly down the steps he come hard as he could go. She said, "Daddy, I'll give you a geography to read." Said, "Yes, I know it." You know, said, "I was reading in this geography here where these places in the sea that ain't got no bottom in it." And said, "I read over here in the Bible yesterday." He said, "He put my sins in the sea of forgetless. Glory to God. God, &gt;&gt; said they're still going. They don't have it in. They just keep on going. That's right. And he was shouting about it. Well, that's right. &gt;&gt; God puts our sins &gt;&gt; in the sea of forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bls them out and there as if they never did happen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Then we stand by the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. pure and holy just as holy as he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he doesn't see me when I come up there, he sees his own son. &gt;&gt; The only way he can see can't see me because I'm in his son &gt;&gt; and he only sees his son. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; We don't have to think about sins anymore. It's all gone. It's under the blood. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Don't have to worry about anymore. It's all out of the and out of God's memory. You don't even remember it no more. Isaiah, that mighty prophet, when he confessed his sins, he said, "Woe is me, &gt;&gt; for I'm a man of unclean lips, a prophet. &gt;&gt; I'm a man of unclean lips, and my congregation's unclean. The people I preach to, they're unclean. I'm unclean. And woe is me." But here comes a bunch of angels down from the glory of God fanning back the the clouds. And I look up there and sees train filling the whole heaven. &gt;&gt; And I watch these angels that's never know what sin was. They never even know what sin was. &gt;&gt; And there in the presence of God, they got two wings over their faces. They got two wings over their feet. And they're flying with two wings. And they cry day and night, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God." That make you feel kind of unholy, wouldn't it? &gt;&gt; Now, what did he do? He said, "Woe is me." And when he confessed his sins and said, "Woe is me." The angel went over and tucked the tongues, picked up a coal of fire, which represent the Holy Ghost and fire, and come over and laid it on the prophet's lips and said, "I've cleansed you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then the wings of winning their way like that moved away the curtains of time and he heard God say, "Who will go for us?" &gt;&gt; But after he found out that there was a way to rid sin, God wanted somebody to go for him and he said, "Here am I send me." &gt;&gt; He had been in the presence of God and had confessed his sins and been cleansed from his sins and was ready for service. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; As the poet caught that said, millions now in sin and shame are dying. Listen to their sad and bitter cry. Hasten, brother, hasten to their rescue. Quickly answer, "Master, here am I." And I think of Africa, India, and around the world. Millions of healings screaming and crying for mercy. And who will go? Not pass him a track, but bring him Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody in his presence like Moses who could go down there and show them true deliverance. Not make them join a church or shake hands and have a creep, but bring deliverance to their soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some good godly man. Yes. Isaiah confessed his sins and was cleansed. After Jacob had wrestled all night in confessing his sins, do you remember the place he was? It's called Pental. P N I T E L. Pentle. The word pimple in the Hebrew means the face of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Jacob the little shy had run all his name was Jacob which means suppler that's deceiver had run all of his life away from God. But when he got one time in the presence of God at pinthal in the face of God he got a hold of God and it wouldn't turn him loose. &gt;&gt; God we need more Jacobs. He held on to the face of God in the presence of God. He stayed until it was sun up. God said, "Let me go &gt;&gt; because the sun's rising." And he stayed in the face of God until sun up. But he went away justified and saved. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a great thing it was now &gt;&gt; to know that he had wrestled through. That's he had seen signs of God. He had had dreams about God. But this is one time he was in the face of God. In the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends, now as we hurry up. In the presence of God, a man's changed. Jacob was changed. Now he could walk with God. Yes. He was a different man than what he was when he went up there. The battle was now over. Yes, sir. And he begin to build an altar. He hadn't been used to building altars, you know. But I tell you, when you come in the presence of God, you want to build an altar somewhere. &gt;&gt; You want to find somewhere where you can pray. He built an altar. He was cleansed. And God had won. And Jacob was changed from Jacob's suppler to Israel, a prince having power with God. &gt;&gt; That's what happened to Jacob. The suppler, the deceiver, the unrighteous, the unholy, the deceiver, deceived his brother, &gt;&gt; stole the birthrights, as it was from his brother, took a little dirty way of doing it. Such a deceiver, he deceived his father-in-law. Put popper sticks and made speckled calves. When the cows been pregnant, he come out, look at the sheep, would see that speckled stick, make speckled cattle, give them birth marks. deceiver, deceiving his own father-in-law, deceived his mother, deceived his daddy, deceived his brother. But when he once got in the he was a shyer, he was running everywhere he went. Always on the run from God. He's on the run from his brother. But when he come into the presence of God, he recognized he was a sinner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did he do? What did he do? He seen his opportunity. He had met something that he didn't even think about before. And he stayed there until all sins was gone. &gt;&gt; Oh my. God got him in his own presence. God manages a way to get man in their presence. Then they make their decision. Some of them run from him. Some run to him. If they're predestinated to life, they believe it. They hang on to it. If they're not, they try to get away and say there's nothing to it. See? &gt;&gt; And that's the guy that's lost. The guy that confesses his sin shall have pardon. If you hide your sin, you'll not prosper. No. So, Jacob when he it was the next day he met Esau his brother. He didn't need no help from him there. &gt;&gt; He didn't need his armies. He isn't business building altars. &gt;&gt; He wasn't afraid of Esau no more. Psalms 168. David said, "I have set the Lord before me." That's a good thing to me. Psalm 168, I set the Lord before me so he could not be confused about it. Uh he wanted to be conscious of his presence. So David said, "I have set the Lord always before my face." Now I David have set the Lord before my face. Always to be conscience conscious of God's presence. Wouldn't that be a good lesson for all of us tonight? &gt;&gt; Set the Lord before a face so we'll be conscious of his presence. &gt;&gt; Putty him first. Why? Put him first before you. Why? Then you won't sin. When you are realizing that constantly you're in the presence of God. When you realize God's around, you watch what you say. A man when he thinks God's gone, he'll cuss. He'll lust after women. He'll do he'll steal, cheat, lie. He'll do anything when he thinks that God don't see him. But bring him into the presence of God, he'll stop it right now. &gt;&gt; And David said, "I have put the Lord always before me." That's a good thing. No wonder God sent his man after his own heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Man will do everything when he thinks that God is near. But when he realizes that God's near, you ever notice a sinner? Let a godly person walk up. He'll quit his cursing. &gt;&gt; He's got any respects at all. &gt;&gt; He won't tell the dirty jokes that he would have told. See, see, you leave off that because he knows that he's in the presence of God because God dwells in the tabernacle of his people. See, after David did this, he said, "My heart shall rejoice." So we should read Psalm 16. My heart will rejoice and my flesh shall rest in hope. Why? My heart shall rejoice because I've got God before me all the time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And my flesh shall rest in hope. If I die, I'll be raised up again. &gt;&gt; For he'll not suffer his holy one and see corruption. &gt;&gt; Neither will he leave his soul in hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, when David put God before him and was conscious that constantly he was in the presence of God, seek ye first the kingdom of God. Now listen, church, I love you. Now I want you to listen to me now. As brother McCulla used to say, I'm going to say something. Always put the Lord before you &gt;&gt; and don't you do nothing that you wouldn't do in his presence &gt;&gt; because he's watching over you. See, the Lord isn't camped about those who fear him. &gt;&gt; He don't He just stays right near you. And he knows everything you're doing. And you must recognize that &gt;&gt; when you start to tell a lie, don't do it. Remember, God's listening at you. &gt;&gt; If you start to do a little cheat, don't you do it. God's looking at you. If you start to take his name in vain, don't do it. God's listening at you. Start smoke a cigarette, he's watching you. is we used to sing a song all along on the road to the soul's true abode there's an eye watching you every step that you take this great eye is awake there's an eye watching you &gt;&gt; remember do like David put the Lord always before your face then your heart will rejoice &gt;&gt; and your flesh shall rest in hopeise &gt;&gt; for he promised it yes sir he knew that he had raised up because God had promised All right. When we come into his presence, we're changed. Never to be the same. Look all down through the ages of every walk of life at man. Look at Abraham. You say, "Well, the changed life is just for ministers." Oh, no. The changed life's for everybody. &gt;&gt; Now, Abraham was a farmer. But when he heard God's voice speaking to him and saw that vision, he was a changed man from that time on. &gt;&gt; He separated himself from his kindred from all his associates and walked as a pilgrim and a stranger in a strange land the rest of his life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Dwelling in tents because he clearly confessed that he was seeking a city whose builder and maker was God. &gt;&gt; He knowed there was a God and there was a city somewhere whose builder and maker was God. That's what Hebrews 11 tells us that he is seeking the city as builder and maker was God. He was a changed man yet he was nothing but a mere farmer but he saw a vision and come into the presence of God and he was a changed man from then on. Moses he was a shepherd but he was a changed man when he come into the presence of God. He was a coward. He was running from Pharaoh with a whole army behind him. But with a stick in his hand, he went back and tucked the whole nation. &gt;&gt; Why? He come into the presence of God. He was a changed man, a shepherd. Peter, a fisherman, knew nothing about fishing or know nothing about God. Only thing he probably know was how to catch fish. But when he come in the presence of God and see the great creator who could create fish, when he told him, "Let down the net for the draw," there wasn't any fish there. He just pulled his nets up. But he said, "At thy word, Lord, I believe that you're the son of God. And if you let if I let down a net, you told me to do it at your word because you and your word are the same. I'll let down the net." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he began to pull, he said, "Depart, Lord. I'm a sinful man." &gt;&gt; A fisherman. After Peter met Christ, he was never the same anymore. He afterwards was so true to God, he was given the keys to the kingdom. Yes, sir. Paul, a self-styled Pharisee, educated and trained in all the religion of the that there was in the world in that day. One of the highest known scholars in the land. But when he come before that pillar of fire one day, the god that he had persecuted ignorantly. He was a Pharisee. He didn't believe that God was a man. &gt;&gt; He know God was a pillar of fire. It led his people out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; He had been with him all along. But when he saw this pillar of fire, he fell on his face and he heard a voice saying, "Saul, why persecutest thou me?" He said, "Who are you, Lord?" He said, "I'm Jesus." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was a man. &gt;&gt; And said, "How have you been baptized?" &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; He had been in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; He was a changed man from now on. You've been in the presence of God. It changes a man. &gt;&gt; Charles G. Finian, a lawyer, a great uh Philadelphia lawyer. But when he come into the presence of God, he dropped his law study and become a mightest preacher of this nation's ever had. Yes. &gt;&gt; He's a preacher because one day he come in the presence of God. He thought once he'd study the ministry, you know, his book, I got his autobiography. He went out to pray. He thought he was a preacher. He had a desire that he wanted to preach. And he had him a few sermons to try to preach. He went out one day out of his office to pray. Went out in the woods. They got down behind an old blowing down tree where you go every afternoon. Very religious. But he didn't believe in that. There's two women in the church kept saying, "Mr. Finny, we're praying that you receive the Holy Ghost." He said, "I got the Holy Ghost." But I'm a preacher. Said, "Mr. Finn, you're a great man and you got a great hold of the word, but you need the Holy Ghost. We're praying for you. &gt;&gt; Sweet little women. So he went on. So every day he'd go out behind his office, his boss and all of them there. He worked and he'd go out of his law office and go out there to pray. And one day he was out there praying and he heard a brush break. He thought his boss was coming up haunting him. He jumped up real quick and saying, "Lord God, I obly did saw brush broke. It got raised up and said looked around, see where it was, broke the brush, and it was then he come in the presence of God." He realized that brush broke for a purpose. He stood there, the tears running down his cheeks. He said, "Maybe them women's right. I'm ashamed for somebody to see me talking to my God, but I think it was an honor for somebody to see me talking to my boss. How much greater is my Lord than my boss? &gt;&gt; Said, "Lord, forgive me and fill me with the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Started screaming and shouting. He's in the presence of God. He run downtown real quick to his office. He got to screaming so hard he had to go behind the door, said, "Lord, I'll bring disgrace up. Oh, he hide me back here. Go get over this spell." Why? He'd come in the presence of God. He was a changed man. &gt;&gt; The sermons that he used to preach, he preached them same sermons and souls came to the altar. &gt;&gt; See, he had been the presence of God. Moody, a little old shoe cobbler. Hardly not his ABCs. That's right. His grammar was poor. Somebody told him one day, "Your grammar's awful poor, Mr. Moody." He said, "But I'm winning souls with it." So &gt;&gt; one day in the newspapers a editor went to writing a newspaper. He went over to see how could this man hold crowds of people under any conditions. Little old guy bald-headed and everything and had whiskers hanging way down kind of potbellied. He was a horrible looking man to look at. So this newspaper really give him a ride up. Said I don't see what in the world that anyone would see in Dwight Moody. Said he's ugly. His voice is squeaky. He's got whiskers plumbed down to his waistline. He's as baldheaded as a pumpkin and said, "How in the world would anybody ever go to see anything in Moody?" So Moody's manager had to see it and said, "Look, Mr. Moody, I'll read this to you." Moody couldn't read it himself. So I said, "I'll read you the editorial." And he wrote it. Moody just shoved his shoulder said, "Certainly not to come to see Christ." [Music] &gt;&gt; Why? He had been in the presence of God &gt;&gt; from making souls on shoes for people to wear out. He shot the people with a gospel of preparation for &gt;&gt; why? He was in the presence of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; A little woman one time come in the presence of God. As guilty as she could be at a moment when she realized that she was in the presence of God, every sin was forgiven and she was as pure and white as a lily. Oh my. How many more I could call off here of people time wouldn't permit. But I want to talk a little bit about myself. What could have been any lower in me? &gt;&gt; Where was I? Come out of a family of drunkards. Come out of a family of murderers. Come out of a family of bootleggers. And you know that. Every one of you know it. You know what kind of name we had here? People didn't speak to us on the street. I go downtown, start to talk to somebody. Nobody talked to me unless somebody wasn't around to talk to me. Somebody else come up to lead me and I'd stand there and cry. Lord, this ain't so. It can't be. So, this is wrong. But one day, I come into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; he changed me. Made me another kind of son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His grace brought me into his presence. I've never wanted to leave it. I've been in here now 30 some odd years. I don't want to leave it. I've got the assurance that I'll always be there. Even death itself will never separate me from his presence. &gt;&gt; No, I'll be with him forever. When I seen his presence the first time, I cried like Isaiah, "Woe is me." Then he touched me with his grace. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was a changed person. the little renegade that used to get out here and carry on and everything was changed. And since then, I've been his child. Since then, I've desired to give my whole life for his service. Only wish I had 10,000 more lives to give for him. This is getting pretty well wore out now. 53 years has passed. About 33 of those has been 32 of those has been in the gospel. I wish I had another thousand &gt;&gt; back in span. Why? When I once into his presence and realized that there was somebody who loved the unlovable, there's somebody who loved me when no one else did. There was somebody who cared for me when no one else cared. I put my arms around his cross. I embraced it to me and made him become one man. And from then on, I've loved him. He stained my bosom and my heart with his blood. I've touched him and forgiven my sins. And I'm happy tonight to be one of his. I never desire to leave this heavenly place. Though tempter to persuade me off have tried, &gt;&gt; but I'm safe in God's pavilion and happy in his loving grace. And I'm living on the hallelujah side. &gt;&gt; It makes my heart rejoice. I'm recommending him to ever wear person. I'm recommending him to you that have no hope. You never been in his presence. The only thing you have to do is confess your sins and realize that you're wrong. And God has that angel ordained tonight called the Holy Ghost. That'll take all your sins away. Then you'll cry, "Lord, here am I. Send me." Then you'll raise your hands and sing, I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the Lamb for sinners slain. Give him glory all ye people for his blood has washed away each stain. &gt;&gt; I love you. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Living in his presence. I come to the pull pit here this morning feeling so bad and so sick from uh I was down in Kentucky last week with some personal friends of mine sitting here. If I stayed down there very long they'd kill me. They sure would with kindness. Some of the best cooks I ever know in my life and when I get to my capacities done overloaded. Brother Brandon, won't you ask some of this? It's just so good I just try to poke it down. I got so full I just couldn't even move. I couldn't sleep. I had to get out and walk around a while. And um I wasn't feeling very good when I got in here this morning. But once when I come into his presence, &gt;&gt; that sounded that settled it. It all vanished away. That's right. Oh, to live in his presence, I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinner sl. Give him glory all ye people for his blood has washed away each. Let's bow our heads now. Did you enjoy that? &gt;&gt; You know the a real believer always looks into the year thundum which is the word of God. And from when we have the opportunity to listen to a tape like this tape, it becomes a measuring marker for us. You're able to ask yourself, is this where my heart's at? Is this where my life's at? Is this how I feel? Is this how I think? And and if you feel that then you you know that this is real for you &gt;&gt; and it's obtainable for you. The word of God never comes to condemn but to correct. Correct doesn't mean to punish. It means to change course. You know, like you drive on your car, you know where you're going and you do a certain thing and that thing starts saying, "Make a U-turn. Make a U-turn." And you start say, "I know where I'm going." You know, and because it wants to keep correcting you, you know, and that's what the Lord knows. He knows where we're going and he knows what's before us. So, he always wants to correct our path. He wants to remind us and bring us into remembrance. You know, always put the Lord before you. And when you do that, it's wonderful. I like the part, I really always like the part about the saved sinner. But he said, "A sinner, a repented sinner doesn't have to worry. It's been settled." and and those those are the attitudes and the wisdom and what he is bringing to us and and and young people to to know that you can come to that place where you've been in the present. It's settled. You don't have to worry about it. You don't have to be afraid the preacher is going to come up and preach some message that's going to make you feel like you're unsaved. You know, you I went through that a few times where some preachers got on me and tried to just make me feel like I wasn't saved. I went back to my room and I got down and I said, "Lord, you know it." And when I got back up, they never could do that to me again. Because I know my redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; I know it is who saved me. &gt;&gt; You know, I mean, I would don't have to come under the subjection of man and what they think I ought to do. I know for myself that he's real &gt;&gt; and he's alive and and and I I I I know that it was very evident and I'm hope and trust that you all picked up on it, but if you've ever been in the presence of God, you're obligated to tell somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and it's more than like an obligation. You better tell somebody. No, that fire is burning in your heart. You just got to let somebody know what God can do for them. You just don't like the devil no more. You know, I mean, when you see the devil on somebody, you just want to say, "Wait a minute. You don't have to live like that." &gt;&gt; You know, I mean, you don't have to suffer like that. And and you'll stick right there. You'll never give up on anybody. No matter how long it takes, &gt;&gt; you won't give up because you know God never gave up on you. And so we just hope you enjoyed the word of God and uh encouraged you and and so would you pray for this weekend? Uh I I know that we have about 150 uh young people coming to the banquet and probably more wanting to come and and um you know everybody wants to cut it off at this and cut it off with that. But I heard a song one time that there's room at the altar. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we have to sit them in the pavilion, if we have to sit them in the Sunday school classrooms, we want everybody to come to hear the word of God. We don't we don't care about how our decorations or our food. Our food's the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not uh you know stuffed meatloaf or chicken cordon blue or pork chops with mushroom gravy. It ain't that. It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. So we just richly ask you the Lord to bless you. So, let's stand this evening and um as they play something on the piano for us this evening, why don't we just take a moment and bow our hearts and our minds before the Lord. And and maybe like Charles Finny came to that great place where he said, "Am I ashamed of the Lord? Am I ashamed of what God's done for me? I'm ashamed to show people that I've been in his presence. And maybe you could just ask in your heart if if there's maybe that you need a little change in your life and see what the Lord might come by and encourage your heart [Music] Our gracious father, Lord, how many opportunities have I let past where I could have stood for you or I could have told somebody about you. Lord, how many times have I run from your presence and instead of running into your presence and letting it change me? Father, how many times have I let my sin and shame keep me from allowing you to make me better and different? Lord, tonight we heard your messenger speak of the power of the presence of God and what it does. What it does to a man's heart, what it does to his life, what it does to his desires, what becomes important in his life, and how that he never wants to leave that place. Lord, I'm ashamed of how many times I've left your presence. And I ask you to forgive me, Father. And once again, make a way back for me through the blood of the Lord Jesus. That that presence, Father, could be a burning light. He talked about the light bulb and the electricity coming together. Father light and light he says shines bright. Lord, as we even heard in the quotations from Wednesday night that to go into the dark places and let your light so shine amongst men. Father, it's not about us. It's about you and and you using us to get you your life to the lost. And when they came into the presence, father and the coal at the altar touched their lips. Our messenger said that a man in the presence of God says, "Lord, send me. What can I do to serve you?" And father, may we each ask that question. May we not let the shame of our sin keep us from doing your work. But may we confess our sins because you're faithful and just to forgive them, Father. And may we leave those things which are behind behind. And may we press for a higher calling. Father, those that have come out tonight, Father, I ask that you would bless their lives in a special way. Lord, I know it's hard nowadays for people to go to church. There's a time revival would last weeks at a time. But we live in a cold, formal, worldly atmosphere. And it takes a lot more prayer and a lot more courage to press the mark. Lord, we need a lot more time in your presence to gain strength and to wait upon you, Father. [Music] Lord, I pray tonight and I believe, Father, with all my heart, I that I did the right thing in playing this today. And Lord, I ask that the effect of your presence would be manifested in the lives of the hearer. [Music] You spoke of the joy that comes to the believer once he's free from all his burden of sin. Lord, I pray that if there's any here amongst us has never been free, that has never felt the lifting of the burden of conscience. Lord, I pray that your loving hand would swing by and touch their hearts tonight or in the days to come that they might know that they're free and that they have an eternal destination and that there's a mansion waiting for them just on the other side of the hilltop. Oh, God, there's nothing like it. There's nothing that a man knows. There's nothing like you, Lord Jesus. Nothing like knowing that nothing can pluck us out of the palm of your hand. That if you started a work, you would finish it. Father, forgive me for my weaknesses. Strengthen me with your grace and mercy. Father, if there's a hand up this evening, if there's a heart that's turned towards you, if there's one that's found themselves wanting, being weighed in the balance, Father, may you just sweep your spirit by their heart. May you let them know that that you love them and that if you if they'll follow, you'll lead them. We ask that you would grant these things to us tonight in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray.

Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, you know what we have need of even before we ask this evening. Father, we are thankful for your word and thank you for the life. Thank you for the lessons that we heard today as we took a moment to sit into the presence, Father, and hear the voice of our age speak to our heart. Lord, I know it can only strengthen us. And Father, may our love one for another increase. May they know that we are your disciples by our love one for another. Lord, we ask that you would give us the grace in the mind and the remembrance to pray one for another, to share one another's burdens, and to live one for another. Father, not to judge or condemn, but to lift up, to encourage, to leave those things which are behind behind and press for a higher calling. We ask that you'd grant these things to us in Jesus precious and wonderful and holy name we pray. Amen. Amen. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is God good &gt;&gt; all the time? Is he good all the time?

He will keep you safe and sound because he's never forsake you and his word is true. God is good all the time. There's a song of praise in this heart of my God is good all the time and through the darkness his light will shine. God is good. Oh, God is good all the time and we will sing. You are worthy for us.
