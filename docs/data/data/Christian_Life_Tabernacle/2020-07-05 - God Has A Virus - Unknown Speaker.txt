[Music] you [Music] you [Music] and God bless you welcome to the house of the Lord listen start sanding just saying this as we open our service this morning light of the world you step down into darkness open my eyes let me see that made this hard Troi spend with you and Here I am to worship and Here I am - back here iets [Music] you are today [Music] king of all oh so highly exalted Lord [Music] to the earth [Music] Here I am to worship Here I am to back here I'd to say [Music] ah how much to see [Music] you're all together [Music] ah we were here to worship Him this morning brother Mike if you just want to come up on our service and prayer this morning there are some reading [Music] let's go ahead and break Heavenly Father were always so grateful to you for every opportunity Lord to be invited into your presence Lord we thank you that a way has been made Lord an entrance has been Minister that we might stand before you blameless that we might sit at your feet and learn of you Lord that meant we might dwell with you have you in our midst and us with you that we might hear from become like you be drawn to you Lord to be transformed and changed from day to day Lord we commit this service to you Lord that your spirit would overrule in every way Lord we as a people take control of any spirit that would stand in the way of the delivery of your work and the receiving

within to you that you would overrule in every way Lord come by our way and meet every need be precious to each one of us when we pray this in Jesus name Amen so though the lot has fallen to me it seems to to do today's song you know it's funny was mentioned to me very casually in a meeting of several brothers and over the years you learn that that's about all the notice that you get so you come prepared if you want to turn to Psalm 65 this morning you know is just kind of looking at this Psalm a little bit in particular verse and it stuck out to me is verse 4 and it says this it says blessed is the man whom thou chooses to and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple you know and I got to thinking about that I got to thinking about a dwelling place you know a house is where someone dwells you know in this scripture is speaking of his dwelling place his courts his house his temple all describing a place where he dwells you know anytime you enter into someone's dwelling place you're only there because someone has invited you in otherwise you're a thief right and how precious is it to have that invitation blessed is the man whom thou chooses and caused us to approach unto thee you know it's interesting as David describes his dwelling place in in chapter 65 the very first verse references the name Zion you know it's it's an a it's a it's a place that you could do a whole study on and it's mentioned several times in Scripture you know it's it's mentioned simultaneously as a city it's mentioned as a mountain it's mentioned as a people you know it's a place where his kingdom is established it's a place where that he as the chief Cornerstone as late as the foundation of it quoted many times in the New Testament it's the place where the Redeemer and the redeemed both dwell so I mean you can do a whole study on that but one thing that's really interesting about it is Zion is a dwelling place it's his dwelling place right in Psalm 132 12 it says for the Lord hath chosen Zion he hath desired it for his habitation so Zion is both a place of his choosing and it's a place of his habitation but then it says in Isaiah 12 6 cry and shout thou inhabitant of Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee ok so there are others who dwell there he dwells with them in this place together that dwelling place blessed city is the man whom the Lord causes to come in and dwell with him right and Isaiah 10:14 it says it says it speaks of my people that dwell in Zion Joel 3:17 says so shall you know that I am your Lord the Lord your God dwelling in Zion so it's not just the dwelling place of the Lord it's the dwelling place of his people the cohabitation of the Lord with his people blessed is the man whom thou chooses and causes to appro unto thee and I think the thing that's the most exciting about this dwelling place is it's not a future dwelling place it's a present dwelling place psalm 27:4 says one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life this life right to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple you know it's it's what's interesting is you can't go to that future dwelling place unless first you dwell in this dwelling place but one is a reflection or as we heard Wednesday night a pattern of the other right in fact Jesus said when he was teaching his disciples how to pray in Matthew 6 thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth here just as it is in heaven so you know and finally it just one letter thought before we start reading it at Psalm 48 12 it describes Zion in this way walk about Zion and go round about her tell the towers there of Markey well her bulwarks consider her palaces many palaces many dwelling places many mansions in this place Jesus said in John 14 in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am present tense there ye may be also so you know as I'm thinking about that in this invitation to come and the blessed is the man who in the Lord causes to come into this dwelling place cohabitating with him here and now you know how many times during this pestilence have we thought boy I wish it was some place I could go to just get away from it all well it turns out there is right there is a promise to the believer says I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord not this house his house so that hopefully bless you as it is me if you want to turn to Psalm 65 we'll go ahead just read this together says this praise wait for the Oh God in Zion and it's at these shall the vow be performed Oh thou that here is prayer unto thee shall all flesh comb iniquities prevail against me as for our transgressions thou shall purge them away blessed is the man whom thou chooses and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us O God of our salvation who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth and of them that are afar off upon the sea which by his strength said it fast the mountains being girded with power which still it the noise of the Seas the noise of their waves and the tumult of the people they also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid of they talk ins thou make us the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice thou visitest the earth and waterís did though greatly and richest it with the river of god which is full of water thou prepares them corn which thou has so provided for it now water is the ridges thereof abundantly thou said lists the furrows thereof thou makest it's soft with showers thou blesses the springing there o thou crown as the year with a goodness and thy paths drop fatness they drop upon the pastures of the wilderness and the little Hills rejoice on every side the pastures are clothed with flocks the valleys also are covered over with corn they shout for joy they also sing bless you [Music] and this world is now my home I'm just passing [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] they're

out of the palm of your hand I'm so thankful you remain ever true to your word ask you to bless those that are assembled here this morning father those that are with us by way of streaming this morning father Lord you just pray that you create an atmosphere around them in their heart in their lives that they know that you're with them that you'll keep them and protect them that you're not a God that dwells in Tabernacles made by hand but you're a God that dwells in the living people we just asked this morning that you would encourage our faith we ask these things in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you you know they if you turn in your Bibles to Hebrews if you would this morning the 11th chapter and the first few verses which I'm sure we're all very familiar with you know you go into a restaurant and they allow you to walk in the restaurant with your mask that when you sit down at the table to feed you can take it off so I believe we're sitting at the table of the King this morning so we be certainly I know it's hard to worship and this sing with masks gone but I think you know there's just so many things types and so many things rolling in so many things today but we're just grateful to be here let's read these scriptures we will try not to be long this morning as you know that our event this evening we were going to try to have a little recognition celebration for brother Mike and Alan as they're retiring and all the wonderful years of service that they had given us but you know right as we announced that the governor dropped down another order in another order and and so we just felt it's best at this time to cancel it so I do have plenty of hamburger so we'll have to just pick another day to to do something together amen let's read this scripture here and I'm sure most all of us have this memorized at the first few verses now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and let's skip to the sixth verse it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen god bless you you may be seated I forgot last week to introduce or acknowledge I believe it's Ben is that right and now I heard your name the other day system and Olivia so Ben in Olivia Shelly are here visiting with us now rumor has it that you guys are fabulous singers and and if you know we we make all kinds of new customs here at this church you know we sing specials at the end of service we can sing specials anyone but I'm not going to be too long this morning so I was wondering if it would be possible if you would come sing for us we can create our own order can't wait right we're not we're not bound by traditions such as some are bound by traditions so okay and it might give me a little bit of inspiration so Olivia would you I know you sing I don't really know about him that I mean II and if you have anybody that wants to join you bring them along but if you need to all right what do you need yeah a husband you come and play you can pick up almost anything yeah we're just here to enjoy the Lord aren't ya all right and then microphones here we go make sure they're on thank you for being here with us we certainly welcome you and and waters the storms raging high the waters around them they were troubled a night fear filled their hearts they were died they fail to remember it the master and book [Music] the Bible [Music] the darkness when the way [Music] footsteps in my master [Music] my body [Music] to the store [Music] [Applause] why should we worry amen you know I've always been a little jealous of ministers who could preach and sing I never thought it was fair but their father's quite a minister in and singer himself so I just want to fellowship with you a little bit this morning I hope I think that song was perfect because I kind of just want to just speak some words of encouragement to us you know there's you you get the hearing so much out there all the time you know and we know that the conversation of the world today is the virus the virus you can use the virus for an excuse for anything you can burn your panic cakes and you can say it's the virus and everybody accepts it you can be late and it's with a virus you can you can any type of failure any type of reasoning you can just tack it on the virus and so you know I got to just thinking about that it just bothered me so much everybody's testing for virus and testing for this and you know I'm in a public office you might say and I contact a lot of people so they want to test me another word for that test is torture so you know they just want to do these things and I thought you know you know so I got to think of what is a virus you know I just curious so I looked up the different definition and it says it's an infective agent or micro body agent it's too small to be seen and it can only live and reproduce in a living cell so that's a virus well I got to thinking you know God's got a virus in his virus is faith and and it's it's it's an effective agent amen it spreads and it's contagious and it get a multiply and but it's got to be in something that's alive hey ma'am and you know canned faith is the evidence of things not seen it's too small to be seen amen but you know it's a thing and that's what we just want to talk about it a little bit it does this morning just to you know keep us on track you know one of the things that's hard for me is there's so many in the church that haven't been able to come for so long we have frontline workers we call them we have people that are in contact with sick people in and in other so many other circumstances that's around that we don't get to reach out and fellowship but yet you're on our hearts and our minds and and I know many of you listen in with the services so we want to stay encouraged this morning and that kind of what my heart's desire is is just a to just build up just build up our faith and and build up our encouragement and just and look into the Word of God and find perspective as we preached here I believe it was last Sunday I think we entitled the service I'm trying to title my sermon and it's very difficult for me so this one I think I'll just call it God has a virus amen and I don't know if the sermon will match the title but it doesn't seem to matter everybody else was titling my sermons and their titles didn't match my sermon so I don't know but I think repeats on your part yeah your part in the plan of God and that God had a plan from the beginning and in the beginning you know God within himself he was God that he was the self existing one so if we could say it in this form or fashion that God dwelt alone so if you could picture yourself living in we can't really put ourselves in God's place but we'll do just to get in there if you lived in a place all by yourself and nobody knew you they didn't know anything about you they didn't know what that you were they didn't know the kind of person you were and and all that you were was just contained within yourself and there was nothing around you or nothing going on around you to bring out any of the things that you were so you just existed by yourself and you were in that state one place the messenger of the hour referred to it as a great fountain of many colors many lights just whatever it is and we'll never be able to comprehend God I guess in our minds that we have here I believe that he'll have to place a new mind in us and I'm more than willing to leave this mind behind amen it's failed me many times and it's failing me quicker and quicker but he dwelt by himself just picture that and one day in his implement plan he says I want to have fellowship I want to I want to have fellowship with somebody so the first intentions of God was to have fellowship he wanted to reveal himself he wanted to let people know what kind of person that he was and and so we as and then we went on and we talked a little bit more about circumstances that circumstances caused things to be brought out things are manifested by circumstance so God is sitting here in this great place that he was in we will call it his house because all creation all in all is God's house he dwells in everything he's all in all so he dwell here in this place and so he decided that he would begin to reveal himself or manifest himself and show himself so he said let there be let there be let there be and in his mind he he had this great magnificent plan that he wanted to unfold and okay and the purpose that he wanted to unfold it is he wanted to reveal himself he wanted to have fellowship he wanted to have preeminence not preeminence in the way of like a mean ruler but preeminence in being the supplier and the source of light and the life of men and so God began his plan of creation he created the and he created the stars in the Sun and the moon and all those things that were created but in in those things it displayed his glory but he only had fellowship with himself in those things you know like so it'd be like if you were in this home by yourself and one day you took out your your paints and you you painted a just the most magnificent painting that was ever painted but there was nobody there to share it with and so in one way there was nobody would know that it was magnificent so you couldn't receive praise for it you you you know and God he wasn't God until he became an object of worship so then he end this great you know when I start thinking of the mind of God I'm glad I have that mind for me okay you you understand I'm glad that that mind is for me if God be for you who can be against you so just think of the great mind of God he created all this magnificence and beauty but there is nobody there to praise them for it nobody just tell them how magnificent was no money don't no one - aw so you've got this great painting in your home that you painted and and you did it and because you did it it was you but nevertheless it was couldn't be worshiped it couldn't be admired it couldn't be shared nothing would come of it so God in this great understanding of creation because he created it he formed man and he formed man in His image in other words he may man with the ability to perceive to see to understand to have emotions he created outward realms of the senses see touch taste smell hear he did those things so that they man could contact the world and then he placed the spirit in him that had that could feel and have emotions and love and so now God had something to fellowship with so God created man and he had someone to fellowship with and the man that he created was Adam and and so Adam began to walk in the cool of the evening he walked with God and he God would say he'd turned the father and said father all those drafts whatever made you give them such a long neck oh you're such a God of variety and and and he would see the son need worship him and the garden was beautiful and the father gave him power over this I want to you understand this great fellowship that he had and and and the love that they had and the fellowship they had and the faith that they had together and then yet as God walked with Adam his son Adam was the son of God a man he it wasn't a byproduct he came straight from God himself and the Spirit of God dwelt in him and as he walked with the son there was a part of him that his son couldn't know he didn't he Adam didn't know God was a healer he didn't know God was a deliverer he didn't know God what was a Savior see if this is because you've got a part in the plan of God you've got to understand that that God's got there's a part that you play that he wanted to wants to play out in you just like he played out in creation just like he played out walking with Adam and so finally Adams there and and and God's got all these attributes that he that he wants to share and there's no way that he can share that with Adam so he's going to make a byproduct he's going to take a part of Adam and and he separates Adam Adam being both male and female and he takes the feminine part out of Adam it creates out of his rib and he now he has a by-product so the Justice of God now God has a way to manifest his attributes to Adam but out and and so God being just in his mind so he creates the byproduct but God knew what was in Adam you have to understand because God created Adam so he knew that Eve would fall but he also knew that Adam possessed an attribute that he received from his father that was going to redeem what was his that he would go out with it and and so God being just he says okay I know that Adam and Eve are going to go out I know that now they're going to have offspring I know that that they're going to have two children and that life's going to go on and in order to be just and fair to Adam and to Eve I'm going to put their name in the Lamb's Book of Life the foundation of the world nothing will ever take it off nothing can ever put it on there it is my choosing I choose it I'm the creator of heaven and earth and I make one vessel unto honor and another vessel under dishonour and I know who's mine I know who I'm spoken of and their names are put in this Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the beginning of the world nate'll I can let them go because they're eternally secure in me Oh hallelujah hallelujah we're trying to get to something this morning that that that fact actually resonates in us at the end so he sets forth this lambs up he puts their name in the Lamb's Book of Life and now he allows man to go out and into the world and so to speak now man's in contact with these feelings he's in contact with his emotions and he's in contact with great things and and so man starts on his journey and so we we see then that what we've been what we've been talking about and kind of bringing about on these lines is that I just had a paper here and then it disappeared on me oh well maybe I took it here and turned it into the book of life which is something that I could have very simply alright you don't miss I'm not totally senile yet so don't vote me out right away give me up no that ain't yet oh well I'll just have to go on yeah I wonder how this looks on the Internet all righty so so we so we we see that this great plan of God so that's what we're talking about we're talking our part that we play in the plan of God so God unfolded this plan and part of this plan was to manifest the other attributes that he had in him now brem specifically brings that revelation out because it's part of the the message that he was trying to deliver to us that man could never understand they couldn't understand how did I get myself into this place that I'm born in sin shaped and iniquity come into the world speaking lives I didn't have a choice over that I inherited that that because of sin and and my father was sin then my husband was sin so I was married to the nature that I picked up in the flag you know when when Mama asked me did you take the cookies out of the jar with a cookie in my hand chocolate chip all over my face no can you say why why would I lie it was an instinct and an attribute of the nature of sin I was born in sin shaped in iniquity shaped in unbelief and I came into the world speaking live so we were all born good fires but there's never a good lie you know what finds out a lie don't you the truth that's why the truth sets you free from the lie the lie that Satan's been telling us the life that he's been pointing us to the bondage he's trying to keep us under by the law but God's plan he had this great wonderful plan he wanted to unfold a part of that great plan he wanted to done full was he wanted to redeem back all those that were his they had eternal life because if you've had eternal life you always have had eternal life because there's only one thing that's eternal and that's God so you had to come from God you had to be with him in the beginning you had to be in his thinking from the beginning all that the father hath given me will come my sheep hear my voice in another they will not follow so he knew that that there that that plan was there that great eternal life was there so his plan that was to redeem another were they were his but they were now out of their original purpose which was fellowship they were out of their original place which was to glorify Him for God seeks the man to worship Him in spirit and in truth and seek such - were that young man was out of his created place so God wanted to redeem him or bring him back to the place that he was another reason that God placed this great plan into operation was through redemption he was able to manifest his attribute of love which he was why do you think Adam walked out of the garden with Eve because he loved her might come strange sound but he loved her he loved her so much great he was willing to lay his life down for he tried to hide her sin and he went out with her and then God's plan all the way from the beginning he had a plan for the beginning so he allowed Adam to fall so he could manifest attributes that Adam would have never known he secured him by writing his name in the Lamb's Book of Life because they always had eternal life that was the reason that Jesus could go raise up that child from the dead that'd be dead because he knew her name was in the Lamb's Book of Life think of it Amen well we were yet sinners he died for us so he paid this great price of redemption and it was the man if as a no greater love HEPA man than to lay down his life for his own I lay down my life for my sheep that were I am they may be also a way to this great beautiful love story of him knowing us he knew we were out here we are a part of him he knew he was there he knew your name the color of your eyes the color of your hair the color of your skin what parents you had come through all those things he put those things together your great-great-grandfather he put them together the father all the way down he mixed and put things together until he got you hell yeah you're not a mistake you know what God ain't like AMERICA AMERICA like skinny you know they like all these carnal things God loves the inside God loves the spirit he's a he's a wonderful God nothing is happening here that he doesn't know about it's a beautiful plan so this great plan of redemption that he paid the price and now his purpose was that once that price was paid that he could once again dwell in his people and that what we came to last week that ye are the Temple of the Living God that God's part of the plan of God was to have a people that he could live in a place that he could dwell so he wouldn't be the great unseen God he would now be a God seen veiled in flesh that mystery of this last day of God being veiled and dwelling in flesh God revealed that to us through the first sheaf offering that came out that there was a man of the age that rose up that God dwelt in and there was God veiled in flesh was God people didn't understand it because they couldn't we'll move to that in a little bit but it was a manifestation of the plan of God God planned the seven Church ages he planned the messengers he planned the believer in each age he planned what word would be let out in each age because God's a nun folder he's an evolutionist and he eat he unfolds himself he brings enlightenment he brings understanding God has fellowship through revelation if you're not getting revelation and God's not enlightening your heart you're not in fellowship with him you might be in spoo it's like the mechanic he went to school he read the book he knew all about it but one day it was time to change the oil so he went in there and he got down in his back and he reached up at that plug and he said shall did they meant they did turn this plug so he turned that plug got baptized ah he was out of school he got a revelation and then he reached up to change the oil filter and he burned his hand on the manifold whoa yeah now he got a revelation you see if I maybe that's not a good example but you understand what I'm saying is that you got to be in fellowship with God revelation is God making his word a reality to you it's good fellowship that you have with him so God's plan was to dwell in a people to manifest himself in flesh he did it in shadows and types in the Old Testament through the prophets and then that all those shadows manifested itself in the beam of Jesus Christ who was the second Adam now this Adam was a quickening spirit another words a quickening spirit means to make alive so this Adam was going to go forth and make Eve alive because there was the second part of redemption that was the restore Eve back to fellowship with him and then they become one so he restored him back there were restored back at the day of Pentecost they were back in fellowship silver and gold have I none but that which I have Oh hallelujah I give to you but jesus knew the law of God he knew the plan of God because everything about God is unfold unfolding he hacked he kept here was this the the restored seed back in our fathers but you would have never had the fellowship if you would have came into that restored seed from the beginning you understand that if you had been born got the Holy Ghost you too never sinned so now he said unless this seed fall in the ground it shall not bear forth fruit so he knew what those father's had but he knew it was going to go into the ground it was part of the Word of God so if God's plan was to dwell in you and we've come to this place that you are the temple of God if you are the temple of God you have faith faith governs your life you know and so when we look at faith and we're just trying to help build us up a little bit encourage us this morning in the light of all things that are transpiring when you have faith you've got to understand that God created the world by faith less than that amazing I'm going to read just a section out of the message called faith is the substance this day that we're living in is such a day of unsettled peace and unsettled rest everywhere anybody agree with that and see it's unsettled now connects the part when my friend Tom weathers came he gave me a bell and he said he said why do you think that they put bells on the sheep well of course I have my genius answer to know where they're at all right that's great one then he began to explain to me he said you hear this ding ding ding ding he said when his sheep eats it bhau's its head and when it comes up it dings so as long as that shepherd could sit there and he'd hear that quiet ding then he would know that everything was not at peace that Bell had a pattern and then if the Sheep got Restless they would start shifting back and forth and that Bell Agoda meeting dignity gain it would create a new sound because the sheep were getting nervous something was happening and they begin to make a new sound and then as he went on to explain - he says then he said when this starts going he says you know those sheep are running from something soap how many thought of the message the uncertain sound you see it soaked it if it's a time and that's what we don't want we don't want the Sheep to be unsettled we don't want them to be disturbed okay pencil you sense that there's a disturbance coming in people are beginning to get nervous they're beginning to start wondering okay I'm starting to worry about their futures worried about this worried only brings sickness so that you know and so we want to just speak you maybe just give us something to hold to that we can no we don't have to run and start panicking people are starting to look for jobs in other places people are starting to think about I've got to show this I've got to sell this and what am I going to do and and you know there's you know afraid of one another and I you know there's so much things that don't make sense but this is this is what we're living in we're living in a time a day of unsettled peace and unsettled rest everywhere people are running to and fro seeking whatever they may seek now take these words to heart because there's only one way you can judge yourself is by the Word of God you understand so when you hear something don't just try to figure out what brother Branham was trying to say let it say something to you here ahem ask yourself if I got to the place where I'm running to and fro seeking something seeking what they may see most any man most anybody can get a following no matter what they teach or think somebody will listen to them now isn't this the time of voices you were in the worst time in this country right now is everybody's putting this bin everybody's trying to get a voice everybody's trying to be heard may if you don't shut your brain off from that garbage can you will have a garbage disposal going on in your mind your mind will be rumbling wait till after the election then it's just finger-pointing he says but no matter what they teach or think somebody will listen to them and it's a day that the prophets spoke up people when they're hungry they'll eat from anywhere if if children and people are starving they'll eat from a garbage can that once eat from an ice table so let's don't run by these things we only have one service today we hear that but if we got to see once we lived in peace once we were prospering we had jobs we were sitting at a nice table now I don't think we've got to go back to no garbage can of Satan starting to feed on fear and doubt and suspicion and judging one another confusion and break the pattern of peace that rests in our heart from God when they eat from one from a nice table but if they are hungry they'll eat somewhere so I think real true ministers of the gospel ought to be up and going and ought to be giving the people the right things meat in due season brother McGarry how can you know that you can give us meat in due season hallelujah I've got a storehouse I got I got food that's been storing up for the due season I've got a place that I can go not only me but you also you don't have to eat garbage there's been food stored up for you Jehovah Jireh I will provide a Santa Lord now this subject of mine as I have testified to you that I am NOT a preacher I'm just merely have the gift of divine healing which I humbly say it comes from God I had nothing to do with it coming I was it was for ordained of God years and years ago I had nothing to do with it let that set in because there's something you didn't have nothing to do with either this is the keynote of the Scriptures faith he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him without faith it's impossible to please God let's go all the way back to what we're saying God has a plan so without faith it's impossible to please go God then brother Branham says I got this gift I had nothing to do with this it was foreordained to me a long long time ago this world was made by faith what things were shaped in existence by faith God just seen that dew drop hanging out there in the air that whatever you want to call it and he just spake and said let there be light and there was light and then he brought the land forth and dried it off and so forth that all was done by an act of faith with God the whole world was made by faith now if the whole world was made by faith when God created you faith was created in you faith isn't something you muster up faith isn't something you work yourself into faith was created in you before the foundation of the world and faith was in you we call it sometimes seed faith but it was created in you faith was in you the whole world was created so if God dwells in you then faith has to be in you it was a it was a substance faith is a substance faith is something that God created in you you got to get the noodle out of faith I had the brother Bramson I had to get the divine healing I had nothing to do with it sure it had a purpose it had a reason it had poles he had a reason it was doing what it was doing you know when I first was a Christian I hadn't heard the message yet I was enamored by discernment man I discerned and one day I heard someone say if you're not 100 percent right you don't mess with it and then I really saw at work and I didn't call it the gift of discernment anymore I called it the gift of stabbing I'd stab at things I had sense things I was relying on the census I was relying on what I felt I was reading feedback I have Kivus do you know my testimony I was into those realms but one day the truth came and the truth set me free how did that truth set me free because there was something a substance that God had created in there you GoGet faith you've got faith it's created in you he created it he put it there it's a substance it's something you have you've been infected by God's virus then he put the faith there my sheep know my voice how do they do that somebody tell me how they do that who do you say that I am that was the Christ the Son of the Living God Peter no man gave you that my father which was in heaven created that in you Peter had the substance you don't think he had the substance he says hey I've got the substance I don't got silver I don't got gold but I've got something in me that God gave me you know that's what we're talking about we're talking about being settled down we're talking about understanding that God created this faith in you it was created in you and when you heard the word it rose up in you when you heard the word by faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God don't miss that just like he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell faith that's in here cometh when it hears the word of God it's resurrected it's brought to life it had to have a circumstance in order for it to manifest itself it had to have a word call it why did you all respond to the Eagle scream do you think you did it on your intelligence I'll tell you everybody that's done it on their intelligence is falling away because they don't have a substance they don't have something that God created in them a substance and so in this day that we're living in God promised to restore the substance see we think of the faith but we don't understand the substance where does the substance come from where does everything come from everything that is all things that were created every bit of it was created by God the plan of God was created by God and you're part of the plan of God was that he could dwell in you and if he dwells in you you've got faith in you I didn't have anything to do with it it was decided a long long time ago now Satan gave a lot of you a big old struggle in and out up and down trying this trying that all kinds of stuff but something was there it's a substance it's created in you faith is not something that's worked up you can go on and read in this message he said people come in the prayer line and they say I've got faith I believe I've got pay pieces they don't have anything no faith at all they don't realize they've got faith they're trying to create an atmosphere or an attitude they're trying to create a feeling they're trying to create something that they can hold on to but real faith is a gift of God lest any man should both if just a substance is something that's in you it's something that God placed in you you don't know why there's no logical explanation on earth why I'm standing behind this pulpit this morning I'm uneducated I've got complexes I've got fears I feel I'm afraid I can't communicate but I can't help what's in my heart and the substance that's in there once I got converted I love people I hated people I would have hated you without a cause all's people did was hurt me make fun of me I had such terrible insecure complex and inferiority complex that everybody just brought the worst out in me but one day somebody let me know by the Word of God that were there was something in me it was always there it was created in me and if I had eternal life and always had eternal life then I always had faith [Music] [Applause] faith is the evidence I hope for heaven now where's the evidence of heaven of things not seen the evidence is what he created in me it's what's in me he created it he put there and that's what he was going to do so Quinn went wonderful though when faith cometh by hearing the word of God it didn't say faith was created by hearing the word of God or faith was given by hearing the Word of God faith was resurrected and brought to life it cometh to meet the word when you heard the word the faith was in you but what was he he was a quickening spirit he was one that came to make alive make alive what do you think God's trying to make alive in you the intellect of doctrine and message and everything he's trying to restoring you what he created in you from the foundation of the beginning of the world the just live my faith now can you imagine you doubting the very thing that God put in you because of a fleshly body when the very thing that's going to overcome he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world what he put in you before the foundation of the world is greater then what's in the world let's just follow the plan of God for a few moments I'm being like that all the ministers who don't have Sunday evening service I'm gonna make you enjoy your afternoon you can take a nap you can go play Rip Van Winkle but just listen this morning so he sent a message to restore right he knew it was going to go into the ground so he wanted it restored so he promised he would restore the substance of God being in you that's what the messenger came to restore back to the believer was the substance of God being in you everybody taught you repent and then you get God no he said it was a lamb to begin with he said you can take the pig and you can wash it up and you can clean it up and you can see the like hey but it's a what it's a pig because it has the what the nature of a pig and if you have faith you have the nature of the creator because faith created the world and if faith created you then faith is in you he created it there that's what he's trying to restore he wasn't trying to bring a new faith he wasn't trying to give us keys to stir faith up there was a faith that laid in the divine neglect of God and he came to restore what was already in down and bring it to life by giving him the true Word of God why it had to be a message with the true Word of God because and that's what the messenger says he says their gospel cannot meet the challenge of the age it had to be a faith of substance now the substance is in you so what did the message come to do didn't come to bring it to you it came to show you it was there because it was veiled to you then if you've read the message unveiling of God he said it was veiled when God came in flesh everything that the Word of God they couldn't see it because of their traditions so what if Satan do Satan's sealed the possession of the substance away from the people Satan steals it away do you know that it was there he sealed it away by coming in a white horse rider he sealed it away by coming in a red horse rider how did he do it he sealed it with intellect he sealed it with false teaching he did two things that touched the mind but not the heart he sealed it away making is totally unaware all of a sudden pudding is he the struggle looking outwardly for something that was inside I don't know I've looked for the glasses on my head that had on my head you start looking for something that you possess you talk about loss you talk about wandering you're looking for something that you've had all the time so what is the word do what was the message to do was to restore back to the bride back to Eve that she possessed it she hasn't but have been hidden from her by her false husband of nature the false husband of human nature by the the attributes that were taught to you by the things that you grew up under all those things have influenced you and built a personality around you and made you that way you are and to think you go all that's a blind lie from the pits of hell if you had eternal life you've always had eternal life your names in the books the trouble with us is is we don't come in contact with the very thing that's in us he says praying to him who is within you God worked from the inside out why does he work from the inside out because he has to work from the substance of his creation [Music] what he's trying to do he's trying to bring it so God sent a message by a prophetic gift a prophet to break those seals the seals that Satan put on the church and the Prophet comes on the scene he says that white horse was a lying spirit from the devil and this is what it did for the church that red horse was a lying spirit from the devil and this is what it did to the church that black horse was a lying spirit from the devil political and everything bound together that pale horse is a lying spirit and he broke he broke the seals he broke the veil and let us look past the deception past the fear to restore back the substance our fathers possessed as without faith it's impossible to please God do you understand you have a virus you have an infectious agent too small to be seen that can only live in and reproduce in a living cell house faith transmitted [Music] from faith to faith from faith from substance to substance from seed to see you can't give I missed it I mean you just can't give it unless it's there it's a virus it infects the substance transfers it's got symptoms praise God this virus is not asymptomatic and then you don't have it and not have a show you have it it shows works is fie hrus expressed it works no asymptomatic well I'm asymptomatic I've got faith it don't show when you've got that substance and you realize that don't you see the message was trying to get us to realize that we were in him before the foundation of the beginning of the world that we were a part of him that we were that part that went out now he's bringing that part back to life wet shirt I can't understand why the world won't receive this message it's the most glorious revelation - the living bride that there ever was it don't need no help it's designed to contact substance it's designed to live in the living cell of faith that God created in you I can see the minds that look back on sin praise God for the blood you know you try to warn people live good live clean because there comes a time even in relationship here's young people there comes a time that if you get to a certain place in your life you're gonna have to confess your past you're gonna have to have everything clean everything open then you'll know there's a blood believe me the brace of God goes to both sides the love of God can set in just put that there but you see if God created something in you you're not walking around here like a zombie and one day God came and gave you life you were walking around like a zombie because you didn't know the life was there then then the word we use the word at like impregnating or bringing to life or causing to grow and it started to grow in you and so now we understand without that substance being in you there's no way you can please God so man's great big effort is to please themselves let's build a bigger this let's build a system let's build an organization that's not what pleases God what pleases God is when you come to the realization and the resting place that I've got something in me that's created by God and I'll close on this you know they talk about a new normal and I thought you know something I was going to say not a new normal and I scratched that word not out I said a new normal live by the word of faith that's our new normal that's what all this circumstance is bringing us to that's why the world is falling apart around us that's why there's so much nonsense and confusion and turmoil to get us back to living by the substance what are you having confidence in I'm having confidence and I rest in this one thing and one thing alone that which was in me came from above give me a reason I don't have one he created one vessel unto honor and one to dishonor the choosing is his own all mankind lied before him like a lump of clay with nail-scarred hands he crafts every vessel after his own choosing to perform the work that he'd have it to do and sometimes he takes that vessel and completely tears it down that he might rebuild it again I know that true I've been tore down too many times but what's one thing I know he's the Potter and I'm the clay and he made that he created in there so I I just think that that in this hour that we lived in and and there this virus is causing to be so crazy but we begin to understand that this the virus of God faith it's hid from the world they don't see it in you they just see another man they just see another woman they just see a brother a sister a person there's no way that they can see it's failed but inside of you it begins to manifest itself because you've been invited I hope I can express this to you right the very flesh substance of faith that's in you has been veiled to you by your own flesh by your own flesh by your own senses but that's why when the word of God comes it strikes something that's in there a substance that's in there so you're invited to come out from behind the veil of your flesh and enter into that inner veil to enter into him he wants to tear that veil of the flesh that's why that went Satan's for horse rider religion appealed to it appealed to the mind it appealed to the flesh and made us give us something that we thought we could do some sort of standard to live by but let me tell you something when that substance comes to life then you live by the substance that's in you so he's inviting us to step past the veil of your flesh what you're watching what you're listening how that you feel all the aggravation that build up in you and their frustration he's inviting us past those things we in him than we being in him we are still veiled to the religious and professors of this world we're veiled to them they don't see what we're talking about they don't see the message they don't see we've been created to believe this see our glory that we have and enjoy we are still veiled to them Outsiders they think we're crazy a nut again that's right but we who are in here in Christ baptized unto Him first Corinthians 12 into him we are partakers of his glory see but not on the outside you're still looking in denying it so so we are invite in to him now look what he just said you're on the outside and you're denying what's in you you just can't hardly believe that God created faith in you before the foundation of the world and he chose to wrap that faith whatever wrapper you happen to be like a Snickers bar this substance got the David McGarry wrapper yeah not that kind of wrapper you got your wrapper all of you but if you stand on the outside you're looking and denying what's on the inside that's what he's trying to do he's trying to say I've put faith in there don't look at the wrapper don't be on the outside denying it walk into it he says in Corinthians into him we are partakers of his glory but not on the outside you're still looking in denying it see if you don't you don't want to be on the outside you don't want to be battling with it if the world was created by faith and God created you he created the faith oh I just wished that I had words in my vocabulary too unless the church understand that he's made this we're sitting right in the right spot at the right time in the right bound bodies at the right place in the right circumstance and right everything everything's perfect and he gave us the only thing that we need to make it and that's the substance of faith that he created in us we didn't earn it he created it let's close with this so now we are invited into him to be partakers of all that he is we are invited into him which is hid to the unbelievers by the veil of human flesh they know the glory they read of it it's in the word here the glory of God the things like that it's just a word to them to us it's a manifestation it's no more a word it's a reality oh my it's not a word anymore it's no more a word it's a reality because the word has become flesh God said let there be light but that was the word but now there is light it ain't the word it's the light you see what I mean now it's just a written word now it isn't just a written word to us it's a reality what is a reality it's the substance it's the realization of what something really is bold made clear unveil totally right there I can see the bride there's a substance in me that identifies with a substance at them I don't care where they go to church we're a part of something it's no more word you see what I mean it isn't just a written word to us it's a reality we are in him now we're enjoying now we're beholding him now we're seeing him the word manifesting himself it's hid out there because why it's failed in human flesh oh go past the veil George and accept and I don't know why I be honest with you I wouldn't have chosen any of you that shows you how stupid I know but he did and believe it or not you all had something in you that caused you to believe the word can't you have confidence in that that's what brother Ram said in perfect faith he said Jesus believed what God had made him he believed what the word said about him do you believe this message is the word do you believe what it says about it he says he walked by faith perfect faith the substance that was in him became the master of every circumstance and situation he lived by what was in him I did do nothing unless the father shows me first I do nothing unless the substance that's in me goes to work he says can't we believe what the word says we are so you say what's the new normal if the new normal is everybody running around with a mask isn't that just a perfect type [Music] it's a perfect type Satan's always masking always bad but praise God that substance that God's put in you it's going to arise to the occasion and there's going to be a new normal in the world today and that's a bride living by substance loving one another faith hope and charity these three the greatest of these three is the love of God the very thing that revealed that substance in you was the love of God god bless you don't don't be shaken you've got an anchor that holds you've got something that holds you solid it'll never break loose nope people say it's getting darker it's getting lighter they say oh it's getting bad the revelations getting sweeter oh it's falling apart he's coming closer hey man there's a deed that calleth to a deep god bless you calls me if you could come lead us in a song or two hey man let's pray for Wednesday night service I'm gonna ask brother Matthew to preach for us if he's here Wednesday night and then I have a new way of telling people things I do it in public so anyway we're looking forward to that you love them too morning do you understand why can you rest why can you rest because despite yourself he created the substance in you and he looked at Paul and said Oh Saul Saul it's hard to kick against that substance that's in you it's hard to kick against the veil and and I know that's just the purpose of this whole nightmare we're in this for us to shake them confident to look someplace else instead of looking within I believe if you'll look inside you'll find that faiths there you'll find there's something in you that said as you know I don't understand this message a lot of it but I believe every word of it you'll feel you'll find that despite the weakness and failures of your flesh that there's still something in there amen let that rise to the occasion faith is the victory it'll win the victory I can look across the audience and people on streaming right now that I've seen that faith win the victory in their lives the Lord richly bless you tonight I want to comfort you God created the faith in you and all that the father hath given me will come I will not lose a one-nothing can pluck you out of the palm of my hand and if I started a work and you all finish it some of us are just harder stones I remember going through years of chiseling and chiseling and chiseling finally to get this the simplest understanding and one day the light just come on and I thought man I've been fine to fight stuff that I never had to fight [Music] it's just time to turn them to come into him just just let go you're not responsible for what your parents do you're not responsible for what people think about your parents you're not thinking my kids aren't responsible for what people think about me they're responsible to one thing only and that's the substance of faith that's in their heart that's all that it's about let it rise up let that faith in you rise up show the world you've got the symptoms of the faith virus the virus that God's given you the virus of the substance of faith god bless you then stand again there are two take the word or what you say [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] with our heads bowed this morning in your hearts doubt I would just ask you this morning do you want to fly to a higher [Music] you just want to move up from where you are [Music] and you feel that in your heart I want to be better I want to be do whatever I want to be delivered from being so short fuse I want to be delivered from lust I want to be delivered from suspicion I want to be delivered from life you know what that cry is that's that substance crying out that's the faith that's created in you that's the deep calling to a deep would you make contact with that with your heart say Lord I've got to overcome it's keeping me it's holding me back and there's a virus that you put in me called fate nor did it has symptoms it believes the Word of God it's got peace it's got joy its long-suffering it's meet its temperance or it's not asymptomatic if their every symptom of it shows fathers Lord and I'm wanting that viruses roll in me I want to be infected with it I know it's there because I'm starting to feel it's pool and I want to enter into it or they say that college students are having parties they columns covert 19 parties they all come together and have a big party and see who can get infected sounds like the world to me the Lord we've come together because we want to be infected with your virus we want to have you at all part sorted you promised you wouldn't lose a one father Oh God we can just enter into your rest you're so good I've been just throwing my hands up and say father I enter into your rest you created it you'll keep it and it'll be exactly what you wanted it to be this morning that's my reality and I ask father that the word now becomes a reality to each of us we ask it in Jesus name [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh speak [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] get your ring [Music] oh you can't [Music] Oh before we close we we can't really have anybody up for prayer not that I'm opposed to it I certainly I could get a mask if you want hands laid on you but you don't have to do but if you'd have a desire just learning on your heart and you feel that pull and you'd want to just make that lift your hand up this morning so we can pray what's your desires maybe it's a deliverance [Music] maybe you've fought so hard you know you you don't want your problem and every day you war against it because you hate it so but you just like to let the Lord Lord I really want to be free you know I do and I can't help but struggle and fight as I hate it so much the Lord what's lifting my hand this morning is the face that you've created in me [Music] that's why I'm coming to your altar father so there's something in my heart that longs for more of you maybe you're sick in body maybe you've learned to live with it you've learned to arrange your life but morning Li but there's something way down in your heart you don't believe that's of God and you want to slip your hand up to him this morning you say Lord there's something in me that I really want to be healed would it really be made well like gonna serve you it's held me down for so long or my whole life sometimes is based around my sickness I just want to lift my hands to you this night say there's something inside of me that caused me to lift my hands you created that in you created that substance in me that calls out to you Lord I'll bring it to your altar this and I'm accepting by heating I'm accepting my deliverer sword I've had no peace and I know I haven't had peace I feel it in my spirit I feel that restlessness and that nervousness I know that I am outside of your arrest or but there's something in me that's calling for that rest that's that substance and father I'm gonna trust that that substance this point that that called it's in my heart you put it there and you put it there to create the peace that I desire for I have father that you've granted hands up everywhere people just wanting you to do something for them we're all guilty for we have all come short of the glory of God we've all seen he who says these sin not is a liar but when we've sinned we've got a great petitionary [Music] making intercession for us tearing the veil off of our human senses and letting us see there's something in us that longs for dogs father I ask that you bless each one this morning keep us Father in these times that we're it can't have
