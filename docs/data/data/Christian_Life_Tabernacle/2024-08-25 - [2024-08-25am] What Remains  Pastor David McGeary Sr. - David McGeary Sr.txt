short testimony uh uh sometimes a lot of times when we go through Tres U and we remember that verse in Romans that's says uh everything works together for good for those that love the Lord sometimes our human thinking start thinking right that minute like what's the good that would come out of this um but that's just our human thinking um because even in this world we'll get to see the good that comes out of it uh uh I used to have uh stomach trouble upset a whole lot uh so I was uh referred to the G uh I think they all they do is everything inside your tummy and so when they did their test and their scanning everything they said they saw a parasite that could lead to an ulcer so they told me I have to use a antibiotics for two weeks uh it was the most miserable time of my life cuz that two weeks was so bad the medication was just bad uh but I then I used it I didn't bother I was just like okay it is just what it is I didn't bother going back to do the test or anything but then my doctor now did an extra referral to say hey I need you to something to check your colon or something like that so I did the first test well they came back and said it wasn't clear that I would have to do it again I was like okay I just didn't bother thinking about it and then they my doctor referred me again and I went back and when I went back this time um and did the test and did everything um they came back and said they found maybe a quarter of an inch type lump or I don't know what to call it but it's some something swollen in there and that could potentially lead to cancer um and then you know they took it out they said they took it out and then they tested it and when the test came back they said it's nothing it's just something malignant or something like that and so I just want to thank the Lord for that that uh everything that happens happen for good and so I sing this song be of good courage I'll start it somehow be of good courage God spake unto Joshua when Reaver got Point head Away Jordan uncrossable things seems impossible Waters divide as the man and obey God any reverse you think are un crossable God any mountains you can turn the true God Specializes in things thought impossible and he will do what no order Park can do B is to win they would meet with their obstacles Jerico's War to must fall to the ground God never failed he stood back off his promises walls had to crumble as they marched around God and reverse you think are crossable God any mountains you can't on the TRU God Specializes in things T impossible and he will do what no order Park can do God is the same and his word is Dependable he'll make a way through the waters for you life situations by him are mendable mountains and Hills he will part for you too God any rever you think are uncrossable Goden mountains you can turn the truth God Specializes in things thought impossible and he will do what no other part can do amen amen man aren't you glad you serve the god of impossible amen it has to get impossible for you to know that he God amen amen it's an announcement that uh the directory pictures will be taken today so uh if you don't have your pictures in the

of this is we we want God to move we we we we do what men can do you want to make sure people are fed they have a place to stay and all of that but above all I I we're talking with the youth I believe Friday we just talked about them we want to come expecting for God to move we want to see God move in the hearts and lives of people that whether it be a visitor whether it be one of us God will move and it will change Liv lives and that's the purpose for the meetings so um even as we go through all of this our focus should be on on on that we expect the Lord to come and move in a mighty way and do according to his word that's what we desire above all amen there will be a a choir practice this uh after this morning service so all of those that are in the youth choir uh please stay behind so you can uh practice the songs that you uh you're going to sing through the meetings but G writes a prayer request he says I asked a prayer for a friend named uh Abraham he said he was involving a car

look upon us with kindness with Mercy father seeing our fraility as human beings and how easy that we're LED from one place to another but Lord we know that you gave us a promise that nothing would pluck us out of the palm of your hand and that if you started a work in us that you would finish it till the end father we've come this morning that you might encourage us along the way that you might speak to us to our hearts as individuals father that you might lift our burdens and carry them for us father that we might love you more come to know you more come to serve you better we ask that you would Grant these things to us this morning in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning if you have your Bibles you turn with me to St John The Gospel of St John we'd like to read in the 14th chapter of St John I thought I took my hair I have a pair right here thank you it's nice to have sister Lesley with us this morning uh people are starting to wonder if we were still together but uh We've made it 50 some years guess we if the Lord carries we'll make it for another 50 uh uh she's got a lot of patience and endurance so we certainly trust that each one when I think I heard that cosin was back from uh Romania uh getting ready to go back and serve the Lord there so we're nice to have him with us this morning uh let's read this great scripture and we just want to share have some fellowship with you this morning let not your hearts be troubled uh that's quite a place to stop right there wouldn't it be uh not not to let your hearts be troubled uh I I I think our hearts get troubled because there's uh there's a troublemaker in the land today amen and so say let their hearts not be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also amen and whether I goeth ye know and the way ye know and Thomas said unto the Lord Lord Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if ye had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him our gracious father we ask you to bless these words to us in your precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated this morning you know I just have a little thought on my heart this morning uh uh maybe word words of comfort in a way maybe words of understanding uh in this great uh hour that we live in you know we live in uh the Bible described it as perilous times in other words uh in fact I've never in my time that I've been here I remember uh we felt one time that we are on the verge of War when the Cuban Missile Crisis came most of you I don't think were born then but uh uh Russia started moving uh um ballistic missiles to Cuba and they were going to put uh missiles on Cuba and which is only 90 Mi away from the United States and that became an intimate threat it became a danger and uh I I believe the president at that time was uh John F Kennedy back in the early 60s and they decided that they would put a naval blockade up and so we got our warships and we put them out around Cuba and we said that we're going to stop it and the world was uh we didn't know what was going to happen it was uh a great uh time of peril and uh I remember uh in school that we started uh having uh air raay drills uh you know in case of an attack and we would all get down uh on the ground and put our heads under our desks we we look like a bunch of ostriches uh you know in our classroom all down on our knees with our our uh heads under the desk and and we we did that everywhere and everybody was putting in bomb shelters uh there was little bomb shelters going up everywhere people digging holes in their backyard and sticking little Barrels in there uh because we thought there was perilous times we thought that uh any moment we could be under a nuclear attack and it's amazing what PR CS people will take uh maybe not even thinking them through uh I remember looking at the photographs of hirosima after they dropped that atomic bomb and I began to realize no little school desk would have saved me from that you know what I mean and no little hole you dug in the ground and went and hide would hide you from that but I'm glad I've got a better hiding place you know what I I mean I'm glad I've got something that can take me through the time of peril that I I have something that's just not temporary but something that's uh permanent you know something that's longlasting and and it brought me to the little uh uh uh text what remains after you know what remains after uh a a lot of things that uh we go we go through and and and so now we know that there's trouble in the Middle East and and there's trouble in China and uh they're they're worried about China invading Taiwan and they're fussing over the The Straits of Taiwan and boats are coming closer to one another and planes are coming close to one another and and Iran is a a threatening to shoot missiles on Israel and and uh uh that's pretty scary and and what's even more scary is we've got a possibility of of of a a woman president a very real possibility all these things were prophesied to us you you know what I mean and and uh uh I I don't know the time and the hour of them but I I know that uh that these are uncertain times there there there times that are shaky and and there there are times that are perilous and we even know that even spiritually uh we know that that uh these are great spiritual times within the individual trying to work their their way through the problems of life trying to work their way through their attitudes trying to work their way through their thinking uh how how how to deal with the Temptations of Satan and the battles that go on in our mind and the circumstances that are arising all around us it it it it just it causes a very uh uncomfortable atmosphere and especially with the financial times and the the conditions of finances that uh are are the money is not what it used to be you know uh I I've seen these charts and that you know we used to pay so much for eggs and now we're paying this much for eggs and I I saw a cartoon a guy went to pay his bill and the autom mechanic said I would rather have a dozen eggs you you you know what I mean that that uh money's becoming worthless and all these things are working towards something you understand there's something there's something beyond what what is is going on uh yeah there's uh we don't always know what's happening but we know that there's somebody in control and and we know that the world belongs the that to the prince of this air uh of this world and he's the prince of this world but but we don't belong to him we belong to somebody else that's got a different plan for us and and so the as the great perilous times come and and and uh we realize that you know a brother Bram made this statement see if I can find it here he says if we know the word of God we know where we're living we know the hour that we're living in we know what lies ahead we see what we've passed and and so you know what lies ahead you know what's after all this so we've seen what's passed you know the the reason that the world is in confusion the way that we're in confusion is because Satan's the author of confusion I mean things that you wouldn't think were even logical people have actually accepted thinkings in their mind and they're being manipulated by uh U uh voices in fact we're we were told our messenger came and told us he said that this is an age of many voices there's so many voices out there and they're pointing to everything he said but yet there's only one voice that points to Jesus Christ so there there's lots of voices so you've got to sit back and and and understand hey I'm not worried about listening to their explanation I should know where I stand by the word of God we we know that the modern events are made clear by prophecy they're not made clear by politics they're not made clear by uh geography they're not made clear by things they're made clear by Divine prophecy another we we know by God's word that perilous time shall come we know that this world is going to perish we we know that it's corrupt we know that because we saw four hor horse riders go out and we know that that last horse rider was pale he was he he was confusion he was all kinds of stuff mixed together and the very thing of this lady o see and age is not to be lukewarm what is lukewarm hot or cold he said I would that you were cold I would that you're hot but if you're just lukewarm if you're just uh uh halfway in and halfway out if if you're not committed if you're trying to hang on to the world and hang on to the things of God but he's saying I can't do anything for you prophet of God said I wish I could get the bride to keep still long enough to dress herall he tells the story of the time that he was wanting to help a lady and and she come up and and he trying to and and she was just oh brother random you know I I'm this and the spirits this and Allie was trying to say is sister would you be still for a moment would you be would you just be quiet let me go inside and let me find out what's wrong with you let the spirit reveal to me what your problem is but she would never she wouldn't stay still you know she wouldn't sit she and so that the spirit could discern what it was and and and she walked off and the prophet of God said she just walked right away from her healing I think he probably said she probably ended up with cancer or something whatever it was maybe you recall the story but it's something to be still and know that he's godall you know don't it it it it's like washing clothes excuse my but you know the thing's all agitated right and it's rinsing and watering and shaking and Bubbles and it's going on but you're not worried about what the process is you're worried what comes after right you're looking for some clean clothes you know you don't walk up to your machine and and say wow look at all everything's all in turmoil in there and and this and that and it's spinning around as fast as it can go you know you you you know that there's something that comes after and and no matter what that he stirs up or no matter what place you find yourself there's got to be something in our hearts that we know that there's something that comes after there's something that comes after you know what comes after the storm you know when the storm's on the it's it's frolicking it's it's tossing and it's stormy and it looks like there's there looks like there's a a great thing the prophet God said it's like kind of like a Revival you know I mean everything gets going and everything but what comes after the Revival well what's supposed to come after the Revival is all the junk is washed up on the beach and a and the water becomes still again and it's clean and it's still and it's went through a period of cleansing is it it's went it went through a a period of restoration and to revive means to be brought back again it's not the excitement it's not the Revival itself it's what comes after that's important what's a conclusion of the matter it's not the matter itself you know people fuss they argue they they negotiate they do all this stuff they they but when it's all said and done you know it doesn't do you no good if you don't if you have a big sit down and talk it out and you don't finish it out you know if you walk away with bitterness still in your heart or you're you're not happy with with your part in the situation that'll just breed Like A little leaven you know pretty soon it'll just leaven up in you and it'll start rising up again and it'll start coming you never got to the matter you never got to the purpose purp and you never finish the course you know it's like repenting when you repent you got to repent of it all you know you got to BR you got to get down before the Lord and you got to pour it all out there you got you got to lay it all it don't feel good it don't feel good to admit it it don't feel good to face your failures it don't feel good to to know that you've been there 50 times but all that feels bad but what comes after it when it's done right you know what comes after it I I I grew up I was Irish I had a temper and and you know when you do something long enough you like it I got in fights I fought all the time I just like to fight of course I got beat up a lot cuz I wasn't very big but you know when I had some fights and when it was all said and done those people became my best friends cuz we put all the fighting behind we put all the disagreements behind that wasn't important you know what I mean it what it's what came after and and I think so many times we don't we don't really look to what comes after and Jesus said these words be not troubled you know don't don't be troubled in other words well yeah we're troubled you know look around these are troubl as times you know we know it's hard on you economically we know your paycheck doesn't go we know your grocery bills and you know and we sit back and we say well we know we've got bills here too you know we don't have any we don't have any way to to pay our bills without you yeah it brings trouble but the bottom line right who's in control you understand that we we can't sit back and I'm not going to sit up here and say we need no more money or who will give $20 or who will give $100 or uh or come up with this and say well we need to pay this this month you know who will dig into their pocket you know you don't have to do that if you know there's a spirit that's in control if you know that there's somebody that knows the beginning from the end so you don't have to focus on the trouble you don't have to focus on the situation you can you can begin to look in your heart and says what comes after what comes after this pressure what comes after this trial what comes after this What's following you know what what what's going to remain when this time passes what is it that I am going to take possession of and have can you imagine I think that's if I'm not mistaken the definition of insanity they say is to do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result you know J it's like having some hot wire there right and going up and grabbing a hold of it and and it shakes you a little bit and you know my dad he used to get on a board he'd had rubber boots in a board and he stand in the board and he'd touch that wire and it wouldn't hurt him and I'd walk up there in my shoes and my boots and I'd touch it and just shake me all the pieces you know what I mean and I he said no no it don't shock you and he'd take it and and I thought I go but let me tell you something after about the third time I wasn't about to touch that wire because it may not have shocked him that's fine but it was shocking me right so I realized what come after when I touched it it didn't matter for him it didn't matter what he was doing it didn't matter that he got the wool pulled over my eyes you know I had to deal with what the result was on me what the effect was on me you know we see a lot of people that get away with things we wonder why they're blessed you know that we wonder why they Prosper we wonder why all those things but that ain't the end of the matter what comes after it what comes after what comes after at the Judgment seat what comes after when they got to face the reality and the truth of what they've done can't compare yourselves one to another this never was a group Affair never will be a group Affair it isn't the acceptance of your personality it's the Revelation that's in your heart I know I've been born again I know I know that what I receive from him is eternal I know what comes out after this life that's what I'm sure of I'm sure of what comes after this life and that's why the church is built on divine revelation no matter who you marri no matter what your course is you can know what comes after what's going to remain when your life is over a character that's been formed in the fiery furnace of tribulation that you got up and kept going you fell you crawled out of the mud you walked through the thorn Pat you went through the dry places you you went through the droughts you went through the Showers of Blessings you went through all those things but when it was all said and done what remains after all of your life what remains in my father's house I've gone to prepare a place for you I just think of so many things the the prophet said that just that strike me so much and things that are to be he made this St statement he says it was easy for those Jews who have been taught through generations to believe that there was a great Supernatural God so they belied that there was a great Supernatural God that's the god that they worshiped they worshiped a God that was a far off they they would go generations with just remaining in their traditions because they weren't taught the promise to come if they were taught that one day Jesus would show up and a virgin shall conceive and one day the Brokenhearted would be binded and the sick would made whole and the blind would see if they would have been taught generation after generation they would have recognized it when he came but they were just Tau that he was you know what what could do us to teach that there is a God we don't want a God that's out out there we want a God that's here we want a God that's that's in control of the circumstance that's going to show us what remains after this life that's what we want we want the outcome I watched a guy do a thing one time it's very hilarious you ever see those guys put X's and O's and and all those do do those stupid looking math problems you know like Einstein's theory or relativity you know what I mean so this guy he did all this great big stuff and he puts a two in there and he does all the but the whole bottom line of his whole thing was 2 plus two is four and the answer was four it didn't matter if AAL Z and and B * 2 = F2 you know oh yeah when I walked into class and they put that on the board I grabbed a tape measure I said that what good does that do I couldn't make no sense of it but the whole thing of it is it doesn't matter all the problem what's the what's the outcome of it what Remains What remains and so he said this he said to believe that there was a great Supernatural God but to think that that God had come down and manifesting himself through the person of of his son Jesus Christ God tabernacled in a body of Flesh that was a little too much for them to understand they couldn't grip that they could grip God being up there they could grip God that he could do anything they can understand that God was Supernatural but understand that that God could come down and Veil himself in a the very appearance that they were in also cuz they didn't see God they saw a man the only time a man showed up was when that man did something Supernatural that was beyond a human being then they knew that was God like the blind boy he said I don't know where he comes from I don't know this but you're the great rulers of Israel you tell me how he took mud and made me de see whether he be a devil or not I don't know but the one thing I know I was blind and now I see I know what Remains What remains is my eyesight and if they could they would have taken it away from him yeah they told me he's a devil and threw him out I'm trying to bring something that if we get so caught up in what's going on and we don't understand where it's going what it's leading what the outcome what we're expecting to have when it's all finished then then we we end up in this great time of it's almost a lukewarmness we don't know which way to walk we don't know which way to stand we don't know what we're believing we don't know we don't know what's going to happen they just couldn't stand it he said but now as you have believed in God believe also in me for in my father's house are many mansions and I go to prepare a place for you Jesus life was fixing to end here on Earth he had showed the people and proved to them that he was Jehovah manifested in flesh by great signs and wonders all right but that isn't what he really was pointing to he said great signs and wonders and re references of the Bible that he had referred to himself and he proved that he was God manifested so now that was that's what he did but he wanted to them to know what comes after what Remains What remains after what he did what remained after the signs and wonders what remained after the Miracles yes that that was what he really wanted them to finally come to was what remains what's the substance what's the purpose why did he do all these signs and wonders what good would it have done if it had just been a Revival or just been a season of blessing what was important is what remained after and this is what he he concludes he he says now he said when you see my life ending it's ending for a purpose I'm going away to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also Jesus therefore is telling his disciples that this life is not the end in death amen this life is not ended in death how many of you been through trials and you just thought this is the end of it all you had more bills than you had money you know what I mean you you you got bills stacked here and your cars broke down in the driveway I've been there you know living out on an old road somewhere and and just what am I going to I'm going to try to hit shik into work see if I can make it there at time finally get down to work and everything and then then they fire you and you don't know and you're laying on your floor crying out to God oh God what am I going to do my rent $60 a month you you can go to McDonald's and drop 60 bucks and just lying there they didn't matter what the trial was God knew what was going to come after he knew what the outcome and and and we know this he says this to us he says now your birth was pre-planned I guess you believe that every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned did you know that you're being here never originated just at a myth or a thought everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here if he could if he knew that you'd be here he knew your trial he knew what you were going to go through he knew what what was going to come upon you he knew the test he knew the the all the great results that and circumstances that you would be in he's never really been so concerned about what you're going through as what comes after what was trials given for anyway what was the fiery furnaces given for anyway to build character how how come he takes a vessel sometimes and completely breaks it down and remolds it because that's the love of God another form of love of God there's not if we get so hung up with what is temporarily transpiring around us it's transpiring so fast you can't figure it out you've got to have a divine revelation that there's something that comes after this whatever period we're in whoever ends up in that white house what whoever ends up in the war no matter what the bombs drop what everything I'm not concerned about the Battle I'm not concerned about the trial I'm not concerned about the blessing I'm concerned what remains does my Revelation still hold steadfast am I still true to everything I believe some men have come up with clever ways to explain the the the picture of the cloud I don't know where where it is where's it at is it up here anywhere I guess it's in the back brother Tim made a beautiful oh they got all kinds of explanations for that they got all explanations for every Miracle brother down they red decline they said I can't find no record of this they can't oh all the trials and all the voices what remains there's nothing can be laid to the charge of God's elect because the seed of God remains in them I can't be hung up I thought of these great Bible stories I I like this like David and and I I always I thought the the story of David always strikes me so much you know the story of David David's anointed to be king right all he all Samuel says go down to the house Jess he one of those guys down there I'm going to make King man he starts with the biggest and ends up with the Run got to be a mistake no because God's not con concerned about the middle he's concerned about the end that's right so David's anointed well David goes out and tend sheep right he's out there just doing sheep doesn't seem like nothing to him right but you know who was tendon sheep king of Israel that was who was tendon sheep now that was who was tendon sheep was one that was going to write some of the most inspirational parts of the Bible to guide us through psalms and and through worship and and and write book of wisdom and and and poetry that uh would remain in the hearts of of the believer forever the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want oh hallelujah look what remained after all that time being shunned in the desert right look at at all that time of being mocked by his brothers and and and being hid from everything what remained a book of Psalms that blesses us today and you know the story he goes out there and and and so everybody go Philistines come in and and everybody goes out to war and his brothers go up there and and so David comes in you know he slew a lion he slew a bear nobody out there he didn't even get a chance to testify about it he was burning up to testify about it he was just wanting to tell every everybody how God delivered a lion from him God delivered a bear you know what I mean nobody listen to him hey man finally he got a chance in front of a giant he said God slew a lion God slew a bear Hallelujah he was wanted to testify he was burned up to testify he' been stuck out in the pigeon hole somewhere you know sometimes a lot of people get to think that they're being pigeon Hol they won't use me for this they don't use me for that they Don't Preach me they don't do this they don't do that let me tell you something no problem being in the pigeon hole God's got a time it's what remains when it's son said and done I've I've seen lots of people come to the Paul but lots of people with great popular Ministries lots of people that everybody flocked to lots of people that people sang their praise and they don't even believe the word of God today it's what remains it's what's steadfast it's what's inside you don't worry if you don't get your glory here you just probably be sitting in a wonderful place at the supper he who humbles himself shall be exalted and he who exalts himself shall be humbled it's what remains what's important not what's temporarily blowing through and traveling through it what's endure what's a - tested Memorial how does it stand up in the face of the trials fun to plant a garden but it's tough when the drought comes it's tough when the raccoons come and the deer come it's tough when the sunburns and and and he goes through a hard season but if it produces fruit you don't dig it up you stay with it so David goes and and you know the story so finally he comes up he goes to bring some bread up to the guys right so he comes up there they bring some bread and and uh this Philistine comes out and challenges him and David wants to know who is this Philistine who is this guy that's mocking the armies of the Living God what what is this now everybody else is is is totally caught up in the circumstance in the appearance of the circumstance the appearance of the circumstance is that the Philistines are about to take everything that they have but David knew one thing they were not going to take his kingdom amen right it was promised to him so he makes an inquiry he says what is going to be given to the man that defeats this giant see David was interested in what remained what comes after if I go kill this guy I'm not go out there and risk my life and kill this guy if I don't get a blessing he was looking you he says when this guy goes down what will remain what do I lay my possessions on what do I have when you go through a trial or you go to something remember that God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek them that's right it's his good pleasure to give you the kingdom it's not bad it's not wrong to expect God to give you a blessing David wanted to know what it was in that I believe it's Samuel uh 17 he makes this statement and the minute he and he came and so and the man of Israel said have you seen this man that is come up surely to defile Israel he has come up and it shall be that the man who kth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in Israel in other words wipe out all debt wipe out everything that's laid to their charge he'll enrich him and he'll give him his daughter in other words to be wed and to be part of the Kingdom so David says this is what comes after he expected so what what I'm trying to say is there may be goliaths in your life life there may be things that have risen up that seem impossible a wayward child a a job situation A a financial situation none of those job Giants matter I like that song that brother with this sh this trial shall be a blessing sure your face in a child but you have to know beyond a shadow of an out after you go through this trial what will remain what will be there what will be the outcome of it what will be the end of the matter the end of the matter is God keeps care of his children and that's what he did he went up and he got in front of that giant and he finally had a chance to testify here's this looking on there and David is having a jubilee praise God he delivered me from The Lion praise God he I killed the bear Hallelujah you know I I was doing this and that Giant's looking at him what's going on with this guy so it wasn't in the Revival it's what came after the Revival and what followed the Revival was the death of Goliath and if you have a Revival in your life or you have a meeting that you go to and the spirit of God moves and you you shout and you run and you praise God that's wonderful but if the Giants not [Applause] killed what good was it you got to look at I feel the spirit Lord what's the what's going to remain after this Spirit leaves cuz the spirit is like a wind it blows and it comes and it moves when you don't know that it's going to move that's why they always tried to beat up the spirit beat it up with music beat it up with temple beat it up with exciting preaching and everything and what Remains What re what remains after it's gone just a desire and that's the prophet says the minute the Music Stops the worships gone it's good to have an outside blessing but if that blessing that the remainder of that blessing isn't a Fountain of Living Water springing up in your heart it'll just leave you thirsty and if you don't kill the giant if you don't cut his head off if you don't put an end to them you just got a temporary reprieve you got to finish the job sir if you get a blessing and the spirit of God Falls in you and I don't care if you run the aisle I I I I praise that you'd worship God but let me tell you something when that leaves and you walk out the door go apply the token kill the giant they just didn't kill the giant they pursued the Philistines and slew them all we stop at the blessing and we don't go on to see what remains after David had a he had a shouting fit man he been wanting to tell everybody now he's telling this great big guy that don't believe that don't un belief don't stop God someone don't want to hear your testimony tell them anyway right you're un fire but fire is to burn stuff out that's what the fire of the Holy Spirit does it burns all the droth out it burns the stuff out so you got to kill the giant and he gets far and he kills and he kills a giant I I just I I love that because it was what remained afterwards what did David get afterwards he ended up living in the King's house he ended up having Jonathan as a booom friend of course the king got jealous you know the story but David ended up on the throne and he ended up being Del laay the rest with his fathers he ended up producing the lineage of of the the great king of kings and Lord of lords it's just what comes after sometimes what comes after comes after Generations people who stood for this message went around showing the film everywhere mocked and and and and everything the the fruits of their steadfastness are are rising up today the seeds that they planted the encouragement that they gave the things that they stood for the approach that they have though mocked in their season it wasn't what was going on in the season it's what remained that was important it's what remains I like the story of Daniel you know the story of Daniel we all know the story of Daniel Daniel the children of Israel they were taken over Daniel went through all kinds of stuff all the time they built an idol to him and made wanted people to worship Him Shadrach mhack the bedy go into the furnace they went don't we love that story we love all these great stories right it wasn't the fire that was the important thing right it's what re what came after it's what remained what remained of all the fire one standing in their midst liken unto the Son of God that's what remain Daniel's great story and just kind of coming to a close the this morning you know that Daniel Prayed three times a day he was well respected and his God was well respected the king respected Daniel and his belief they refused to eat the the king's bread they wouldn't eat un koshered food and they never got sick they prospered they did well God blessed them everything seemed to be going good in their lives captive children but you know what they did it's like that story brother man tells like about the slave they were in captivity but they acted like children of Israel they kept the law they kept the Commandments they were true and steadfast of their worship he had a habit of praying three times a day which was his tradition and the and Daniel got set up you know sometimes you get set up get false witness born against you or you get accused of things you know you find yourself in situations that are totally unfair and all you do is you get ate up with it this is unfair this shouldn't be that way you know on and on and on and on go back to your father Abraham Abraham was set up by God go kill your son really yeah offer your son up what did he do he didn't go to the circumstance he didn't go all through oh how am I going to cut his throat or how am I going to do this he went through the process but he had his eye on what would remain he knew his son had to remain cuz he was a promised son you know that you have to remain standing no matter how hard they come against you cuz you've got a place in a Rapture you've got a place in a kingdom it doesn't matter what devices that they rise up against you the Lord will provide the an regardless of what devices they come up with regardless of what stories regardless of what rumors regardless of how unfair it is you didn't get the class you wanted you didn't get this you wanted you didn't get that you wanted oh my my whole career shot do you got a mansion are you is it coming again for you what's the end what remains when all this is gone what remains that's what's important what Remains What remains of you after you've been criticized and mocked and falsely accused and and spit on and Crown of Thorns put on you and whipped and you've been through all those great things what remains when it gets down to the all the onion peel is is pulled away what's really down on the inside what remains you know what remain for the Lord forgive them Father they know not what they do when it was all Stripped Away mock humiliated and everything you know what remained the love of God it was a fountain the spirit of God remained and it shed its love abroad even to those that condemned him when he found the woman at that was caught in adultery and he finally looked at he says where are your accusers she said there's none to accuse you Lord but me he said neither will I accuse you go and sin no more look what remained after that look at what her life was look at what her testimony was because of what God done for her and so we know Daniel so these guys set Daniel up 30 days nobody prays to any other God to honor you oh King now if anybody's going to ask for anything they ask for you it's against the law for 30 days to ask well they knew Daniel was going to go pray Daniel didn't have a 30-day compromise Daniel didn't have a three-hour compromise Daniel didn't have any compromise he wasn't going to give up on the word of God Paul said I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God to Salvation if they cut off my head they cut off my head I am not going to deny I have not been disobedient to the heavenly vision well you're going to go to you're going to go to Rome and you're going to be Tried by Caesar he said the Lord told me what things I'd have to suffer for his name's sake and then when it finally came down to Paul saying what finally remained after all his trials after all his imprisonment he worked just the same through it all he labored through it all he preached through it all he stood steadfast through it all he was pure as gold through it all and when it finally come down he said I ran a good race I ran a good race I fought a good fight now I go to receive the Crown of Glory that's laid up for me that's was what remained for Paul after it all a Crown of Glory is what remained he was more concerned in what remained than what went on what are you going to be on the other side of your test I like last Wednesday night when Heidi testified I almost threw my computer through the ceiling that's it the joy of the Lord is my strength the joy of the Lord's my peace I'll give you peace that's your pathis understanding Joy unspeakable that's what's matter it's not the trial it's what's remain you if you if you can if the joy of the Lord Still Remains there if the peace of God Still Remains there if the steadfastness for the commitment Still Remains there if the lack of compromise Still Remains there then you know beyond the shadow of a doubt in my father's house are many mansions he's going to come and receive me but we forgot that we forgot what the end of the matter is we just want to bet ease we wanted to fix every little tra travel every little problem that we travel through Life's a constant Warfare the only thing is is we know what remains when the battle's over we know what remains when the wor worlds consumed by Flames we know what remains we know what remains after Daniel gets thrown into the den right they they they close up the door and now the king he can't sleep good King huh he knew he got trick in the law he couldn't even go back the scripture says he worked day and night politicking around trying to figure out a way that he could get out of the circumstance that he was in I appreciate that that's somebody with integrity that's somebody you know so many times boy if someone gets in a fix we're so ready to take the side of the finger pointer oh I knew brother McGary was a creep oh I knew he really didn't believe someone gives a false accusation I thought so not this guy he knew Daniel was a man of God he witnessed it himself he had taken his wisdom he had seen the results of his counsel and the first little opportunity that came to throw him under the bus he didn't do it he got tricked he tried to make it right and those guys held him to it the law of the MEO Persian says if a king makes a decree it cannot be taken down because if it is it'll destroy the Integrity of that office it must get fulfilled and the King was forced to it he put Daniel in there and he put his seal on it because that's what the law required and he went home and was up all night long he did everything to do it but I like what he said when he put Daniel in the grave he said then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and cast him into the Den of Lions now the king spake and said unto Daniel thy God whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee H Hallelujah and then then so the king gets up and he he runs he runs and then when it came he said the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel and the King spoke and said to Daniel oh Daniel servant of the Living God is thy God whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the Lions Hallelujah then he said then Daniel then said Daniel un to the king oh King live forever my God has sent his angels and has shut the lion's mouth and they have not hurt me for much as as before so much as before him innocence was found in me and also before thee O King have I done no hurt what a testimony Daniel wasn't Daniel knew one day Israel would be restored he knew that Kingdom would come he was true to it no matter how ugly this world gets you stay true to this message no matter how they mock you no matter what they call you no matter if they call you homophobic or racist us or uh whatever terms that they have uh to degrade you I'm not ashamed of this [Applause] message but here's a little side note and the you know so Daniel gets up right and the King commanded and they brought those men which had accused Daniel and cast them into the Den of Lions them their children and their wives and the Lions had the master over them and break all their bones in place even they e or even they came at the bottom of the den you know why the king did that he was not going to leave one relative he wasn't going to leave anybody else to come and and exact Revenge on him and if you're going to get something out of your life get it all out don't leave nothing around to rise up again if you're going to lay aside something if you're done with sports be done with sports don't say all right I'm just I'm done with sports except for the playoffs I'm done with sports except for the this or except for that I'm not saying it's not lawful to do Sports it's fine I don't get in your lives concerning sports but I'm saying if you're going to do something do it all the way don't leave nothing remaining that can rise back up and come attack you that King did away with it all right that's why he told he he told uh Saul go out there and wipe them all out and then he says why I hear bleeding of lambs I hear this stuff what is this I hear oh they just saved out the good stuff we don't understand sometimes when we make a sacrifice but it's not the sacrifice it's what's going to remain after you get rewarded a h hundredfold in this life and the life to come we get too hung up in the temporary instead of what's coming after and and then and then this is the part I love the most so what followed Daniel the king made a decree and he said I make a decree that in every Dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the god of Daniel there was nothing more that thrilled Daniel's heart than to see his God lifted up is that the same with you this morning there's nothing more in your life that Thrills you than to have the word of God exalted and lifted up you're willing to Bear the reproach because you know after it's all said and done after all the criticism after Daniel being unjustly thrown in the de and I'm sure he thought how did I get in this condition I'm innocent before God oh King I've not done anything wrong but here I find myself he looked to what was going to follow that they fear before God the god of Daniel for he is the Living God and steadfast forever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed and his Dominion shall be ever until the end he in the reign of Darius in the reign of Cyrus the Persian you know it's not the trial it's the end of the matter and I think the greatest example of that is job job lived upright before God so much so that God could brag on on him I wish I could stand in front of you this morning and say God can brag on my life but all God's been doing for me is taking his blood and covering this and covering this and covering this and forgiving me of this and forgiving me of that but not job J lives so upright before God think of it so uprightly before God that God boast on him and the enemy came up and said oh he's just that way because you built a hedge around them it wasn't the blessings that made job it was the life that job lived that caused the blessings and job shared and he prospered and he was good and he gave and he took care of people he lived a real Christian Life and then all of a sudden the enemy was let loose on him he said you can do everything to him but take his life he took his family he took his cattle he took his sheep he took his land he took everything from him just think of it and finally his wife says why don't you just Curse God and die it's not worth going through it and then he has his good buddies come and all their theological explanations and everything trying to get job to change his Doctrine and change your stance and you know give up the picture of the pillar of fire give up the picture of the cloud give up this give up that don't do this don't do that you know it's all this trying to soften it all up make it easier and better he said no I'm not I'm going to stick with it I made the sacrifice he said he was just and forgive it I'll tell you what I'll do I'll go make a sacrifice in case my children when they all got done accusing him and he's finally on a as sheep scraping his boils and just miserable and they say why don't you curse God and die he said the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord it didn't matter what he was going through is what remained that was important and when it was all said and done what did job end up with and let me tell every time you go through a trial or every time you go through a time of blessing on the other end of that you should have a word promise you should have a promise you should have something that you've learned something that you've seen something that has given to you that know you know will remain Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away you've got something that that remains you got something that you you can hold on to you could you've got something that I've been through this storm I've been through this blessing so many people go through a blessing and they come out of the other end with nothing so many people go through trials and everything and the only thing they've got on the other side is they're glad it's over when you go through something look for what remains there should be a promise there there should be a Bible story you can grab a hold of there should be a future that you know a promise that you have that makes you partakers of divine nature and when it was all said and done what did job have oh he got everything restored back to him but you know something if he if you had it once and you lost it you can lose it again you can be healed from the sick and you'll get sick again you could have perfect health and the only thing that'll keep you from tasting death is the rapture but yet death has no sting grave has no Victory but when it was all said and done it get so it's so beautiful to me because when it was all said and done what remained what did job have in his possession that was worth more than cattle worth more than land worth worth more than everything he lost or the time that he suffered what was it that he possessed that he knew that he had a divine revelation of that that changed his life forever he was finally able to cry out and say these great words and though after the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God hallelujah that's what he ended up with what would you give in exchange for that no matter what happens to me Billy if I get sick if a disease takes me if I lose my mind if I if I I I can't remember anybody no matter what comes my course no matter what lays ahead of me no matter matter what hand has dealt me in that this life no matter if I'm thrown in a lion stand no matter if I've got to meet a Goliath if I'm falsely accused and evil spoken of what difference does it make if I could say though the skin worms Goliath a skin worm the Lions the skin worm accusations skin worms they're all things that come from this flesh and being here in this flesh what does it matter if they destroy me yet I shall see God job ended up with the same promise that Jesus gave him be not troubled in my house are many mansions and if it were not so I would not tell you I'd go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also and I can stand back and say I've Got a Mansion I've got a place I'm going I don't care if it my life doesn't turn out the way I wanted it to I don't care if I didn't get all the things I wanted I don't care if I didn't get all these things there's yet there's one thing I know though the skin worms eat my flesh yet in this flesh as I am I shall see God hallelujah it's what remains what's important if that promise can remain in you I've got eternal life I shall not taste the second death he can take every everything from me but he can't take that nothing can be laid to the charge of God's elect cuz the seed remains in him no matter what the storm blessings or storms and everything you should walk out on the other side of whatever you're going through with a word promise in your hand boy those guys done me wrong but I'm going to turn the other cheek sometimes you don't even know it I've told you this story before I was a electrician I was a c i i i was a foreman and a superintendent with some pretty big electrical companies did some pretty big jobs like Texas Instruments and different jobs and Kelly Moore Factory and things and and I I met a lot of electricians but I was on a job and everybody would make fun of me they'd laugh you know and at lunchtime I'd try to read my Bible or something and if I went into another room they'd sit on the other side of the wall and turn on ACDC as loud as they could could you know and they did everything they just mocked me and laughed at me you know called me name I I didn't care you know I just about my business I never realized I mean I wasn't going to change I couldn't help it but I just you know I I just thought you know I didn't really sign up for this but he signed me up for it and I so I I I went to this long time these guys they just they always laughed and they they talked about me behind my back I I I never could figure out talking about people behind their back what a waste of time you know what I mean if you don't like them they probably don't like you either so why give them the time of day don't let stuff eat you up don't let bitterness get in your heart and your mind it defiles everything but you know I I think I put some change one time in a Coke machine and and something went wrong with the Coke machine and all the money came out of that great big Jo Got Hand of quarters and so I took it and I brought it into the office those guys couldn't believe it you can't do that man you know don't what are you doing I'm bringing this money back to the office no we can buy Cokes with that their mind wasn't where my mind was and and your mind shouldn't be where the mind of the world is let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus and I remember I I was there and I remember that job and it went on and and and uh I was at a supply house electrical supply house and and you you backed into the supply house to load your supplies and everybody was fighting for parking places and all of a sudden this great big guy I mean he he was he he was a big ear and Ben and that's big and he probably about the size of Big John Beal and this guy come walking down the counter at me but he had a look on his face and he said are you David McGary and I thought here goes David and Goliath but I couldn't find no stones and he walked up to me and he looked down at me and he started crying and I said I said you look familiar to me he just balling great big guy balling he said I I've been looking for you for 3 years well here I am he said I wanted to tell you something he said I was one of those guys that made fun of you on that job out at Texas instrument and mocked you and put stuff in your lunch pil and hid your tools and and let air out your tires and and did all those all those stuff he says and I want to let you know that I've given my heart to the Lord Jesus Christ and he said it was the way that I treated you that brought me under conviction he says now I'm the youth minister at our church at the Burleson uh big Baptist Church in buron he said I want to thank you I want to thank you for staying true because it's made a difference in my life I didn't know what was going on then but it's what remained that's important guard your testimony stay true to the word of God don't worry about what you're going through your trials your tribulations don't worry about whether you're blessed a blessing is just like a trial it's just one way that God deals with your life to keep you balanced when you go through a blessing what remains after the blessing what ground do you gain what is it that you have what is it that you learn what Eternal possession do you take care hold of what promise because it's by these exceedingly great and precious promises that you become partakers of divine nature and I thought is that kindy looked at me that scripture came through my heart you stood for me and I'll stand for you and I believe that guy he may never come to this message but I'll tell you that act of humility showed me one thing he meant the same Jesus that I met right and I believe that'll be laid up for him as a reward that's in the hands of the father it's my job to know one thing it's what remains that that's important it's not what I go through it's not Daniel going into the den it wasn't David facing Goliath it wasn't job having everything taken from him it's what remained after they went through it that's what has the value God bless you this morning don't ever get shaken stay true to the kingdom let's Stand Together Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall remain forever amen amen what that song you unravel me I like that song like I would ever is that the right one doesn't he do that for you just think he
