jesus christ lord we ask and pray amen amen amen excited to be gathering his presence amen want to welcome everyone and certainly uh happy to have you all our visitors with us amen as you invite brother mike for so i'm reading this morning god bless you morning i don't know about you but every once in a while there's a maybe a portion of scripture or a chapter that as you read through it every single verse just just as a nugget that you could just spend a long period of time on and you know that's sort of the experience i had as i was reading psalm 138 we'll turn to that this morning you know in the lots of things stuck out on this one but you know i couldn't get past the first verse and uh you know it says in verse 1 i will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will i sing praise unto thee you know and it struck me what an unusual statement that was before the gods will i sing praise unto thee it seems like a strange thing for someone like david who is a man after god's own heart to say you know i i guess david was many things but he was not an idolater so when he talks about before the gods well i praise thee you know there were no other gods in his mind so it seems strange that this is a statement he would make as he's beginning to praise the lord you know there's example after example in the old testament about how david stood in stark contrast to all the other kings in this respect the fact that there were no other gods whereas the others tolerated accommodated worshiped other objects of worship and yet david always maintained that standard and yet it says before the gods will i sing praise unto thee an example of this is in first kings 14 and verse 7 this is a time when jeroboam one of the kings was seeking the council of the prophet that our hija and the word of the lord comes to him it says go tell jeroboam thus saith the lord god of israel for as much as i exalted thee from among the people and made the prince over my people israel and rent the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it thee and yet thou has not been as my servant david who kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in mine eyes but has done evil above all that were before thee for thou hast gone and made the other gods and molten images and provoked me to anger and hast me behind thy back and look at the contrast between the two and yet here's david before before the gods will i sing praise unto thee you know what's interesting is that hebrew phrase which david uses there before the gods means in full display in the face of something so in other words as all the other objects of worship were raised up around him instead of allowing a single part of him to make accommodation for it his response was is that he uttered a song of praise into the lord and so i got to looking at that a little bit but he put something on display in response to all these other objects of worship that were around the land in the day that he was in you know rather than just ignore them resist them not give place to them his response was to make something visible before the gods will i sing praise unto the lord you know what's interesting is the first few times that praise is mentioned in scripture it has it is mentioned in relation to producing life or bearing fruit in fact the very first time that the word praise is used in scripture is when leah names her son judah which means praise upon his birth you know leah was desperate for something to be born in her that would be something the father israel could identify with and then judah was born and there was praise unto the lord you know in leviticus the next time that praise is mentioned it's in regard to the fruit of the field that this will be a praise unto the lord you know when that scripture says before the gods will i sing praise there's a visible manifestation a visible demonstration of a song of praise unto the lord the funny thing about praise is it doesn't necessarily involve music kind of as we talked about a couple weeks ago you could sing every worship song in the book and it not be praise unto the lord and you could still have a life full of objects of worship and yet you can sing praise unto the lord without there ever being a single musical no but you know when there comes forth an utterance or a reflection out of your life in response to a work that god has done and he gets glorified for the work then there's praise being sung unto the lord and this was david's response when surrounded with all the objects of worship all the things that would demand his time and his affection and his efforts his response was to continuously have something presenting in his life that was giving praise to the lord this is a step beyond not get not allowing the enemy to have a place in our lives but this is an opportunity to visibly demonstrate something else in response to the call to worship and as david describes before the gods will i sing praise unto thee you know and here's the best part you know i just thought as the scripture even just as i'm saying that the scripture comes to mind when the enemy comes in like a flood the lord raises up a standard against that well what's a standard it's a flag it's something visible it's got an identification on it especially in battle especially in times of war so that people can see that identification and know what you're presenting but you know the best part is if you go to the end of psalm 138 and verse 8 this is not our work it's his work it says the lord will perfect that which concerneth me you know in just every single verse how david is describing his response to the work of the lord and his response to all the calls the worship from the objects of worship that surrounded him in that day you know how many are uh grateful for the opportunity that he's given us to present a praise unto him by the work that's done in our lives as his response to all the calls to worship that exist in the land today so i never got past verse one you know and as i looked at that i was so grateful that for whom he did for know you know he did predestinate to be conformed into an image of his dear son so that was a blessing it was to me i never got past that so if you see something else in the chapter you know i hope it's a blessing to you but let's read psalm 138 this morning it's just a short one starting in verse 1. i will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will i sing praise unto thee i will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name in the day when i cried thou answered me and strengthens me with strength in my soul all the kings of the earth shall praise thee o lord when they hear the words of thy mouth yea they shall sing in the ways of the lord for grace is the glory of the lord though the lord be high yet he hath respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth afar off though i walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me the lord will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy o lord endureth forever forsake not the works of thine own hands amen amen god bless you and i have yours with thanksgiving in my heart oh i will enter his coat with free will and i will sing this is the day that the lord [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] is [Music] [Music] me [Music] i [Music] oh [Music]

that they could come and join us amen god bless them amen also there will be an adult choir practice immediately after service this morning amen in the sanctuary amen we don't have any other written requests we certainly want to continue to remember sister karen for it and pray that god will certainly do a miracle for her and our sister heidi he would continue to pray for her that man we serve a living god amen nothing is too difficult for him and when i approach him with faith within our heart that he's able to give us what we have need of because it's part of his word amen man the brothers

invisible things of god are clearly revealed in the things that we see and to think that that's the god that loves us amen that's the god that's watching over us shepherding our lives and and he will not leave us nor forsake us amen let's approach him and para gracious heavenly father this morning father i trust that our lives are in the palm of your hand and that you said that nothing will pluck us from them and there are nail scarred hands lord that purchased what you hold and you mold it lord and you deal with it and you shape it into your very image father that thrills my heart to think that you're preparing us and molding us informing us father in a way that we can enjoy the great kingdom and the great eden that lies before us your wisdom is beyond all that we could think or understand lord i see you bless us this morning father with your word that you deal with hearts and we live in such a great hour of the mental battle so many voices and so many people trying to get us to the side one way or the other the lord we've purposed in our heart to take sides with jesus to live life with what he had in his thoughts to follow the actions that he demonstrated and to be like him we ask you to help us to that goal and that purpose this morning in your precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning if you have your bibles this morning let's turn over to the scripture that we've been reading um quite often uh here in the romans the eighth chapter and 11th verse as we're going to continue this morning and trust the lord will be your portion this morning this this scripture i guess we've read it every sunday for the last three or four sundays and it's still an astounding scripture it says but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you our gracious father we ask that you bless us this morning in your precious name we pray amen god bless you this morning we've been fellowshipping around this great subject of the quickening power and you know a lot of times that word power we look at it and we per we apply it in maybe the way of force or or over coming or dominating but this this power is a power that is so far-reaching that it covers every circumstance of life and we're going to listen to this morning to the rest of the easter seal and it's 45 minutes long and i i looked at it and i listened to it two times and i just couldn't find a place that i could break it off with because it this portion of the tape is so personal brother graham's talking about his life he's talking about his hopes he's talking about what this quickening power did for others and what it's done for him and also letting us know how that it changed his viewpoint and how it can change our viewpoint on the way we view the future the way we view death the way we view circumstances this gift that god gives us of his spirit the same spirit that raised up jesus christ from the dead the very spirit that gave him the power to overcome and to live a victorious life and to work his way through all the circumstances all the traps all the hatred all the words that were spoken of him criticized being called the else above all the stories that were told about him he had something that kept him and he's talking to us this morning that life has dealt us all uh very many difficulties i believe that we have an enemy and and he wants to be in total control the word of god says that he exalted himself above the angels to make the earth his throne and he wanted to have dominion over the stars and we know those are the stars or the messengers to the ages so we have this great uh force that is trying to build his own kingdom his own eden so we have someone of great power and and we don't fight against carnal things that we can hold by hands but we fight principalities and powers in high places and these great principalities empower his trying to make a world that he gets worshipped in and that's what he did he wanted to make himself the object of worship and even from the very our birth we're disadvantaged you say at your disadvantage yes you are born in sin shake and iniquity and you come into the world speaking lies you lie when there's no reason in the world to lie you don't even know why you lie the first time your mother said little johnny did you eat any cookies and there's crumbs on your thing and you got a cookie in your hand and you say no you know it's the very nature you possess you're born defeated so you could never accomplish the kingdom of god and i and i think when you realize that it in our own lives it ought to have us extend a lot of mercy and grace to those in life around us you know it it's easy to point thinkers but and it's easy to be discouraged but uh we we're totally helpless and we you know men make great efforts to overcome things but without the grace of god you just can't that's right uh you just can't win so god gave us this gift of his quickening power he even told his disciples go into this room up here and wait until you are endured with power from on high i will not leave you comfortless in other words i'm not going to leave you alone on this journey i i will come and i'll be with you even in you till the end i will lead you into all truth and righteousness and this is this power that he's talking about this easter that when the lord resurrected he sent this spirit back onto his church in measure in other words in accordance that he'll give you whatever portion of that spirit that you need to make it amen if you come into more difficult times or more difficult situations he will increase that portion of the spirit on you to overcome so he we're in the palm of his hands and he he's he's here and he's telling us that that i i'm i'm sending you my spirit back onto the church and i know that we're not worthy of it we're only worthy of it because he paid the price for us it's his gift and we we talked as we went down through it that when a man the spirit of god goes out and it convicts a man you don't even come into conviction by yourself the spirit of god by the word of god convicted you you heard the word and you knew it applied to you and you knew you were doing wrong and there's something in your heart that says this isn't right a very conscious of man knows and he comes down he knows that he needs god and he cries out and he he's sorry and then god sees that he's sorry so he sends his spirit to that person it's like a seal it's like a ticket yeah if i could express it that way it's something that goes out and lets you know that okay i forgiven everything that you've done everything that's laid to your charge my blood has totally washed it away i'll give you a token of that i'll give you something that identifies to you that your whole slate has been wiped clean connect his spirit and i think where the church has failed so much as we've taken that great spirit and we've turned it into religion we've we've turned it into uh rituals and practices and teachings but that spirit is a person himself it's like a friend it's like a buddy it's like someone collect that that is that never leaves you or nor forsakes you he says i didn't call you i call you friends and and so he's befriended us and he's here to help us all the way through and so if this this great quickening spirit is not just something that comes at one time in your life but it's an ongoing relationship of god pouring his grace and his mercy and his forgiveness and intervening in your life and doing things for you and making the way for you and opening up the path for you so that you will get to the end of this journey and back to where that you came from and uh so that that is uh just such a a a wonderful thing to understand so this morning the last part of this tape is in kind of an altar call it's called worshiping an altar call and and when we come to that part i think when we're done with this 45 minutes i'll just have billy come up and lead us in some singing and i'm not going to add anything to it and we will just go at the end of this uh at the end of worship but through this time if if you don't have this quickening power in other words you don't have god working in your life overcoming for you and helping you you understand it's not you against god it's god for you it's god for you the only one that's against you is the enemy that's the only one that doesn't want you to get this power he doesn't want god in your life helping you and guiding you and talking to you and and and instructing you and convicting you he doesn't want the hand of god in your life because if the hand of god's in your life his life his power is not in your life and so he he he's just here pouring out his heart and pouring out his spirit because all that the father hath given me will come he wants to take his children back to the kingdom that they belong in and he's got to give them something that they can overcome by because they have no overcoming ability in themselves not in their mind not in their flesh not in their willpower because there's nothing okay look if satan's got you at whether he's got you in a mental state whether he's got you in a physical addiction a medical addiction i don't care what it is you are helpless you need some outside power to come in and deliver you to do something for you i i don't care you know your relationship could be in a wreck it doesn't matter what the circumstances are we cannot make it on our own we can't do it we don't have it in us to do it you're a liar you you know what i mean you were you that you're the what very formed you was iniquity unbelief and and and and so we're so we're born in such a defeated state but he's not going to leave you he loves you so much he's not going to leave you in that state and so when when as you listen to this he's going to tell us what it did for other people what this power did in other people's lives the effect it had on them so that you know if it did it for them it'll do it for you because we already went through that if it acted one way this way it'll always do the same thing so if it overcame one for one person and over if it cast out demons before it can cast out demons today it got rid of tormenting spirits it can get rid of tormenting spirits today if if you're you're you're warring in your spirit and in your mind the disciples did it all the time jesus said why do you murmur amongst yourself why do you think why do you go through all this stuff and then he would go heal them and and help them so he's here this morning for anybody that will sit back and and ask because he wants you to ask for it he wants you to say i want that that's what i want he wants you to look at what the world has given you the wages of sin is death and sit there and say no i don't want this i want this i want you i want peace that's her path to understanding i want joy unspeakable i want the love of god shed abroad in my heart i don't want to be bitter i don't want to be angry i don't want to live in contention i need healing in my life i i'm not happy and content in my present condition and that's what he's there for he said i've got something for that it's my spirit and i will give you my spirit and as you grow that spirit grows with you that power grows with you it it leads you and guides you and then when you come to the place that you can be placed as a son so that he tutors you by that spirit and then that same spirit empowers you to do works to go beyond your own self to go into others it it's it's a wonderful thing that god has for us this morning this great seal and and so he knows you have need of it he knows you can't get it on your own he he knows that your nature he knows your nature born in sin shape nate come in the world speak english he knows all that about you so he knows you need an intervention from the outside and i know i can use more of that spirit as the challenges grow we need more of that spirit so as you listened this morning i i trust with all my heart and and i just wanted to read a statement to you that as we've read and understand that we're kind of in that great resurrection now but i just would trust that this would be the comfort that each of us could have but if that quickening power is there you'll recognize like that little eagle that's his mama that's the word that's thus saith the lord that's what god promised that what was foretold that's exactly what happened we're beyond any shadow of a doubt potentially in the resurrection right now the saints getting ready to be taken up in the air that's where we are and we can't do it without this spirit so just so jesus was so full of this quickening power said if you can destroy this temple that took you 40 years you thought to build i'll raise it up in three days why why could jesus say that i want to ask you why could jesus say a thing like that he knew that he was amen i wish i could make that stick he knew who he was he knew that every word god had wrote in there of him he had fulfilled it he knew he was the one david spoke of that's right do you know you're the ones the bible speaks up do you know your position is in christ amen do you know your position is in christ not do you know your position in christ but do you know your position is in christ if you were in christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like everyday living to you why sure it's yours you are an eagle that's your food so when you listen to this it it doesn't matter if you're living a perfect life but if there's something in you that says that's where i want to be that's how that i want to be that's what he's looking for and if you want more of him this morning when we come to the end of this tape ask him for more ask him for more uh when i i i just break down when i hear this because brother branham's so torn in his heart he's so pleading with the people he his voice is cracking he knows he's been rejected he tells us this is his last easter he he alludes to the fact that he knows that his time is coming near and all he wants to do is make sure every believer has the gift of god which is eternal life in their life so god bless you this morning 45 minutes and we'll be that's all we'll we'll have so i'm done for this morning and i just hope that you listen i hope you enter into the spirit uh and become a part of it and then when we're done brilliant come and lead us in worship and be dismissed if anybody wants prayer just come up for prayer we'll be happy to pray with you we're going to start on paragraph 2 14 and and i just hope that you take the time to enter in this morning it'll be a blessing i prayed a lot about this whether to play this this morning and i couldn't get away from it so if you would just trust me this morning and then god richly bless you this morning bless you this little fellow sitting right here under this church now a few days ago that man believes little old boy had a cancer on his ear and he wouldn't say nothing about he's working up there at the house i've been on a hunting trip with him up there at the mosley brothers and brother dawson here was up here hunting brother william's son and i have to look over on his ear and i see his ear all swollen up and i said what's the matter donovan now here he said brother brent's been on a long time i don't know i just missed caught into the hand there that was a big cancer on his ear never said one word just held it without my brother in a day or two at that there wasn't even a scar left of it it was his respect amen to the god of heaven by his quaking power killed that cancer and spared the life of donovan wurtz back there it's ryan what is these things look at your people here in phoenix look at you people who's believed in this look the people who has this that lays their hands upon you watch what happens it's quickening power these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick that quickly power eagle two eagle something's gonna take place not equal to a buzzard won't work eagle to eagle raises from the barnyard to the heavenlies these signs shall follow them that believe and they're both in belief see that same quickening power of god represented in these two prophets elijah and elijah notice the same word one of them is ketchup the others caught up catch up and caught up see he was caught up we'll be catch up catch up with him meet him in the air be caught up to meet him in the air notice a bird has to have two wings to balance himself that right elijah was a translating wayne elijah elisha was a resurrection wing see both of them together representing the saints that are living and the saints that are going on remember quicken to see the past the curtains how these people were quickened back there to look past the curtain and see down in this time those prophets look at paul said in the last days how these people be acting call themselves christians he was a prophet full of the quickening power force sword come to pass we believe that don't we he received quickening power look at the quickening power today for telling things without one event missing not one time does it fail quickening power not the power of a man the power of god the power the abstract of easter the resurrected jesus has sent back the abstract to guarantee us that we're already quickened with him notice you remember the little book businessman you're looking to pass the curtain of time i began to get older knowing my days are getting shorter now i get real i play that little piece of them ladies saying a while ago i've had it for about 18 20 years now i want to talk it over lord they get out there and go to praying then that quickening power comes i'm rested up and i looked up there and i said look at yonder i remember that morning being caught up as my wife sitting back there laying on the same bed with me that morning and i was raised up and looked up in there she was asleep i said if i'm going to do anything to the lord you better hurry up or you're past 50. and then the holy spirit caught me away and i looked over there i seen those saints just as certain i'm standing here by this desperate sacred book laying here and a minister of the gospel have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord but what happened video don't you tell me about it every time has it been perfectly at the platform every time has it happened just like he said this was thus saith the lord i stood there and looked over that time and i've seen tens of thousands times thousands coming young men and women run throwing their arms around me screaming i look right back and see myself laying on the bed oh lord let me look at past the curtain of time what is it it's quitting power that'll catch us away that great quickening power the quickening power coming this last days that's what i'm in arizona for right now there's many people sitting right here stood right here at phoenix you heard me tell you from this very platform thus saith the lord how many remember said oh of course something's fixed that happened i saw seven angels come didn't life magazine packet is the fog of it floated across here 27 miles high and 30 miles across it's not fred sophman these other gene normally sitting back there stood right there when them seven angels appeared right there on the hill and shook the hills for miles around like that there stood seven angels and thrown a sword in hand said go home and open these seven seals they were given and here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce and the serpent's seed and all these things has been fussed about it's the santa lord what is it the acquaintance power coming to the church making her already this hour that we're approaching quickening power oh god help us to receive it help us to believe it see just depends on what attitude you take to it what's going to do you any good or not at all so you have to believe that if you don't believe it it won't do you one bit of good how samuel stood there before that people said have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord but what happened did i ever beg you for your money to live on no but we want the king anyhow that's the way the church is today they want their own ideas they won't pay a bit of attention to either walk right around well it just goes to show the quickening power is not there always say well i spoke in tongues i jumped and i shouted that's all fine but that quickening power is there you'll recognize like that little eagle that's his mama that's the word that's thus saith the lord that's what god promised that's what was foretold that's exactly what happened we're beyond any shadow of doubt potentially in the resurrection right now the saints getting ready to be taken up in the air so jesus so full of this quickly power said if you can destroy this temple it took you 40 years you thought to build i'll raise it up in three days why why could jesus say that onto ashton why could jesus say a thing like that he knew that he was amen i wish i could make that stick he knew who he was he knew that every word god had wrote in there of him he had fulfilled it he knew he was one david spoke of do you know you're the one the bible speaks on yes do you know your position is in christ if you're in christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like every day living to you well sure it's yours you are an eagle that's your food he knew that by the power of god he would do it because it was prophesied he would do it that's the reason he wasn't scared to say destroy this temple i'll raise it up in three days because david said i'll not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to see corruption he know not one cell of his body would corrupt any crops in 72 hours he said destroy this temple i'll raise it up again amen in three days why he was so full of that quickening power that quickened every word he looked back and seen every word god wrote of him the prophet said it fulfilled it he know that would be fulfilled too now every word that god said has your spirit said amen to it has been fulfilled in your life as a believer do you hold back on something say well my church teaches different then be careful paul comes notice eagles believe there's no question to them they believe it notice now he knew it would happen because the word said it wasn't every word wrote of him had to be fulfilled he knew that it was written by the power of god by the holy prophets that had prophesied that he would do so and prophecy never fails it cannot the word of god can't fail and it is written in the by the spirit that is now also the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead if it dwells in your being your body it will also quicken your mortal body then shoot it burn it do anything you want to make fun of it tear it down turn it down do what you want to god will raise it up to where he said he would man every saint of god has that promise and he knows that that's the truth so fear not brother we're already in the easter look now at transfiguration just before we close transfigure transfiguration we are all represented there and transfiguration look what we are seeing today notice just what we're seeing today the quickening power of god was all there there was a dead saints represented in moses there was a resurrection and jesus christ glorified elijah moses elijah and jesus all standing on the mountain the dead saints raptured saints and jesus glorified oh my well you say i heard a guy say they say you people why if you had this kind of power you ought to go out and tell people what you can do far be it from a real christian saying a thing like that see surely we don't claim no power to but we do one thing when they looked around with all this power upon them they saw jesus only and the real true believer don't care whether he's backing up a denomination or nothing about it he only wants one thing for you to see that glorified christ makes any difference a real true mount transfiguration experience only glorifies jesus christ he did glorify moses and glorify elijah and glorify themselves and glorify nothing else but they seem to glorify christ and any true believer that's what's in his heart to glorify jesus christ that's what he's trying to get the people see not say well if you come join our groups if you come do this or do that oh don't do that don't do that see god's word which is christ magnified and fulfilled the promise of this day in this great hour of resurrection notice and it gives them joy to know that we are with him a flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones what a joy that's the only thing that a real believer cares about they don't care about a denomination they don't care about an organization you don't care about what the other women think they don't care certainly not they won't do these things that the these other women do these men won't do them things they won't hang and baby around with some organization keep being put out and afraid they won't have a meal ticket they don't care about them things there's nonsense to them there's only one heart's desire that is to see jesus christ glorify yes their conduct must be with god it must absolutely nothing else but just the glory of jesus christ and what is jesus the word is that right amen i notice and seeing his same vindicated method proving his resurrection now what is it seeing your life by his promised word that he said he's the same yesterday and forever proving that he's still alive i don't care if every door in the country's close to me that i'm as i said i was 56 of the day i could be snapped out i'm at the heart attack age i'm in all this other age everything else well what difference it didn't make any difference to me when i was a kid they don't make any difference now one hour my number is called in my car out of the rack i don't care if they ever know they ever lived on the earth it don't make me no difference you don't have to have no big monuments and big buildings to say that i was showing earth and then one thing i wanted let me all know that jesus christ is the same yesterday [Music] and in my heart my holy abstract and i know that someday although i may be drowning in the sea i may be killed in africa i don't know what happened to me but one thing i know i hold the abstract hallelujah every door can be closed that don't make a big difference to me i'm not trying to glorify some man or some organization nor myself or another groups or nothing else i want people to see jesus christ is raised from the dead in his spirit lives he's the same yesterday today and forever no wonder jesus said fear not i am he that was dead but i'm alive forevermore for now we are redeemed by him and are risen with him and are now not will be sitting in heavenly places in him now when we have this spirit in us the abstract shows that all of the doubts has been stricken off what christ lives amen not i live not me christ lives in me not you live but christ lives in you because his living word lives in you showing that all of the accounts of all your methodists and baptists and pentecostal ideas and everything else is stricken off jesus christ like on mount's transfiguration all the prophets and everything else is finished all the days of the lutheran the methodist of presbyterian they are all right but this is my beloved son amen hear ye him the word of this hour the hour the seals when all the mysteries backcounter has been hit all these years since that great pyramid of time or stricken off the headstone make it home down so that the star of david will settle into its place and the great church of the living god will be raised like the wings of an eagle packed out in our into glory yes in now and now in our bodies with speaking with new tongues prophesying and foreseeing laying hands on the sick and they recover the world dead and all the things of the world we pass from death unto life and we now hold the power amen hallelujah on that resurrection morning when death seals will be broken we shall rise hallelujah we shall rise amen there ain't enough devils in hell to keep us from doing it we were forwarding to god for this hour the word of god manifests itself right through us and we live in the presence of god by the word promise of god amen you know devil in hell can keep me from raising then i'm door he can shut my face for that morning amen the seals have been broken hallelujah i'm free i'm an eagle i'm no longer in a cage i'm free of raise from the dead into the new life of jesus christ not only me but every man woman boy or girl sitting here that's been filled into that spirit of god is a new creature in christ and you are our eagle we are alive today and enjoy the resurrection forevermore because he lives we are alive also and he's living us making us alive and the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in our being shall quicken our mortal bodies to that great eternal easter amen glory to god oh take the world take anything you want to but give me jesus amen i love him he's all the world to me and because that you are a part of him i am a part of you and you are a part of me and together we are part of him oh christian what an opportunity we have we have opportunities that saint paul never dreamed of having we had opportunities that enoch and elijah and all them never had the opportunities we have now and there's one little sheep out there somewhere and he'll not be satisfied until that one comes in the full by the help of god and by a vision and thus saith the lord i'm returning across the sea that last little sheep may be a black one down there for all i know before they don't even think they got a soul but god knows different yes i'm going to seek to the last day of my life to find that one wherever it is i hope i never have offended any of my brethren but saying these strict things out not as i don't want you go to church sure i want you to go to church you go to church wherever you're going but just don't let that be your hope say well i belong to this or i belong to that oh brother sister belong to christ go to church but belong to christ yes amen let that that potential if that isn't in you quicken you right now to life won't you just receive it now this room's full of it i feel it all over me i know it's here the power of god the great seer of visions the great foreteller that can tell the things that it never fails a great one that can speak in no man can say it's no a man can open and no man can shut he that was dead is now alive amen and alive today here in phoenix walking amongst the newborn flowers no wonder on that easter morning little teardrops of dew was laying on every lily's cheek whatever rose why didn't know when it was brought up through the ground and somewhere there's an eternal flower blooming it'll take its place someday that's right no wonder joy full of tears can run down our cheeks no wonder our hearts quiver and shake when we can feel that same transforming power coming into our lives and filling us even for letting us speak in a language that comes from heaven we're so quick enough into his presence there prophesy 4c foretell and everything hitting perfectly with the word if it's prophesying contrary to that don't believe it but if it's with the word it's already said the same of the lord amen fear not i am he that was dead and alive forevermore that is god's easter seal that seals every letter of this word into your heart what is the seal you are written epistles read of all man you know that but when god has claimed you he sealed you with the easter seal that you are risen with christ and you are a new creature if you haven't been sealed this morning do so while we bow our heads thank you lord lord you hear that think now with your heads bowed romans 8 11. so be that the spirit that raised up christ from the dead be in you it will also quicken your mortal bodies what can we look forward to people what is or left look at for most in all the world atomic missiles and everything else is ready to strike the world is so nervous and scared and screaming and these movie mimics is on out there just telling all kind of jokes it's like a little boy going through the graveyard whistling at night trying to make the people believe that everything's all right don't you be deceived the coming of the lord is at hand you notice the other day a fisherman come up and told me sitting on the right in the bay that some kind of a rugged point or something other down here and how that long before that earthquake shook over in greece all the fish that usually feeds about that time of morning they didn't feed it wasn't it wasn't on the surface the second time it happened the same thing took place he knew right then something's going to happen and fish wasn't feeding at that time and all the gulls and things that feed on the fish they quit feeding that early in the morning that's when the feed is set up on the bank got away from the cliffs and things for just in a few minutes the sea moths began to boil up out of the earth off the seabed see and fish knew it before it happened going into india i read the paper said the earthquake must be over for days the little birds wouldn't come back to their nest in the rocks the cattle wouldn't stand around the shelters under the the shade in the heat of the day the sheep stood out the middle field leaned against one another they wouldn't go up around them rocks two or three days before the earthquake happened one of them sheep knew it they knew something was going to happen those birds knew something was going to happen those gulls knew something's going to happen those fish knew something's going to happen it's the same god that led those animals into the ark can't you see spirit filled people something's fixing to happen thank you lord don't look for some great big universal something sweeping nothing but the coming of the lord jesus amen remember just remember the words and promise of the lord don't you come on in right quick get away from big walls the resurrection is near at hand now if there's somebody here that don't know that they'd go in that resurrection and not sure that they've got that resurrection power resting in them though the skin worms destroyed though an atomic bomb burst right in the middle of you it'll never destroy that quickening of resurrection power no no sister brother your precious name is put on the lamb's book of life upon her no man can rub it out there isn't enough rubbing compounds in the world to rub your name from the book there where his blood has bought it if you're not sure of that don't don't take a chance on it now you might take a chance on running through a barricade somewhere and not get killed but you're not going to run through this barricade right no no you're going to get it you don't have to there's a red light flashing now bypass bypass your own ideas bypass the things of the world come let's be resurrected together this great easter time the great celebration of the easter can you celebrate in your heart this week if you can't would you just raise your hand to god

say come up let me shake your hand us they come up kneel at the altar now them is fine i haven't got one word to say against it at all not a thing anything you'll say but let me just tell you my way as many as believed that's right as many coming to the altar won't make you believe shaking hands with the minister won't make you believe but if you're called of god and you're eager to begin with just the scream tells you you believe if you really believe it i'm going to pray with you thank you lord could you imagine that little eagle stay in that barn yard any longer no no no no don't stay here any longer friend let's let's rapture now the grace of god is here today heavenly father we realize that we're coming down towards a closing hour we haven't too long to be here now not as our age but at the time we believe there's many young persons sitting here be living when this happens it may happen yet today we don't know the minute or hour but lord you told us when you see these things taking place and they've been taking place now for a long time we know we're way over according to the scientists six seven years ago was three minutes till midnight we don't know how much time that is taking home but we know we're right there oh god to have that assurance see that our heart punctuates every promise of god with amen see that the spirit itself has come into us quickens our being god let my brethren see that this morning let my brethren see that that spirit comes in and quickens to the word let my sister see the same thing lord and then if they see something that won't let him quick into that word oh god may they get rid of it right quick granted father it's all in your hands now i know i failed in many things and continue to fail the lord have done all i know how to do now that's in your hands they're yours in jesus name receive them father now to you that you're and it's needy of healing for your body how many believers are here raise your hand i am a believer as far as i know in my heart how many possessed you know beyond a shadow of doubt in your heart right now you've been raised from the dead you know oh my what could happen in a meeting like this then i know i'm late but what could have happened right now just think of what could take place the potential is laying right in you see you with your hand up you've talked like i could oath to god and i know that something's happened to me i may not be right where i ought to be neither am i no sir i'm a long way somewhere i should be but i know this one thing off path from left to line amen i know something happened to me not as an old man now but many many years ago it happened and i know that day when i walked into the hospital and i had my great challenge i've seen my wife die me calling for a life what have i done to stand on the street corner and preach and pray for the sick and then satan said well he won't answer your prayer i seen her die but i know that in her was that resurrection power that bone shall rise again i see my little baby layer in the label and don't say god don't take it look like he pulled the curtain down so it won't even hear you no more satan said there it is just one more he knew better tell me he was no god because i know that but he said he don't love me don't care for me see every reason thing said you're just a young man you're 20 years old there lays your wife laying out you're in a marg and here's your baby going there and just you said he was a great to heal and he's all this and look what does he do one word he wouldn't have to speak it just look down there and say it's not his head that's all take place it'll be healed but you see he don't love you he don't care for you let your baby die right there now and even refuse to hear your prayer in this dark hour everything he said was absolutely the truth so what have you done work all day long so you couldn't hardly stand up and then set up all night to 12 and 1 o'clock standing on the street corners preaching making calls to hospitals come in sit down in a chair sit there and sleep a hour or two and go back to work again next night the same thing here you are about 21 22 years old every friend every young lady every young man she ever associated with calls you a crazy crank what have you done you made a fool out of yourself don't you sin i was just about ready to agree with him but something loving me thank you that's a quickening power i said the lord gave and the lord taken away amen blessed be the name of the lord all my hopes give way that he's all my hope and stay for on christ oh he shall come with triumph sound then may i then be him in him be found wrapped in the robes of his righteousness not in my own i don't have any mind filthy dirty rags i'd hate to try to go to heaven all my preaching he talked about heaven on my patients i'm going to heaven because i hold his grace in my heart his gray man that's what he's born that's how we go oh friend you're a part of this body you are god's little children now i'm saying just to build your hope if you found if i found favor with you told you the truth and what i've told you is the prophet said of years gone by not making myself his prophet no sir but i'm telling you the truth has he ever said anything but what was right i've known you now for some 20 something years here in phoenix since that song i'd like to talk it over with it or brother outlaws church i believe it was brother garcia have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord but what happened remember there's only one hope get this quick power thank you it'll hold you when everything else is give away it'll hold you some of them said did you keep your religion brother brown i don't know it kept me it keeps me i don't keep it it ain't whether i hold on or not whether he held or not that's it here's what held off for me he didn't have to she was just sitting never treat you just pull your fingers loose just point you don't have to take it from the cross just point your finger and watch what see that mocking bunch but if he did that i couldn't have this testimony today you could have had but because he stayed to the cross he held there that's why i hold with him on christ the solid rock i stand all other grounds are sinking sands now if you're sick when you lay your hands on one another let's pray just lay your hands on somebody regardless of what's wrong with you have faith now if i ever told you the truth i tell you now jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe in your believers you just raise your hands don't doubt there's some poor suffering person that you got your hands on somebody's got their hands on you remember that quickening power that power that raised up jesus from the grave now you have faith in what you've got in your in your own body it's going to help that person that you got your hands on if it dwells in you it'll also quicken your moral bodies dear god as i stand here this morning nearing the noon day time when it's about this hour of the day when jesus cried my god my god why has thou forsaken me i thirst no wonder the prophet foresaw it set up all my bones they stare at me they pierced my hands and my feet but he was numbered with the transgressors but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace is upon him and with his stripes we are healed we claim that this morning god we claim that in the morning of this resurrection notice this vindicated truth that i'm told lord from your word in the presence of god he is judge and we are witnesses that he's redeemed us and in us lays by the grace of god that resurrecting power and our friends are sick the ones that the hands is laid upon oh god we challenge the devil in the midst of our faith this morning with hands laid up on the people with me and my hands stretched over the people whatever disease every affliction that tries to hold the people in the presence of this vindicated truth come out in the name of jesus christ may these people be made free today that the bible the words of our god said if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and our hands have been up in the air towards you god as every plant of the earth drinks at your fountain and as sure as that plate that's germatized drinks from your fountain it begins to build up it begins to grow the stalk of corn the flower whatever it is that's drinking in your fountain grows up towards you and this morning we've grown inches lord we can reach up higher we're drinking at your mountain we are your creatures with the resurrection power within us lord and we pray that you'll hear our prayer for our brothers and sisters and may every affliction has hindered these dear people here that possesses this power lord turn them loose so they can serve god and it shall be well lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen thank you lord you believe him hallelujah leave a thing like this how can you do it you just have to look like just pull yourself away do you feel that way i it may just be me and i'm but i have a feeling just a strange feeling when i come among the people where you step together like this i know somewhere invisible here just like radio television whatever it is passing through this room christ is in this room thank you lord just think our redeemer thank you lord tony he's amen and who could be any happier than people who possess with bible evidence of every word of god being made manifest to see even to angels and his beings as they have through the the ages and hear the words of the seers predicted that it happened just exactly and here we are at the eve of his covenant what a wonderful time we'll see one of these days he'll be here until he does come will you pray for me i've got dangerous perils in front of me i know it see and i meet with heathens who would shoot you the same as taking a drink of water and you're just paid for it you come on their ground devils that'll challenge you in the bible just as easy but never seen a time before our god won the victory amen i go in his name yes in the name of the lord jesus christ the hope of eternal life the resurrection and the life he that liveth and believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth that believeth me shall never die i believe that to be god's eternal word do you believe the same would you pray for me i pray for you may god watch yours until we meet again now let us stand up to our features thank you lord how
