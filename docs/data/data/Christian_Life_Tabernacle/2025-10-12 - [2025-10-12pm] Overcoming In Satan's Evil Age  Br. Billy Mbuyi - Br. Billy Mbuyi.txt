Heat. Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Are you [Music] ready? [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Let's all stand and sing this song. Oh, amazing grace shall always be my song of grace. For it was grace that bought my liberty. And I do not know just why he came to love me so. And he lift me all my faults and saw my need. Oh, I shall forever [Music] to calary. To you the cross where Jesus died for me. And I want to bless the grace that come on. And he looked beyond my fault and saw my need. The amazing grace that saved me. Oh, the amazing grace that saved me from that same chain to draw me close and keep me by his side. and forever sing. Oh, I'll bring all the glory to it. And if not for him, oh, I surely would have died. And I shall go away. [Music] I have to calary to view the cross where Jesus died for me. How loves the grace that come by. Oh, and he let me be.

We ask brother Manique to come and open up our service in a word of prayer. Psalm [Music] 103 verse 1 and 2 says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits. Two weeks back uh you know you all know when the rain comes it comes drop by drop but there is sometime it happens the the cloud splits and tons of water comes all at once. Two weeks back, two or three weeks back where my mother is law is is from, two cities wiped out because two clouds split apart instead of drop by drop the water came uh so forcefully just day before yesterday it was a great earthquake in Philippines four 7.5 to8 of a magnitude so many people lost their lives when we read the scripture And when we thank the Lord for all the benefits, it just reminds us every breath we are taking, it's given by him. &gt;&gt; So let's bow our heads and give thanks. Dear God, we acknowledge every breath that comes and goes, Lord. It's from you and you are the ultimate master. Lord, we want to thank you for that extra oil that you have given to us, the Holy Spirit. that is going to take us back when we depart from this earth and we will be able to spend the eternity with you Lord and we thank you for what you have done for us on the cross of Calvary and because of that we have the confidence because you have risen we have eternal hope Lord thank you for your presence at this time not only in this building Lord but your word says the kingdom of God is within us and we acknowledge that Lord You have said that I leave the world will not see us but you will be with us even in us Lord and we know that you are within all of us.

[Music] Each morning he tenderly feeds them, watches them so faithfully. The birds know their heavenly father always supplies every need. On earth they are not worth much value. Still through the darkness they seek. not born false without his permission. It touches the heart of the king. [Music] He sees each tiny sparrow that falls. He hears every time your broken heart calls. No matter how big, no matter how small, he cares about it all. Don't be afraid. Ye, you are more valued than they [Music] left his heavenly father to say I love you this much. His blood bought your eternal pardon. Why is it so hard to trust? He's near the brokenhearted.

No matter how big, no matter how small, he cares about it all. [Music] Don't be afraid. You are more value than they. He sees each tiny sparrow that falls.

Mech [Music] [Music] They [Music] They could feel [Music] me [Music] and she [Music] abra for [Music] a trump. [Music] [Applause] [Music] God bless you. [Applause] We have a couple of announcements. We want to remember the children's gathering that's happening. Remember our pastor threatened without threatening to watch your kids that nobody goes towards the maze for the sake of them not participating but participating. Um we want to remember brother Daniel as we mentioned earlier today with the surgery that's coming up. that the Lord be the surgeon in the process. Brother Joel Villa writes, "Please pray for protection during this pregnancy for Mela Alvareo." They had lost the previous two pregnancies. You know, I I don't know about you, but when when a mother asks for something like that, you know, Brother Brandham says it's it's her right to to mother. And I believe God moves on things like that. Regardless of how simple, how big, how small, he cares. And especially when you come in line with his word, he moves on the scene. We'll ask Brother Jay to come and take these before the the church and the brothers who are taking the tithes and offerings. Please come up. inspire our heads. Heavenly Father, these [Music] serious needs have come up before the church, Lord. And Lord, there's no better place to place them than in your hands, Lord. And so we know that you can Lord give victory Lord to the ones that are battling Lord and struggling Lord and Lord through these trials and tribulations Lord. Your prophet said that he just wants to show us Lord that you can have confidence in us Lord. So we lift these up to you, Lord, and just ask that the Holy Spirit would just move upon the the family, Lord, that's Lord, that's having a baby, Lord, and just pray that you'd be their portion, Lord Jesus. Lord, that you'll increase their faith, Lord. Lord, there's nothing like a love of a mother and a father, Lord, to bring forth a child, Lord. And just ask that you would, Lord, make a way, Lord. Lord, for brother Daniel, Lord, and his surgery, Lord, we just ask that, Lord, the surgery would go well. he would come out a a new man, Lord, just knowing that you're the one that healed him, Lord. Lord, that he would have a burning desire, Lord, in his heart to to just be in fellowship, Lord. Lord, we just ask that Lord, you'd meet every need for the the church, Lord, financially, spiritually, Lord, and Lord, for each one that has a need, Lord, that raised their hand or may not have raised their hand, Lord. You know the hearts and desires of each person, Lord. So, we just lift them up to you, Lord Jesus. and ask that you would just meet every need, Lord, for the tithes and the offerings, Lord. We just put them in your hands, Lord, and ask that, Lord, your will would be accomplished with them, Lord. Lord, we just ask you to be in our midst the remainder of this service, Lord, and ask you to have your perfect will and way in each life in Jesus name. Amen. As we sing this song, just if the Lord put somebody on your heart, put a burden on your heart for somebody else. As we sing this, just keep that person on your mind. Set aside your personal requests that you have and think on somebody else. I trust the Lord will answer to your need in due time. He's got it all in control. [Music] He's got it all in control. He put that reassur way down in my soul. Oh, he's got it all in control. I've put my life in his hands. I put my life in his hand. [Music] I put my life in his hand. And so every road I walk down, I'm sure it's in his hand. [Music] I put my life in his hands. My father knows what I need. Oh, my father knows what I need. My father knows what I need. Every year I go through. Oh, he knows what's best for me. My father knows what I He's got it all in control. Oh, he's got it all in control. He's got it all in control. [Music] He put that [Music] great in my soul. [Music] Let's all stand. I want to sing this song. Take me deeper. There is a longing only you can feel [Music] of a raging tempest that only you can steal. My soul this thirsting love to know you as I'm known. spring from the river and that flows before your throne. Take me deeper, deeper in love with you, Jesus. Hold me close in your embrace. Take me deeper. We invite brother Billy at this time. Deeper than I've ever been before. I just want to love you more and more. How I love to be deeper in love. [Music] Sunrise to sunrise. I will seek your face. drawn by the spirit to the promise of your grace. My heart is found in you. A hope that will abide here in your presence and forever satisfied. [Music] Take me deeper, [Music] deeper in love with you. Jesus, hold me close in your deeper than I've ever been before. I just want to love you more and more. to redeem. Just sing my course one more time. Oh, take me deeper, [Music] deeper in love with you. Jesus, hold me closing away. Oh, take me deeper, deeper in love before. I just want to love you more and more. How I know you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Gracious Father, we believe that's the promise you've made us. We know that when we come closer to you, Lord, Father, our love for you grows more and more, Lord. Lord, we know one thing that all we desire is to love you with all our hearts, with all our being, with everything that we are. Father, even though we see our inabilities and our imperfection, Father, we know one thing that you promise that just looking upon you, Lord, will bring about the change that we need. There's never been anybody who's come in the presence of the Lord and remain the same. And I believe, Father, even tonight as we come into your presence, Father, that you're working out everything for our good. We want to commit tonight's service remembering those that are on the way. Father, brother Jeff texted me that is not feeling well. Father, I want to lift him up tonight that you may just touch his body and make him well. We commit the service to you and invite you now. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. May God bless you. Let's open our Bibles. Certainly good to be gathering the house of God. I know we have people that are on the way maybe from the meetings and so we will uh uh just try to take as much time as we need and not be too long. Uh let's open our Bibles in Revelations chapter 3. How many enjoy the word this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. and we'll just try to pick something from what was said this morning and see if we can just say something that will be of help. Uh Revelations chapter 3, a very familiar scripture reading. Let's start from 14. And they said, "And unto the angel of the church of Laudian, write this thing, saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning and the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works. I know thou thou are neither cold nor hot. I would that thou were cold, oh heart." So then, because thou are lukewarm and neither cold or hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because that saith, I'm rich and increase with good, and have need of nothing, and knoweth not that thou are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel thee that to buy of me gold, tried and fire, that thou mayest be rich, and the white raignment that thou be me clothed, and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with thyself that thou may see. And as as many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous, therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in. I will come into him, and will s with him, and he with me. To him that overcomemeth, I will grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I al also overcame, and am sat down with my father in his throne. He that has a near, let me let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church. Also, if we could quickly before we be seated, turn to James chapter 4. We're going to read verse seven and just seven and eight. It says, "Submit yourself therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw nigh unto God and he will draw nigh unto you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your heart, ye double- minded. You may have your seats. Sorry, technology problem. Sorry. So I I trust you enjoy the word this morning and uh you know we can't say enough about Satan's Eden and I just want for a few moment and say overcoming in Satan's uh evil age overcomers in Satan's evil age you know um we we look at the world around us and as we heard this morning in the God of this evil age we understand that Satan more and more that he's uh he has a desire to build his kingdom and he's building his kingdom and um we was fellowshing in brother David's office he just just beautifully laid it out that even from the beginning here's Satan manifesting giving out of his seed and he didn't all of it to be manifested all at once and he was also gifting out little by little so and uh even by their own thinking thinking that they're making something out of something but not understanding that even knowledge is being imparted to them because the scripture will say that in the end time that knowledge shall increase. So even in his within his own kingdom he's dishing out this knowledge to his people and coming up with this creation and Barabanam will use that even as a type but we see that through knowledge and civilization and education that he's completely taken over everything and his goal is to build a better kingdom than Michael that his goal since the beginning is to have everything uh that we see around us everything work towards his goal not god's goal and it's so amazing because when brotherham speaks about the very deception of the devil he goes even as far as saying that he gained access to the name of the lord Jesus and now he's he doesn't mind being worshiping under the name of the lord Jesus people thinking they worshiping Jesus but they worshiping him so he starts out as a stark uh uh uh one that would come and manifest himself. And then he's disguising himself and taking worship that necessarily don't belong to him. Worship that was not directed at him, but he's taking it over by deception. And he comes and he wants to be worshiped just like God. And he wants to be uh uh to be placed above the stars of God and everything. And he wants people thinking that they are worshiping God, those people are worshiping him. He's designed everything in the world to keep us distracted. And and it's amazing even when we especially when we talk about technology. I'll say perhaps in the last 20 years there's been such an acceleration in technology more than ever before. It it seems like today you know something and tomorrow it's obsolete. It it's no longer of any use. Why? Because knowledge keeps growing and and more information. We are subject to so much information. Even our mankind, our human being, just our flesh is not even made to handle that kind of information. the the amount of information that we go through on the daily basis, the amount of pings you get on your phone, the amount of notifications, the amount of uh uh reminders that you put, the amount of scheduling that you put, it's not even it's not even possible for one human being to to just take that in. It's too much. It keeps you distracted at all time. You can't even sit there. We get to where, you know, if you sit there, it's too quiet. It seems like something is going wrong. They because why you live in the world where there's constant noise, constant this one has to happen, this one has to happen, that has to happen. And in all of that, his objective is to keep you away from your true objective, which is to live the life of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he comes and and he comes as an angel of light because he doesn't he's not showing up with horns and one that wants to hurt you because he will be clearly visible in that form. But the form that he takes is will say some place the form of godliness but yet denying the power thereof. A form of just of a shell. One that can uh uh he doesn't mind if we are Christians. If we gather here, we say we we want to be like God. He doesn't want us to uh participate in in the customs of the church and and the services and everything. But he doesn't want you to come in real contact with the real living God. So he wants you to keep you away from that. He wants to fill your mind with religion. He wants to fill you with theology, the understanding of uh perhaps knowing all the scriptures. And and I was just fellowshipping with a brother and he just done on my heart. Brennan makes a quote. I don't have it here. It says, "We study too much, we do a lot of things too much, but what we need to do is to fail in love with him." If we can only uh set our hearts right and fail in love with him, that will answer to the needs of every day. Because one minute in the presence of the Lord is more than all the studies we can do. One minute in contact with him will change your life forever. Your life will never be the same. It's not by theology. It's not by education, but it's the contact that we need to come. Like we said the other day, you know, Moses heard that how that he was born a proper child. Moses heard that uh from his parents how that he was to deliver Israel and he saw it perhaps when he looked at the children of Israel. He saw the nation of God and all of those things. But one thing that was lacking was Moses had to have the uh to come into the burning bush and meet it God that God for himself. Moses couldn't do it just by the knowledge that he had acquired. Moses needed a personal experience with that God so he could be empowered. In other words, what God was able to do that the the the teaching and the knowledge uh could not do was that God was going to bring the very word that he was hearing into a reality in his own body is in his own flesh in his heart. That word will become such a reality that by revelation he'll be able to walk into pharaohs and Egypt and speak and have no fear. But what he heard from his parents, even though it was good, it kept him in fear because when the Egyptian uh the Egyptians died, he ran away. But when he came in contact with the living God, and all of his questions were answered, there was no fear anymore. And that's what we desire as Christians, not walk in fear. Oh, I'm going to do this wrong or I'm going to fail over here. You know, if you can ever fell in love with him and meet him face to face for yourself, you have no fear because you know he has you in his own hands. &gt;&gt; So he wants us to worship. He's designed this world to keep us distracted and he has designed the world to keep engaged at all time with the things of the world and no time to see God. He's built a kingdom. He wants us to live by the provisions of what is given. Whatever you have need of, I got it. &gt;&gt; I there's things that you you can it's just as much as your imagination. &gt;&gt; You think about it, somebody's made it somewhere. &gt;&gt; And and and and think about it. He and the more time goes by, he makes it more easier, a lot beautiful, more attractive, more appealing, and more everything. Why? Because he he doesn't want us to to live by faith. He doesn't want us to engage into the promises of God. He doesn't want he wants you to rely you need you need money, you get a job or guess what the government will give you money for free. Whatever you have need of, he has a way for him to try to provide it for you so you do not depend from the kingdom to which you came from. &gt;&gt; He's built such a kingdom, such a place. And as long as as believers, this is where it becomes very important. As long as as a believer, there's no heartbeat inside of us that desire to see the reality of God. He's got us right where he wants us to be. So what makes us different is regardless of what Satan has to offer out there, regardless of his money and the things out there, everything that he can offer, his medicine, his hospitals, and all of those things, there is something that hungers for more than what we see. There's something that hunger for the reality of the living God. There's something inside of us that wants to see the reality of what was written in the scripture come to pass into our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he builds a better kingdom and that we can rely on it. And he wants us to be continually living without faith because we know the scripture will say that by that only those that uh the scripture will says that it's by faith that you could please God. It's not by intellect but it's by faith. They that cometh must believe that God is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek after him. So he doesn't want us to be partakers of the supernatural because the supernatural cannot come by understanding or by knowledge. The supernatural can only come and be manifested by faith. He He knows that if we can ever get the key of faith, if we can ever receive revelation by the word of God, that we will look at his kingdom and reject it and seek for the things that which come from above. He knows that if we can ever receive the true revelation of the true bride of the end time and what she is and what she's to be manifested that we will become the very invincible army that God pro promised. So therefore he wants us to he wants us to keep us in the lukewarm state. You know we come to church and we hear the word of God and we go out and we want entertainment just like the world wants it. He wants to be one foot in and one foot out. And he wants us to be in such a place where uh uh you know we even though there's a desire for the things of God in our heart just like our pastor said that we also have a place in our hearts or in our minds or or for for the things of the world. You know we want to be the best gamer there is and want to be the best person there is and the best educated person there there is and we want to manifest also those things and everything. Let me say this. It's either you live by the provision of God or by the precision of the devil. God wants us to live by his provision. And living by his provision will provide everything that you have need of. &gt;&gt; You don't got to be the best anything. You just got to be the best Christian that there is. And he will provide. If he needs you to become something, he will make you what he wants you to be. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He it's a chasing of something that you can never s that can never satisfy you when it's all said and done. You know in technology used to be even in my own discipline it used to be not not few years ago that if you attend certain certification you are the best that they were you know it was like something that was regarded as great and everybody went for it. But today with a rise in AI and all of those things now the the the direction is completely changing. You cannot just be one thing. You need to be this this this this like four different things combined before you can do be anything. So what is it? It doesn't matter. And even if you attain it a a sum of it is just good for a year. &gt;&gt; Then you got to go through the same exercise again. And and so it it's a it's a process that's built to continually lead you on and lead you on and lead you on and it's almost like you got you on the leash and and just quick and just pushing you forward and then when you realize you come to the end of it, you realize that it's all but vanity. &gt;&gt; My brother and my sister, the world is nothing but vanity. There's nothing out there that satisfy. The only thing that satisfy is Jesus Christ living in the heart of a believer &gt;&gt; is the true birth by the Holy Spirit. One that can come and make you a different person. And once he makes you a different person, you will never hunger for the things of the world. &gt;&gt; It says it would deceive the very elect if it were possible. But says that this age speaking about this age he say we see in this age what we are living in it's the greatest of all the ages the age of laian church hate is the greatest of all the ages and it says because we are because it's the ending of time and the blending into eternity and then it's the greatest sinful age. It's the most sinful. It's the most It says it's the mo It's the most sin in this age than it's ever been. And all power of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any other age. &gt;&gt; The power of Satan is many more times harder to fight in this age than it ever was in any other age. Why? Because if you can you can perhaps the best way for me to just say it is you can look at it as as far as the spectrum is concerned. The word of God gives you 100%. And every variation from the beginning till the 100% belongs to the devil. If you want to be the ranked sinners, he will give it to you. If you want a little bit of watered down type Christianity, he's got it for you. Whatever version of Christianity you you want, he's got he's there to satisfy for you. &gt;&gt; He's there to give it to you so he can keep you a peace and so he can uh have you where he wants you to be. But I even was fellow fishing with the youth group on Friday. But but Ram speaks about the seed of Abraham. He says that with them there is something different. So that when they look at the same circumstances that you and I look, for some reason they they they refuse to accept circumstance for the way they are presented. It doesn't matter how hard the situation look. If you go reading the history of the Bible, you find out that there was a group of people when they showed up at the Red Sea, however difficult they looked, they didn't believe that that was the end of them. There was something in them that believed that something could happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I believe that's what we are called to be. Why? Because we are not called to live by the provisions of the devil. We are called to live by the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I'll say this, the challenge uh uh uh uh even in this end time if we are not careful is we live in a time where when we when when one says the word of God people often time replace uh the the the minds are drawn to the very text or the record of the word of God and looking at the letter as if it was the actual word. This is the letter and the record of the word. But the word of God is the very person of the Lord Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; And let me say this, that's why brotherham says we the weapon that's been given to the believer is the word of God. Adam and Eve were given the word of God. The word of God is the most powerful thing that there is on the face of the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and because we we often time look to the letter and fail to realize that there's the author of the letter. There's the author of the record and he's the real word of God. &gt;&gt; The scripture will say that in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was even God. If you go back and look but speak and said that God was there with his own thoughts and everything and then he the word is the thought expressed. The word is the thoughts expressed. So the word is not the thought but it's the thoughts expressed. In other word when it moves from the thoughts to the word it's got everything that he need in order to fulfill what it's supposed to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God said let her be, he was taking her thoughts and by the time it became the word, it was the manifested light of what the thoughts was. &gt;&gt; So even you look at it, Jesus came, it says that he I come from God and I go back to God. The prophet tells us that the very form when God moved from the spirit that he was when he decided to take a form, the first form that he took was the logos and he calls it the creative power of God. So when you have the word of God, you have the creative power of God himself. &gt;&gt; You you don't have the letter, you have the creative power. whatever. In other words, when he speaks it, when it becomes the word, when it is the word, it's the creative force that would bring that which you have need of. &gt;&gt; When it's the word, it's finished. It's not the beginning. It's the finished. But said it may take a hundred years, a million years, however long it takes, but if he had already spoken it, it's as good as finished. So, when we have the word of God, we have the finished product. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God will not go back and change his word when he already spoke it. It's got to come to happen. &gt;&gt; We We have turned it into some type of understanding. &gt;&gt; It's the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh, I love this. And I probably won't have time to read it, but he speaks. It says God in the beginning it would come in and he would he says the spirit it will hover over his own seed and the prophet Jo say he would brood over over it as if it was as a chicken will brood over his own seed. The word will brood over his own seed until that which was spoken that which was in seed form will become manifested. So it's not a different person. So when God speaks, he himself, the spirit that spoke the word will hover over his own word to bring it to pass. All that we need to do is to believe the word, trust the one who spoke it, and let him do the brooding until it comes to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The the challenge is when we have the word separated from the spirit, then we feel like we need some other spirits from some other place to come and make the word to come a reality. When it's the same same exact person that spoke the word, that bruise over the word to come to pass. &gt;&gt; So he comes and he bruise over his own word. But says until one came that was in his very own image. So I was thinking about this even in terms of what we spoke about I believe a week or two ago about uh Michelangelo here it was he was the only one who had received the inspiration about how that statue was supposed to be. It wasn't another great artist. There was only one artist who was given and he had the responsibility in shaping this uh uh marble and bringing out the image which was supposed to come out of. But when says oh he worked night and days and for years he said perhaps it will go and while he's sleeping and he realized oh that part doesn't supposed to be is not supposed to be. It says they express about in the nature of an artist how that they are uh uh uh perhaps very uh picky about what they do. They want it to be exactly the way they want it to be that it's not that within the very nature that it was created with. He cannot just look at something and say oh that's fine it will do. No he wanted it to match the vision that he had received. He wanted it to match the perfect vision and inspiration that he had received. Why? Because the the when he got the inspiration, he wanted what we he was building to come alive even to himself. But says he built it to such a place that he was able to look at it and smite it and say speak. Why? Because at that particular moment what was a vision became a reality. My brother and my sister. Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me say this, there's coming a time where this word of God will move from a vision into a reality. &gt;&gt; We we had one who had a vision of what the bride's supposed to look like. &gt;&gt; We We're not just walking, you know, sparingly and just trying to figure out what is this message going to produce. No, we know what it's supposed to produce. We we know and we've been given the accurate description of what we are supposed to see. And what we need is to stand before the message to eat it day and night to eat it at every moment and let it shape us into the &gt;&gt; image that God wants us to bring. Banana will say in the message God gives all always find its place. Paragraph 73 says the whole creation was lost. We just went through it in the seven seals. It said see the whole creation was lost. Everything was gone. It was all gone to Satan. He felt heir of it and he still owns it. He certainly does. That's the reason we are fighting and having a lot of trouble. He controls every kingdom. Satan does. Every government, every king, every kingdom controlled by Satan. The whole world is controlled and run by Satan. That's the reason we have a lot of trouble that we have. Any Bible student or anything can tell you that Satan well the Bible itself says says it here says he did it. It says he did. See that he controls the world but Christ will fail. It says, "But Christ will fall heir to it for now. He is our our redeemer and he comes to redeem the whole creation and nothing could do it but God himself." That's the reason it says that's the reason it says that's the reason that God doesn't do uh doesn't does nothing outside of a man. He always works through man because he had to use a man. Let me say this. God is not working with the world as a whole. &gt;&gt; It's not interested. That belongs to Satan. He's not even working with the churches. Oh, I'm going to work with churches. No, the word of the Lord is to the individual. God is looking for a man, a woman who will believe the entire word of God. We just read in revelation but one of them says that Christ himself was kicked out of his own church. He was put on the outside and it says for he that will hear my voice he because he was kicked out Christ became to look for the individual who will receive the word. That's why even when we come to church, it's not a a matter of us receiving it as a whole, but it's a matter of each one of us coming in contact with what's being said and making sure that it's talking to something in inside of you. Making sure that the word is speaking and connecting to something that's inside of you. He's not interested in groups. He's interested in individuals who can receive and make contact with that word that's been spoken. And I want to say this because we live in the time where if we're not careful, people go and they they they go to church and they they they they pay their tithes and they do all of those things and they find comfort in doing that rather than in making contact with the word itself. God wants us to make contact with the word. He doesn't want us to hide behind religion or behind the customs of the church and all of those things. He want each one as an individual to come in contact with that word and know the word for himself. That's why we must be born again. To be born again uh often time is taken uh you know we we look at it as oh I must be born again. I it it is because the mind that's in you is not the mind that's made for you to receive the word. The mind that's in you as a human will re will reason the word of God every time. But when you are born again, that reasoning is taken out of you. What you have inside of you is a faith that believes even when it doesn't make any sense, it believes it. He He wants us to be a separated people. He He But says he God made us to be oddballs. Yeah, we are you we spend all of our lives wondering why could I not fit? What's wrong with me? We we try to learn new habits so that we could just fit. We do all kinds of things trying to fit in and not knowing that we were created the way we were created the way with our our taste, our likes and our dislike. We were created for one goal and one goal only so that God will use you where he needs you to be. We we completely failed to understand that we were made oddballs because God had a plan for our lives. He had a plan. He elected us and he chosen us. He He wanted us to be gathered for his own name's sake so he can use us for what he wants to use us. And yet we are all of our lives fighting that. Wanting to fit like everybody else, wanting to do everything like everybody else, and wanting to be liked by everybody, wanting to be appreciated by everybody. God don't want you to be appreciated. If they don't appreciate you, that's fine. If he appreciates you, that's all that matters. &gt;&gt; The problem with religion today, we we we all Christians, right? You know, everybody's a Christian. No, God don't want us that to be that kind of Christian. He wants us to be a different kind of a Christian according to his own election. &gt;&gt; But Bam says the masterpiece was rejected. It was despised. It there was no beauty in it that there may be desire. But guess what? We we we are building a Christianity where we want everybody to like us. If they don't like me, oh, I must not be a good Christian. I was telling the young people, I said, if somebody said they don't like you, just rejoice. Praise God. I must be crazy. That's why they don't like me. He didn't make you to fit. He created you to stand out. He created you to be that way. So only him can satisfy that. So when he takes you and he places you where he wants you, that you will act exactly that way. And it will fit a purpose that even you yourself has no understanding. &gt;&gt; But Bam says in identifying masterpiece he says let us turn uh let us turn now our thoughts from Michelangelo. It says to the great sculptor God himself, God Almighty, who in the beginning, before there was a day, before there was a dawn, it says for before there was a dawn, for there an an atom or a molecule, God in his mind had man what a man should look like, what a man should be, and what a man should act like. I love that. Everything about us, the way we would look, the way we would act everywhere, everything about us was written about us by God himself. And he wanted to make that man to be part of him. So he made him in his own image, in his own likeness. God created man. And he says, "Oh, when God in the beginning made man, he says this masterpiece something that reflected his thoughts, not reflected the thoughts of man, but reflected God thoughts." &gt;&gt; You don't got to be a Christian according to somebody's understanding. You got to be a Christian according to God's understanding. Our desire is each one of us to reflect God's thoughts, not the human thought, not even our own understanding. We come to a place, let me say this, in this age that we are living in, it's so dangerous because there's so many imitation everywhere. &gt;&gt; There's so many imitations everywhere. You look across the net, everybody wants to be like everybody else. &gt;&gt; Uh uh people, oh, you know, people study what is it that I need to do so people can like me. People fake being sick so people can like them. &gt;&gt; People do all kinds of things and so they can become famous for popularity, for for for likes, and for for for thumbs up, and for all of those things. That's the people are looking for attention. But let me say this, the only attention we need is to get in contact with him. &gt;&gt; Because if we get in contact with him, then it'll all be settled. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Remember, there's only one way. There's only one form of eternal life. and even our name and our thoughts. It it says our and our name and our thoughts were with God before the foundation of the world because now we possess eternal life and to be that we have to be part of God. Though we've had to be as much as it is taught because we have eternal life was predestinated to life and our names were put in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world according to revelation. Now that God had us in his thinking then we have eternal life because then he spoke us. We came into existence and a word is just a thought manifested. God had us in the beginning in his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. That's how and that's the reason why you are going to overcome. &gt;&gt; It is not because of how many prayers, works and anything. It's because we are here as his thoughts being manifested. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the word spoke it. The word will bring it to come to pass. Why? Because God taught it. The prophet spoke it. It's going to come to pass. Why? Because he who started the work will finish it. Why? Because he placed it within your heart tonight to be a son and a daughter to him. And there's nothing that can stop that from happening. &gt;&gt; Let me say that. It wouldn't help how much enthusiasm we had if that what it was not written. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And let me even say this. We wouldn't even know what deception is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't even know what truth is. What what is truth and what is deception? It took a prophet to come and reveal the word of God in the end time. It took God to open our eyes. It took God to bless the seed in our heart. It took God to bring us to church. It took God to transform us. Everything about us is God doing the work. &gt;&gt; The problem about it is we feel like we can change somebody else. &gt;&gt; We can't. Only God can change him. If God change you, that same God can change somebody else. That's why we rejoice in because we know I have been changed and I'm in contact with that God and I know that God can do the same for you. That's what the gospel is. &gt;&gt; It's not that we've come to a place where God started the work. Now we say it's time for me to take over. Let me continue my own transformation. It's always God through the individual, through the work, through everything. It's God using men to speak. It's God laying hands on people. It's God. What is it? If we look at it through the lenses of God, then we'll understand the program. If we look at it through the program of men, we'll fail to see what is it that is trying to achieve. If the musician could come, it says in the uncertain sound, it says paragraph uncertain sound, paragraph 34, it said man in the beginning when he was made, a man is a god. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just so I could give you some background, we were talking with the young people about there was one one of our youth here it asked me it says he had a question about the uh godhead the deity of the Lord Jesus. He said, "Why is it that Jesus was praying to God?" And you know, "What's the difference between?" And it just stayed on my heart for such a long time. And and I was just I I know I could give a simple answer, but for some reason, I just went and I was studying on it. You know, I could have just responded. It took time and everything. And when it was all said and done, I understood the reason for understanding the the the deity of God was because it was our own identification. &gt;&gt; Straight and simple. Because if you don't understand the identification of God, you will not understand your own identification. &gt;&gt; But Ram says, "Go to a Jew and try to feed him that there's three gods. Amen. &gt;&gt; It won't happen. &gt;&gt; There's only one God. &gt;&gt; And we are offspring of that one God. &gt;&gt; How? By his word. &gt;&gt; He created us. He made us what we are. It's by the word. The creative force of God. He made us what we are. So we begin to show that it was God in heaven. But yet says he would have been unjust to to send his son someone outside of himself to come to die for the sin that we committed. If he wanted to p put to pardon us, he himself was going to come. So God became a man. &gt;&gt; God became a man and he died the death on the cross. And he said that he took our place so we can take his place. Amen. &gt;&gt; A son of God, a son is the reflection, is the nature of the father being pour into another vessel. It's the same God. It wasn't a different God. It's the same. And why is it important that we understand? Because you tonight that are sitting here, you are the God manifested. &gt;&gt; It's the same one changing forms. It's the same one coming. The one who came in the form of God above us. The one who came in the form of the Holy Spirit over the church ages. The one who came and he came in the form of a man God. The fullness of God dwelling in the human body. The same one promised that I have to go so that I am where I am you may be also. What was he talking about? It's not about some physical location. He was taking you back to the word. Why was Melisedc supposed to come? Melkisedc, what was the representation of Melkisedc? Melazedc was the word form that that accomplish and fulfill every word of God. So when he stood before Abraham, when he was speaking to Abraham, it wasn't just some thought form. It was actually the one who promised, who made the promise. He was the one who was going to fulfill the promise. That's why he looked at him and says next year at this same time you shall have a child. Why? Because he was the creative power of God. And brother Benam says the same as Abraham saw him. The children of Abraham must come with that same identification meet that same one &gt;&gt; not a different God. The same one who made the promise &gt;&gt; suited an generation. And he spoke the word. He says I'm going to have a bride. And that's why we're gathering here. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with our feelings. &gt;&gt; Whether you feel like you are a Christian or you feel like you are a sinner, it doesn't matter tonight. &gt;&gt; Religion is not about your feeling. It's about what's already been spoken. &gt;&gt; You believe it, it happens. You don't believe it, you struggle with it. And he's absolutely a god. For he was made in the image of God, being a son of God. Then he's an heir of all that God is. I &gt;&gt; I love this. There's no variance. There's no well is a god but is a lesser god. You you know this is what we do to ourselves, right? Oh, I'm a god but I'm not that kind of god. What kind of god are you? &gt;&gt; You know we we we start watering down our own identification. &gt;&gt; There's only one god and you are inade form of that one god. There's no two god. There's only one. And the spirit that was in Jesus is the same spirit that came on you. The scripture says the spirit that rose him from the dead, if it dwells in you, it shall also quicken your mortal body. Do not water it down. Take it for what it is. If it's too hot, believe it. It will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Let the one who promise make it come to pass into your life. It's not for you to understand or explain it. It's for him to bring the manifestation. &gt;&gt; Then he said Jesus was the first born among many brethren. So really the godhead is only a lineage where we really come from. It's not about understanding about some god that sits up high in the throne that we got to go and figure out how do I even worship him. It's the identification that you are worshiping &gt;&gt; the one that you came from. &gt;&gt; You are one with him. You cannot worship something that you can identify with. &gt;&gt; He's made you in his own image. You are part of him and you and him are one. In fact, he's not complete without you. &gt;&gt; If he was, why would he give his life? &gt;&gt; He gave his life because you are part of him. &gt;&gt; The same way that Adam gave his life for Eve, that same God gave his life for you. Why? That he may make you an overcomer in Satan's hidden. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this. God will wait until there is so much sin in the world. Until the world is in a place where you look, you said this cannot work. Almost like it was said, can anything come out of Nazareth? &gt;&gt; He comes to such a place. He waits for such a time. He waits for such iniquity. He comes back and say the reason why you can overcome is because you are a god to begin with. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are made in my own image. I never fail. There's not a promise that I've ever made that's come not come to pass. Has he ever failed? Has he ever said anything that's never come to pass? He said because I am that and you are part of me. The same thing is going to happen with you. &gt;&gt; Oh, but our humanity, your humanity means nothing to him. your human errors and human problem. You might as well take that and put it in the trash. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he knew it. &gt;&gt; He knew that you will come from the place that you came from. &gt;&gt; He knew that you will come from the parents that you came from. He knew all about the challenges. He knew the question tonight. Do you believe what he said or not? &gt;&gt; The question is not where you came from, what you did, how much your cup of sin is, all of that you have done. It has nothing to do with it. All he has is do you believe my promise? Do you believe what I've called you? Do you believe what I've made you? If you believe it, then it's a finished work. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. It says being a son and heir of it all. And then it says a man was given a domain and do the domain was the earth. He has all the power over the fish and over the fowls. He had everything all over. He could just speak and everything will obey him because he was a god within himself. Not universal god but god means god the the god of heaven and earth. But he was a rule in his domain. He was a king ruler. It says that that that was man. It says and even now he in his fallen state now he still has the appearance. &gt;&gt; How much more when you become redeemed? When you realize that I have been redeemed. I have been restored. You know the challenge with us is often time we think power is to go and raise the dead and and and just go and speak everything. No power brings you under subjection. &gt;&gt; Power comes when you have real power, you have humility with it. When you have real power, you care about what God wants to be done with his word. When you have real power, he imparts to you a character that you understand what to do with the word when it's necessary. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. Our gracious father, Lord, what you have done for us, even if we take all the volumes of all the books that we know and rewrite new ones, Father, it will not be sufficient. Our desire tonight, Lord, is that you may just enkindle that fire within our hearts, Lord, that we may recognize the power and the things that you have done to get us out of this Satan's Eden. And Lord, we are in the world, but we are not of the world. &gt;&gt; Lord, we are made to be different. that we may rely on that which is what you said and overcome the challenges of every day. Father, not to be tossed through and fro, not to feel forsaken, not to feel like we have nothing. Yet, you've taken your glory. You've taken everything that you were. And Father, you desired to place it in your church that they will become the very representation of who you are. I pray tonight Lord no doubt we've fallen short and but I pray tonight father may you just come and restore us by your word Lord that we may be empowered by the ver the only thing that has the power of transformation which is your word that we may know without any doubt with assurance that father you have done the work and we are only here to manifest it lead us oh God and father I pray for each uplifted hand and those that are home in various places. Father, I pray just the same way we know that the devil couldn't defeat you that the devil cannot defeat us. Not because of our flesh and our minds, but because it's the same word being manifested in us that overcame him. I pray that you lead us, oh God. Amen. Father, let your Holy Spirit hover over the word that lives in us that it may bring us into the completeness of power and joy that we may live the life that you want us to live. Forgive our shortcoming one again. And Lord, we commit everything we are. And we ask all of these things in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. Oh, hide me now [Music] under your wings. Oh, and come home. [Music] Oh, and your mighty when the ocean roar. I will soar with you above the storm. [Music] Father, you are king over the flood. I will [Music] go. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was a masterpiece &gt;&gt; right there. You know, here we are, the sons and daughters of God. Our father owns the cattle on a thousand hill. He's put the pen in our hand &gt;&gt; and we won't write the check. &gt;&gt; And Satan's just a bluff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's just a bluff. and and he's got us so beat down with so many complexes and everything that you know I'm not worthy to lay my hands on the sick. Never was, &gt;&gt; never will be. &gt;&gt; But he told me to. &gt;&gt; He said, "Son, you go lay your hands on that sick person. They'll get well." in Mexico City. The prophet of God was there and somebody girl is going over crazy over there and he said, "I'll just send one of these ministers over." God said, "Son, you go down there &gt;&gt; and lay your hands." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You know, and and Satan does such a trickery because we have we're born in sin and shaped in iniquity. He uses our flesh against us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But that's what he said. I'd overcome and we can we can have victory over everything. We are the sons and daughters of God. Christ the mystery of God revealed. He was our kinsman redeemer. And and you know you never can be like Christ. You never be with Christ in the flesh. &gt;&gt; But you can be like Christ through his spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. You can ask and you'll have what you ask for if you believe what he said. &gt;&gt; I I just think we're that when we can start grasping this, we're we're we're we're starting to go forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the word of God right there. We go forward by what he said. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I thought that was just wonderful. In fact, I'm going to go listen to it again and and uh I'm going to steal all those notes and preach it in in Zambia because that's what we want the people to know. &gt;&gt; We we don't have classes, &gt;&gt; you know. We don't have economic groups and and and education groups and we're all his children. &gt;&gt; That's what's so beautiful. We're always children. Amen. I I just really enjoyed that. Uh I'd like to sing that song because I just thought when Billy probably came on my heart, there's two roads &gt;&gt; that we can travel. That's what's put before you. You know, you can take the road of doubt and failure and and complex or you can leave that which is behind behind and you can go by faith. &gt;&gt; And oh church, that's what pleases God when you accept that you're a son and daughter. Every time I I hear something like that, my mind just goes back to that prodal son. What a wreck &gt;&gt; that guy was. &gt;&gt; He had squandered all of his inheritance with riotous living. [Music] And he looked up and he thought, "Well, you know something? In my father's house, the servants are living better than I live." So he decided, you know what? I think I'm starving here. I'm living with the pigs. I guess I'll just go home to my father's house. And when he got to his father's house, what did he find out? He found out he was a son, &gt;&gt; not a servant. &gt;&gt; And nothing could ever take his sunship away because it came from the father himself. And nothing can take your sunship or daughtership away from you because it came from God. All he's trying to do is by the word of God is bring you to the revelation of that and that somehow in your heart you'll choose your elected predestinated being to be the one that rules your life and not the deception and the lie. And I think if we keep hearing preaching like this, I think we'll we'll come to that place. So, choose tonight. What road do you want to go down? There's two roads that you can take. One by sight or one by faith. Lord, help my unbelief. Oh, there are two roads may take one by side and one by take the word of God for what you see. What you believe is what will be. Set your wings through the wings of faith. You can fly in a high. Do not struggle. It's by grace. Send your wings to the wind of watch. Watch your mountain. Speak the word of God and I am. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like this. for you [Applause] [Music] to waste [Music] my praise. Send your wings to the wings of me in the sky. [Music] He does not [Music] for the power that makes him fly. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's already here. Praise God. Oh, set your wings to the wind of me. [Music] [Applause] [Music] It's by grace. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm wondering if tonight there's somebody that maybe has something that is a struggle or a a conflict or that you're battling and the spirit of faith is here and you'd want the church to pray with you and you're going to walk up and you're going to take that thing and you're going to say that we're going to fly above it. Do you believe you can do that? &gt;&gt; Amen. ain't going to stop me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there we just want to say if there's something that you desiring for something, you want God to do something, something in your heart and you want to you want to take that right to the throne and say, "I'm battling." You don't have to tell anybody what it is, but if you want, you can touch the hem of his garment tonight. &gt;&gt; We don't want to let the opportunity &gt;&gt; go by. You don't want to carry it with you. You're tired of carrying it. You're tired of packing it. You're tired of it just being a burden to you. You say, "Lord, I want to go in a different direction. I want something in a different path." We'd be happy to pray for you. If you want to be prayed for, you can just raise your hand right where you are. But don't let faith &gt;&gt; pass you by. Claim your sunship. &gt;&gt; Claim your position. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I I I can have my relationship restored with my family. I can have these things that are right. I know they're right. I know that's the way it's supposed to be. I I can possess that gate of that enemy. I can claim that promise. I can believe it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to claim my sunship. &gt;&gt; You know, with God, you don't have to wait for someone to die to claim your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; You're join &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All that he had and all that he was, he poured into the church. Just think of it. You can claim that right now. It's yours. You own it. &gt;&gt; It's just up to you to say, "I'm going to accept my position in Christ. I'm going to believe what he said about me." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Did you know in perfect faith the prophet of God said that Jesus believed what the scripture &gt;&gt; said about him? &gt;&gt; And that was the key to perfect faith. Tonight you heard right from the word of God straight read to you from the mouths of the prophets through his minister exactly &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; what God identified in Jesus Christ. Christ the mystery of God revealed that he was a son because you were sons &gt;&gt; and daughters and it took a son for a son. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what we do. &gt;&gt; If you want to step back into your sunship, step back into your position, step back in. And if you know you're on the outside of it and you know if you know you're not living, you just know that all that's being said you're not a part of, you can stand right where you are and say, "Father, I want to enter into that world. I want to enter into knowing who I am. I want to I want to come in. I want your spirit. I want your Holy Spirit to come and &gt;&gt; and place me, Father, back in the position of my inheritance. that I can do the work that you predestinated me to do. If you want to be prayed for, you can. But let's just pray. And you just purpose in your heart. You watch God &gt;&gt; answer your prayer. You say, "How do you know that?" Because that's what he said. &gt;&gt; He said, "All ye that come unto me and know wise will I turn you away." That's his word. And if you come on that basis, God will honor you. Let us pray. A gracious father, the flesh wars against the spirit, &gt;&gt; and the spirit against the flesh. And these two are contrary one to another, Father. And we know that the carnal mind is emnity with God. and the flesh and the carnal mind buckled together is such an overpowering force. But father, the inner ma man coupled with faith tells us that he who is in us is greater than he who is in the world and that all things are possible. And father, that's what we're desiring for our path forward is that we can step into the position that you have so spoke of us. That our adoption would come into its fullness, Father, and that we could without doubt or fear exercise the authority that you've given us in your word because we are your children. Yes, &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart, heavenly father, and I ask now, father, as our hands are lifted, our spirits have been moved by the word of God. We've heard that we were in your thinking. Why would you tell us it if it was not true? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You said, "I go to prepare a place for you. If it were not true, I would not tell you. &gt;&gt; And there's one thing you can't do, Father, and that's lie because you are truth. You can't pervert what you are &gt;&gt; and you're the way, the truth, the life. And father, we believe what you said, &gt;&gt; and Lord, we may not be what we want to we be. We may not be what we ought to be, Father. But we know we're going to be what you want us to be. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's true. &gt;&gt; And we're going to hang on to that &gt;&gt; this evening. So, Father, every heart that wanted more faith tonight, every heart that wanted to be able to take the promises of God, the sword of God in his hand, and wield it against the enemy, not only in their own lives, but in other people's lives. Father, we ask that you'd enkindle that divine revelation in our heart that we come from God and we go to God. Man, the works that I do shall you do also because I go unto the father and I'll not leave you comfortless but I personal pronoun will come again that where I am you may be also oh father sons and daughters of God in every walk of life you have people here from every walk of life father so you can be shining lights in every walk of life every conditions, every ways and levels of society. You've got real children shining the light to this lost and dying generation. We thank you, Father. Tonight, we ask you to enkindle the fire of God in our heart. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Aren't you glad to be a son and daughter of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing for our dismissal song. Oh yes. Oh yes. I'm a child &gt;&gt; of the king. That that make you pop up.
