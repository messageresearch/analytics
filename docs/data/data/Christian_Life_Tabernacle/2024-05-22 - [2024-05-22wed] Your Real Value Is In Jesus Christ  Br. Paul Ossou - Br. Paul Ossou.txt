begat elizar and elizar begat Matan and Matan be Jacob and Jacob begat Joseph and Jo uh Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ you may have your seats let's also turn to the Book of [Music] Romans we're going to read uh chapter 8 uh we'll just read the first verse [Music] the Bible says okay there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit s Lord Jesus once again we invite you to come and bless this word and to help us say something that will bring us closer to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I believe we still believe that we're happy to be gathered in the house of God tonight as David said that I was happy when they told unto me let's go to the house of the Lord uh from these few scriptures the Lord had put uh subject on my heart uh that I'm going to call your real place is in Jesus Christ or again your real value is in Jesus Christ we know in the society that we are living in and everything that we have in the world the we try to give value to things through everything for everything we encounter we we we we guess or we estimate what the value of that is if I want to get a bottle water there's a value for that I buy a clothing for there's a value for that if I want to buy a house there's a value for that and even up to uh we try to estimate the value of a person they're going to try to evaluate the value of that person according to the history of that person what that person has done in his life we try to give value to that person and the value is like a measure that's attached to something it's it's a value by which you can exchange something so I want to buy a bottle water they'll tell me it's a dollar therefore the value of the bottle water is a dollar and often time we estimate our own own value also based on what we are in society based on what we do at school based on what we are in the family but brother bam is telling us that this body of Flesh has no value has no value but as a man as a human we have to have value but what is our true value because often times is when man cannot recognize his own value that the circumstances of life will bring him to depression there are people that come to committing suicide because they couldn't confront or deal with certain things in life they estimated that the value of their life has gone down to zero that they can even commit suicide but what is our true value as Sons and Daughters of God [Music] I was thinking about it as Brother David was speaking about it in uh his preaching last Sunday even on Wednesday how do we find our identity uh by Prayer by the word and the value of this blanket that this man had that he he he himself never recognized that value until the day where something allow him to recognize the value of what he had and often time it's the same way that we are walking as Sons and Daughters of God sometimes forget that we are Sons and Daughters of God and we walk as simple human beings that have no value where brother Bram said that the soul that lives inside of us it's more than 10,000 world so when you recognize you a Son of God that just your soul has a value of 10,000 worlds not not not astonishing that when men fall that when committed when man committed sin man had to be bought back man had to be redeemed and to redeem a man God had to identify what value was to be to attribute to him for him to redeem that man so he can redeem me go God didn't find anything that could match than his own blood that the value of a Christian that's the value of a son of God that if I can give a dollar to get this bottle of water it means for me I need this Bott of water more than the dollar that I have that when God spilled his own blood to redeem me it's because he found out that I had more value than the blood of Jesus Christ and sometimes we walk without identifying or recognizing our value and that's some that's why sometimes when we do things that we should not be doing as sons of God is because we don't recognize that value it's like a child three years old if you take a threey old old child or two years old you take a a bill a $100 bill you take it and you fold it or you put it in the uh dirt and you take a a$1 bill clean you put the two together a two-year old child will take $1 but I don't believe that any of you here that if we do the same thing you're going to take that $1 why because this bill a $100 bill even if it's folded has not lost its value of $100 means a Son of God even if it's folded up if he was known before by God he doesn't lose his value the only thing that does is to come back clean so he could be used as a $100 bill but he's not going to underestimate himself he's not going to tell himself I don't have any more value you cannot be a Son of God today and not be a Son of God tomorrow your value is to remain a Son of God and that's why as a Son of God as David would say I constantly put the Lord before me whereever I go regardless of the circumstance that comes before me I am a Son of God can I do this I'm a I'm a daughter of God is this something I can do this is not for me because I'm a Son of God because I'm a daughter of God and when I was thinking about it I came back to this scripture of the genealogy of Jesus Christ you know when they talk about a a a story of a family they speak they talk about the father and the mother they speak about the man and the woman but mostly when you speak about the genealogy especially in the Bible they only speak about men they say this man beg got that man this man we got that that other man but when you read the genealogy of Jesus Christ they they call about five women and we're going to look at the story of this five women the first woman that the Bible talks about is Tamar the Bible says in verse three MTH of Matthew chapter 1 verse three Tamar that Judah begat feris and Zarah of Tamar and Tamar and the story of Tamar we find it in Genesis chapter uh 38 uh uh Tamar was uh uh judah's daughter-in-law the Tamar was the the the wife of the son of Judah called a and when a was he was evil before God God took him and Judah took Tamar he gave him to his second son who was called Omar your brother has died had not uh uh uh left any uh uh seed take the the the your brother's wife so you can bring up a seed for your brother but when Onan went to to Tamar he didn't want to leave a seed to Tamar and it didn't please God and God took Onan and and Judah and Judah had a younger son and he he he he he he was afraid to give terar to Shannon he was afraid that he was going to die that he may lose all his three sons he asked Tamar he said go back to your the family that this the time that Shen will grow up when shanon will be older he will take you as a wife Tamma went back to his family her family and she waited there sh grow up but they never wanted to give him as a husband and Judah lost his wife and after he lost his wife uh one day he decided to go and take care of his sheep at in a place called timna with one of his friends and people told himar look at your father-in-law he's going to a place called timna and T Tamar took all to she took off her uh widower clothes and she dressed herself as a prostitute and she went on the road by which Judah was going to pass by and when Judah came by there he was attracted by this prostitute and because Tamar was covered he didn't know that this was Tamar and he asked can I go with you the Tamar ask what are you going to give me he said well when I go I will send you a little H lamb okay but Tamar requested and said but what are you going to give me now as a guarantee he said what do you want he said I want you to give me your your steak your the Signet your your your seal yes your Signet I want you to give me either a bracelet and I want you to give me your and Judah went and he left the signant he left the the the the stick that he was was walking with and he went with Tamar and he went went his way and then the next day he took what he promised to Tamar the little animal and gave to his friend he said go give this to the prostitute and when his friend came there were no prostitute anymore and he asked questions oh there's never been a prostitute here so he went back to Judah J said well we cannot make any noise otherwise we're going to be ridicu let's just wait let's just keep quiet now when Tamar went back to her place she realized she was pregnant and people realized that Tamar was pregnant uh uh three months later they send a message to Judah that behold your daughter-in-law is pregnant she she was she prostituted herself and she became pregnant and Judah gave an instruction that she may be taken outside of a city where she could be stoned and they took that prostitute so they can go and burn her outside of the city the Tamar took the stick she took the bracelet she took the the the the stick she said before you can burn me I want you to go show these things to Judah tell him so if he can recognize who does this thing belong to at that time they can burn me after that and when Judah looks at it he said I am the one who's guilty because after that pregnancy they came Faris and Zarah and Zarah that's what Tamar was that's the story of Tamar who's in the genealogy of Jesus Christ to whom God gave value to be in the genealogy of Jesus Christ a woman who became prostitute to go out with his father-in-law certainly there were uh uh good women in the genealogy of Jesus Christ that are not inserted in this genealogy but Tamar God found out that the value of Tamar needed to be inserted in the genealogy of Jesus Christ so it means regardless of what your story is regardless of what your pass is regardless of what people are saying about you regardless of what the devil is reminding you if God has placed his seed on you in you he's giving you value he's giving you your value in Christ from Tamar Judah had phis and feris five generations later he had Salon a great General in the army of Israel who brought the uh uh the the the the the the battle ofan battle to the Army of Jericho and when they got Jericho back from whom did Salomon fall in love with Ahab the prostitute that's what the Bible calls her Ahab the prostitute and she's in the Gen ology of Jesus God gave value Rahab she was not even of Israel she was of Jericho Rahab was a prostitute rejected from the people of Jericho but Rahab had an understanding of what was happening in Israel Rahab believed the god of Israel when the spies come came into Jericho RAB identified that there were people of Israel it said it's those people that have the truth it it's those people that have the true God we have heard the testimonies of that God it's true that I'm a prostitute but that God and I I I know I have to follow him Raab she helped those spies to to hide and when Rahab helped those spies to hide as those spies were about to go RAB told them I know the testimony of thy God I know that your God is great I want to follow that God uh promise me that when you will come into Jericho not only you will save me and my family but you will make me a part of you Raab didn't look at a situation as a PR but she believed that she could be part of that people that was serving a true God that was serving a true God that was serving a powerful God RAB the prostitute in the genealogy of Jesus Christ God gave him value give her value says in the message uh uh why why the little battle Bethlehem 49 we find out that it was also become the home of the Harlot Rahab when Israel had passed over the borderline of Jordan River into Palestine we are acquainted with the story of Rahab the hared let's picture her this morning for a few minutes a young lady a beautiful young a beautiful young woman who some Misfortune in in life had had been forced being a pagan had been forced into the life that she was living and many times people are forced into the life that they live like Rahab we are certainly have come across things we have certainly find ourselves in certain circumstances because we were pressed and forced into those circumstances but Rahab um I was in the prison the other night to see a man who was uh uh uh taking a sentence I took him by the hand and I talked to him and I said why would you do such a thing as that and holding me by the hand he began to speak he was forced into what he was doing I said because that you permitted that to force you to that you don't have to do that you no man has to drink I said I'm nervous myself but there's no need of that and this young woman after she had gotten her first hearing of Israel it's like many of us that have heard talk about the message for the first time and of a God who was a a God that answers prayer that answered prayer not only a God to pray to but a God that answered back when she heard that there was a god of Miracles who could perform miracles who dried up the Seas and Rain bread out of out of the heavens her heart began to tremble and when she got the first message from the two preachers that went over went over quickly she accepted it with all her heart she was a prostitute but when these two preachers they began to preach about the God of Israel she was she accepted it with all her heart she accepted it with all her heart and there was a Scarlet C cord bound to her [Music] window for a protection of her house because she had received the message and and if God has that made of Rahab a prostitute as soon as she she had re heard the message as soon as she had believed the message and she read as a son as a a daughter of God and the pur Contin ahe she can no longer continue to be a prostitute she had believed with all her heart and we know that when you repent God doesn't only forgive you but he also justifies you so when they wrote the genealogy of Jesus Christ God forgot that Rahab was a prostitute as as long as God is concerned Rahab was never a prostitute God forgot it but when I'm told about a story uh there was a old man who was a uh uh he was holy who really like reading his Bible and often time when he was reading his Bible oh he was getting really happy he would scream he he would just scream out he would scream Allelujah and he went to visit a daughter who was living in a city where before she was a good Christian but because of the environment and of the friendships the the her friends cause her to forget her value of a real daughter of God to say that your value is to be like this in society is to do this in society and one day her daughter she uh the daughter organized a a party with her friends and she knew that if he if she left the dad the dad with the Bible he's going to mess up the party so he told the the dad you know Dad it's just a a you know conversation between friends with a young with between girls if you stay there it's not going to be comfortable for you what I'm proposing is for you to go upstairs and when we finish you can maybe come downstairs and when because I know you like to read she took she took the Bible she hit it she took a a geography book he gave it Dad he said you know you know read a little bit about geography and you kind of know you know what's going on in the world the dad said okay it's no problem uh thank you my daughter and he took the book of geography and as he was upstairs just few moments L Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the daughter said what Dad what's going on it's not the Bible it's geography yes he said yes yes my daughter he said it's geography he said look here in this book of geography they say that in the ocean there's places where they can't even find the depths of it and yesterday I was reading in the Bible that my sins they were sending the sin of forgetfulness so my sins they went in the place where they cannot find them he found God in geography Rahab so her sins were forgiven and she was justified and says it says I might add here paragraph 52 did you know she was a type of the Gentile Church she was a gentile and she was a type of the Gentile church when they heard the message we were all out in spiritual prostitution committing spiritual fornication against the god of Heaven in all kinds of stuff in all kinds of denominations and religions but when we heard that there was a god there was a God that still lived that could perform Miracles quickly we received the message there was there was a there was it was at that time that was applied the blood of the Lord Jesus when we heard the message we took the decision when we recognize our value regardless of what we were we take we make a decision we we take the [Music] engagement to walk according to our [Music] value if my value says I'm a Son of God I cannot lie oh God keep me from lies if my value says that I'm a Son of God and I cannot smoke oh Lord I know yesterday I smoked but now you're telling me that I'm a Son of God forgive me I will not do it anymore Rahab The Prostitute God allow that she may be in the genealogy of Jesus but says a lot of things about RAB her faith deis her decision and salmon had Boaz and boas took a a girl or woman in this that we call ruthu Ruth the moabit the just the fact of you being called a moabit it already means that you came from the the incess relationship between lot and his children and the daughter that those are the moabites because it was when lot went in with his wife that's when the moabit came Ruth the moabit ruab Ruth the moabit when Naomi went to Moab with with the with the the children that were young I'm sorry and because they were young they grew up there they they married the the moabit daughters and the two boys they marry Ora and Ruth the the husband of Naomi died the two children of of Naomi died Naomi makes a decision to go back to Israel but because these two daughters uh uh uh Ruth and orpa were already part of the Israel family and they knew about the God of Israel they knew the message they had believed the message and when Naomi decides to go back he said I'm going back I'm going to go back to practice My Religion uh uh in peace oh orer said it says well it's true that I went to a church message but uh but now they're giving me an opportunity to do whatever I want I I think I will not go on anymore no I won't but Ruth she said what I read about the message cannot remain here myself and believe that you're going to go back to a message Church wherever you go I will go where you will die I will die look at this moabit that finds herself in Israel she was Moab one who came from the ancestral relationship but she finds herself in Israel practicing the religion of Israel she came came she came in the message and who's taken a decision to follow the message in the in its entirety and from there we understand boas came and exercises the law of Kingsman to whom even God has allowed that the whole book may be written about her in the Bible a moabit God never looked at her past God looked at the value of Ruth God looked at the decision that root made God looked at the engagement that root made God placed the real value of what Ruth was in the genealogy the next woman in this genealogy the fourth woman was BBA the the the wife of Uriah the one that husband she got the husband got killed adulterous woman and she caused the husband to be killed but she's in genealogy of Jesus BBA that uh David came and and and and uh lasted upon David came and committed adultery with her trying to cover it by calling back Uriah and having him to go to his wife and because she was already pregnant but a true Soldier saying that others are dying over there the battle I'm not going to go with in my house and and and and and with my wife my place is over there at the battlefield I'm going to go fight for my nation and because David had no choice he asked the commander of the army that you may Place him where the battle is really raging where where there's no place to hide on the no place to run and that's what was done and Uriah was was killed and that's how David got BBA and from Bela Kim Salomon and the last woman in this genealogy is Mary this young woman you know today we can believe the history but in the time of Jesus a young woman comes he said I never touch a man but I'm I'm pregnant and it's the Holy Spirit how she was made fun of that she was a liar that's the the eye the look of of of of of man but the value of God the angel told Mary that you found Grace says uh in Mary's belief paragraph uh paragraph 11 and as she moved along she raised up her head again it they stood this great light in in before her perhaps the same pillow of fire that led the children of Israel came walking from the light that great Archangel Gabriel Gabriel and he said Hail Mary means stop blessed blessed are thou among among the women how to tell the other woman went to the well that morning perhaps thinking about the washing that they had to do or some task or some Society some Society in the church they had to take care of but Mary was thinking on the scriptures was not it cleopas and his friend on the first Easter morning as they were thinking on the scripture when Jesus appeared to them and as they saw this great Angel it SLE this little virgin she stopped and she stopped and he came closer to her and saluted her and gave her a message that was a hard message to believe the hard message for this child to believe for she was nothing but a girl he gave her something to believe that was more outstanding and hard to believe than anything that's ever given to anyone it was hard to believe this message that was given to Mary and explain months before God the the the angel came to Zachariah he was who was a a a priest or a high priest who knew the scripture the angel gave the same message to Zachariah that the wife who was a Barren was to have a child when there've been testimonies in the past there was Sarah there was Elizabeth there was [Music] Anna Zariah ask a question to the angel how can that be how can I recognize that the angel looked at him and says unbeliever you're going to become a m I will open your mouth just so you can go and pronounce the name of John that I have given you but the same message was given to this young girl I had no testimony of anything like that ever happening she said Let It Be according to your word yes when the message is preached God wants us to have the same disposition as Mary here's your your your handmade I'm going to go in the middle of the paragraph paragraph 12 how shall it be my Lord the the angel said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow and the holy thing that be born from you will be called The Son of God it says watch her she didn't question that she said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word it says if we could just do that that's the only thing that's the only thing that's what God loves that's the only way to get right with God is take him at his word that's the only way that there is to please God take his word don't trust your knowledge you will reason your value is not in your your knowledge your reason how can it be done it cannot be done when you reason then you lose the victory we must cast down reasoning and believe what God said to be the truth God said that your value is in Jesus Christ that you are more valuable than his own blood that he he spilled his own blood so he can redeem you that you are son and a daughter of God that's what God said that's the value that God is attributing to you don't consider the value that the world is giv you I'm going to skip some things to go to the end our value come like Tamar come like Rahab like BBA come Ruth like Ruth when we come into Christ our true value is Romans 10 now it's what Roman said now there are no longer there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ now we are recognizing our true value there are there is no therefore no condemnation [Applause] there is not one thing that's supposed to condemn a Son of God ites that you're going to behave as a pagan and say that there are no condemnation there's no condemnation it means that you are no longer living according to the flesh but you are living according to the spirit and your walk it says holy holy holy be the Lord and your your walk is now in Holiness and you constantly put the word before you and everything that presents itself before you so that nothing brings you into condemnation and you remain a Son of God and that's what God wants for each one of us he says we have the value and our value in Christ is in Christ that when we we get that we may get into Christ that we may abide in Christ it says if you if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and when we abide in Christ and his word abide in us he forgets our past he gives us a ticket to get into ware in his Warehouse where the everything where there's everything it says you have h h h you have a free access whatever you want whatever the only thing remain in Christ remain in me abide in me then you have your true value and there you can have access to everything that you have need of many times we we don't recognize our value that's when we think our God is limited he has never been limited he's capable of everything and he said says that he gives us everything that we ask and the scripture says we don't receive because we don't ask and we don't ask is because we don't believe is because we don't recognize our value we don't recognize that we are Sons and Daughters of God that everything that belongs to to God belongs to us he says that we are uh uh uh air with Jesus that everything that Jesus inherited we have P it's also our portion we have a part in that and that's our value as we we would stand tonight my brother my sister our value is not in what we possess in this world it's not what what the world says of us it's not in what the world think of us it's not in what the world says about us imagine the testimony that people will tell in the days of Tamar H imagine the testimony that was told of Rahab how what to say about belba but the true value is in Christ look at that day Jesus went to Simon he was invited at Simon's place a a a great high priest with the uh the guesses that knew what the scriptures were but none of them knew the value of Jesus Christ Jesus got into Simon's house nobody washed his feet nobody paid attention to him they put him at the corner and there was a prostitute a a woman of a bad life who was coming was coming by perhaps she saw a lot of horses and a lot of Chariot and things around he said oh what a great feast around here what's going on she probably try to look across the door she saw people that were well dressed but at the corner they they there was someone who looked like it was being neglected someone with no value she was a prostitute but there was a seed in her there was something in her and that thing told her but that one but he the one that John said is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world but how come all these people they cannot recognize his value how can they leave him in that condition oh can I do something I know I'm a prostitute true but can I give get a possibility away for me to get in what can I do he said I will try to do something I have decided to do something I believe that I'll will crost all the obstacles so I can get to him because his value it doesn't Merit what they are doing to him the value of this message it's not what people are thinking of this message I have to get access to that message she went she went and bought a per a perfume of of a great price she came and she fulfilled herself and find a way out around maybe those that were at their door try to stop her but when God has placed something in you and you have taken the decision to go to the word God Will Make A Way to create the way for you so you can get access to the word and she came around it she found herself at the feet of Jesus Oh perhaps when she was going around to get to Jesus there was probably a God who tried to stop her some tell him no don't touch him oh because she's a prostitute she's going to go to Jesus Let's Go Let Her Go and let's see what he's going to do let's see what he's going to do he's a prostitute you know in every way he's there to be ridicul so if we give him a prostitute there's nothing wrong let her go she came to the feet of Jesus she was no longer a prostitute when she got there she went to her knees and she started repenting she started crying she started crying with her tears she started washing his feet she took what she had the most precious she took and she started wiping the feet to Jesus and the Pharisees were looking they were saying in their heart oh he doesn't know that she's a prostitute can and in front of people and he calls himself a prophet Jesus who was Discerning the [Music] thoughts he knew what Simon was saying in himself he said Simon Simon there was a man a man who had two people that owed him there was one who owed him $5,000 and there was another one who owed him $50 because the two didn't have the means by which to pay the debt he decided to forgive them of their debt he said which of them you think will would have been more appreciative they said certainly the one who owed 5,000 I said I came to your house you didn't watch my feet you didn't pay attention to me but look at this woman that you know as you're thinking she was a prostitute but because of what she had done her many sins has been forgiven and as that woman was leaving that place as far as Jesus is concerned she would never been a prostitute to begin with never in Christ this prostitute came to her True Value if we were to tell a testimony today we'll never say she's a prostitute thank let's bow our heads God our heavenly father with the pressure of this [Music] world we were in certain things horrible forgetting our true value but we believe Lord that in you we have our true value that we are Sons and Daughters of God we are you [Music] redeemed you pay the greatest Price to save us we may not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit that's why I pray to you God may your spirit may it descend upon each one of your children fill each one of your children with your holy ghost that your Holy Spirit may lead us every day of Our Lives that your presence always be near us we have need of you Lord come fill our [Music] hearts come lead us and hold us into your hands we commit all to you in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ amen [Music] amen amen praise the Lord it was a tiny simple stable all beat and War hardly a place for a king to be born he didn't choose some place special to reveal his majesty so I know if I'll give him control he'll be born in me let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it [Music] star live inside this house of clay and mold it every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart [Music] well outwardly I'm nothing not much to behold unlikely the place for his word to unfold but if I'll just yield this vessel let him have his way from glory on to Glory he'll change me day by day let your word be BN in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this house of clay and Lord it every day let your word be in the MJ of my heart oh and outwardly I'm nothing not much to behold unlikely the place for his word to UNF but if I'll just Shield this vessel let him have his way from Glory onto Glory he'll change me day by day let you word be in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it St oh live inside this house of clay and mold it every day let your wor [Music] manger are you thankful for the word tonight your real value so many times we want to give oursel our own value your your values in your identification we want to identify oursel by our occupation just as you look in the scripture well this is what they did for a living well that wasn't her identification she found her identification when she came to Christ Maybe there's somebody here you're still struggling with your identification you're still identifying with the things of the world and you see that you're doing things you you still shouldn't do and you're still wrestling with things I believe you're you're still struggling with who you really are in Christ don't go don't go from [Music] here the same let them change you let them do with your heart but why don't you be like that one that came and washed jesus' feet you keep looking at your past and what you did and all your mistakes and all your failures and and that's how you impute value to yourself you say well I did this and I'm not worthy I should have never done that and I've already been baptized and I I've told people I had the Holy Ghost and then I I fail to this sin and and and now what what are people going to think of me don't worry about what people think about you what does he think about you why don't you just wash his feet right take a little time tonight say Lord I love you yes because you first loved me and done a lot of things that I shouldn't have done Lord but you're telling me that's my not my identification that my identification is in you you the prophet of God said it's like taking a a pocket full of coins he grab a a bunch of coins and in there you got pennies and nickels and dimes and quarters and half dollars said that's how the world is some people can only give a penny God can only use them in a penny way some can only use them in a nickel way and and there we go with our carnal mind well I'm probably just a nickel I'm probably just a penny no God said lot was a penny but Abraham was a silver dollar and Paul said Galatians he said if ye be in Christ then you are Abraham's seed and heir to the promis that's your identification as he was ministering it just struck my heart about the prodical son his value wasn't The Inheritance he was given the inheritance was given because his value as a son because of his identification I see how our our pastors been ministering on identification brother Peterson about the face of God you know what gives that coin the value is the face of the coin yes and here God's telling you you're mine you're my Offspring You're my seed that's your value why don't we just worship him a little bit just allow the Lord to deal with your heart and that you can come to a true identification of who you are G why don't you just take a moment before we're dismissed pour your spirit out on me fall just like the rain saturate if you need prayer or want to come to the altar it's open why didn't you make
