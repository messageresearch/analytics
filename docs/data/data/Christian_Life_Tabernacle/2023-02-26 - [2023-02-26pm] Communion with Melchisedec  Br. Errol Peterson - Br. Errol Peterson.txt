testimony for the glory of the king of your kingdom I'm not used to speak like in front of a lot of people but I will try in 2022 not in 2020 I had a a wisdom tooth cavities that was taken out like some month later I had to have a big pain at the same place I was maybe it's gonna go and then I tell my husband this this thing is still this pain is still like persisting I have to go to see though the dentist and then on August the 12th the Third 2022 I went back to my dentist and the dentist said I was suspicious of a jaw cancer to my my right job I speak to my husband about it and you say when I pray he was on Wednesday and the the dentist take a long fall to to to tell me that I have a cure cancer he takes a long time to to tell me but because he didn't know how to tell me I have my kids with me she was like she she didn't know what to tell me but she tried her best to tell me that what I see here might be a cancer and then I called my husband I say the dog that's what the doctors say I may have a jaw cancer but I I want I have to go to church even if it's two minutes later no two minutes before the the end of the church I have to go and see the preacher so that it will pray for me and then I came when I came it was about a nephew who was speaking who was preaching to speak uh he was preaching about let me see please Matthew was speaking about uh excuse me yeah but I'm a few we're preaching about the the Lord Jesus the Lord doing it it's my turn and I say yes it's my turn and then he starts preaching you say even if you went to the doctor right now and you have x-ray no X-ray and then the doctor says something don't believe that just forget about it it's your turn and I was I was at a very bad day I was like just cry because he speak to me so at the end of the Church of the service I didn't come back here again for the prayer because I like have my wrist my answer and let my husband say you can start giving a testimony I say no I want to see I want to go back to the to the dentist I I I wanted to say that I don't have any cancer again so that I can give a test because you can give a test match you know he said if you can't give down I said no I

mama the dentist say I have a tumor that they have to be removed my dad say I don't believe that the the same God who healed me for my le liver cancer is the one who's gonna heal I don't believe that

everybody is talking to me I don't know he say God is going to heal you so I my I was like maybe I'm not gonna pass through the surgery God's Gonna Take It Off and then one week I have a surgery on December the 29th last year so when when I was one week before my surgery I was listening to this I was listening again to Brother Brian preaching uh I think I would just read it excuse me again yes I

be removed without the doctor thank you if you if you don't want the the tumor to be moving with the dog the doctor I know you're gonna you're gonna be the you're gonna be the Sergio what's gonna weather the white clothes to do my surgery and then so today I have to go to the surgery I was calling everybody in my family were calling me what are you good are you good are you good I say everything is good I keep on belief that even in the the surgery room God gonna be there he's gonna do the work by himself if he wants me to pass through the surgery is he's the one who's gonna do it

of the world that you may be glorified not much tonight may you come and bless us tonight as we linger in your presence in Jesus name we pray amen amen while we are standing let us turn to our Bibles for scripture reading we'll turn to the Book of Genesis chapter 14. and we'll read from verses 14 to 20. and then Matthew chapter 26 verses 26 to 30. and then in Hebrews chapter 7 verses 1 to 2. our first reading would be from Genesis chapter 14. verses 14 to 20. and when Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive he armed these trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto Dan and he divided himself against him he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hoba which is in the on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of cheryloma and of the kings that were with him at the valley of Sheva which is the King's Dale and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and he blessed and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all Genesis and now Matthew chapter 24 26 I mean verses 26 to 30. and as they were eating Jesus took his bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to his disciples and said take it this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shared for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink his forth of his of this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it Anew with you in my father's Kingdom and when they are sung and him they went out into the Mount of Olives and in our final scripture in Hebrews chapter 7 verses 1 to 2 for this melchized the king of Salem Priests of the most high God whom it Abram returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to also Abraham gave a tithe a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that king of Salem which is king of Peace may the Lord add His blessings the reading of his word you may be seated so tonight we would like to Fellowship around this inspiration on communing with Melchizedek communing with Melchizedek now we find according to our scripture reading that lot went down to Sodom and Gomorrah and the Gentile kings came to Sodom and they declared war and they took lot and his family captive and the Bible says that lot was a brother to Abraham and when Abram heard that his brother had been taken captive we find that he went after a fallen brother now as you all know that what brother Branham says about Adam and then Abraham Adam could not keep the Covenant of God so God started off a New Covenant with Abraham and yet we find in the Book of Genesis we find a mystery being made known of what the Bible was all about the Bible Abraham calls it the seven seal book of redemption the whole Bible is about Redemption and Redemption means bringing it back to its former condition and here we find in this little story in the Bible anybody can read it with loud real just thinking well it's another story but we thank God for a prophet in our day he could see further than what the letters were printed in the Bible he said here that Abram was absolutely doing the work of Redeemer by going after his Fallen brother and yet we find there was lot it was is his brother the Bible says and Abram he armed himself with his servants see they were born in his house they were faithful and they were the ones who were circumcised now circumcision being a type of the Holy Ghost and they were all included in the same Covenant and we find that the whole scripture deals with this Covenant which God made with Abraham in the Book of Genesis even the faith that Abram had but Abraham says his faith was the for the coming of Jesus and that Faith was a faith unite spirit and flesh together and that's the only true faith that God recognizes upon the Earth that's why Jesus said when I when he returns again will I find faith so brother Branham says yes Malachi 4. the faith of the fathers will be restored again amen the heart of the children will return to the faith of the fathers and that Faith started when the hello gods or the power of fire came into the body of Jesus and from Jesus he Sanctified the 120 who went to the upper room and on their Pentecost that polaro fire came and he divided himself up amongst those hundred and twenty and brother Branham says that for 2000 years the Holy Ghost was bound we never saw the pillar of fire again but yet the end time the pillar of fire returns back again at the time when there has to be a restoration back to the faith of the fathers so they could not be of restoration until the pillar of fire returns again to the Church of the Living God so there's a mystery behind all these things that was happening and the brother Brian says the messenger of Malachi 4 must do two things he must reveal the mystery of the seven Thunders and turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers and he says these divinely revealed truths will literally turn the heart of the children to the faith of the fathers amen and yet we find the story unfolding in the Book of Genesis and the scripture says that Abraham pursued the enemy until then and he smote them then to Damascus then he slew them brought them blown back all that was lost and that's what Jesus done he went to Calvary he paid the price of redemption to bring back all that was lost to bring us back to our former estate again we are going back to Eden Hallelujah so we find that it was a picture or a story of redemption but Abraham says it's the seven sealed book of redemption and we find that Christ pursued the enemy to the end until he brought back everything that was lost amen as I were the opening of the seals we find the Redemption of the Bride his wife those first four horse riders then the fifth was the Jews the sixth the Redemption of the earth and the seventh they were silence he says nothing about the seven but as we all know that was the coming of the Lord that was the appearing of the logos yet at the end time Revelation 10 he says was your seventh seal so we are living in Bible times great Supernatural things has happened in our day what a wonderful day we are living in the songwriter says there's never been a day like this day there's never been a light that shines so bright as his glorious light of the hour we are children of the light we are walking in the light of God Amen so we find that this was a great mystery that was unfolding itself in Genesis and here was Lot Abram's brother he was a relative to Abram his own relative they had the same grandfather so we find Redemption is all about the family of God those that are a part of him amen so there was a blood tie between Abram and that feeling was that he could not lose his Fallen brother his brother had gone astray the brother of God said he was taken away by the enemy and he went to rescue a fallen brother and that's when we go out and we give witness of the message of the hour we are not looking for church members we are looking for fallen brothers that are part of the Covenant they are included in the Covenant which God made with Abram amen that's why it's a Grace Covenant Abram I have already done it go before me and be thou perfect Abrams God told Adam if you do this I'll do that if you do this I'll do that but with Abram it was Grace Grace that's how when the Capstone comes down at the end time it comes with shoutings of Grace Grace not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord so we find a picture brother Branham says of the true church they're going after a fallen brother they are going after the brother that's of the same bloodline see we find the prophet says a picture of the two churches that is blessed of God that as the promise of God here at the end time they have a covenant with God that's why when he comes in Revelation 10 he comes as the angel of the Covenant he comes as a covenant Angel he comes with a rainbow around his head and his feet as well as a fire so he's coming for a covenant people he's coming for the Royal seed of Abram that's whatever happened in the life of Abram in the Book of Genesis that same thing is to repeat again at the end time Abram was visited by Melchizedek so the Royal seed will be visited Again by Melchizedek Hallelujah just before the coming of the Sun Hallelujah and that change is in progress as we preach the other night there's a change since the promise has been made he's changing us amen we are getting away from the world but we are growing closer to him we are being more transformed into the image of the Heavenly he says don't pattern after Hollywood you must pattern after heaven we are reflecting that Vision which the prophet saw of the Bride yeah he saw the bride in preview amen you saw the first bride and she was walking in tune of the word of God and then he saw the American bride he said he made it made him sick after all the meetings and the manifestations of the spirit and this is what that message could produce but then the voices the bride will come into preview again and she walked exactly as the first bride Hallelujah she was properly dressed the prophet explains in that preview how that bride looked so if we look any different to the one that appeared in the vision that we are not in the bride we must pattern after that Vision because then we are part of the vision that the prophet saw in preview Hallelujah so we find that this church has a covenant with God Hallelujah and has faith in this Covenant the prophecy is the holy spirit leads them that is born in the same household of the Holy Ghost where Christ was born to pursue after the wayward the backslidden slaying every devil that has overcome them Hallelujah overcoming sin speaking to the people about their lusts and the things that they are doing preaching to them the true gospel we have the true gospel brothers and sisters we I don't think we realize what we have amen this is a message direct from the Throne of God God came to visit us here at the end time Hallelujah so we find that uh Abram wanted to bring them back into full fellowship with God again that's why when you come into the message you are coming into full fellowship with God again that's how I felt the first time I came to the message it was something totally different to what we had in denomination here we experienced the reality of God here the word becomes a reality unto us yeah everything has changed the way you speak the way you conduct yourself the way you do business this is something totally unique in itself something different to what the world has out there because we find we listen to the gospel out there it's just philosophy and psychology and that's all that they are teaching the people you know how uh this happened to me and how that you've got to do this and that to the other but when you come to the message of the hour it's just solid wood it tells you exactly who you are where you come from and where you are going to Hallelujah the promise is why because they are Covenant Brothers not just members but we are looking for Covenant Brothers we are looking for blood relations we have the same father we come from the same source Hallelujah he says in the message in the book of Hebrews we are in a battle now we are after our fallen brother that God before the foundation of the world saw and predestinated unto eternal life see and the things of the world got him caught up in a whirlwind he's out into the societies and classes him and his wife walking up and down the streets smoking and drinking and carousing trying to find peace and the spirit of Christ in us as it would be in Abraham we are going after him we must bring him in why he's a fallen brother see with all the armors of God the angels of God encamped about we have gone to bring back our fallen brother Hallelujah so we're not even praying Church we are this is a fellowship of all brothers and sisters together in Christ amen but as it unfolds we'll see what is absolutely taking place at the end time so we find that despite what lot did to Abram there was a bond between the two of them when his brother Bachelor and gone astray the holy spirit is still called for that person Hallelujah because he is a brother so we find that since the fall down Through the Ages it was the spirit of Christ going after Fallen Brothers and we find that in a battle like Abram did to bring back Brothers those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life back to the household of faith so when Abram returned in Victory Melchizedek met him showing the brothers and sisters at the consummation when the battle is over when it's time for the lost brother to come in the Royal seat of Abram will meet Melchizedek again that's why the prophet preached a message who is this Melchizedek he has no mother no father no beginning of days no ending of life it says that he's the same yesterday today and forever what was he showing us Melchizedek has come it is about the time for the promised son to appear on the scene Hallelujah you see there's an appearing of the of the Lord and is the coming of the Lord the appearing is the spirit coming but the coming of the Lord itself is when we meet him in the air amen as the physical person but now we've seen the appearing of the Lord so we find when Melchizedek met him he never offered him money he offered him Bread and Wine so there must be a spiritual meaning associated with this offering which Melchizedek gave to Abram so let us look at Melchizedek and we'll find out that his titles unfolds the different stages of redemption in his titles you find out that he was a priest of the most high God tomb Abram paid tithes and he blessed Abraham now Melchizedek was none other than the incarnated Lord Jesus Christ and as a type he gave Abraham communion that was the first time the communion was ever served on the Earth he gave communion to the one who was in a covenant with him so we find that communion is not just for everybody who feels like taking communion it is for the believer who's in a covenant with Melchizedek because in Genesis chapter 17 verse 7. God told Abraham and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their Generations so God is interested only in one lineage and that's of the seed of Abram so in this generation there's going to be a call again for the seed of Abram and is only one group of people who saw the sign of Melchizedek that Abram saw in Genesis 18 where his back turned to the congregation and then he said and he told Sarah what she was thinking in the tent behind him whom was he addressing it to the seed of Abram in our case it's the Royal seat of Abram when we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost see so this message is designated to a specific group of people and this is what he says further in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee so he promised to be Only a God to Abram and to recede and to them after him as we heard this morning about the worship and all you know if you are not part of the seed of Abram is all in vain and how do I identify yourself as being a part of the seed of Abram by recognizing your day and its message to see what God is doing in your day all those who are part of the Covenant they will respond to the message of the hour it's designated to a specific class of people so tonight we can say Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound that saved a Wretch like Me I was blind but now I can see by the Sovereign Grace of almighty God amen he says yeah and I will give unto thee now I want you to remember these words to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee verse 8 and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger now to Abram it was a natural land but to us it's a spiritual land and that land is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the land of promise and all the land of cadence for an everlasting possession and I will be their God verse 9. and God said unto Abram Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their Generations God is unchanging it shows the Infinity of God you know how many people they are on the earth tonight billions of people but he knows what each and everyone is thinking just to give you an idea of the great God that we serve knows what you are thinking he knows your holy history he knows your future he knows everything amen in verse 10 this is my Covenant which he shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man shall among you shall be circumcised which is a type of the Holy Ghost so do we a royal seat of Abram we must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost we are not counted as part of the sea that's why Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children to them that are far of even as many as the Lord Our God shall cope amen not him that willeth but it's God that share with Mercy so God gave Abram communion as a shadow that when he becomes flesh he would be cut in parts and communion would be given as a further symbol of his body and a further revelation of himself as we all know at our communion table we have wine symbolizing his blood which is the life of the spirit and the bread itself symbolizing the body and he said at the last communion he says do this in the remembrance of me see so his body was resurrected and ascended on high but he sent back the spirit to seal every Covenant brother into his spiritual body upon the Earth who are of the same order with no beginning of days or ending of life so you had you existed in God's mind before there was a star a molecule or a atom you were right there already God knew the hour that you would come and the Very thought that God had of you he presented that thought to you in a word and the word comes to the prophet and it was a prophet the message that Drew is like a magnet into the household of faith amen so if it is not by chance that you're here tonight it's not by chance that you accepted the message of the hour you in God's mind before the foundation of the world Hallelujah see so we find it's to those who are of the same order and when we receive the spirit we are baptized into the fellowship with Melchizedek we become a part of him the Bible says we are by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and brother Branham says the alchizedek became Jesus now we want to see what he says when he became flesh John chapter 5 and verse 53. then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you you said some people they don't take communion you are absolutely openly declaring to everybody I'm not a part of him I'm not a part of Melchizedek but you partaking of the communion you are absolutely giving Witness that you have life within you that you are a part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ see he says whosoever eatth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that easeth my flesh and drink with my blood dwelleth in me and I in him part of him as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that either me even he shall live by me so it's a close-knit family the family of God I love the family of God United all together as one that's why there's a kindred spirit it's a spirit of the Holy Spirit see and they couldn't really understand what Jesus was saying he was he was absolutely telling them or speaking of the believer partaking of his being see but we find later Paul came around said it was the New Covenant in his blood we must partake of him to be identified in the New Covenant and we must do it in remembrance of him and so we take communion we remember him the price he paid for our Redemption upon the cross of calvary the most cruelest death that any man could die of he had to follow that route to declare his love for you amen we are in a covenant with him by sacrifice and we find here in Psalms 50. verses 1 to 6. David is giving a preview of the opening of the seventh seal other brand says the Seven Seas is risen all over the Bible see there was silence in heaven for the space of half hour but the activity was no longer in heaven because as long as he's in heaven those seraphims they cried day and night holy holy holy unto the law holy holy holy unto the Lord but if he's not there there's nothing to worship anymore and they were all in silence and we find him in Revelations 10 one I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven and brother Branham says that was the seventh seal the seventh seal which brought him down amen and the scripture says I saw another Mighty Angel come down let's read psalms 50. from verse 1. the psalm of Assaf the Mighty God even the Lord had spoken and called the Earth from the rising of the Sun that was from Genesis unto the going down thereof that's in the Book of Revelation is amen he went to Sunset Mountain it was the setting Sun but it was also the dawning of a brand new day rise Shine for thy light has come this was now introducing a new day this was the bride's day the Gathering of the Bride together in first two out of Zion the Perfection of beauty God hath shine Our God shall come he's speaking about the coming of the Lord and shall not keep silence there'll be a Breaking of Silence when our God comes because the activity is no longer in heaven it's now on Earth a fire shall devour before him and it shall be very Tempest you will surround about him he shall call to the heavens from above and to the Earth that he may judge his people he comes as judge with the wig amen gather my Saints together unto me so it's coming both as judge at the same time Gathering they elect together the Saints by the same message those that made a covenant with me is the word covenant again by sacrifice in other words those whose names that were written in the land's Book of Life Is Coming only for those whose names that were written both Jew and Gentile if your name is the last book of life you're going to see the light of your hour but he was not there the Bible says in Revelation and the Beast that's to come on the earth will deceive all those whose names that were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life see so he speaks here about the Covenant and here comes as a covenant angel with me by sacrifice and the heaven shall declare his righteousness for God is Judge himself so we find that through him we are Justified the prophet says you've never done it in the first place the only way God can see you is the way he saw you before the foundation of the world we never done it in the first place we are kept clean as we have an intercessor a priest amen who intercedes on our behalf that's why he was both man and he was God he got headaches he got let Downs he got disappointment the Bible said he was despised he was rejected of man a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we heed as it were our faces from him he was not we esteemed him not you know the man that made the the false arm how God says romantic he was esteem he's honored for making such a great thing but here the god of Heaven came in our midst and the Bible says we esteemed him not amen he's a priest who intercedes on our behalf the prophet says you're the first word in the Bible in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now before it could be the word it had to be a thought it's one thing about the message like even before the beginning amen takes you back into the mind of God even takes you back into the back parts of God's mind and he presented here for us to understand what Redemption is all about now before it could be a word it had to be a thought because the word is a thought expressed and when you see that the enemy of this world was going to do what he did God thought how he would send a great Plan of Redemption and when he thought it then he spoke it and it was as good as done right then and thousands of years later came the Lord Jesus Christ and died for the sins and rose again some 1900 years ago this morning for our justification sitting at his right hand now as a high priest making intercession Upon Our confession see he became the sacrifice he went to Calvary on our behalf we should have died we should have suffered but he took our place he became me that I might become him he's our intercessor the high priest he says in water from the rock oh beloved God we come to the most humbly father in the name of the Lord Jesus to ask first to forgive us of our sins and error that's our Prophet prayed hey he was never you know I don't sell in all those things he said I'm a man I make mistakes he says not everybody will be healed when I pray for them you know because everybody is not not in the position for healing they are not in the right condition so he says not everybody will be healed when I pray for them say he was an ordinary man but yet he was God's man it was God's man for the hour entrusted with such a great ministry and he says and we are so happy to know that we have a high priest sitting in glory who can be touched with a feeling of our infirmity believing this that he climbed the ramparts of Glory setting way exalted above every Angel Archangel Way Beyond the moon and stars and hears the prayers of everyone that will come humbly asking this great telephone connection we have as it were taking down the receiver calling Central Christ Jesus asking to be plugged into eternity and brother and sister there's only one class of people that can be plugged into eternity it's those who come from eternity after the order of Melchizedek and your brother Branham says in the message called who is this Melchizedek he says now we find him at the beginning his attributes and now you were with him then you shouldn't get we were there with him all the time then is when the Book of Life comes into view now we read over here in Revelation chapter 13 chapter the eighth verse that the Beast that comes upon the Earth in these days will deceive all those people on the Earth whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he says think of it before Jesus was ever born 4 000 years before he came to Earth and several thousand years before you come on Earth Jesus in God's mind died for the sins of the world and the Book of Life was made and your name was put on that book of life before the foundation of the world that's the Bible truth your name was ordained of God and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world that's how when you read the message you're absolutely discovering yourself so that's where that's that's where I come from and that's where I'm heading backwards so you can only have eternal life if you never had a beginning and you never had an ending you were there in his attributes you don't remember it no because you are a part of his life you're a part of God when you become a son and daughter of God just as you're a part of your Earthly father the male carries the hemoglobin the blood and when he's gone in the egg when you become a part of your father and your mother is a part of your father also you're all part of your father Glory that lets the denomination out all together God in all the only place amen he says notice now his attribute was first God the thought the atom itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondly he became the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Saint John the first chapter notice this is the beginning but before the Eternal notice in the beginning was the word when time began it was the word but before it was word it was an attribute then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word now we are getting to where Melchizedek is see that's the mysterious person in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and when the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us hold that there now the prophet says his first being was spirit God Supernatural the great Eternal second he began to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word body then when the state he was in when he met Abraham was called Melchizedek he was the form of theophany now we'll get to that and prove that in a few minutes so the reason why he came incarnate in human flesh was so that he could sanctify a church so that he could get into that church the main purpose of his coming so that he could come in in 12 people hallelujah what he says here he says God came down and become flesh and died to death in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for Fellowship God loves Fellowship that's what he made the man at the beginning for the first time for was Fellowship God dwells alone with cherubims so God desires your fellowship so we were ordained by God to have communion with him because communion is only for the household of God we can only take communion if we were baptized by the Holy Ghost into his body and then we become a part of him it's only those who were with him in eternity that can have eternal life that's why we find that in Redemption he had only one purpose in mind and that was for his kingdom subjects those who are in a covenant with him by sacrifice the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and you could accomplish Redemption because he was the priest of the most high God who became the Supreme sacrifice for all of his subjects amen so we find that after him becoming priests he made it possible to unfold a further part of his purpose to become the king of righteousness to become the king of this Kingdom of his righteous subjects see that's why we are not going to make it because of our righteousness it is because of his righteousness he's the king of righteousness that's why in the Old Testament they never examine examine the worshiper they examine the sacrifice if the sacrifice was perfect then the worshiper was declared perfect and we find Revelations 5 no man was worthy to take the book or to lose the seals thereof and John wept realizing that everything would be lost if no one come but then the Elder cried don't weep John for the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to take the book and to lose the seals thereof and when John turned he expecting to see a lion he saw a lamb a bleeding bloody lamb who was worthy to take the book and to loose the seals there are so it's the worthy one that made us worthy Hallelujah so by making his subject righteous he unfolds a further part of redemption he provided himself a Dwelling Place amen because he's also now king of Salem which was later called Jerusalem it's the only city on the Earth that God that they say is the city of God that God identifies himself with Jerusalem is the city of God and Jerusalem was first a gentile possession and the New Jerusalem from Heaven is as a bride a dawned for a husband she becomes the holy city she becomes the New Jerusalem he's Dwelling Place of which he is King see this whole Plan of Redemption just unfolding and unfolding and unfolding all the way from the book of Genesis and why can we speak this way it's because if God sent us a prophet he's opened the eyes of our understanding to realize who we really are amen we're not American we're not South African we are children of the kingdom of God hallelujah we're from Heaven amen in Revelations 21 verse 1 to 3 and 9 to 10 it says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no mercy and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men so the bride becomes the dwelling place of God you know brother Branham says that potentially it's already on the earth now in the heart of the Saints all the attributes Sons and Daughters of God amen they have the attributes of all those that will be in that City the New Jerusalem you are the dwelling place of God God's attribute is within your soul he lives within you amen so we knew come to service you'll bring God to service but the branches God loves to go to church and how can he go when you come amen hallelujah he says and I heard of words of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with him and they shall be his people remember the Covenant is made with Abram they shall be his people and God himself shall be with him and be their God exactly still the same words that he used in the Covenant that he made with Abraham see Revelations 21 verse 9. and they came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven lost plagues and talk with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great high mountain and showed me that great City the whole the holy Jerusalem descending out of from heaven Out of Heaven from God so in the Old Testament the holiest of holies was his Tabernacle when God came and spoke to the children of Israel it was only a shadow of the coming Tabernacle that God was going to indwell at the coming of Jesus he says this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell but after he had accomplished Redemption in Revelation the bride now becomes a tabernacle of his Dwelling Place let's read another song Psalm 46 he says to the chief musician for the sons of Korah a song of element God is our refuge and strength a very present help in times of trouble therefore will not be fear that the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea South almost like Los Angeles the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea see though the water thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof but there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God who is the city of God Jerusalem the holy place of the Tabernacles plural of the most high God is in the midst of her her is a church her is a woman she she shall not be moved God shall help her and that's right early the Heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge come Behold The Works of the Lord what desolations he had made the Earth he had maketh was to cease unto the end of the Earth he breakth the bow and cutth the spear in Sunder he burneth the shattered with fire be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen who are the Heathen the Gentiles I will be exalted in the Earth the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge he's our hiding place the name of the Lord is a might Strong Tower the righteous run in and they are safe in Revelation 21 3 it says and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with him and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with him and be their God according to the Covenant that he made with Father Abram so the New Jerusalem is his Dwelling Place and is occupied by his bride so the New Jerusalem is a gentile possession he takes a bride from the Gentiles for his name who is a blood relation to him he's of the same family brother Branham says they come from the same source like Rebecca was amen she was a blood relation to Isaac the Bride is a blood relation to Christ she's born of his bone Spirit of his Spirit life of his life she is him same bloodline Hallelujah and his King of the New Jerusalem and he says I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also he desires our fellowship that puts another might use the word spin on the message that we follow it's not church but it's actually a life a daily walk with God a revelation of who you are your relationship with the one that you are serving you are a part of him you are in a covenant part of the Covenant that he made with Father Abram he hears your prayer he promised to be a God to you to Abram and his seed after him Hallelujah do you love him tonight in Revelation 19 16 he says he comes to the to the end time as king of kings brother Branham says it's a further revelation of redemption see he says notice his title king of king of righteousness king of righteousness king of Peace he still Kings now watch Hebrews 7 2 king of righteousness also the king of Peace he's two kings there now since he has come in flesh and received his body up in Revelations 21 6 is called the king of kings he's all three of them together see King God who's King God the great logos King theophany then he becomes king Jesus the word the logos in human flesh then he becomes king of kings amen that's when he takes on flesh so now after he Sanctified the church the logos now divide itself up into a many membered body as a did on the day of Pentecost brother Branham says God divided himself up and he came in that first church and after 2000 years returns back to Incarnate human bodies again the word made flesh again at the end time that's why the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different to what Pentecost believes it to be is not a sensation is not the evidence being speaking in tongues although it will cause you to that we haven't but it's basically the very person the person of Christ now indwelling the individual he's very person of his being your attribute Express of God Hallelujah some of those New Jerusalem the theophilicity of God takes on the form of his bride he's King theophany he's king of all the other king of kings potentially that city is on earth now in the heart of the Bride but Ibraham says we need to recognize this to be Eagle food we have heard from our theophany and here we finally meets Abram as Melchizedek a communion which is a type it was a prophecy of what he was going to do at the end time at the consummation amen those who partake of melchized their communion are the ones who are included in the Covenant they are of the household of God so correctly speaking it's only those of the household of God that can take communion everybody else can take it but we take it with revelation we are a part of his being amen we have the same Lifeline they are the hustle of God they are the order of Melchizedek so communion is a showdown and Judas exposed himself at the communion table amen it was there that he left the service amen because he was not part of the family Hallelujah says he gave Abram communion after he won the battle after he whooped the kings of Camara after Abram took up his position God gave him a part of himself and what did God do adopted him God blessed him Hallelujah it was 17. uh well Abraham says and the king of Solomon went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of cheryloma and the kings that were with him at the valley of shaver which is the King's Dale after the battle Abram took up his position as in the Kingsdale as a king a ruler an overcomer Hallelujah and melchized king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth see brother Brian says this is the order of adoption first to win the battle over sin secondly to take up your position as a son a ruler a king over sin sin does not rule you anymore you rule over sin and Abram was recognized amongst the Kings after his victory amen and his victory was also recognized by Melchizedek and what did God do after God victory he gave him a part of himself Abram was given communion and after he was given communion then adoption the blessing in his position as a son the prophet says it's a Compares with Ephesians 1. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ who by by the will of God to the Saints which are emphasis and the faithful in Christ Jesus how do you get into Christ by one spirit amen Christ be unto you and peace from our Lord from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places he says here as we come to a close notice those Melchizedek as soon as he met Abram coming from the slaughter of the Kings the mystery of God now being made known who was he they can't find any history of him because he didn't have any father he never had any mother he never at any time he began he never had any time he ever died so ever he was he's still alive he never did have a beginning so he couldn't have been nobody else but yeah Ella Elohim the self-existent one almighty God and Abraham took his position after the church takes its position we are called unto the adoption of sons by the Holy Spirit and when each man takes his position what God has called him to do and stand to the end of the road going after the loss so after you have overcome find your position as a son he gives you a part of himself then he adopts you amen you have now full Authority you can say storm go back to your places little fishy I'll give you back to your life so stay at the arise I give it to them in the name of the Lord Jesus what was it when God and you now has become one Hallelujah so we find brother and sister amen let me just finish up by saying this in Matthew 26 26-32 said Melchizedek in human flesh came to establish a New Covenant after his battle was over with those who were part of the household of God those who will be with him in the father's Kingdom he made a promise we'll eat no more of the fruit of the Vine till I eat it and knew with you in my father's Kingdom amen hallelujah I don't want to read those quotations it's going to take up time amen you know and brother and sister America goes with this one other branches May our hearts think of this over I'll drink it Anew with you in my father's Kingdom if he should come before another Easter comes if you should die before another Easter comes it will not prevent that great event for I say unto you by the word of the Lord that those which are to sleep in Christ shall come forth first and Weavers are alive and remain shall be caught up with them together in the air to meet the Lord and the great Melchizedek of Heaven the king of not of the natural Jerusalem but the king of the Heavenly Jerusalem the New Jerusalem will meet us and will be served again the wine and the bread so tonight while we take the symbols of this we ought to do it till we find him coming again may be found faithful as we bow our heads so brother and sister it's all those who are in a covenant with him we were a part of him before Genesis 1. and then the prophet came at the end time he revealed all the Mysteries he says before Genesis 1 you were in his mind and he came to show us when he revealed Lutheran was he also showed who the attribute Sons were they were all a part of him so we are all just one big family of God fellowshipping here upon the Earth amen attribute year and attribute day that's why we have this we can create that atmosphere because of his presence that's with us he doesn't stop inside here when we go home he goes with us if we're driving our vehicle he's there with us when you're at your desk at work he's there with you he says I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'll be with you even in you until the consummation amen is a permanent Union halleluia the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly Pride amen God did she bless you amen amen [Applause] let's sing a little song I love him I love him because he first loved me and he purchased my salvation on calvary's tree [Music] why do you love him because he first love me and word cheers [Music] if you love him raise your hands team tonight as we sing it together I love him [Music] because Keepers love me and pray purchase my Salvage [Music] amen you know there's so many things that were said that I really enjoyed I thought how he talked about Abraham that showed what Abraham was because he went after his Fallen brother amen and I and I I don't recall the quote just exactly how that a prophet of God said it he said but when that last one comes in amen we'll leave amen let's look for him you never know where he might be he might be in the place you're staying he might be in the place you're working he might be the person you meet somewhere you never know and then he made another statement that just really thrilled me I thought in my heart I want to preach on that someday he said they never examined the worshiper they only examined the sacrifice because if the sacrifice was right it was good enough to cover the worshiper and I thought you know that that that even applies when you look at somebody you know you don't examine them because I'll tell you if you would have seen me before my conversion you wouldn't have wasted your time but praise God he looked at the sacrifice and he knew the sacrifice was worthy and perfect enough to hide the multitude of sins and that's what we rest in don't ever look at the condition don't look at the symptoms don't look at anything in the Cardinal side look at the great sacrifice look what what how perfect that was and how it was so perfectly accepted it was the great father accepting the perfect sacrifice and believe me he'll do everything that you could ever hope or imagine it can do it can do exceedingly above whatever you could even ask or think that's how perfect that sacrifice us God bless you my brother and may you have a safe trip home and and send me an invitation I like South Africa that's for vacation I'm done going places to preach I go places to vacation now amen beautiful it's beautiful there and and it it's grateful I I again we just ask you to keep my good friend Ron Peterson's daughter in prayer he's got a great battle ahead of her but it's one the sacrifice can win do you believe that tonight let's pray again this evening as we are dismissed and you Heavenly Father we thank you for the encouraging words father a greater understanding of the fellowship that we're in as we've heard the how that Satan's kingdom is heading up tonight we heard father how your kingdom is heading up in an indwelling bride a people manifesting your attributes identified with you in communion with you in fellowship with you father that the love of God may be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit father we ask this we that we can introduce that Great Divine love to the world that we will come in contact
