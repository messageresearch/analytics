before communion um it might be a lot of scripture um just see how much we might be able to get through but um we're not gonna minister necessarily but we just wanted to maybe be able to place a communion in the bible and not not even lord for your grace and your mercy lord as we would just read in your scriptures tonight before communion or we pray it would be a blessing lord just that your word would become more real to us lord that we would come into a deeper communion a deeper revelation a deeper understanding of these things lord many times we take it for granted lord it becomes maybe more of a routine but lord we want it to be a personal relationship with you lord so we just ask that you would come father and just make this more personal to us we pray we love you we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen so just reading in john chapter 13 which is um we're all familiar which starts uh our reading that we would normally read for communion and foot washing so it says in verse one now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world and to the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end amen you may have your seats and so i just thought by the way it's good to be back with you amen god was gracious on the trip me and brother cosman had to romania to be with the young people there um i had some just powerful meetings of the holy ghost lives transformed and changed um there was one moment uh that was really moving to me as we we sat back in our chair after we had uh just been praying with the youth and and and calling out to god we just could see the the tears and and the wet spots along the altar from from where people had been giving their heart to god and that that's just an image that's ingrained in my mind now and so we couldn't have gone without you uh we are sent by the church and so we just we thank you brother gabriel brings greetings uh to to each of you and we're just thankful to be back here amen so here just in john chapter 13 it says uh we just read it now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put it into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him so notice here in john he's making the distinction he's saying now supper has ended so they've come to the upper room and now the supper is over and so now john's going to start to to show uh what takes place after the supper has ended and and and just to maybe if this is for a hell a help i i hope it's not too academic for you i'm not much of a of a teacher i would say but if if we can just read the bible and maybe have a better understanding of being able to place the scriptures i believe it'll be a blessing to us so if you just look into the scripture here and just uh as you do a little brief study and you look into the message uh the day that they are having communion who knows what day it is what day of the week are they in the upper room it's thursday so they're in the upper room and the day is thursday because tomorrow is going to be friday which is the day our lord is going to be crucified and so as you just start to place this in scripture you can even start to uh follow the dates and the times and and if you you do a little study on it it's more than likely the dates april 6 80 30. here it's thursday during the week and uh palm sunday has just happened which um it was april 2nd 80 30 and if if if you want to be skeptical uh about the dates brother branham says in the 70th week of daniel now jesus the messiah rode into the city of jerusalem triumph on the back of white mule on palm sunday april 2nd 80 30. i'll take it i did an extensive study and many theologians have a lot of different dates and as i had some fellowship with some brothers i said i'll go with the vindicated prophet and and sure brother branham was a student of the word he he very well would have been a student and got the date maybe read something else of a historian and and gave the date and and i just thought if i was the historian i would be fascinated that a vindicated prophet vindicated my estimation of the date you know some some people get so bent out of shape that that that brother branham used dates and and used other studies from other men and they try to use that to to disqualify brother brenham's efforts but to me that was the greatest vindication that those theologians could have ever had is for a vindicated prophet to pick it up and say you know what that looks right i'll use that and to have the liberty to take that because you know it was the age of man if you look into the age of man under that man anointing um god did mighty things in the church and and and so many things were translated and and into so many languages and and while we have even the word and that we have today in the written bible is under that age of man of everything being uh transcribed and and just so just kind of trying to set a just a little uh uh just to give you the visual of what's taking place here because um john's account starts when supper has ended and but you realize when you read this you start into john it says and supper being ended well but there was a lot that actually happened during the supper and if you don't comb through the scriptures and you don't go back and really and then we we just read we we read john 13 as a congregation every month that we do communion and supper being ended and if we're not careful we really lose the gravity and how monumentous this actually is that now jesus has come to this place uh to to do uh to to have the last supper and to wash the disciples feet we we really if we're not careful we just allow it to become a ritual we allow it to become education and it really loses its value and its meaning and it's just oh it's just it's just communion it's just john 13. but there's such a richness and a depth to the word of god that i believe if we can be students of the word and we can and we can pour ourselves into it that we can really uh uh uh get a whole lot more out of it i hope maybe i'm the one that's lagging behind we all pray for me i i i enjoy getting in the word of god and studying the word of god and being a a workman that needeth not be to be a ashamed you know it doesn't say to study to show yourself a workman that you're you're not ashamed right that means you can be ashamed i've been ashamed many times now we we we we should fall in love with this message really fall in love with the bible uh let it be a new book to you but i just want to maybe uh jump into some of the other gospels and and also use john and i try not to be lengthy um that was the idea in reading a few scriptures before communion but as you start to comb through it and you go through it all saying like well my you can hardly get through this much and that much and then you realize you you bit off more than you can chew but i would think that if we could just read our bibles tonight before communion i believe we'll be blessed amen so just to set the stage we mentioned palm sunday so if you can even in your minds just start to understand where we're at in jesus ministry he's coming now to where he's having the last supper and it's on thursday and and after this last supper he's going to be betrayed in the garden and he's going to be crucified just hours later and so when you look into the scripture though if you jump back into john chapter 12 you just find that he came riding into jerusalem which was palm sunday fulfilling prophecy of zachariah behold he cometh meek and lowly riding upon an ass and here they're all saying hosanna hosanna hosanna and so palm sun that's on so it's called palm sunday because that happened on sunday and what we're talking about in scripture about the upper room having communion and foot washing is the thursday following palm sunday okay so if we if you can kind of just get that in your mind and so if you look into the scripture here in john chapter 12 and i just grab your bibles we'll try to get it up on the screens like i said we just do a bunch of reading if if that's okay i hope it's not too awkward for you uh but i think it would be a blessing but if you look into your bibles um in in john chapter 12 uh it says in verse one it says in jesus six days before the passover came to bethany where lazarus which had been raised from the dead and he whom he had raised from the dead there they made a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him then mary then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odors of with the odor's appointment now you might uh uh the reason why we're backing up a little bit because john here in verse two he's making a very uh profound statement because he's saying and supper being ended the devil now having put it in the heart of judas iscarion and so you back up into the scriptures about about a a week before um here's mary coming in must must be led by the holy ghost must something moving upon our heart that she would take this ointment and want to break it and start to to to anoint jesus feet and here in verse 4 you find that one of the disciples judas iscariot simon's son which should betray him says why was not this ointment sold for 300 pence and given to the poor he's looking at now mary coming and and offering a praise and a worship and and doing something that was needful doing something she was predestinated to do this this was something that i believe mary was ordained to do that god moved upon her heart i believe there was something in her maybe she even she even looked at it was like oh but but this was so costly maybe i i you know they say the value of that would took several days in one place they'll say it took 300 days to make to make that kind of money i pence a day's wage but but whatever the value was very costly and something moved upon her heart in such a way where she couldn't take it anymore and she just moved in there and she broke that alabaster but she started anoint jesus feet and and wipe wipe his feet with her hair and here's one of the disciples that is questioning her offering questioning why she is doing this questioning the value of why would you do this this could have been sold and notice what jesus would say uh he would say this he said and notice john points out here he says in verse six he says uh he says this he said not because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put there in and then jesus said let her alone against the day of my barian hath she kept this so so notice that mary had a purpose in what she was doing but judas was so blinded by greed judas was so blinded that and so void of understanding he couldn't even accept the rebuke that jesus was given to him because jesus was correcting him but but if you jump into matthew i believe this is just like i said we're just going to walk through the scripture so we'll keep walking matthew chapter 26 verse 12. we're going to grab out of matthew how matthew's going to to make a statement about this story so now we're in matthew chapter 26 he's given a same account he says for in this she has poured this ointment out of my body she did it for my burial verily i say unto you whosoever this wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her oh i just wonder how that just judas just couldn't take it because here he was you know he was the i'm in charge of the money here and she was just very wasteful and then jesus goes on to say leave her alone she's done this for my burial and even more so that this is going to be preached wherever the gospel is preached i i just i just feel like judas couldn't take it he just couldn't stand it because you notice the next account that matthew would give it shows that right after jesus says this it says then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the chief priest and said to them what will you give me and i will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for 30 pieces of silver and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him so you see how just coming down in the last week of jesus earthly ministry here how how he's his feet are being anointed it's about to be palm sunday he's he's moving towards the upper room and foot washing and now it's been put in the heart of judas iscariot to betray him you could just imagine that the gravity of this moment and the atmosphere and how thick and how everything's coming down and how jesus knows that he's living out his last hours before the crucifixion and just to think here this is prophecy being fulfilled because if you look into psalms 41 9 david would prophesy and say yay my own familiar friend and whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me and even earlier as jesus would there in john chapter six you know as many would start to to leave he would say look i've chosen you twelve but even one of you is a devil and so judas wasn't fooling nobody i j jesus chose him knowing he was a devil but it was that the scripture might be fulfilled and so you could just see the the gravity of everything uh just moving up to this moment and i i i put this into the study here in second thessalonians uh chapter 2 verse 3. i just think this is um just to cast a little light on here he's saying let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition and i just want to show that make a note here of how that jesus is now coming to communion with his disciples he's coming there in the evening time and he's about to break bread and he's about to have communion and do foot washing with them and it's in this hour think of this son of man ministry it's in this moment of communion that the son of perdition is revealed and it just reminds me how as we we have received the son of man in our day a son of man revealing the son of man it's in the evening time that that the son of man is revealed but also what else is revealed in the evening time the son of perdition is also revealed and so as we just keep moving on in our study i want to jump into the book of mark mark does a a good job of of just laying the foundation to bring us into the upper room if you turn to mark chapter 14. maybe i don't know if you're able to make notes if this if we're moving quite quickly but we'll uh just continue reading mark chapter 14 verse 12. so once again we're just we're just setting the stage for the last week of of jesus earthly ministry there from palm sunday now we've we've come down and he's he's gone to the you know on monday he went to the temple and he he cleansed the temple and then it was probably around tuesday if you follow the scripture that he cursed the fig tree he's going to go into the temple and teach and and give parables and talk about the widow who gave of mites and just many things uh oh my so much transpires uh it's actu actually uh as i started to jump in and study it with some of the brothers and and just look at these things it's to find out how much actually transpired in the last week of jesus earthly ministry is overwhelming of what the disciples heard uh they they they sat there on the mount of olives and heard them preach the seals and they they were in the temple and and all of these things were being said and so much happened to the last week it just makes me you think about the disciples in that last week and then you think about all them saints sitting there and that that week there in jeffersonville in march in 1963 and them seals breaking you know that's when you say praise god for a tape recorder i mean i i believe it well what did he say he said it you can imagine it yeah you so you think of these disciples and and and how much was being said to them and and jesus said tell him look what i'm doing you can't bear it right now you can't bear it right now you get kept letting know but these things had to fulfill because he was he was fulfilling prophecy he was fulfilling scripture but there was coming a day that he'd send the comforter and he'd remind him of all those things and praise god we have that same same promise that we don't have to try to digest the whole i mean that's i think in our in our in our youth in our zeal we make the big mistake of thinking we're going to sit down and digest spoken word as the original seed and just i'm going to come out and do a book report on it it doesn't work like that it's spiritual food and due season it speaks to you when you need it you can never exhaust the word of god you i don't care what it is 47 through 65 it's spiritual food and due season study it out show yourself approved come back to it and let god speak to you again it'll speak to you in a whole new light a whole new meaning a whole different way because it's god's speaking it's it's spiritual food and due season and thank god he gives you the holy ghost that can take that word and feed your soul he'll bring into remembrance those things because if it was left up to this old noodle here we wouldn't have a chance you know just look at those disciples you know could you imagine them trying to run around with a steno pad wait you said what what's the times at the end and you you said wait did you say wait you're going and i can't follow you but you're gonna go away so you can come i'm confused you see everything was happening so mark here just does a beautiful job of leading us up to the upper room it says in the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples said and where wilt thou th that we go and prepare that thou managed to eat the passover and he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him and wheresoever he shall go in say ye to the good man of the house the master saith where is the guest chamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples and he shall show you a large upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us note that it mark makes that distinguished uh distinction that it's a large upper room and they made ready the passover and the evening notice this verse 70 and in the evening he cometh with the twelve and the prophet of god would say this in fellowship he'd say and we notice eating is implied in fellowship you want to know why we eat so much there you go eating is implied in fellowship what do we have a breakfast why don't we just meet and talk but there's something about eating that brings a fellowship and now did you notice jesus the closing of his life's journey he wanted a little time of fellowship with the disciples so he called them apart set a table and broke bread blessed it and had eating and the last supper was a fellowship with his disciples just before he crossed over into the other land to be our high priest what wonderful words the prophet is is is is showing us what this last supper with the disciples was and so just continuing on in mark verse 18 now chapter 14 verse 18 it says and as they sat and did eat jesus said verily i say unto you one of you which eateth with me shall betray me well this this dinner just got awkward i mean yeah i thought i thought we were gonna have a good time i thought we were all just gonna muck it up and just you know talk about all the miracles and you can imagine the atmosphere and imagine the feelings but but i i hope if i can say this right now as we move towards the communion table as we move towards foot washing that maybe by god's grace there can be a sobriety and a sincerity in our hearts of what we're really approaching because here jesus there they're coming to the communion table and he's sitting down he said one of you that eateth with me shall betray me and they begin to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one is it i and another said is an eye what are they doing they're searching they're they're they're asking is it i and you would think that you would think they're asking that if he would at least reveal to him what's in their heart then they could make it right is it i and he answered and said to them it is the it is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed good were for that man to have never been born and as they did eat jesus took bread and blessed it and break it and gave to them and said take eat this is my body now remember we've jumped into the gospels to catch what what john comes in at the end of this and saying when supper was ended so all of these things are being are taking place before we get to that portion in john so he says and he took the cup and when he gave thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of it and he said unto them just some of some of it does overlap john does mention that later some of it's overlapping but just moving he says and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many verily i say to you i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that i drink it anew in the kingdom of god i mean what a mouthful these disciples are getting one of you are going to betray me but i'm not going to drink no more fruit of the vine until the day i come in the kingdom you know you can imagine that the atmosphere and and they're looking around at their brothers and saying who who in the world would betray the lord what is what is happening here that you no doubt you could feel the atmosphere in the room and and and i just want to um just to make this statement here that if you were to go into the book of matthew you you would find matthew will give this it's it's almost verbatim in matthew chapter 26 verse 20 through 29 it's identical to mark 14 with where we're reading but but matthew makes one distinction that you don't find in the other gospels where in matthew 26 25 when they're all asking is that i is it i actually matthew makes note of this in matthew 26 verse 25 says then judas which betrayed him so think of this judas is already you know he had enough of about a week ago when when mary you know mary had had uh um you know wasted 300 pence he he about had it so what did he do he went he betrayed the lord he had set it all up to betray him so he's already done it he has already conceived this wickedness in his heart to betray the lord and you wonder now is is he is it is he this is he that ignorant or is he is he asking to know if he's caught i'm you almost like is he asking did he find me out it's really quite profound to think but i tell you what when a strong delusion comes upon you you can live and stay in a condition if you just don't flat out call out to god say oh god i want to be right with you lord if i've done something wrong if i've done something to betray you lord if you're asking is it i don't don't do it in a way like you know i am i caught have i been found out because how many times have you been caught for something and you are not sorry you did it you're sorry you got caught unfortunately that's most of the time especially when you're dealing with your kids they ain't sorry they did it they're sorry they got caught or they wouldn't have done it they don't tell on themselves very often but every once in a while as they grow and and god deals with their heart they'll come and make stuff right say you know what i did this and i shouldn't have done it you're like man praise god for that and they don't have to be sorry when they get caught they're sorry they did it because god convicted their heart so he says he says in this uh verse 25 then judas which betrayed him answer said master is it i and he said unto him thou has said i i want to maybe pick that up here a little later but just think of that thou hast said now we're we're in the book of mark and we were talking about how it parallels uh with with matthew um i think verse 25 and 29 say the same thing about eating the fruit of the vine and so i'm i'm letting you know that because i'm about to read a quote where brother branham is referring to matthew 26 29 um which is also mark 14 25 i believe but brother branham says this in adoption uh number four he says but but listen to the 29th verse i say i will not drink henceforth of the fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it anew with you and my father's kingdom what the same thing melchizedek did after abraham had got his position set his men in order and won the battle and had come home and melchizedek come out with bread and wine after the battle's over then we'll eat the wedding supper with the lord jesus in the new world so now we're seeing a prophet take that scripture and he's telling us what the meaning of it is i wouldn't have figured that out but he's he's telling him right now that that's what mark 14 25 that's what matthew 26 uh uh 29 is he's speaking of we'll eat the wedding supper with the lord jesus in the new world and i just want to keep uh just reading scripture here as we continue to move and jump into the book of uh luke now if you'll turn with me to chapter 22. so once again we we've come now to the upper room and this is luke's account in luke 22 verse 14 and he says and when the hour was come luke chapter 22 verse 14 and 15 he sat down and the 12 apostles with him and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer you think of these words how that would i i would feel that if i was the one in that room and here my lord is looking at me and and no doubt you could you could feel the you could just feel it from his eyes and him looking at at them and maybe the atmosphere in the room and and how everything that's transpired over the last week and everything that's being said and and knowing that they're they're seeking to kill him and to take his life and here he comes to this upper room and he's telling them all with desire i have desire to eat this passover with you before i suffer and i just want to pull these scriptures up and link them together because in revelations 3 20 he says behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will suck with him and he with me i have desire to have fellowship with you i have desire to have communion oh i've looked forward to this moment i look forward to this time i i've been i've just everything that's within me i've been wanting to come to this moment and with desire i have desired to eat and commune with you and the prophet of god would say this in the message to the lady is he in church in 1958 he would say now sup here means to commune or fellowship jesus wants fellowship that's what god's heart longs for tonight fellowship if anything this last supper this communion this this fellowship here that he's having with his disciples he knows this is the last time that he's going to eat with them and that corporal body like that until he comes again into the new kingdom is that not what the prophet said is that not we've read so just think about uh th this is this is the last meal this is the last supper and and and he's he's he's cherishing this moment of fellowship with his disciples to be able to to break bread and to be able to eat it now we know many more things happen uh after his resurrection but but yet just think of how it's said in that form and that corporal body and the way that he was there he's saying look i'm not going to be able to i'm not going to eat of the fruit of the vine until i come again in my kingdom and that's um just there's so much studies on everything we're moving through quickly but just continuing on in the book of luke in verse 19 he says then he took bread and gave thanks and break it and gave it unto them saying this is my body which is given for you do this in remembrance of me likewise also the cop after supper saying this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you now we know paul said you know follow me as i follow christ and i just want to throw this in there because paul picks this up in first corinthians chapter 11 verse 18 and and i'm certainly in uh just wanting to just give you scripture so you can read it pour over it study it yourselves not trying to say anything more than what the scripture is saying so notice he just said in in in verse 20 there likewise also the cup after supper saying this is the cup in the new testament of my blood which is shed for you and paul now he's going to pick this up and and i won't expound um on it but just read what paul says because many times when we get to verse 23 it seems like he's just saying this out of nowhere um but paul is going to say now i think we're speaking about communion about coming together having communion with the lord and paul's going to pick this up and say for first of all when you come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you when you come together there into one place this is not to eat the lord's supper for an eating everyone taketh before another his own supper and one is hungry and the other is drunken what have ye not houses to eat and drink in or despise you the church of god and shame them that have not what shall i say to you shall i praise you in this i praise you not for i have received of the lord that which i have delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread now this all sudden should should really catch your attention that paul is now showing that even even the same night that the communion was taken jesus was also betrayed that same night and now just jumping back into luke chapter 22 verse 21 notice he continues to say but behold so what did paul just said he said the same night the lord took communion the same night he did as he was betrayed and now we're we're right back at the table with the lord in verse 21 of luke chapter 22 verse 27 he says but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed and they began to inquire among themselves which of them was that should do this thing and remember we read matthew 26 25 where where where judah said master is it i and he said thou sayest and you know what strikes my heart is is that was an opportunity for him to repent am i the one that did this thing thou sayest oh if there would have been if that would have been me oh i i would have i would have cried ass oh god please don't let it be forgive me o god if i've done anything to transgress your word if if i've done something lord that i would be the one to betray you or please forgive me oh god what can i do to make it right see that was his opportunity that's just how it spoke to me once it was exposed hey you know he had conceived it in his heart and he's asking him is it i and he's like look thou says thou know you know what you did and many of us we know what we did we know how we're living and we're coming to the communion table you know your condition you know the way that you're living you know the sin that you're committing is it eye master thou sayest thou know but we're going to move on and what paul says i mean what yeah what paul says that many are sick among us because we're not discerning the lord's body thou sayest see he knew what he had done and i feel many times i say oh god what was our pastor talking about about conviction if you've done wrong it's the grace of god to have conviction because it just seems that judas was void of it he's like yeah did i get caught am i the one that did it thou says yep you know he didn't have that ability but god being a just god i i know he gave him a space to repent he gave cain a space to repent but it wasn't in them to repent i say oh god if you ever give me a space to repent let me be quick to repent oh god so just continuing on now first corinthians chapter 11 verse 27 now he says wherefore so we're just jumping back into paul's account now he says wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world my approaching the communion table should be sobering we should stand before that year in thumb and just like these disciples were is it i lord am i though am i the one that did it and here paul when he jumps into chapter 13 and he starts to talk about communion says hey when we all come together there's dispens we're disputing and we're fighting and some are living this way and some are living that way it shouldn't be that way and then you look at these disciples and they're they're doing the same thing because you could jump back into the luke and and and right after right after the lord says one of you are going to betray me and they're all asking is it i is that i you you jump into luke chapter 22 verse 24 and all of a sudden there's strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest i mean these guys are carnal man yes am i the worst sinner in here am i the one that betrayed you and all of a sudden i mean weren't they getting some fight now well he wouldn't know you wouldn't do that like well then if we can't figure out who's the worst of us all who's the best of us i mean how did that happen how did they go from wondering am i going to win all said well if i ain't the worst of them maybe i'm at least the best of us what's wrong with us ain't no big eyes or little users our pastor says the human factor and imagine the gravity of this moment of approaching the communion table and we're thinking about all this nonsense and so we could spend some time there in luke and and how um my they're just carnal well then who's the greatest of us and then and then the lord would would all of a sudden speak to simon and say satan's desire to sift you as wheat and boy and it seems like satan's i would like you know peter's being called out now maybe they're like is he is he the one and he's going to go on and and and and there there's much more that could be said about that because he's about to tell peter look you're going to betray me and now they're thinking he's the guy oh i'm telling you these these disciples were a mess i don't know about you but i actually kind of makes me feel okay because i've been a mess so many times i've been an absolute mess but i can at least say like the disciples you know they might have been a mess but you know what they kept doing they kept following the lord they didn't know what else to do and i tell you it's the same thing with the message of the hour i i i don't i don't i can i can get in all of a mess and think i got this figured out and that figured out and this person over here says that and then you think you got you know you you got this figured out and all of a sudden it runs back together and it you know one quote pulls your whole foundation out from underneath you on this thought and you realize do i even know what i'm talking about but then there's something in there that no matter what you know that you will say just like peter lord thou hast the words of eternal life where in the world am i going to go from here because it's not something that you've done it's something that god's done it's something that god put in you because them disciples would have been gone a long time ago and the the fact the grace of god they make it to the upper room it was something that was keeping them so just to move towards a close here so we can get to communion but now we're back here at the very beginning just in john chapter 13. supper being ended the devil now put it in the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him at verse 4 in john 13 says he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girdeth himself and after that he poureth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherein he was girden now we got the scene here of of now foot washing imagine everything that's been going on everything that's going to be being said and who's the greatest who's the least who's going to trace peter you're satan desire to sift you as we you know uh uh one of you here's uh you can imagine uh the gravity of this moment just think of now even over the last week everything that's transpiring and the atmosphere in the room and how they're all feeling and knowing they feel unworthy and fellow who's going to betray what's going to go on what's going to happen and all of a sudden jesus rises from supper and he girds himself and now he's going to start washing their feet you could just imagine how surreal this this this feeling of these disciples would be just like what it what is going on here and remember they're in a large upper room it's a special prepared place that has been furnished it's in the evening time that he's come with the twelve and he's doing football he's doing he's had communion and now he starts to wash their feet and the prophet of god would say in the unwelcome christ and hear the greatest of men the greatest of all men god manifested in the flesh become a foot wash flunky with humility the king of all eternity all glory the creator of heavens and earth washed the dung off of men's feet then we think were something we got on a fifty dollar suit and oh god have mercy on us i wish we could feel the sincerity of that quote that here god manifested in the flesh washed the dumb off of the disciples feet but we get a we get a little piece of garment or nice clothes and we think we're somebody we get a nice job or we get something we think we've done something well the scripture would say in proverbs 15 33 that the fear of the lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor is humility proverbs 22 4 by humility and fear of the lord are riches and honor and life you find in the old testament humility also means meekness where psalms 37 11 will say but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in abundance of peace and and this is the scripture that you see just even the more fulfillment of it as he just come in on palm sunday zachariah 99 says rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a cult the full of an ass lowly poor afflicted humble to so much where he even humbled himself to a foot wash flunky are you willing to humble yourself to a foot wash flunky where you you don't think yourself above anybody jesus said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest upon your souls foot washing communion you think of the the atmosphere in that room the things that have been being talked about how they've really been challenged to search their heart and their motives and their objectives and him saying look who eateth and drinketh of this drink damnation unto themselves testimony upon the sea in 62 you know when you go into their homes there the first thing they do they take a foot wash flunky now that's the lowest paid man of the bunch is a foot wash flunky he goes out there and when a guest comes in he sets up his feet and he takes his sandals off and washed his feet because they walked on the road and the animals walked on the road you understand where the animals and had got the dust and when they walked they had a robe on and it picked up the dust and it settled on their limbs and things and oh the stink from the animals it wasn't nice to go into a home so they had a foot wash flunky he was the lowest paid man of the bunch and he got he'd get out there and wash their feet and then then make them welcome you see put them on a clean pair of sandals and jesus became a foot wash flunky the lowest job in the earth and somebody failed to wash his feet referring to jesus sitting there with dirty feet i say oh god may i never be guilty may i be quick lord to wash your feet with my tears and with honor in humility bow before the lord and reverence and worship jesus would say in matthew 23 but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted i just want to end right along these lines just to think of peter here watching all of this unfold think of how astonished peter would have been just all the events leading up to this you know here they're thinking of you know restoring the kingdom you know here christ is coming to restore the kingdom and we're going to kick out all the all the romans and we're going to be a victorious people and and we're going to get the kingdom back in power and he chose us i mean we're like the first ones man we're the first 12 we're going to be right there riding in victory and our king that cometh in all glories he's washing dung off of our feet and it it's it's not registering they don't understand what's going on think of peter looking at this and that's why verse 6 john uh verse six john 13 verse six p peter simon peter peter saith in the lord just thou wash my feet lord you're not a foot wash flunky what are you doing lord this isn't a job that you should be doing this is below this is below me this is below you what are you doing the prophet said look my text tonight speaking of images of christ he says just for a short time the subject of images of christ and i want for a subject what what would this be what does it take to make a christian that just left an effect on me because what has jesus done he's put an image now that these disciples will never forget peter says answer to what jesus answered him said look jesus answered said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter that should have been enough but it just couldn't match up to peter's the image in his head of what the lord should have been doing but i'm thankful he said look what i'm doing right now you don't understand but you'll know hereafter and that's why i believe we should pray for revelation as we come to the close here john 13 8 says peter sayeth in him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answer said if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me simon peter said it unto the lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head peter look you don't know what i'm doing right now but you'll know here later and i just want to say this that from that time i believe that those disciples never looked at a foot wash flunky the same ever again i i i believe it changed them forever no matter what house what restaurant wherever they went whenever they went into a building and all of a sudden that one came and started to wash their feet they could they could almost see his face and something in their heart would start to well up oh what a savior he humbled himself to the lowest job to even wash our feet what a savior he humbled himself even unto death philippians 2 3 8 would say let nothing be done through strive for vainglory but in lowliness of mind let us esteem each other better than our themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robber to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant it was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion of many man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even to the death of the cross peter he that washeth needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every and ye are clean but all nah but not all not all because judas was there but he said ye are clean oh he was speaking of another cleansing that was coming peter i'm i'm to go lay my life down at the cross and shed my blood because i'm that true sacrificial lamb and when you're washed oh and you're washed in the water of the word when you're washed into the blood of jesus christ there's coming and washing peter what i'm doing right now you don't know but hereafter you'll know so much more we could we could continue on in that but just that's just a portion as we just need to cut it so we can get into communion so god bless you [Applause] amen didn't you enjoy that you know you could just see all those different emotions going different things and i like what that verse um um he's closed with in he says in matthew in luke the 26th verse of that chapter of 22 he said but you shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that death serve for whether wither is greater he that sitteth that meat or he that serveth is not he that sitteth that meat but i am among you he that serveth amen i think that but it puts a lot of things into communion really what we should be coming to communion for and what it is that we should be communing with we should be communing with that spirit that makes us serve and love and look everybody upon everybody as greater than ourselves if the brothers would go bring the communion together we'll just stand for a moment and let's just read those same scriptures right there in the 22nd chapter of luke and he says and he took bread and gave thanks and break it and he gave it unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me and likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you amen and then we know the rest of these scriptures so let us keep it on our heart as the brothers bring and we pray for our bread and for our wine and that's the blessings on it you enter into that fellowship this evening with the lord let us pray our gracious heavenly father as we are brought into remembrance this evening of the many scriptures that transpired that evening as you are preparing to go pay the purchase for your elected that you were preparing to take the stripes that would purchase our healing to pay the price of the our chastisement lord you are giving preview to all that you are fixing to perform on our behalf lord and now we take this bread as a remembrance of the suffering for us the purchase price to hold you in reverence and honor and respect and with thanksgiving father we come taking this bread bring us into remembrance of the fellowship that we have with you and the communion we have with you and the many benefits we have by the fact that you called us and redeem us father may we respect and honor those benefits with all our heart and all our love and all of our respect father in this wine that
