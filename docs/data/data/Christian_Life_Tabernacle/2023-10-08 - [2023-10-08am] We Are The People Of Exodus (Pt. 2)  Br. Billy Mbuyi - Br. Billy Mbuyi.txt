[Music] h [Music] h now we just want to welcome you to the house of the Lord let's just stand we'll ask brother Mike to come and open our service in prayer and have our Psalm reading amen have you come with expectations this morning of God to move to do something well if you haven't if you've been so busy trying to get here now you can start to form in your heart and say hey I did actually come here to Worship the Lord and I did come come here to receive something from them so let's just be an expectation for what God is going to do amen God bless you let just go ahead and bow our heads this morning Father we just once again want to thank you for your goodness and bringing us to this place Lord Lord in all that we have before us every week and the things that Lord come against us and all the influences of the world and all the voices that surround us Lord the fact that we find ourselves back here in this place is evident of your hand Upon Our Lives Lord for no natural inclination of man would cause them to set aside time out of their busy schedule to come and Lord to lift up your name and to hear from you but something within us Lord that you placed there has brought us here that you might speak once again to us Lord and we believe that Lord as you promised in your word as we gather together in your name that you will be here Lord that every need that's been brought into this building Lord will have an answer answer we'll find an answer here in this word and in your presence today Lord we commit the service to you Lord every need that's coming the door Lord that you would have your way Lord that you would speak to each one and Lord that your word would have preeminence and that your name would be lifted up and we praise pray this in Jesus name amen amen well just to emphasize the need to be instant in season and out of season we uh we just flew in last night late last night yeah go ahead and be seated I'm sorry so uh we're going to read Psalm 68 this morning at least the first 18 verses it's a lengthy chapter so we're just going to read the first few verses there but you know as I was reading that this morning a verse out of that stuck out to me that you know I just share with you and um you know hopefully it you know means the same to you as it does to me it says in verse 11 the lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it and that caught my attention you know it's one thing to hear the word of the Lord but it's something else to have there be someone that publishes it you know as I was reading that the scripture in Isaiah 52 that we all know well came to mind it's Isaiah 526 it says therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak behold it is I how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisheth salvation he that saith unto Zion thy God reth thy Watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion you know the scripture speaks of the Lord speaking in his word but the thought that struck me was is there's an expectation that there be a publication a publishing of that word you know that word publish shows up in the scripture 29 times in different forms and it means this it says to make generally known to disseminate to the public to release for distribution the Hebrew word there means to show forth Paul was speaking in acts 13 He said for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light to the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region you know just a quick thought you know as I was reading that it's wonderful to hear the word of the lord we come into the service with expectation that we'll hear his word hopefully this isn't the only place where we hear the word of the Lord but that each and every one of us hear from him each day that's wonderful but where is the company that great company that will publish it that's the question it's one thing to hear the word the question is are we publishing it you know and this isn't just in books and tapes this is in flesh this is with words this is with actions as it says in 2 Corinthians 4 for we preach publish not ourselves not our brand not our identity not our social presence but we publish G Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels flesh that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we go ahead and stand this morning but as I was reading that scripture there in Psalm 68 it struck me am I a publisher of his word not just God sent a prophet but the word that I have heard when I have heard the word of God am I a publisher of that word how great are the company of them that publish it let's read those first 18 verses together let God arise let his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flee before him as smoke is driven away so drive them away as wax melteth before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of God but let the righteous be glad let them Rejoice before God yay let them exceedingly Rejoice sing unto God sing praises to his name extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name job and rejoice before him a father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows is God in his holy habitation God set at the solitarian families he bringeth out those which are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in a dry land oh God when thou Wiest forth before thy people when thou did March through the Wilderness CA the Earth shook the also dropped at the presence of God even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God the god of Israel thou oh God did send a plentiful reain whereby thou did confirm thine inheritance when it was weary thy congregation hath dwelt therein thou oh God has prepared of thy goodness for the poor the lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it Kings of armies did flee a pace and she she that carried it home divided the spoil though ye have lean among the pots yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow gold when the almighty scattered Kings in it it was white as snow and salmon the height of God is as the hill of Bashan and high hill as the hill of Bashan why leap Ye Ye high hills this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in yay the Lord will dwell in it forever the Chariots of God are 20,000 even thousands of Angels the Lord is among them as in si in the Holy Place thou has ascended on high thou Hast LED captivity captive thou has received gifts for men yay for the rebellious also that the Lord God might dwell among them amen amen praise the Lord you may have your seats I enjoyed that let's sing that song are you washed in the blood of the Lamb I tell you if you've ever come in contact

tithes and offerings and also um Matthew asked for prayer for healing of his ankle you know there's there's nothing too big too small for our God we were out ministering and a a young sister came up

but for the little things and so we we have a high priest that's touched by the feeling of our infirmity so if you have a need and maybe an unspoken request you just want to lift up your hand and just

can change us your Prophet will tell us that that the robe was made so we can fit in the robe and it's not us cutting it so it will fit us and Lord we hear that your word may take us and remove our

those that are standing to preach your gospel this morning father I pray that you help them oh God we love you we commit the service into your hands and we ask this things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen it's good to be in the house of God Amen I trust you're excited to be here amen um let's open our Bibles um man don't forget the announcements that we made about the youth Gathering and all of that and you know I I think we the desires is to do all that we can to to help to to to to create an environment where people can hear the word of God and be saved amen Exodus chapter 3 and verse 1 it says now Moses kept the flock of uh jro's father-in-law uh the priest of Midian and and and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the Bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses says Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight um why this bush is not burned and when the Lord saw that Moses turned aside to to see God called unto him called out of out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here I am let's also turn uh let's Skip and and read verse 8 it says I am I am come down to deliver them out of out of the hands of the Egyptian to bring them out to bring them up out to the land unto unto a good land and a large unto the the land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites the hites the amorites the parasites the uh heaves and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel has come unto me unto me and and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptian oppressed them come now therefore I will send thee uh unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring my people the children children of Israel out of Egypt let's just bow our heads father we ask that you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus Christ amen may have your seats this morning we want to continue just in the same line we were talking the people of Exodus we are the people of Exodus and I I want to say this this morning um it's very important we as individuals not just as a body or believer not even just as an age but it's important we realize that we are the people of an exodus we we have to look at ourselves and I can even say this morning we we we as Christians have to always have it on our mind that this world is not our home uh we we we don't want to make it too comfortable for us to stay here forever we we we want to know that we are on the journey and and we are here only a temp for a temporary time we are and we don't want to make make this a permanent place we don't want to be anchored here do all our business here and stay here forever we understand uh one way or the other in this lifetime that we are living in our life is only here for a moment the the and and I want to say this we also want to understand that we are on a journey somewhere whether we know what that is whether we understand or don't understand but we are being moved we are on an exodus some place to some destination that we are going and I believe the reason why we gather here this morning is because we want to be sure of where we are going and I want to say this because we we as as people as a human we know uh Brother David said this a while ago the question that man has always asked himself is where do I come from how did I get here and where am I going the the very uh uh uh understanding of the meaning what Gives Life Meaning is when a man is able to answer those three questions where is it that I'm coming from what am I doing here what's my purpose here on Earth and where is it that I'm going and so those things determine they on themselves they show you that you are on an exodus to some destination so whether we understand it or we don't understand it we are headed to a destination we are here to find out by the word of God where is it that we are going we are are here because we know there's a promise in the word of God for the time that we are living in there's a promise in the message of the hour about the people of this generation and we are here to find out what is my final destination going to be and I want to say this uh our choices is a very good indicator of where we're going to go because the person who's on the journey they make choices that shows where they're going the things that they engage in what they do all of that it will be a summary or a summation of what they thinking about what tomorrow is going to be if you don't think much of tomorrow you're going to do whatever you need to do but if you know tomorrow there won't be any food you'll go buy all the groceries that you can if you knew that tomorrow there won't be any water you're going to go get all the water that you can and you know so the the what what what we do today is deterministic of what we think tomorrow is going to be so therefore we we we as the Believers of this message we cannot get complacent we we cannot come to a place where we think well we've we've arrived and we understand it all no God is taking your life and the same way he took you out of sin and he washed you and he he brought you to the knowledge of this message he took you and he brought you here so you can hear the things that you are hearing he didn't bring you here so this could be your final destination no he's taking you on a journey somewhere where and so the same way he took you out is the same way he's leading you so this is not a a time where uh we we need to be halfhazard or or or give up or get complacent I I'll say even this morning I was as I was studying this and and it just came on my heart and and I was thinking about even what's happening in the world today we just learned that Saturday Israel got into a war a war that they didn't look for a war you as if there was not enough Wars already and and we we understand it was about 200 people killed and Hamas was successfully able to penetrate from different uh locations and they said it's never been to this scale never in the history so it it behoves us to know that we we're not going to remain here forever something is happening whether we are we want to be aware of it or not be aware of it it's moving and and and I'll say this the the the the thing about it is there's times where things seems like it's not moving it seems like things are just going as slow as it can and they slow and then there comes a time where there's a bunch of prophecies all coming at the same time and I want to say this it behooves us to always be ready at every moment this is not time to to be one foot in and one foot out and this is not time to get complacent this is the time of full commitment to what God has given us in order for us to see the results that we are looking for we need to be committed to the cause we need to know that we are in an exodus out of here God is trying to bring us out of here by all means possible amen amen and so we we and I want to say this we have a promise uh that that if the world will get in the condition that it's in today you know I it just you you sit you look at the world and you can't make any sense of what's happening out there you're like well you would think people want to live in peace no they don't want peace they want war and they want why because bam tells us that they are in the spirit of the last day but what I'm say that God is not going to destroy man man is going to destroy man by themselves and that's what's happening out there you you you you think you know in the history of United States a speaker get it rejected out of his postal Duty because they had some rules that didn't make any sense you're like how is that even happened I I tell you we we're not here to make sense of what's happening out there because it's going to be chaos upon chaos upon chaos we are here and we need to be sincere and be given over to know what is the promise of my time and am I walking according to when because he said when those things are happening out there you need to look within and say that what is the promise for the believer and am I in that promise walking in the promise of my time seeing the fruits of that promise come to pass in my life right the the prophet will say this this is not our home and things that are to be he says now we think of this now that God we should behave ourselves and act like Christians we should behave ourselves and act like Christians our cond should be like Christians because we are aliens here this is not our home no we are we are just put here temporarily we've got to go every one of us tonight and oh my I I and I think when you you engage the world and when you go to work and when you go do you ever come home and think oh I I'm here only temporary we we said last time here there's no continuous City we seek for one that is to come and whose Builder maker is God we need to be in the mindset that I'm here temporarily I'm here on an exodus to some destination I'm here that God will do what he needs to do with my life that he will clean me and wash me and get me ready for the new body that's awaiting me we we can't get complacent that's that has I was listening to our pastor when he preach on Friday I I follow a little bit of what he was saying I and I say this Rapture has to be on our mind every day I tell you this we need healing we'll get healing says it's the children's bread we need this and we need Deliverance God will give all of those things but with with all of that we cannot get sidetracked and start chasing things that God didn't that's not the promise of the age the promise of the age is Rapture so I want everything that I'm going to get to be leading me in that direction true that's right I want my focus everything I want everything that I do to to add up to the Rapture not take me away not Sidetrack me not lead me to another Direction but to lead me to that great Rapture that is to come am but when I'm say this and I know we know these things and he speaks about this I I just want you to follow through and I know you know this very well but I want you to see just the the how the F the prophet is unfolding this things and he speaks here he says and here some time ago now he's speaking about when he was with his wife and he saw this woman in the skirt he says and yes sometime ago uh he says the wife and I uh about two years ago brother merer and them uh we'll get a kick out of this and he says and to say we was over the shopping center uh uh and he says in our city here it's over Many religious people and soall but we seen a woman that had a hurt and it was strange it was a strange it was a strange thing and then he says because none of the rest of them seem to have had one and so we know that many of them that sing in the choir and everything now he he's giving you a characteristic somewhere is singing the choir and everything and so forth my wife said to me she says it says well it says well I said well you see uh they are not our they are not of our citizenship she said what I said no they are not of ours she said they are Americans ATI I said sure they are Americans that may be that may be true enough it says I find out in missions and in missionary and missionary and around the world I go to Germany there's a national Spirit called it a German Spirit it says and it's the spirit of the of the nation I go up in Switzerland and I find out just the brothers just brothers almost speaking the same language but there's another spirit it's a different spirit it's a it's a s it's a spirit of Switzerland and then I come to over to Finland I came I go I came over to fin Finland it said and allog together a different spirit and I come to America there's a there's a spirit of America that's right well I say we are it says we aren't we American citizen why is that why is why is it that our people are so and so and I said well you see honey see each Nation lives off on the spirit of that Nation that's the national Spirit she said then then wouldn't we be living in the American Spirit I said oh no listen to this oh no I said we are born again we live on the Heavenly spirit we Holiness and righteousness and let me say this this is very important because if we understand that we are on an exodus then we need to understand that we are no longer Americans we are no longer Africans or the whatever Nation we come from we are of an Heavenly spirit and we walk that's what qualifies us for Exodus without you being born of this spirit that he talking about without you having a Heavenly Spirit upon you of the holy spirit of God you do not qualify for an exodus The Exodus is God came and took you out of the national Spirit whatever Spirit you are born in whatever country you were coming from God came and he took you out of that Nation he brought you and you were born into another Nation you were born into another country you walk by the spirit of that country you act by the spirit of that country you think like the one of that country you talk like one from that country and that's why it's important that we have a full Exodus within our lives where we are not tied by the things of the world or by the mind of the world but we are fully surrendered into the spirit of the nation that we are born in he will continue on and it says we are not American as far as that goes because America is just on an an an earth ly Nation but when a when a German and of a ger when when a man of Germany of of of Switzerland or whatever uh he may be when he becomes born of of born of Heaven he says he takes the Heavenly Spirit his nature his makeup look for the things above Christ sets right uh sits uh it says where Christ sits at the right hand of God Amen it says oh how we ought to remember that he died that we might be able to be fortified from the things inoculation that's right so we when we are of a of a certain nation and of a certain Spirit we don't walk by by the things of other nations our mindset and our our way of doing things and I want to say this the there is a uh uh uh uh uh characteristics to the people of Exodus the the people that are going in an exodus they are identifiable why because they walk by the spirit of whatever Nation they are in the children of Israel they had a culture they don't touch the unclean things and they don't do this they had a law by which they were to walk by that's what qualifies them as the people of Exodus why be because they were not like other nations when Christ came and he gave his life on the second Exodus the people of that nation that were moved from the spirit unto the spirit they became filled with the Holy Spirit then there were no longer Jew or Gentile the spirit tells us they were born in another country they were born of another nation and they operated by that the spirit of that nation and we in the Ted Exodus are no longer different because the spirit tells us that we move from the spiritual into the Everlasting so what is it we are governed by the spirit of God to move into the heavenlies he would say the hour is late in another message the hour is late as one said a while ago he said in a prayer and I just want to walk in it says the hour is late and we need uh and the need is great it says we are here uh to try to put uh to play to try to put our part in to help this great hour that we are in and and I just W to for a moment I want to say this it we we cannot be uh part of this Exodus that God is calling for and not be able to examine Our Lives to to check up to see am I what what is am I being influenced by this Exodus am I living by the spirit of this Exodus is is this message really having an effect on my life am I really seeing the fruits of this Exodus that I'm in if if the because remember the Exodus takes God to come down first without God coming down there's no Exodus forget about it the change in your life will take God to come down first and I'm not just talking about the age Exodus I'm talking about your personal Exodus you cannot stop doing the things that you are doing unless God comes down first unless God speaks his word first unless God has a promise first by which he can call you out from the things that you are in and put you in the things that he wants you to be you are on a destination somewhere and God is the author of it but when I'm said this it continues on in the same thought it says the hour is getting late and and I want to say this are we aware of the lateness of the hour are we you know there's no calendar there's no quote there's no message that you can read for you to buy yourself any even one minute the reason everything shows you that the hour is now the hour is late the hour is late there's not a place you can say well this hasn't really happened I'm waiting for this to happen then I'll see no as far as you are concerned the word is in front of you the message that sent to prepare you for an exodus is in front of you it's for you to take it and eat it and let the word change your life into the Exodus person so you can be taken out of here so the hour is late the hour it says the hour is late in the evening it's also late in the time that we are living in the Sun is going down the world is cooling off God it says Darkness will soon take set in it says then the coming of the Lord the cing away of the church how that we are thankful for this now it's amazing because when the the things of the world when they unfold the the the people of the world they get scared they get uneasy the uncertainty grows because the very Foundation that they were upon is shaking they realize that they don't have enough they don't realize they don't they realize that they don't have what it takes to keep them they realize that the government under which they rely on doesn't have what it takes to keep them but over the other side for the believer is supposed to be a time of rejoicing a time of thanking God a time of uh uh coming to the realization that what I've always believed is to be the truth to see that God is here vindicating his word let me say this the prophecy out there is an assurance for you to know that the promise in you is coming to pass he said we pray now that you will bless every person in that divine presence everyone everyone that the Hearts any anyone that hears this tape around the world it says may we get away from those old Creek uh Creeds and things and come to serve the Living God come in and invest into it oh my where is are we making the right Investments it says that we may invest in it do like the Queen of Sheba she came and took her uh uh took her three months to get were the men of uh the men that representing Jesus Christ or God of the god of Heaven Solomon uh Jesus said she came from the outer part most of the world to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold greater than Solomon is here it says and we know that greater than Solomon is here great he says the great Holy Spirit himself is here walking through the people he says how that we thank him for this father I pray the blessing now so we we we have to understand that the the word of the hour the message of the hour is a message to prepare you for an exodus the the the and Pastor said all the time this is a living message and I think it's important that we have those things in our mind and in our heart is this message when you read it when you look look the things that he says it's not telling you anything about how you can cope with your life it doesn't tell you anything about how you're going to do this how you going to achieve great success no he's telling you that this world is going to go into a destruction everywhere you read is telling you the world is falling apart the world is falling apart it's getting worse and worse and and why because they rejected the very light that God sent them that's why they are in the condition that they are in but those who receive the the light that God said will be lifted up out of this earth into an exodus so I want to say this the word of God is here to create a separation in your heart the word of God is given for it to kill in you the desires you have of the world when you inject the word of God in your heart it starts killing everything of the world oh I I have this ambition the word of God kills it oh I want to be an astronaut the word of God kills it oh I want to achieve great things the word of God kills it why because it wants to take everything in perspective and prepare you for the oncoming event amen I I thought there was something that but David said that thought there was so much wisdom in it he said when Jesus Christ looked looked at the Rich Young Ruler he knew that he was not ready for the event that was to come around the corner I want you to think about that a prophet is one who sees around the corner he's one who sees something before they happen Jesus may have looked at him even though he loved him he knew that hell was his destination he said well for you to avoid what's about to come take this instead you take this and it will help you avoid what's about to happen to you and and I want to say this the word of God is offered to us to get us out of the situation that we are in now I I want to say this I don't care what you're dealing with this morning oh I I can't overcome this the word of God is here to help you oh I can't do this the word is here to help you this Exodus is not a m made Exodus it's no it's not you waking up in the morning say well I I don't want to sin anymore no that's good but if it's just your mind it will not help you understand that you you I don't want to lie anymore that's wonderful but let God come down because there's no Exodus unless God comes down go to the Bible find the promise call upon his name let him come down and take you out in an exodus but when I'm says this God wants to help you God wants to help you the problem is man wants to do things by himself and when you want to do it by yourself you can't overcome because it's just you but if you bring the owner or the author of The Exodus into your life he will promise he will take you out of an exodus so I want to say this it it's here to to to take away the desires if you find yourself still struggling with the desires of the world and this and that oh I I tell you this morning this is not condemnation this is the word that comes to rescue you this morning all you need is to lift your hand and say father I I needed some Exodus this morning I I need to get out of a lot of stuff that I'm in this morning I'm stuck in some things that I I tried for my own and I can't take out and I know I need I need this things taken off before the Rapture so I'm here that you can take me out in an exodus and I know that I've tried on my own I can't but you promise in your word you promise Malachi 4 will come you promise Luke 17:30 you promise that you'll have a bride of your own choosing you promise that there will be a people on Earth that'll be the very representative of you you promise that you yourself will come the same way that God poured himself into you you will pour yourself into a people I want to be that people this morning and I can't get that by myself I need an exodus in my [Applause] life this is a reality this is not some fairy tale this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever this is what the Exodus is all [Music] about the first one was a natural land because they had a promised land that they had to get in they had to go from a natural land to a natural land the second one we know he was from a spiritual condition into the baptism of the Holy Spirit but the last one is not to keep you here on Earth is to take you and pick you out out of this world and put you into the heavenlies where a body is waiting for you Hallelujah and let me say this so we when we gather here we we have to come and know that I'm here it's because of a promise I let me say this I didn't make myself a Christian I didn't I didn't open my own eyes to see the message I didn't claim to be a message I didn't bring myself here to be part of the body God did that why because he has an exodus that is working on but but will say he says he says now we've had many Exodus and I want to say this every day we hear the word of God we come in contact with God he calls us to move a step forward he causes an exodus a movement uh uh going forward going into a direction and he says we've had many exence people have called for changes in our own lives oh do this you're going to be you're going to change and oh you're struggling with weight and go do this and do this and do and and I've seen people they go on to lose weight yet to come back and get and pick up where they left off oh if you do this you'll be changed oh it goes and you see oh that's wonderful I I see them make progress and just give him a little bit of time it comes right back to where they left off right so so I'm saying this to say it has to be an exodus in your life that God called for an exodus not a main call Exodus how does God call he has a promised word in his word where he says that I I have heard the Cry of my people and The Exodus oh I just want to jump ahead they they he has a step to an exodus so first there has to be a crying out from the condition that you are in I don't like what I see I don't like the things that I'm involved in I don't like all of this and I know you promise you'll make me a real Christian I know you promise that you will take me and you will make me one that can serve you and I want to serve you and then God will hear your cry he will say I heard the cay of my people and I himself have come down and I'm sending you and preacher will send here and preach the word of God and you will receive the word and it will cause an exodus in your life so this is not a man-made process it's God's process of getting you out of what you are in Hallelujah so the prophet said but I'm speaking at time this isn't a message Third Exodus paragraph 55 I'm speaking of a time that God called for in Exodus a separation from where you were where they were at the present time and here God is making ready to fulfill his Divine promise word and that he had given to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob years a it says a hundred of years had passed but yet God never forgets his promise in in the season the due time God always makes his promise right aren't you glad we have that kind of God he always there to make his promise right he says therefore you can rest assure paragraph 56 you can rest assure that when that what God has promised in his in the Bible he's going to do it just no need to try to think anything else you wasting your time thinking anything else you wasting your breath you wasting your effort you're wasting years of your life if God said it's going to come to pass you stand still it will come to pass and I know we said last time so isn't it amazing because if God said something because of his nature I would almost say it's impossible because he cannot say something that you will think and say oh I got that yeah you're going to go in the body change I have no idea how all I know is God said he's the master of the impossible I am climbing into the impossible he will take me from The Impossible into the possible what is our problem you know God said you already heal you like oh I don't know the doctor said there the so you give the doctor more power more Authority more belief than you do in God that's right if God said you are saved oh my goodness I'll say I'm safe I'll sing I'm safe until I die why because because it's God who said it Hallelujah I I like the prophet the story that the prophet talks about that couple with the baby in the hospital and I like how he says it because it's so it's so true there's so much truth in it here comes the nurse and she's looking at the instruments it's like things she's never SE before so she comes and he says you're giving them false hope and he's looking at the the parents is saying you you hear rejoicing but your son is dying he the par the dad looks and says he says young lady he says you are looking at the instruments that you were training to look at as far as you are concerned this is where your knowledge stopped but I'm not looking at the same thing that you are looking I am looking at the Creator himself the one who can create out of nothing don't forget this world came out of him if you can understand that let me know you say there was no world I don't can't even go past that I can't put it in my mind you because every time you say there was no world you create a void there was no void there was just God sir but yet we come with our human problems when he says I've taken care of it with struggle I don't know how it's not for you to know how it's for you to just know who said it if we can just rest in who said it I think that will help us a lot God I don't understand the process I don't understand how I'm going to get out of this but one thing I know is if you said it you have the power you have the tools you have everything that you need in order to create out of nothing to bring it to come to pass for me so therefore I am only hanging on to the word because the word has creative power so now he says now he he he says here in paragraph 57 and in luk look how simple he does it I am come down I heard that cry so there has to be a cur I remember my promise there has to be a promise I am come down and I'm sending you there has to be one that is sent and then he says you do it I'm going to be with you certainly I'll be with you my never failing presence will be with you wherever you go don't be afraid I'm coming down to deliver you it says I'm I'm I'm sure this spirit spiritual mind catches that see I'm going to send you to bring you my people to an exodus call them out and I'll be with you so God comes in this generation he anoints a prophet in the backside of the desert he calls him from his birth and he prepares him he says I have given you a message my never-failing presence will be with you you just go and call my people out and they will hear my word and they will come out often time we want to know the process well how is it going to happen he says that's not for you to know you just go and speak the word my failing my never failing presence will be with you you said I've I've done it and fail the difference is this time God is with you oh I I've tried many times I fail I know but this time he said I'm going with you but when him said God came down where was he God going in the form of a man what makes the difference is not the man is the person in the man God himself I I was hearing a someone told me a story long ago and I thought it was so amazing I don't know if they got it from a cartoon or something and so let's say there was this a mouse and the cat so the M the cat will always chase the mouse and it will go and run away and all those things and then all of the sudden the mouse goes and he St and then he goes on some wine and he drinks wine and he's all evil he's all drunk up so he comes out and the the the the the cat is trying to scare him off he's just looking at him the the the the cat strike him he Strikes Back the cat looks at him and said I don't want anything to do with this mouse and then it's instead of the the cat chesing the mouse the mouse now is chasing the cat I thought there was so some truth to it you know the problem with us is we are not drunk enough with the Holy Spirit the problem with us is we are not drunk enough with God what we need is to be drunk with God when the devil shows up when he says boo you say boo back when he say run you say you run when he comes and he shows up you cast him out because remember the army of God was given to cast out the devil when he brings diseases you cast him out you cast him out why because where he belongs under your feet we are not filled with God that's the problem but let it f with God come this morning and say God I want so much of you that when this devil shows up instead of me running he's going to be the one [Applause] running we are a people of an exodus we are not called to tremble before the devil the scripture says the devil will tremble before you when he hears that there's a Son of God involved well it's time to pck my bag because I know trouble is about to come the problem is we don't come with expectation we don't we we live far Bey below our means and we don't understand that there's a position that's been given to us that wherever that devil is within our family and our our relatives we can we can just find him and cast him out I said God I need to be drunk with you so much so much that it's no longer me but it's you it's the wine of the holy spirit in me working where I will do things that even my own mind to my better judgment will not do butam says the holy spirit will make you do things that you couldn't otherwise do go check it out we can't get the Holy Spirit and remain in this mind we can't the devil is all over just hecking havoc and we all they oh God oh God let me say this we cry out to God we speak the word to the devil remember that we cry out to God because we have need of him but when it comes to the enemy to the trouble we speak the word and we cast it out we don't cry out before the things of the world we don't cry out before the devil and say oh the devil go go no we cast him out in the name of Jesus Christ sorry I just don't know where I am anymore he this this morning I want to say this this morning we as the people of God we have to understand that the E an exodus is God's means by which he comes and I was thinking about it in terms of giber because if you really look at it it it Bears somewhat a resemblance of a going in so Exodus is coming out and going into jubile says I don't care what situation you were in there's a time set Jubilee said you can because let me say this we we make so much claim to the reason why we are in the shape that we are in and we lay so much weight into that my parents were divorc and this happened and I was cast down and I did this and I did that that that's that's all gone the what what matters is what did God said when did The Exodus start did did you hear anything at all because if you haven't heard you will only go in the cycle of the same thing or whatam calls the cycle of Revival and death you'll think you got it and then pretty soon you find yourself back what changes the dynamic from that cycle into a new cycle is you knowing that I have heard from God God has spoken to my life and is spoken into me I have heard that's why I am what I am today I can't go back even if I wanted to what I'm say this it says the you you you look at and I want to skip some that's why he's saying The Exodus then and The Exodus today he says before we can find out uh this Exodus means it says I'm going to type the Exodus then with the Exodus today now have you ever wondered how come the children of Israel find themselves in Egypt butam says it was because of jealousy of a brother because they rejected the spiritual because of unbelief God God sends them a prophet God in their own family Jacob's family there's one who's a Seer instead of them loving him for what gift God gave him they rejected him their own family just just think Human family today on Earth God sends a prophet messenger one who has the key to show you how you're going to get back to where you came from one who has the to come and open the door so we can get out of this P house so we can get out of the condition that we are in where we were born into it just think about it but there are those that will look at it and call it of the devil it says they went in there because of jealousy of a brother why because he was born spiritual he was Bor to lead them he was Bor to be there above them but but they didn't want to accept his position you say what is that has to do with me we do it every day am the prophet says this we find a way to go around it you know we find a way to give our own interpretation the prophet speaks something oh we have our own wisdom on how to interpret it I I don't need an interpretation if he said it he's the he he's the only Divine interpreter if the prophet said it don't let anybody tell you otherwise don't let anybody add more meaning to it if he said it it's exactly as he said it if God wanted it to say otherwise he would have said it otherwise if if you if you if you start playing with it then your destination changes and and that's what he said jealousy over the brother they they they want to some wants to lift thems up close to him some that want to put themselves in front of him say Well you come to me before you get to him no there's no such thing this word was given so he can fall on the ears of all believers it was recorded so he can speak to you directly not so I can come here and become your interpreter I don't want that right it's given so when you hear it you hear it from your own heart and God because remember the mouth of the Prophet is the mouth of God when he speaks is God's word it's not his own thought it's the mind of God being [Music] spoken but people want I'm going I'm going to read it but Ram said the order of Exodus was the pill of fire it was the cloud there was an anointed Prophet it says they were going by the anointing of the Prophet that's right it didn't say preacher Minister anybody no we go in by the anointing of the Prophet the moment you take yourself out of the anointing of a prophet you're going somewhere else wait what what's so hard in just saying what he said why I I think there's more value there's more honor there's more truthness if we can just repeat what he said instead of trying to put it ourselves in our different ways there there has to be the same heartbeat that beats in the prophet to beat in The Believer to beat into the minister that I don't want to vary for one second for one aota I want to stay as true as he said it because that's the only thing that will produce the result am now let me say this the purpose of an exodus is to bring you back into the promised land remember that the purpose of an exodus is to bring you back into to the promised land remember the scripture says that God cannot bless Israel outside of the Homeland remember that so when they were in Egypt it didn't matter if they prosper whatever happened to them they were not a blessed people as long as they were in Egypt the blessings was only to take place when they come back into the promised land and I want to say this to you Believers you have to understand that you are only blessed when you are in the word of the hour we compromise left and right and we come up with our own things and we we come up with things and God will not bless you unless what you do unless your life is lining up with the message of the hour now remember he said the sunshine doesn't mean God is with you neither the rain means God is against you Prophet spoke simple things it says under no circumstance a Believer can marry a nonbeliever but guess what we find a way now how do you expect to be blessed when you just broke the ordinance right there and then when Trouble Comes you're going to say God doesn't like you as Believers we conduct ourselves a certain way we do business a certain way we do this a certain way those things are given to you as your promised land they are not given as judgment to hold you from anything else no the devil is as is always the one offering a carrot look standing this is the line of the promise look if you just come over you don't even have to step over just get your neck here get it you'll still remain what did he tell Moses well we're going to compromise let's do this how about you go worship and come back Moses said no okay how about the man goes you can't take the children all the way over there with women you're going to drag them in the wilderness why don't you leave them behind and you guys go worship and you'll come back no why he always there to offer a compromise so you are not fully blessed but Moses looked at him he says we'll take everything we'll take our children our women our cattle everything that we own we'll worship God 100% oh I wonder if there's anybody here wants to worship God 100% I'll take my family I'll take everything that you have given me I I'll take my life I'll take everything I'll worship you 100% let's not compromise let's believe the word it will produce the reason it's not producing is because we've mixed it with other stuff that's why it's not a full Exodus but I believe God is here this morning to say the reason I'm calling you into an exodus is because you cannot be blessed outside of the Homeland and our homeland is the message of the hour and let me say there's walk into it there's so many blessings in it you don't need to go out God provides for his Believers you need something you pray God is obligated to his word you have something you need a job that will allow you to be on Church you need something you need whatever you need you ask him he's obligated because he knows if he doesn't give you you attempted to go outside he will provide so you can remain in the homand he's a good God He Loves Us he wants you to remain in the country he doesn't want you to go [Applause] out and you will say God goes even as far as to change the laws of a country just so you can come back in the Homeland think about that to what extent he will go he said he like a Shepherd who will take a sheep and work its leg so he won't go far Glory now you either want to walk with a broken leg or you just want to hear what he said and say father I'm just going to stay here I'll be like that child that didn't have to leave I don't have to go test of the world so I know the goodness of God I'm staying here it seems like God is only good when bad things happen no if you have good health it's the blessing of God if you can walk and your your members are functioning it's a good if you came this morning you walk up and you came it's the goodness of God we don't need to get into some situation near death experience to know God is good it's it's the same God it's not it's not it's not lesser here than it is over there hallelujah hallelujah the reason why he gives you something and it looks impossible to you is because number one we think with the human mind and number two because God wants to use the process of taking the impossible to possible to create a fellowship with you that's right to have fellowship with you he comes you're like father I can't I can't jump he said yeah I know I know you can't jump but I'm I'm here with you I told you Exodus I'm always going to my presence will go go before you I'm always my angel will go before you he will prepare the way so you can make it so jump I'm holding you I'm here with you you're not going to fall I give you my word so you jump now you have an experience now when you get next to the same another trial you know the father said there the word was true so the same father who said here he said that the word was true the word is true also here that's his goodness he wants to baby step Us in This Promise so we can get CH bigger and bigger and be able to overcome the land if the musician could come and let me say this we don't need to go outside of the Homeland you only going to come back with scars and bad memories and things that scars your life forever it's not worth it let his goodness for where you are be shown but mam said and let me if I get into this I probably won't have the time to stop but I just want to say this our pastor made a comment about the law that was passed in California about children he said if the parent interfere in the children desire to choose a gender or something like that that it's illegal it's going to be made illegal and it's going to be arrested or something like that I thought that must be somewhere in the Bible in the message now think of this we don't let our our kids carry guns right we don't we don't let them smoke we don't let drink beer we have all the limitation for everything else but yet we can let them choose the gender and Bam says here that the first order of areses was always to kill children first order I I want you to ponder the time we are living in you see in the first Exodus he had all the babies killed because he knew one would come and the second Exodus to try to get Jesus killed and here he says today spiritual death think about what they teaching kids oh you can have two mommies two daddies and two this what is it they're killing their mind in but getting them into their mind where they they are void of the word of God it's Exodus time this is real we we have to watch out the the the devil is not playing so we can't be playing we can't be the one that are not serious about what we have received the devil is coming full force and now is just killing but bom says he comes and he's just killing what is it he's trying to kill that seed but he said at the same time that rameses was doing all of that raising up he says the children of Israel God was RA raising up a Moses and I say we have received the word of Moses today we have a word that will overcome anything that the devil throws at us if he's going to kill our children we'll take our children and fill them with the word of God they'll be like that drunk Mouse and they will stand there the teacher will say it wouldn't get into them why because says when they come home when don't leave them like that take them the amount of time that you spend with them at home even if it's 10 minutes is enough to kill all of the things that they've taken into them why because it's your position it's the power that God has given you but if we take it we just say well you know the world is falling apart and iniquity is rising I don't even know we can talk about that anymore it's there's no time there's no place we can turn to and say well we still got no it's the end and I say we are an exodus people this morning if we could just within our heart and say God I know I'm in a lot of things I'm not supposed to be why don't you come and call an exodus in my life this morning take me step by I know there's probably too many things I don't know how to overcome them all but if all it takes is his presence to come down is him to come down he'll take you out of one two three however many it is he will take you out of all of them why because he promised in his word that he will do it let all stand this [Applause] [Music] morning I don't know about you but when I read this message more and more lately is become such a reality the things that we see in it and to see every day that everything that's happening out there we can go and find it in the message everything that's going out there we can come back and we'll see it's the prophet speaking right back to us I say our hearts needs to be on fire for God we can't be lukewarm and we can't just give in we have to be here and come and say God we are here so your word can be made a reality that was a prophecy this is a promise that was a prophecy out there the the the the the difference is we were told when we see the prophecy here the promise has to come to pass the promise is I'll change you I'll get you out of the world your situation I'm aware of it remember when he came down he says I know what my people are going through I heard their cry I heard the things that they are going through I know what pharah is doing to them I know what they're doing but I'm here to change all of that God I'm here this morning that you may bring that change in my life let's just bow our heads our gracious father father not needing to go into much but really the desires of our heart this morning is just Lord that your reality May
