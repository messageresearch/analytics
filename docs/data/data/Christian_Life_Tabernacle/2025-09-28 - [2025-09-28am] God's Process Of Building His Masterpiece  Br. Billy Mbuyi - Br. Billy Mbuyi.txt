[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Good morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord. We seem to be few in number this morning, but we're going to make a joyful noise and lift our voices. And you know, there's only 120 in the upper room. Amen. But they let the whole area know their presence when they came out of there. Amen. Let's sing that course they were playing. Grace, grace, God's grace. Oh, it's grace. Grace. God's grace. Grace light will man within [Music] grace. Praise God's grace. Grace that is greater than all lies. Let's sing the chorus again. Oh, praise. God's grace. Grace love that will pardon and within grace lives. God's grace. Praise that is greater than our sin. Let's stand as we sing it one more time. Oh, praise him [Music] God's grace. Grace that will pardon things within his grace. Praise God. [Music] Grace is greater than all our sins. Amen. Unmmerited favor, the outpouring of grace. What a blessing it is. Um I must admit I feel a little bit uh out of place here this morning, but uh we're going to do the best we can. Sometimes you think uh if the pitcher, and I'll use a baseball analogy, is not doing so well, they go to the bullpin and get a reliever. Sometimes they call him the ace. Sometimes he's better than the guy that started out. But I'm one of those position players. When they run out of relief players, they just get a position player. Just lob it up there and let them hit it. We'll take care of you. So, I'm relying on you guys to back me up and take care of me. So, amen. Lord, bless. Uh let's just open with prayer. We'll give him the honor and the glory in first place. Amen. Our gracious Lord, we truly ask that you would have the preeminence. Lord, there be nothing said or done that's outside your control in your Holy Spirit. We pray, Lord, that you just envelop this place, Lord, as we come with prepared hearts to hear your word. Lord, we want to sing the songs and praise you and worship you, Lord. Let them sink down on the inside, but mostly, Lord, they're to prepare our hearts and create an atmosphere that the true word of God can come &gt;&gt; and make manifest and do something for us that's of eternal value. So Lord, just lay the flesh aside. We pray all the faults, the failures, they're many. Lord, there's many needs, but we just put them all on your altar this morning and pray that you'd just lead, guide, and direct as you'd see fit. Lord, we worship you in spirit and in truth this morning. We ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'll grab your Bibles, if you don't have a Bible, refer to the screen. We're going to read from Psalms 86 this morning. Psalm 86 and I couldn't help but notice verse 9. All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee. Amen. There's many, many nations gathered here this morning represented and but we've all come to worship him. Amen. All right. We'll just uh read responsively and we'll join together there on the last of Psalm 86. Bow down thine ear, O Lord, hear me, for I am poor and needy. &gt;&gt; Preserve my soul, I am &gt;&gt; Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for I cry unto thee daily. For thou, Lord, art good and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. Thou wilt answer me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All nations whom thou has made shall come and worship before thee, oh Lord, and shall glorify thy name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen to the truth. And this is a prayer of David. Teach me thy way, O Lord. I will walk in thy truth. Unite my heart to fear thy name. &gt;&gt; For great is thy mercy toward me and thou has delivered my soul from the lowest hell. But thou, oh Lord, art God full of compassion and gracious and long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. Show me a token for good that they which hate me may see it and be ashamed because thou Lord has hope in me and comforted me. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. If we could let's sing that song. They come. They come from the east and west. Man, just uh before you're seated, just turn around and bless someone by shaking their hand and say, "Welcome to the house of the Lord." Enjoy ourselves this morning in the spirit of holiness and lifting up his name. Amen. Oh, they come from the east and west. They come from the lands of God to feast with the king tonight as his guest. How blessed these pilgrims are. Beholding his pal. [Music] as partaker of his grace as risen his since Jesus has set me free. I'm happy as far can be. No longer I bear the burden of care. His yoke is so sweet to me. My soul was as black as night. The darkness has taken flight. And now I shout the victory for Jesus. Let's go to the last one. is coming before it the ransom stand. No longer our tears, no sorrow is flown, nor death in that goodly land. For my Savior has gone before, preparing the way for me. [Music] Soon we'll be to find the Lord. [Music] Amen. Since Jesus has set me free. Time as far as can be. No longer I bear the burden of pain. His yoke is so sweet to me. [Music] My soul was as black as night. The darkness has taken. [Music] Now I shout for Jesus. Jesus is coming soon. Jesus is coming soon. [Music] Our Lord, this moment should come for those who are free from sin. Oh, then would it bring you joy or sorrow and deep despair. When our Lord in glory comes, we'll meet him by him. Since Jesus has set me free, I'm happy as far can be. No longer I bear the burden of car. His yoke is so sweet to me. My soul was as black as night, but darkness has taken down. Now I shout [Music] for Jesus [Music] free. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. You know, there are times when uh especially on Wednesday night, it seems that you know, you get uh a little depressed by the work day and and things uh tend to just come down on you heavy and and you think, well, I'm going to go to the house of the Lord. And you think, well, I'm going to set myself aside and come in to worship the Lord. and and the burdens of this world and just this old sin nature just continue to to rob you of your victory and and you get somebody up here that sings a song and say, "Oh, I know that one." And it energize you a little bit. And sometimes it's uh we're reluctant to lift our voice and sing because well I may be like me a little off key or a little too loud offensive brother sister you hear me singing. I think it puts the devil under our feet. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram taught us if we raise our hand we defy gravity. That act alone can bring the presence of the Lord. We lift our voices and sing. Doesn't matter. We make a joyful noise unto the Lord. Amen. So, I encourage you this morning, even you young sisters that think, "Oh, my voice may be cracky this morning." Raise your voice and sing. Give God everything that we have. Amen. Amen. I want to sing this course. Uh it's in the old belief song book number 113. It's leave it there. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there for others can pull it up. I mean, we may sing some that you're not used to singing, but we're going to we're going to try them this morning. Amen. [Music] Let's start out. If the world from you withhold of its silver and its gold. Yeah. If the world from you withholds of its silver and its gold and you have to get along with bigger f just remember in his word how he feeds a little. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there. Leave it there. there. Oh, leave it there. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there. For if you trust and never doubt, he will surely bring them home. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave it. If your body suffers pain and your health can be and your soul is all sinking in despair, Jesus knows the pain you feel. He can save and he can heal. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there. will leave it there. Oh, leave it there. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there. [Music] If you trust and never down, he will surely bring you. Take your burdens to the Lord and healing them. When your eneies are saved and your heart begins to don't forget that God in heaven answers prayer for he will make a way for you and he will lead you safely. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there. Leave it there. Leave it there. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there.

Take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there. Amen. Amen. Let's try to segue into sunlight. Sunlight in my soul today. Amen. It was number 46 if that matters. Amen. Uh, I will say I was in church a lot growing up and sometimes the only thing to read was the little blue book on the back of the pew and you just flip through it and you just seem to memorize those numbers. Of course, every song leader everywhere they always had their favorite. So, we knew the the person that was leading singing more than likely they're going to sing this song. But we may, like I said, scatter around this morning. But, amen. We enjoy the freedom of the Holy Spirit this morning. Let's start out on a on a verse somewhere there. All right, here we go. I wondered in the shade till Jesus came to me and with the sunlight of his love it all my darkness. Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today. Sunlight, sunlight, all along the way. Since the Savior found me and he took away my sin, you're right, Lord. I have had the sunlight. All right, let's start it over there. She warned me it was too high, but I must say, uh, I was telling the brothers back there, my key is B flat. Doesn't matter what key it is. I'm on B flat. So I try to raise it up a little. Sometimes I get too high. So Amen. Let's start it off. Jesus came to me and with the sunlight of his love it all my darkness. Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today. Sunlight, sunlight. All along the way, since the Savior found me and he took away my sin, I have had the sunlight of his love. [Music] Roll. However dark the world may be, I have sunlight in my soul, sunlight, sunlight in my soul today. Sunlight, sunlight. All along the way, since a savior found me and took away my sin, I have had the sunlight of his love. Walking in the light of God, I speak communion find. I press with holy vigor on hand and leave the world behind. Oh, sunlight sunlight in my soul today. Sunlight, sunlight. All along the way. Since the savior found me and took away my sin. I have had the sunlight of his love. [Music] Goodbye. that journey or the pain. And in the sunlight of his love, I ring the golden flame. Sunlight, sunlight, in my soul today. Sunlight, sunlight, all along the way. Since the Savior found me, took away my sin. I have had the sunlight of his love. Soon I shall see. Soon I shall see him as he the light that came to me. Behold the brightness of his face throughout eternity. Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today. Sunlight, sunlight, all along the way. Since a savior found me, took away my sin. I have met the sunlight of his love. Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Let's tone it down just a little bit. We'll before we read the prayer requests and make a few announcements. Let's sing that little course. I think uh Bill and Gloria Gaither may have written this course. It's called Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. There's just something about that name. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Jesus. [Music] Jesus, there's just something about that name. Amen. It's true. Oh, master, savior Jesus. Like the frame rings after the rain. [Music] Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. [Music] Let all heaven and earth proclaim. Kings and kingdoms shall all pass away. But there's something about that. Let's worship him now. Sing it again. Oh Jesus. [Music] Jesus. My Jesus. There's just something about that name. Master, Savior Jesus. Like the brains after the rain. [Music] Oh Jesus, Jesus. Jesus. Let all heaven and earth proclaim. [Music] Kings and kingdoms shall all pass away. Oh, there's something about that king. Amen. Amen. Amen. That line says, "Kings and kingdoms will all pass away." They might not be a king. They may be a proposed president, a dictator, whatever. All those kingdoms are going to fade and pass away. I don't care what kind of power they flex or say, "Oh, we've got this arsenal or that arsenal. We can outdo you." It's all going to fail. and they're just instruments in God's hands. Amen. Amen. There's a couple announcements we need to make concerning u a little bit of a date correction. This little fall festival thing that we're going to have this uh for the children, the families of young children, Sunday school, uh will be October the 18th. Okay, brother David continues to say the 19th, but the Saturday preceding the 19th, the 18th is the day we're going to do that. So, and then also after service, uh this is the last call for the lost and found items that we've already made announcements before. They're going to be in the little best Bule outside in the hallway. When you go out those double doors, just sift through those, find something that's yours, you can claim it and take it. If not, it will be donated. So, today is the last call on the lost and found. Okay. Um our sister put in a prayer request. Sister Zomada, I think her name is. Pardon sister if I mispronounced that. We want to pray for her her father who will undergo surgery this coming Tuesday. Juan Pablo is his name and she asked God bless you all. So, uh, my daughter, Sister Joy, is not up here on the platform this morning. She has strained her right wrist and would like some prayer for that. She's just trying to get it completely healed before she gets back in service. And then brother Inten Inten from Colorado, Denver, Colorado, lost his son. So we want to remember him in prayer. All right. All right. If we could, let's just all stand and give reverence. And brother Jose, would you mind coming and asking the Lord's blessings on that? Let's pray. I understand. forch. [Music] to the east. [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I failed to mention that we want to remember brother David, sister Leslie. They're attending uh brother Biscll's uh going away service there. Uh and also brother Matthew will be preaching this morning I think out east. Um and there are quite a few brothers that have gone to the men's meeting. You may be seated. So the Lord bless them in all their efforts and travels. Amen. We're going to have Sister Accassia and group come up momentarily to get ready to sing. Let's sing that little chorus if we could before they come. Blessed be the name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Jesus is the name. Amen. [Music] Oh, blessed be, blessed be the name. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, blessed be the name. Blessed be the name.

May we all get together and we'll all go up anyhow. Amen. Amen. John came and said he's going to make the the high places low and the low places high. So, Amen. The Lord work it all out. Sister Aassia in your group if you could come. Someone take the stage at much better singer than I am. Lord bless you. God bless you.

How great th great things [Music] my soul my savior comes to thee. [Music] How great th [Music] great. [Applause] How wonderful. You know, I was dwelling on uh the idea of what language will we all communicate with uh for eternity. And uh you know, there's such music and language, you know, I love the Spanish language and uh and even French. It has a lip to it and a cadence and and you really enjoy that. when they sang that last chorus there. When you know the meaning, it makes a difference. And I'm thankful that the Lord knows all languages. Doesn't matter the uh the earnings, the yearnings of our heart and the groanings, he understands that as well. Amen. Amen. And uh we're getting ready now to uh turn our hearts to the word. And I just feel like Elijah when he was on the top of Mount Carmel actually he was he was still down in the valley. It says after he had slayed the prophets of Jezebel and he said I hear the sound of abundance of rain and there wasn't a cloud in the sky and he went to the top of Mount Carmel. He put his head between his knees and he told his servant says go check for a cloud. go look. And he said he looked out toward the sea and there was nothing. He said, "Go seven times." He came back on the seventh time. Well, there arises out of the to see a little cloud the size of a man's hand. &gt;&gt; It's happening. Whether we realize it or not, it's happening. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things going on. He told he said, "Tell Ahab to get up." He said, "Arise, get thee up, eat, and drink." And he said, "Prepare his chariot." And said, "Don't let the rain stop you." And I believe it's the last miracle performed uh on or with Elijah. The Bible says that Ahab took off on his chair and he said, "Don't stop for the rain." He headed to the gates of Jezrael. The Bible says the hand of the Lord was upon Elijah. Amen. And he he put his mantel about him, girded his loins, and he took off. And he beat Ahab to the gates of Jezrael. The Bible says he overtook him and beat him to the He outran a horse and chariot. Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He's going to get us out of here before the first bomb will fall. Amen. Let's sing. Think about his love. Think about his love before I get longwinded and try to take over the preacher's job. But we got brother Billy prepared and he's going to bring us a good message. Let's enter in and worship the Lord. You know, tithe and offering is a part of worship. Sing is a part of worship, but it's all a preparation for what's coming next. Amen. Oh, think about his love and think about his goodness. will think about his grace that's brought us through. For as high as the heavens above, so great is the measure of our father's love. [Music] Oh, praise and of our father. [Music] Oh, think about his love and think about his goodness. [Music] Think about his grace. While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us that brought us through. [Music] For as high as the heavens above, so great is the measure of our father's love. [Music] Great is the measure of our father. Let's sing it one more time. [Music] Oh, think about his love. Think about his goodness. [Music] Think about his grace. Think on these things that's brought us through. [Music] For as high as the heavens are, so great is the measure of our love. [Music] Praise the Father. Let's sing Sweep Over My Soul. As brother Billy comes, we sing Sweep Over My Soul. Can we all stand together? Oh, sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. [Music] Sweet peace, sweep over my soul. For my rest is complete. While I sing at your feet, sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. [Music] Oh, sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweet spirit. sweep over my soul. My rest is complete while I sing. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh sweet spirit. Oh sweep over. Why don't we just sing it one more time? Sweep over my soul this morning. Oh, as sweet my soul. Sweep over my soul. &gt;&gt; Oh, sweet spirit praise. Sweep over my soul. And my grace is complete. By the se at your feet, sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. &gt;&gt; Is that your heart desire this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. We certainly want to be. We gather in his presence and we're here to hear from him. And uh I believe he will speak to us this morning. He said, "Where two or three I gather in my name, I'll be in the midst." Amen. We want to welcome all our visitors this morning. Brother Gary, Sister Barbara, it's good to see you. All of those that are visiting this morning, remembering as Brother David, uh, Brother Tim mentioned, Brother David and Sister Lesie as they are at the memorial service, and I know there are some of the deacons and brothers that are at the men's meeting. So, want to remember them. Let's just bow our heads this morning. Our gracious father, we're so thankful to be gather in your presence. Lord Jesus, what if it wasn't for you, Lord, where would we be this morning? Father, your word even said that, Lord, bless the Lord, oh my soul, forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thy iniquity and health all thy diseases. Lord, we can certainly gather this morning and know that all that we have need of, you've taken care of it, Lord. Lord, we've come to honor the resurrection this morning, Lord. We may not have much but we want to know let everybody know which side we are on. The side of the Lord Jesus who died and he gave his life for us Lord. We believe that you promised that there was to be a life's transfer that the same life that raised you from the dead will also be in the believers Lord. And we are here as those that have partaken have tasted of that life Lord. And we cry out this morning and say Lord we want more of that life in us. Lord, come and speak to us the words of life. And Father, we know that men's word can kill, but your word will give life. And and we we don't desire to just speak as a man and speak the words of men. But Lord, we desire this morning to stand upon the unfailing word of God and speak the promises which you've made us, you've made for us for this generation that it may bring life unto us. We commit the service to you. We ask that you be with us at this moment. Father, guide our lips and our minds that it may be focused on you at this moment. We ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. Amen. It's good to be in the house of God. Amen. How many appreciate brother Tim this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm Amen. Amen. I like those good old songs. Amen. Amen. They make you feel alive. It's not, you know, just some of those little songs that sometimes, but I like some of those good ones that just, you know, reminds us so much of what God has done for us through the ages. Amen. Why don't we open our Bibles this morning, Isaiah 53, a very familiar scripture reading. We'll read a little bit. We'll sit and then we'll continue on uh later on. Amen. It says, "Who had believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" How many can say me? &gt;&gt; Amen. I've believed the report. For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as the root out of the dry ground. He had no form, no comeliness. And when we shall see him, there's no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief. and we hid as it were our face from him. He was despised and we esteem him not. Surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrow. Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquity. The chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed. Father, we ask that you bless your word to us this morning. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen. God bless. You may have your seats this morning. I want to speak this morning and desiring to not be too long and desiring to just uh speak something that's been on my heart uh following the some of the services that we have heard from the brothers preach from our own pastor preach and and and just something has been in my heart um and especially for myself and I I believe the the really the first person you should preach to is yourself. And and this is just something that's been in my heart. I know Brother David preached on um uh faith in our dying, faith in death and in our death and and taking side with Jesus. We we heard that. I listened to the tapes and he made some comment. Uh then uh uh uh brother Benoya came and preached uh being Jesus to somebody. Amen. And then brother Paul last Wednesday they preached on being members of the family and the benefit of being part of the family. And then just just been on my heart and and I believe the best way as Christians to do is to always apply the word to yourself and and and desire to be a better Christian. desire that how we can best apply the word to oursel not to other people ourselves first because I believe you know Barbana will say many times God only need one person it only takes one person to be on fire it only takes one person to actually be changed to affect the others so when we hear we apply it to ourselves so we be the one that would first be changed so that change can also be applied or viewed food uh by others or even desired by others. So I was reading this and we didn't read the whole scripture uh but we'll read it in a moment. Um uh Isaiah 53 but Brandham uses this scripture to preach a message called the masterpiece. The identify masterpiece is where actually I get my inspiration from. And what I want to title this is uh the uh God bringing forth his masterpiece image and also uh God's process of building his masterpiece. I I I would just try to uh spend a little more time on the actual process because I believe uh even in looking at it from what we have heard I believe this will be very helpful uh to us as a as a group as a body even as an individual to to apply in our own life. So we find out that we what we call we are called in this end time brother will say that we are called to be uh God's image projected to this generation. We are called to be God's image. We are called uh to be the very thoughts of God manifested for the generation that we are living in. That's the message of the hour. Uh that's what we believe and and that's the promise for this age. And there is no other promises. The promises of this age is that Jesus will be manifested to a group of people even as we sing the song that come from east and west. That God will gather up a people for his own name's sake. That he will manifest himself to that people. The same way he did with the Jews, he will do with the Gentile. If you go read the history of the Bible, there's never I've always been amazed how that the Jews uh the how that they anchor the desire and everything about them was for the coming of the Messiah. Uh it didn't matter what condition they found theel themselves in. You can go from Genesis all the way to the end. They always believe in the promise of Messiah. You can go through the Jews and you can go even through the very Samaritan. Regardless of what was happening, whether they were in bondage, whether they were in Egypt, they knew that there was a promise of the Messiah to come someday. And I believe that same promise has been made to us by the New Testament that we shall also receive the promise of the Messiah in this age. And I believe God has made himself known unto us like never before in the generation that we are living in. So we are called, we can certainly say we are called, we are called to be the elected chosen bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. And we are called to be out of the world and into the bright age. That's the message of the hour. And the reason for that is because the prophet don't want us to be those that will wonder not know what time you're living in, what generation you're living in, what is your message for your hour because that becomes important because it's the only thing that God will accept. &gt;&gt; It becomes the only way in. Everything else becomes just a noise or a way to have a good time. And the only way in it becomes the provided way for your age that you are living in. And uh and and we can say the scripture will speak in uh Ephesians 2 and 10. It says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works that which is uh which God had for ordained that we should walk in them. Now I want to say this as the scripture says we are created. We are his workmanship. Even as we gather here we'll believe with all of our hearts that we are God's creation. &gt;&gt; We are created for the workmanship of God and not of the devil. &gt;&gt; That's our identification in the hour that we are living in. I have been created to praise God. I have been created to be a Christian. I have been created to live a life that's pleasing to the one who created me. I've not been created to be an instrument to the devil. I've not been created to dwell in sin day in and day out and do the things of the world and not be satisfied. My satisfaction is that I have been created by God and for God. &gt;&gt; We we we need to have that understanding every day when we wake up. I am a Christian because God created me. In fact, not just even Christian. I am alive. I am an individual created by the power of God to serve God. &gt;&gt; Not to serve the devil. Not to take my life and use it for things that are of no value. But so that when all is said and done, I'm living a Christian life in my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says in Peter uh uh 1 Peter 2:9, it says, "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people." You are not created to be like everybody else. &gt;&gt; You need to embrace that. You are not created to be like the world. You are created to be different. And God created you to be different so that in your difference you will worship him in the way that you are. Oh, like brother Tim said, "Oh, I don't have a good voice." God wants to hear your voice. Whether it's good or not, he created you. He's the one that gave you that voice. He wants to hear it. But if you would shut down your voice because another one is better, then you are failing the mission that God created you. and whatever manner of God means you. That's why I was saying I was telling brother David the other day. I said, "Oh my, if God made me, if I had the ability to shout and jump and and jump on this pulpit, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; If God created me to be that way, I'll be what God created me to be. I don't want to be ashamed because I'm around people to act in a manner that I was not created. I want to be free. I want to be free in the presence of God or wherever I find myself to express exactly what God called me to be. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I one one thing I love about our pastor even our gathering we such a gathering of so many different places &gt;&gt; and and we've always cultivated the the the the culture the atmosphere that it doesn't matter what language you speak where you come from that you should feel free in the presence of the Lord not to feel like well I have to act like the other one but whatever you are whatever God made you wherever you come from in your own tongue, in your own language, in your own culture, you will praise him for the glory of what he's done for you. &gt;&gt; United together for the purpose, one purpose and that is to worship him. &gt;&gt; So we find out that as we speak, we we we have a goal. We know what we are here for. So when in this message but when I'm we'll speak about the masterpiece. Now the very definition of a masterpiece is a work and an outstanding artistry or a skill or a workmanship. It's a when you look at at something and and you see the details. You know, many times you'll see painting and and those that know how to appreciate it will look at the stroke and the thing around it and just know, oh, this is so beautiful and everything and within it it has the very uh character and nature of the artist that painted it, you can look and see and people that knows art and and some of us can look at it, we don't see anything. But yet it's a masterpiece because the and the only way you can learn to appreciate it is to get into the the understanding of the art and know the understanding of the one that painted it for you to become appreciative of it. &gt;&gt; But what I'm will make a statement in it in this and it will say that the trouble with us is sometimes that our very definition of masterpiece is completely opposite with what God will call a masterpiece. when when we think even what the the scripture speaks about uh uh what we are to be even as I said this morning we'll find out that uh h understanding sometimes is oh we ought to be uh this glamour and greatness and oh we we ought to be the final voice to the final church and and in our minds we will uh somehow paint even an image that doesn't necessarily exist and we'll think about uh uh uh as just a situation where every time we open our mouth and we just speak the word and things happen everywhere along the way or we'll just uh uh call things that are not as though they were even though that's true but we we forget to understand within what framework God is trying to bring that masterpiece I &gt;&gt; and he's warning us because we we if we are not careful we take the promises we run ahead of God we build our own imagery And we don't see that happen and we get discouraged. But let me say this, God has never been left without a witness. When God gives his word, God is on interpreter. He brings forth the interpretation so you would know what is it that you need to look after or to look for. &gt;&gt; So when God definition of the masterpiece comes is very precise on what is supposed to do or what is supposed to be. So and and the the scripture will tell us even that here we are it says that what God call great men calls foolish. What God call great men call foolish. And it will say that God will even use the simple things to confound the wise. Why is it that way? Because God didn't want us to have the understanding even of what we will to be by some type of intellectual understanding. But it's by revelation and the revelation of understanding that God pattern never breaks from revelation all from Genesis all the way to Revelation that is always the same. We can look at what happened in the past and see that it's the same God walking along with us. He doesn't want us to have some type of denominational understanding of these promises, but he want to quicken it by revelation so we can come into the understanding of what he says. In 1 Corinthians 1:27 it say but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things not the strong things but the weak things of the world to confound the things that which are which are mighty. So what we call great God call foolish. So we we that's why it's important that our definition of the masterpiece or or our definition of what we ought to be is derived from the scripture by revelation and not our own interpretation of what's been said. When you look at it, even as we read in Isaiah 53, God now is trying to define the very masterpiece that he wants to create. He said he had no form, no comeliness that when we see him, there's no beauty that we should desire him. Amen. &gt;&gt; When when you when the image when God now is building his own masterpiece, when he's now giving you what this image of this masterpiece is, he's saying that there won't be any beauty that you should desire him. He's saying that he's despised and rejected of men. He's a man of sorrow. He's acquainted with grief. And it says and we uh as it it were we hid our face from him. He was despised and esteem we esteem him not. Surely he has borne our grieavves and carried our sorrow. And yet we esteemed him stricken. Oh smitten of God. How many times you go back in the Old Testament and you you read the story of Job and others. They looked at him the very masterpiece of God that God was building and men looked at him and said you are a sacred sinner you must have done something wrong that's why God rejected why their imagery of what the masterpiece was to be was completely wrong was derived from their own intellectual understanding and not from God's pattern of the scripture he says he was wounded for our transgression I love this He was bruised for our iniquity. The chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed. It says all we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all. So the masterpiece God takes what you did wrong and delays upon him. The masterpiece is one that can take the the pain of others, what what others have done wrong, where they need to be accused and die, and yet he produces life out of it. One that will take and and and the situation, he didn't do any wrong. He's the only one who had the right kid to condemn, but yet he was the one that was stricken &gt;&gt; for us all. And then it will say, "And he was oppressed." He was oppressed and and he was afflicted and yet he opened not his mouth. He says he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and the sheep before her shear as a dumb. He opened not his mouth. He says he was taken from prison and from judgment and he and and who shall declare his generation. Let me say this. He was not the only one because here God is promising that who is going to declare the generation of such man. The generation of a people that desire to take what the word of God said there would be. The one that will take the pain of others and take it away. The one that will look at a situation and and try to bring peace into it. The one that will look and and even though they are not wrong, they would accept to take the sin of others so they can p purge them. Those that could be like brother Benoa said Jesus to the others. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. There is such a generation he promised they will come. &gt;&gt; Why? Because if the same spirit that was in Jesus is also in you, it will also quicken your mortal body. It will produce the same works that he did. It will produce the same generation in the time that we are living in. &gt;&gt; That's the that's the masterpiece that we are talking about. &gt;&gt; He said he was cut off out of the land of the living for transgression of my people and it was shricken. He says he was he he has made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no no e no no no no no violence neither shall he deceive neither there is deceive in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruce him he had put him to grieve when now shall make his soul an offering to sin he shall see I said and he shall see his seed and shall prolong in days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. But what I'm said in a message smearing a church age says what why does God why does God stand by? It says the reason is in Romans 8:17. He says, "And if a children then heir of God and join air." So now he he's talking about uh what actually what it takes to bring you to a place where you are actually in the position where you can rule. What it will take for you to become this masterpiece that can actually be put to work. So now he's talking and it says, "And if so be it that we suffer with him while we may be so also glorified with him. For I reckon that the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us. Unless we suffer with him, we cannot reign with him." Amen. &gt;&gt; But I say so people we have designed a Christianity in the end time that is void of every trial that's void of every suffering. Our our picture of being the bride Christ is that we just speak the word and it happens to come and if we speak it takes two seconds to come that means he didn't answer. We we there's no suffering at all. There's no commitment. There's no perseverance. and and and said that's not even the image of the original. The original is built with resistance. &gt;&gt; We we we become those uh we pray two seconds if it doesn't come we go on praying onto somebody else and we pray and all of the sudden if something happened we don't even know if it's God or if it's not God that gave it to us. Why? Because that was not part of the original. That's not how the masterpiece was built. &gt;&gt; That's right. And &gt;&gt; and I want to say this, it's very important. That's not how the masterpiece is built. The masterpiece is built in suffering. The masterpiece is is built in waiting. The masterpiece is built in perseverance. That if God said it, I'm not going to move until it happens. If God said, I'm not going anywhere until it happens. If God promised to change my life, I'm not going anywhere until I see that change. &gt;&gt; Now, the the the challenge of it, and we'll get to it, is we we can't stand still long enough. God don't want you to move to and fro. He wants you to stand upon his word and don't move. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you just remember that, I'll repeat that in a moment again. He wants you to stand still and don't move. Don't move until he makes it happen. &gt;&gt; We we were talking with the brothers. We watched the videos of of the deep call unto the deep. We saw him here. The prophet, he knew that he had a promise. God told him that you go through this that I will come. And he stood there for about an hour and a half &gt;&gt; just talking and wondering and and you can feel the atmosphere in the room just getting very tense and maybe people wondering when is this going to happen? What's going on? But he stood there. He didn't make up anything. He continued to just talk and talk and talk and he said perhaps if I done something wrong forgive me. Perhaps I said something to grieve him. And all of the sudden he came. My brother, my sister, he's not going to come if you keep moving back and forth. He wants you to stand firm like the saints of all to say, "I'll stand here until the Lord does it." &gt;&gt; That's how character is built. &gt;&gt; Character is not built in somebody two minutes here, two minutes over there, but one that can stand for the results, stand there until it comes to pass. So when we see this characteristics of this masterpiece and he was only interested in one thing. What what is the father desire for my life? What is it that the father actually desire for me to bring out of my life? He but the scripture says that he did nothing except what the father showed him. He was in but one of them said one place he said he was so one with the word until he became the word. Now we understand at another place he said it was the word but I thought it was so important that he says that because that's where we come here. We can become one with what was spoken until we become that which was spoken. We can be so one with this word of God, with the promises of our time until we become that very word that was spoken coming to pass. &gt;&gt; He He did nothing and his desire was to please the father. He had no agenda of his own. He he didn't care about what people were going to think about him. He didn't care. He was not in the business of pleasing people. He was in the business of doing one thing alone and that was to be about the father's business. When you go read this, but when I'm talks about where the inspiration of this message came from and he was to go um he said uh that he never meet uh this lady um um uh Amy Simple McFerson. They said they actually never met her and that uh he knew his son and he had preached there and so he was down and he heard about and he was you know just thanking God for her life and they took her to the place is called Forest Lawn. I've actually visited the head of the opportunity to go visit that place. And so when you get in, you actually see the very statue that that that statue that talks about the Moses statue that Brennanom uses for the inspiration. And if you go, you'll see that statue of Moses that that he's talking about. He will talk about the story of Michelangelo, how that he was uh he was there, he got inspired to build Moses statue and then he came and he took a a a piece of marble and he took and he he build it and he build it and the the the the story goes that he was so inspired that statue were built by so much inspiration until when he was done he he took a a hammer and he struck it on the knee and he said speak Why? Because he was it was so real to him what he did. It was so real and he was surprised. He he he actually so was so real to him that he expected that statue to speak and move. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's where the inspiration came from. And he said when I heard it, I stood there. He said I walked away a little bit and then my mind just started going. And and I just want for the sake of illustration, ver if you could just come up for a moment. Yeah. So I want you to just picture this with me for a moment. Like I said, I don't want to be too long this morning. So there and and and and the prophet uses it to illustrate what God was doing. Now, the first thing I want you to realize is the inspiration was not the block's inspiration. It was Michelangelo inspiration. &gt;&gt; And but one of them said he didn't even write it on the paper. He said he had that image in his mind for years. &gt;&gt; For years. He knew what he wanted at the end. So, I want you to picture me as Michelangelo and my brother here as the block. And in the sense of God, I am the one with the inspiration. And this is the block that has to become the image. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to realize that it's very important that even if he knew what I was bringing him into, he couldn't bring that himself. &gt;&gt; You with me this morning? Don't I? And I I said I'm not going to be long, so let's just write together. Let's all get together so we can get to it really fast. He cannot I can tell him that within you there is an image of my of Moses. Within you there is the image of the bride. He in himself he has no power to bring that image to come to pass. He needed Michelangelo to bring that that image to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? So the same way we are sitting here a preacher can tell you that you are a son of God. You were elected before the foundation of the world. You were with God in the beginning. I cannot make that image come to pass. God has to make that image come to pass to you. You have to receive and believe the inspiration that in this generation we have received a man who had the mind of God, the original image of what God wants to do. And let me say this, if that inspiration fall upon Picasso or upon uh uh uh Dainci or some that it was never going to produce the same image. &gt;&gt; The image was to come by one messenger, by one person, the one who was inspired by God to bring a bride in the same time. Not a preacher, not a pastor, but one messenger for this generation to bring forth the image of the bride. And let me say this, that's the only image God will accept. &gt;&gt; No other image. You can build your own image. It's not acceptable. You can build your own religion. It's not acceptable. What you need is the message of the hour. What you need is to understand that God in this generation provided a way for you to get out of here. &gt;&gt; Now, so I want you to imagine this as just a block of of marble standing here in front and it's not helpful for this block to be moving away from me. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? This block moving and shifting away from me will not produce the image. This block need to trust me that by the word by the instruments that I've been given that I can bring out of it the image that it needs to be. It's not helpful if we don't trust or eat the message. It's never if you don't eat the message, you can't produce the image. The &gt;&gt; the words of a preacher are not enough. &gt;&gt; The word of a pastor are not enough. You got to hit the message yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We get criticized for playing tapes. That's wonderful. But guess what? That voice is inspired to bring you into the image. So this block it will stand and it will taste and I love it. It says for years not it it didn't it's not an overnight job. &gt;&gt; It's not a twominute job. And it it it takes time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It takes effort. &gt;&gt; It takes dying. It takes committing to the Jesus it day in and day out for you to come into that masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Today we feel like oh but praise God I'm saved but says the new birth is only the beginning. &gt;&gt; God is trying I'm sorry. I hope it's okay. Yeah. Sorry. He's trying to build you in the statue of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Now what he said that is the seed that's in you, you you don't need anything from outside. It will push out of its own self all the virtues that are needed. But for it to push out, you need to be drinking. &gt;&gt; Because remember he talked about the farmer when the seed is in the ground you don't go pull the seed out and look is it ready? Is it not ready? No, it's just a process of pouring water day in and day out. It's just a process of that process alone. That's why I said God has a method to do things. You just keep drinking. Let me say this. You don't need even need the change to be a parent to yourself. You just stay there with sincerity. Let me say this. God will make the change. Amen. &gt;&gt; We We don't There's no such thing as overnight Christian. You need time. &gt;&gt; In the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, my brother, my sister, it gets wonderful. It gets beautiful. Day in and day out, they will work on you. And all of the sudden, the things that seem to have been very hard will start to fall away one by one. But it cannot happen if you keep shifting. If today you here, tomorrow you over there, no commitment to the cause, nothing. No, we need to be as a blood that stands right there and say, "Lord, here I am. I am willing to die." Now, so the image was in Michelangelo and here he is looking at the block and he's looking and and he takes and he picks a predestinated block for him to sit it in front of him. And the method by which he's going to bring it, he had an a hammer and a chisel. So out of the block, he's taking the block and it's chopping away or chipping away every portion of that block that never was part of the original image. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So now you cannot know, you can cry out and say, "Oh, I want this." You can't remove it yourself. You need the one that has the original image to chop it away from you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to be changed. Come to the one who knows the change that you need. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we write our own prescription. Brother Tim, I need this. I No, you just go to him. He knows what you need. &gt;&gt; So he he he takes it. It's very important. The obligation of the block is to remain still. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The obligation of the block is to not move and to trust that the one who's doing the chipping has the image that needs to be brought out. &gt;&gt; Thank you if you go. Thank you very much. So it's very important that we have that within our mind when we come to church. I I don't come with some preconceived I I just come and say Lord I know you you have a portion today that you want to do. Lord I do I have needs. Yes, I lay before you. You know my heart desire. You know my deeds. But I have to trust the process that the Lord will chip it away from me one by one by me standing in front of him. So when you stand there, when the word of God is being preached, it's God chipping away all the parts of you that's never part of the original. He's forming you into this image of the perfect church, into the image of the perfect bride, into the image that he desired for you to be. &gt;&gt; That's the process. It's the dying out. It's the chipping away of the things of the world. It's him doing the work that he promised. Only him has the original image of what he's trying to bring out. &gt;&gt; Now let me ask you a question. Now when it's important, this is very imperative that what we say we are matches what we do. We and this is uh let me just speak to myself. There's so many claims we f we say we are but yet our life fell so short of those things. &gt;&gt; There's so many things we claim oh I'm this or I'm that but yet when we look at our lives we we we have such a deficiency in whatever we claim we are. My brother say, "So what you need is to come into the presence of the one that has the image. &gt;&gt; What we need is to come into the presence of the one that has the image and say, "Lord, I I know you called me to be a bride. I know you call me to be all those things. But one thing I know is within my own self, I cannot bring that image out of myself. Whether I want whether whatever I do, I will never come into the image by myself. I need you to perform a work on me to remove the things of the world so that I can become into the image that you call me to be. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we fail to understand the very process by which he's bringing us. So it it comes and and it's dying out and it's him and shaping the part and removing all the part that were not part of the original him doing the work. And says this in paragraph 64 of the uh sorry 51 of the identify m masterpiece. He says let us turn our thoughts. It says uh thoughts from Michelangelo, this great sculptor to the mighty God who in the beginning before there was a day and dawn and before there was an atom or molecule, God in his mind had a man had a man what a man should be like, should look like, what he should be, and how or what he should act like. Now I that's the key. I wouldn't even know how to act &gt;&gt; until I know what the image supposed to be. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't even know what to do. And what we do most of the time is we run and do our own action. No, my brother, my sister, the gospel of the Lord Jesus tells you how to act. It tells you what to do. It tells you what you are. Why? because it's that which has been given to mold you into the image. &gt;&gt; But what speaks and and and let me just run for the sake of time. He said that the first family God gave them he placed them behind the word of God for their protection. And he says another place he says the word of God was their strength. The word of God was the uh uh the uh uh uh uh whatever gave them everything that they needed in order for them to be protected. &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, we have taken this word of God and we come to church and like oh there we goes again and oh I don't have to dress like this and oh I don't have to do that. It becomes almost like a burden. Oh I I don't have to talk like this. My brother, my sister, you failing to understand the goal. &gt;&gt; When we do that, we are failing to understand the goal. The devil, your image that the devil has is the image that's been given to you by your parents. &gt;&gt; But your true original image of what you're supposed to be, it comes from the word and it comes from God. And when you come to God, when he's telling you, "Don't do this, don't do that," it's not God trying to cause you to suffer. It's God trying to bring you in the image of what you were actually supposed to be from the beginning. It's not a condemnation. It's not some type of rule. It's liberty so you can become what you're really supposed to be. Let me say this. Drinking, smoking, and all those things will only bring heartache. But being a Christian will bring happiness. &gt;&gt; My question is which one brings you happiness? Does drinking bring you happiness? Then go do it. &gt;&gt; If you really drink and become very happy, I'll say go do it. &gt;&gt; But if you go drink and become miserable, then you read the remedy this morning. Then what you need is God this morning. You need to come and drink from his fountain because he will bring you into what he calls you to be. We I wonder when we look at ourselves this morning and me included, we look at the way we dress. My question for you is where did you get that image from? &gt;&gt; Because that image either came from God &gt;&gt; or it came from the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not a thought generator. You got it from someplace. You either by being influenced by God or you influenced by the devil. When we look at ourselves daily when we go to purchase our clothes and and it used to be just the sisters, but now it's the brothers, you know, pants are too tight and you sit down and the socks are showing off and and the the jacket is like you took your little brother jacket on. What's going on? the the way you dress, you are emulating somebody. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that's just you. You got it from somebody. &gt;&gt; And my question is, is it God or is it the devil? &gt;&gt; The way we treat one another, &gt;&gt; where did we get that from? My brother, my sister, the scripture says we need to provoke one another to godliness. &gt;&gt; We need to provoke one another in the things of God. We need to love one another. We need to follow the scripture way of doing things. &gt;&gt; We We don't need to have little group. Oh, this is my group and that's your group and that's one group. I my brother I I'm just here. I hope this is helpful. I'm just trying to help even my own self. We need that every part of the masterpiece, let me say this, is here to play a role. &gt;&gt; God didn't place you here so you could just come to church and go out and come and go out. No, you are part of this body to play a role to influence somebody. Whether you know it or you don't know it, your life is influencing somebody. Where do we get it from? &gt;&gt; We have concerts. Our weddings have become like parties. &gt;&gt; Nightclub. I mean, it's the same as going to a nightclub. So, so we don't do we don't go to the nightclub. You understand, brother Tim? But we can create another version that is similar to where we let out our steam. &gt;&gt; We we we we don't want to look like we are copying. We just need to create something that's similar that we will call Christians. &gt;&gt; What is our image? Where did you get the image from? &gt;&gt; You either are his image &gt;&gt; or you are somebody else's image. &gt;&gt; And I'm trying to help myself. Let me say this. Just because we and I don't care. We could be from the same place or the same country or whatever. But don't associate to do something that's not Christian. &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Oh, just because we're from Congo, we from Mexico, we're from America." No, you are here as the Christian, a chosen people, a call out people. When we act, we act as Christians. [Music] And that's the one that came directly from the message of the hour. The only one that has been presented to us as the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; We were fellowshipping and you know often time we talk so much about brother Brandham's ministry but so much about his life we can learn about the things which he was doing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How many people he was even helping without people knowing. How many times he did things that he never even made it public. How many times he did things that he never even mention it &gt;&gt; that everything that he did he did for the good of the body. He Let me say this and and you may hate me for this brother Brham. He's our masterpiece in the end time. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's the one to make our example. That's the one to look to to follow after. If you need a physical, remember God is was an invisible God. The children of Israel knew him by the body of Jesus Christ. He who was hidden him who was in the scripture says the invisible God made himself visible in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. When they saw him, they knew what God was. You wouldn't know who God was unless you saw Jesus Christ. Everything else it was just scriptures and understanding and prescription and the things of which they know. But their true understanding came when it was manifested in the physical body before them. And we in this generation we have had the opportunity or see a receive with one who came into that position with the manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ in the human body. What did he do? We hear so many times, oh, but couldn't be here and he was called away and everything right there is said, oh, but I couldn't do that. If I do that, I'll hurt the brother's ministry. Nobody will believe him. The masterpiece is to take the sickness and bring healing. To take the wrong and make it right is to bridge the gap. The barbam says it was a go between between men and God. He had the right butam says he had the right to marry. He had the right to have a family. is the masterpiece image is to lay down your right &gt;&gt; so you could be used of him &gt;&gt; in the way that he desire for us to be. &gt;&gt; The masterpiece is when we come to a place where it's not about us. &gt;&gt; It's not about anything we can do but it's about him coming and using each one of you young, old, no matter what age you are. God is here to bring you into that masterpiece. But whenam says you could be a wash woman, whatever you are. It doesn't matter what you do as a job. God wants to use you as a masterpiece where you are. &gt;&gt; If we can only have that understanding. He doesn't want we we need when when you wake up in the morning, pay attention to the image you are projecting. Is it Christ's image or is it the world's image? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you when you choose what you should listen to, what how you should reinact or even in our conversation. If somebody's bringing negative things, stop it. &gt;&gt; Don't continue it. &gt;&gt; Say that I'm not here to bring negativity. I'm not here to share the the the this one that and this that. I'm here so I not another person. I can be the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; If you don't want to be a masterpiece, that's your business. I want to be the masterpiece. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He says remember there's only one form of eternal life. &gt;&gt; It says and even our name and our thoughts where did uh where we were were with God before the beginning of the before there was a foundation of the world because we were we were possessed. We were we were possessed of eternal life. Eternal we possess eternal life. And to be that we have to be part of God. And then it says so you would have to be as much as in his thought cuz we have eternal life and was predestinated to this life and our names were put in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world according to the revelation. Now it says God has us in his thinking. We and then we have eternal life because then he spoke to us. He spoke us and we came into existence. And a word is a thought expressed. A thought manifested rather. God had us in the beginning in his thoughts. Amen. &gt;&gt; So your life as you're sitting here this morning &gt;&gt; is a manifestation of somebody's thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the manifestation of God's thought. And the way for us to completely come into that thought is to let the one with the inspiration work upon us so we can manifest the true image of what that inspiration was. He said as it says man, it says now man, he says now when a man when Adam first a man was how perfect he was, he looked like God and he says and the great Holy Spirit I love this. The great Holy Spirit brooding over the earth. Now I want you to go when you go look at this word brooding biblically speaking it says it refers to a protective nature or a creative work of the Holy Spirit much like a bird hovering over the nest to bring forth new life. So, so I if I could just put for I want you God with a thought brooding over his own seed so that the thoughts that he had will be made into life. &gt;&gt; That was the original process of creation. It was God brooding over his own seed by the Holy Spirit bringing it to come to pass. You cannot bring the image outside of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; In fact, let me say this. The confusion comes is when we take our carnal minds and we try to interpret what the scripture says. &gt;&gt; But that's why there's the need for the new birth. Because what the new birth does to a Christian is it takes away the carnal mind and it gives you the mind of God. The scripture says this, a conno mind cannot understand the spiritual things because these two things are contrary. in order for you to understand even what the new birth is or what the word of God is is to come into the nature of that word and let that word now be revealed to you because at that time you will have the same mind that was also in Christ like a bird come out maybe an animal at different things trying to look for time. Keep coming more and more into the foam and was brooding until finally they came up a species just exactly like the one who was doing the brooding. &gt;&gt; God looking himself directly straight at Adam and seeing himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what Banam said? This message is to bring us right back in that same condition. &gt;&gt; This is message. This message is not so we can get the Holy Spirit. No, it's to he says we are today the same way that Adam was making our choices today. Do we want to be that image or do we want to be something else? We today this morning we are making our choices. We are faced with the same exact question that Adam was faced. Will we believe the word of God or will we take what the enemy is offering? Because he says it's the two kingdoms that are running. The devil and Holy Spirit is here to inspire his people. And God's Holy Spirit is here so he can also inspire his people until after he came. Exactly. One that was in the doing in the image of the one that was doing the birding. It says God God or man was made in the image of God. Then he placed him in the great garden like Michelangelo placed his great work. He says and all the great sculptor God placed his handiwork in the garden of Eden made him and help made help with the complete satisfaction. He was to God till even he rested. It was just it was just it says it was just a rest. His work had been finished. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says in another place it says it says man man in the beginning he was made man in is it says man is a god. He's absolutely a god. This is in the message the uncertain uh um uncertain sound. Absolutely a god. He was made in the image of God, being a son of God. And he's the heir of all things that that that God is. And man was given a a a domain. And the domain was the earth. He have power. You have power over the fish, over the fouls, of the air, over everything. He could just speak and everything obeyed him because he was God. He was God within himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not universal God. But I mean the God of heaven and earth. And let me ask this morning, what what is our deepest desire when we come to church or within our own lives? If we don't desire, if we don't strive to become this masterpiece, then what is it that we desire? &gt;&gt; If we don't strive that that we can work within the midst of where God has placed us, let me ask this. What work are we going to present when all is said and done? Is it the houses we've built? Is it the the the places we've visited? The work that we were placed here to do is God's work. It's God's work within our own families. It's God's work within our workplaces. It's God's work within the framework of the church. We are all here. But says, we are all made to be different so that God can use that difference to manifest himself. &gt;&gt; However different you find yourself, God didn't make you so you can fit into the world. He make you so you don't fit in. And the reason you don't fit in because you have another place &gt;&gt; is not so you can cut yourself up and and trying to just make things happen. No, he made you that way so you don't fit because he has a place that he has prepared for you. But one says the trouble with Israel was that they were made to be a different nation, but yet they wanted to be like all the other nation. They wanted a king like everybody else. They wanted the music like everybody else. They wanted everything like everybody else. They wanted to prosper. They wanted they they didn't want when people looked at them and looked at the other nation to see the difference that God wanted them to have. My brother, my sister, that will lead to death. &gt;&gt; The only way we can prosper is by remaining what God called us to be &gt;&gt; and be happy about it. &gt;&gt; When you are called weird, rejoice. &gt;&gt; Oh, that guy's weird. Praise God. That guy is crazy. Praise God. There's no value in imitation. &gt;&gt; There's no value in being somebody else because that's a limited version. There's a version of you that's more powerful and that's what God has made you. &gt;&gt; If the musician could come But when I'm talking in this message, it will talk about there was an instrument that was being sold at an auction &gt;&gt; and they called out for the price and said, "If I could just say $5. Nobody was interested. They went down $4, $3, $2. Nobody's interested. I said, "Then an old man walked up and he took that old instrument and he dusted it off and &gt;&gt; and he took it and he began to play. And as he began to play, it was by the sound of it Amen. &gt;&gt; It was by the life that came out of the instrument the value began to raise. &gt;&gt; $100, 200, 300. People were beating for it. Why? Because now they recognize the value that was locked into the instrument. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can only recognize the value in you by letting God play your instrument. [Applause] The only one who can interpret your life &gt;&gt; is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If you let somebody else interpret your life, they will bring down your value. But if you let God interpret your life, your value will go up. Why? Because he's the one who created the instrument and he knows what the instrument's supposed to sound like. Let's all stand this morning. &gt;&gt; That's our desire this morning. We want to be that. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm reminded by the old mechanic and this young man is there with a car and he opened the book. He replaced all the parts that he knew and he did this and he did that and it still wouldn't work. He stood there confounded. What do I do? And I feel like that's what we do with our lives. Oh Lord, I want this to take away from me. I want this to take away from me. My brother, my sister, I tell you, we all have a long list of stuff we want taken out. But my question this morning is, why don't you go to the master and let him order those things? Perhaps what you think you need to taken out, it's something that you really need in order for you to do something. Paul said, "I want this to be taken away from me. I I pray I pray to the Lord twice and I want this taken away." He came and he said, "My grace is sufficient." And I'm not talking about sin this morning. I'm talking about perhaps what we have in our minds as what we need to be is contrary to his will. Oh Lord, I want to be this. I want that job. I want to go here. I want No. what we need is to surrender to him and let him lead us. So this young mechanic put all and he was almost tired and just looking and butam said and then the man came dressed in the suit and he looked at him and he said oh what's going on and said well you know the book says to do this and the book says to do this and I follow the book to the letter and it's not happening and and and all of the things I did all that I know I cried out to the Lord oh Lord oh Lord and it wouldn't happen. He said, "Okay, wh why don't you touch and tighten up over there a little bit?" That looked very strange. He could have said, "No, that's not going to work." But you know what? He had done all that he could and he couldn't fix himself. He done all that he could and it didn't work. Why not take the advice of this one? Even though he didn't know him, he said, "Okay, I'll do that." And then he said, "Well, yeah, then go ahead and tighten up the other one over there. Go ahead and tight." And it says, "Okay, go ahead and start." He started it and then the car started. Why? Because he was the engineer, the inventor of the very engine and only him knew how it's supposed to work. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, we have such an opportunity. We come here to church, we hear the word of God, and that's the inventor of your soul. And that's the one who knows how you're supposed to function, not you yourself. He knows the way. He knows what you have need of. He put you in that difficulty so you can learn something. He placed you in a threshing floor for a reason. He did it took you through all of that so you could have a testimony. Let me say this. When all is said and done, what is interested in that you may have a character that's fit to rule? [Music] No, we want glamour. We want greatness. We want everybody to pat us in the back. Good job. Oh, that's a mighty preacher. That's a mighty son of God. Whereas he was rejected. He was not thought of as even much. My brother, my sister, don't take your queue from the world. Don't take your queue from the people. Take your queue from your master. [Music] Let us be like that young man that was playing an instrument. It didn't matter when people were clapping or whatever was happening. He was only interested in one person and that's the guy sitting in the balcony. Why? Because the praises of men will lift you up but they will drop you down. But the praises of your master will give you strength for the journey. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't need a temporary fix. We need something permanent. We don't need to come and and and then get lifted up and then down and then up and then down. No, God brings the permanence. Something that lasts forever. Something whether it be in hell, wherever it is, it will stand. Like David, it will say, "If I go down in hell, be all thou art dare. [Music] the ruggedness that was part of the characteristics of the masterpiece. Let's not be just some happy golucky Christian and you know on the bed of ease. There were those that were burned. There were those that lay down the lies. There's those that were fed to the lions. There were those that throughout the ages, we can go throughout the dark ages and see all of them. There's those in this generation that lives in countries that are hunted because they are Christians. They're those that died that didn't even do anything wrong. [Music] It's not made to be easy. It's no, it's made for those that will stand and say, "Lord, don't matter whether it be good or bad, whether it be sunshine or rain, I will stand here until you do it." Those are the kind of people God is looking for. Is that your heart desire this morning? Say, "Lord, don't don't let me just, you know, something happen and then I fall down. Strengthen me. Let me be let me be a a a man and a woman of character. One one that can take a punch. One that can stand there. One that's not going to run away. One that actually desires to see the reality of God in the not just in my life in the life of all of us gather here that we may be here for one another. Those that will pray for one another. Those that will fast for one another. Those that when you hear somebody's hurt, your heart hurt. Not just, oh, as long as I'm good. You know, people use the new birth just to say, "Oh, praise God. I'm saved." No, that's not what it was given for. It was given so you can become a soldier to be placed on the on the field in the line of duty. Let's just bow our heads this morning. If you so heart desire, I I know I I probably didn't go the way I wanted to go, but I just fell in my heart to go the way I went. Amen. If your heart desire, just lift your hand out to him. Why don't you just pray within your own heart then ask him and say, "Lord, I lift my hands this morning." Even as brother Tim said, we broken we breaking gravity this morning. And we're crying out to you, Father. We desire that work of you that you promise will be done in our hearts. Amen. Your prophet told us that all that the seed needed to do in the end time was to lay in the presence of the son. That it was the responsibility of the son to bake all the grain out of it. It was the responsibility of the son to actually bring it into the maturity that he could become food at the master's table. Lord God, we know and we speak with sincerity of our hearts this morning. Lord, in the state that we are in, we cannot come into that maturity by our own self. Lord, we need you this morning. We need the Holy Spirit that spoke the word, Father, the same Holy Spirit to come and vindicate the word in our lives, Lord. That you take away the parts of us that's not yours and you chip away the worldliness and you chip away all the things of the world, Father, that we may walk into the perfect image of what you had for us in the beginning. We desire that and nothing more. Father, we want to be Jesus. We want to be those that would reflect the image of the master in the end time. Father, I pray that's our heart's desire. Father, if there be any sick among us and if there be any need with a little bit hand, Lord, may you just come by our way and speak to us and help us. We love you and we commit all that we are to you, Father. Receive us into your kingdom today. Father, let your grace and your mercy always accompany us. Father, let your word become a reality to each individual that we may claim for our own self that we have met the Lord Jesus Christ. We love you and we ask all of these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. Oh, pleasing. Oh, let me be pleasing to you. Let everything that I do be pleasing to you. Praise. [Music] Oh, I let everything I pursue be pleasing, oh Lord. If you desire prayer this morning, just come here and pray for you. Let's sing it again as brother Tim comes. Oh, I believe in you. Oh, you [Music] be pleasing to you. Praise. [Music] Let everything I praise you. Be pleasing, oh Lord, unto you. Amen. Man, I'm appreciative of the effort brother Billy put forward today. Amen. It's it's the very truth. And uh we know the truth shall set you free. Amen. it. May we all say as we leave here, it's good to be in the house of the Lord. Yes. Amen. Okay. Sorry. Pardon me.

So, we're thankful for that. Lord, gather us all together to the appropriate time. Lord, we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's continue to sing that as we go.
