to invite you to come amongst us once again lord and speak to our heart lord we're so grateful that you've shown us in this evil age how to overcome knowing that it's not in ourselves lord but that your word has come and it's exposed to the devil and revealed the son of perdition but in doing that you've revealed the son of man which is christ the hope of glory living in your brain and that's how we overcome is recognizing that you are greater because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world lord jesus as your prophet said and pointed out that you were able to recognize yourself in the word and have faith in who you were lord and so we can do the same thing because we've received a revealed word in this hour that has shown us that we are bone of your bone and we're flesh of your flesh and life of your life and power of your power lord then if you came and revealed those things to us then we can start to have faith in what you made us lord that we can do the greater works that we can speak to the mountain that we don't have to cry but we can speak the word lord that we're coming into the the manifestation of the sons of god and uh realizing who we really are in you lord what a great hour this is lord we're thankful that we sit right now in the realms where all things are possible because you've given us a faith to believe all things lord and you've

morning please pray for my daughter-in-law karen and she had a baby and was admitted back in the hospital in serious pain amen and if you have a need upon your heart just lift your hand up to him and

single one of them before we brought them before you and father we ask with confidence knowing father that you will fulfill our hearts desires and we pray for those that are sick says the clue he's a

father and that would have been my father's day message but that's what we're called to do to break chains not only our own chains but the chains that are out on other people amen sicknesses diseases mental problems amen you know i i don't want to revival amongst the bride i want a revival that comes from the bride you know what i mean when we start going out after those loved ones those impossible cases you know we're not looking to go on vacation you know what i mean we're looking to go to work i mean it's too early to retire amen i thought you know what i'll do is it's it's so hard to go to church on sunday evenings while we could just cancel sunday evenings you know we only have to go to church on wednesday and traffic's so bad wouldn't it be nice just come to church once a week and take the rest of the week off play basketball i want to be in the battle say why do you have service who knows the soul might walk in right something wonderful might happen so that's that's why we're here i like that to break every chain to break every chain all right now tonight is the test of our spirituality how many knows why the chicken walked across the street that's a riddle right to get to the other side right to avoid the fox i don't know but our brother told us tonight that there's riddles in the message so i want every i want my ear tuned you know because i know he's going to be setting me up you know what i mean but i i want to be right there so i can catch the word of god and listen to the word of god amen are you excited about the message that i am the riddles in the mess you didn't change yeah so he's gonna bait and switch but i i happen to know that he wouldn't say anything over the pulp that would be a lie so i think he's back to right where he was at before because he wouldn't tell us an untruth would he how many enjoy our brother's spirit amen in this message marvelous this is a man in another country that is has heard the message and the message didn't come to romania all in the purity that we got it there's people that brought it in there with all kinds of different spins and all kinds of different revelations that the message wasn't just presented as the message and let everybody get their conclusion but people already sowed seed explanations instead of sowing the message and our brothers laboring hard there to take all these different ideas and bring them back to the absolute back to the word that's on the tape that's in the books and and realize that you can be fed right there you don't need a middle man amen the word of god's for all of us so let's uh let's see you sing a pick a song for the brother maybe you know something stumped yet all right creating me a clean heart amen so let's sing this song as our brother comes tonight say lord let me let me catch the riddle tonight let me let me hear clean and clear what he's saying lord and speak to my heart i want to be moved on i want to be stimulated by the revelation of god's word amen [Music] within me [Music] me ah [Music] hey [Music] god [Music] yes let us bow our heads for a word of prayer gracious heavenly father we are so thankful that you play something in us to thirst and to have a desire for you for your world create us a new heart a heart of understanding perfect perfect love perfect perfect faith oh lord we are we are here for your glory for the purpose to heal to be encouraged by your spirit we commit the service in your hands and we are looking unto you look and we bless us and take every spirit under your control let's help us to say something to be an encouragement anoint let let you speak through me and listen to the people let it be let let us became one one in the same spirit you can be better worshipers to worship you in spirit and in truth now we ask you to come and break the world of life and let us see ourselves in the picture lord you shut the mouths of the lions in the in the den you can do it today for us to let us speak the truth the present truth we commit everything in your hand in jesus name and let the bride say amen revelation chapter 3 we don't have our own understanding we don't have our own revelation we are what we are because this message this message of the hour made us what we are revealed what we already have been and by he grace amen we soon we come to our perfection which is the redeeming of our bodies verse 21 to him that overcome i i will grant to sit with me in my throne every night also overcome and sat down with my father in his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches amen and one more scripture john chapter 21 i think verse 17 17. he says unto him in the third pool in the third time simon son of the dove lovers tell me peters was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovers told me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knows that i love thee jesus said unto him feed my sheep may the lord as the blessing of the living if you can take out our we can take our seeds amen thank you thank you so how can i overcome in this morning we we start our journey to point it to to find out to remember because everything what is for us necessary to step in another dimension we already received it in the form of a message a man of an hour so every all the inspiration we have it is only from this message and once you see the message all the rest became a filler once you see the message once you see you see not understand what once you see you always see and the rest will be a filler blessed be the name of the lord so we find out that the first step to overcome first of all the prophet said we must have a dream of god this is what he just said the light in you is god he knew this is the gene of god the gene of god in 1464 and 65 he intro the prophet used a terminology actually it is not us that we reinvent english the prophet did it because he has to create new words because this message is a new song so he has to create english words because we have a new song as this new song is the message of the hour can you say amen amen blessed be the name of the lord so in 64 the lord really wanted us to know before nobody nobody will speak about these things that there is a gene a gene god has a gene god has a seed it is not the seed of jesus it is jesus didn't had seed after natural his natural body but we are the seed seeds of christ amen seeds of christ sons of light sons of god we are living in the manifestation of the sons in the revelation of the sons we are not anymore in the pentecostal age that's finished since the opening of the world we have the world and the world world world only invisible union so we must have we must be we must it's also important for god to let us know to inform us that we are we have in our world of our hearts a gene coming from the pillar of fire club global tongues with your name written on it a cloven tongue with your name written on it you are a problem tongue you are a light apart because of the day of pentacles we just had pentecost was god dividing himself god dividing himself so first steps first thing that the the the message revealed to us making us aware is from the beginning you are an eagle you have never been another species because the species you cannot change that's why only only the seed of god can be rebirthed he didn't say born again he said reborn in order to be reborn have nothing to do with the flesh to be reborn is to be born again from this message we need to be reborn from this message spoken word is the original seed and there must be an or an original womb an eternal womb that can match hallelujah so first step that we find out that we are we have we contain a gene so every morning you can have a revival hallelujah so the same things we realize what we just find out from how can i overcome because this is in this coming of the lord in the bright form he came in a bright form in your form that should make us happy we are the most happiest people on earth because he's hiding against under skin [Music] i am happy on this that make me happy yeah so we then he said we must have his faith or his revelation maybe i can have proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 proverbs chapter 3 verse 5. this faith is not an intellectual faith trust in the lord with all your with all your gene so in the seed in the gene you have already because the faith is unconscious you not even know that you have it it was in the line when a sister came from the prophet to pray for ferrari says sister you are already here i didn't know that you have faith she didn't know because faith is unconscious it's not something that you produce it is not that i believe i believe i believe is right there hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so you we must have his revelation from your heart amen now we want to continue we want to continue this this evening with the third step this step because we know that the holy ghost baptist is not make you perfect it's just that is helping you to stay in the in the in the in the when he is working on you to stay in the trials to not divorce amen do not be disappointed when they show you how many mistakes are in the message it keeps you is helping you to continue till the end to be a martiro a martyr a witness hallelujah it is not you i mean it is his faith in you it is the holy ghost in you it is the holy ghost in me so so how can i overcome first you have to be a gene of god the second thing you have to have his faith not your face his face and you cannot produce it it is given to you it's already in the gene it only need to to let at the atmosphere to create an atmosphere in that atmosphere the faith comes now the third things the prophet said you we must receive his word it is not enough to be a dream of god and not enough to have his faith you need to do something to know also something you need to open your heart and make a full surrender you know he you we need to accept his word so i have a quote here because this is our our food we in the morning we left it here when jesus said when the prophet said he he has had faith with his power because because he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the world and then the most what is for us verse 65 in perfect faith he said therefore he relied upon what god had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what god make made us as believers he had faith in what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen so i am the code number five so we want to continue with with this code are you blessed in this evening amen because he blessed us now the only things we have to do then is to have and to have faith in what you are have fed faith in what the world says you are and jesus had faith in the word of god and he said that he was it is written of me so you can say in this evening it is freedom of me tell to somebody it is written of me it is written of me too didn't david in the psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him i am the bread of life that cometh from god out of heaven and the prophet said amen i am the tree of life from the garden of eden i am all these things i am that i am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed messiah and you we need we know with that perfect revelation that you are the messiah nights hallelujah the prophet said that we are the anointed messiah knight you are the anointed messiah you are the anointed messiah you are the messiah you are the anointed one of the because the word has anointed us and that the spirit of god was upon him he said now i in myself do nothing but is my faith in god and god was in hebrew the word made manifest and when the word of god comes in you here we are it's made manifest for you are a believer see and the believer are you ready is the face of god that moves in you hallelujah it is not my faith that is moving in me it is his faith hallelujah a super sense 59 in the morning he he preached about the super sign and in the evening in the evening message he preached a super sense paragraph 54 and we are grateful to god that we have the five senses not only these senses but we have the spirit senses by no means that was five senses given to you to guide you they were given to you for earthly contact but there was given to you it was given to you it was given to me it was say it was given to me let's make the message personal hallelujah the sixth sense and that sixth sense belongs only to the christians actually brother brown said if you in order that you believe the message of the hour you need the gift of faith good evening bride you have the gift of faith to if you believe this message is because you have a gift of revelation hallelujah somebody say praise the lord amen you cannot have these six or six cents until you become a christian is the only way that you ever can have any more than the five natural senses for a natural person but the sixth sense is better no to the christian as faith is the one that governs and guides you and it's superior i am happy to all other senses it's superior to all other senses five senses so first step you need to be a gene of god by his grace we are the second thing we we need to have his faith which coming by revelation the third things we need to accept his word now let me see the end time sign said but branham said and the people sit in the church and hear the messages of god and believe them and want accepted they wouldn't say well no i don't believe that's right some of them will come say and agree with it i believe it's right but you won't do it see you will die dying in the pews of the church because they won't accept the remedy actually the people when they come to church when they listen the message they come not to eat they come to filter so when you go to eat you are not filtering you go to eat when you listen to this message we don't filter anything we just absorb everything hallelujah we are not here to judge we are need to eat the book this message is not something that you have to let do it there it is there's somebody to prove me that this message is truth i thought the message don't need to be proven he's already proven [Music] this message is nothing but the truth and you know why because i believe it because you believe it is a deep calling to the deep hallelujah in order to see the third pull in manifestation we have to have the same attitude as heti the right one hath is the right one it is nothing but the truth you know it's the power of creation in you in each one you feel the prophet said is creative powers [Music] right hallelujah but the question is can you receive it do you believe it now here he is here well if he is here the only one thinks he keeps his word just believe that you receive it and accept it and rise up and say lord god i am here to accept it hallelujah now it comes the essence of it the flavor and by accepting then his word not by fasting not by praying not by good deeds and by accepting making a full surrender then his word brings life brings christ back in us not but coming at the altar not because i try to manipulate you sentiment sentimentally or to work you in such a way to tell you stories about grandma and some nice boy that he died in an accident or you know i don't i'm not here you know the only thing that you you will see results is to make a full surrender to accept it to make a clear-cut decision to say lord from this day all i will believe with all my heart these magics i will no doubt anymore and the holy spirit will come right there and you will be filled with the holy ghost and always the the holy ghost will guide you to the light nobody can deceive you anymore because the token that's right you know that the message is the blood yes now first you apply the blood and the token automatically come the token is the literal life of the law of jesus christ turn back in the believer that's why you are here christian life tabernacle in order to see that in manifestation we need to apply the message it's so simple the people like to come in the church and they say can you say it sermon brother david that we all cry here you know and you try to bring the music in and the people feel so nice it's so wonderful and then we go out and everybody does how what they want i i didn't supposed to say that huh yeah we are not a you know sandy message believer we need to apply the message every day in our relationship in our thinking in our businesses in everything and the holy spirit which just fell fresh upon you how do you know about the gabriel because i did i i went to it i was a good pentecostal i spoke in tongues i still speak in tongues i had visions i had manifestation i was floating in the air but i had the holy ghost only over my spirit but one day i heard i was listening to the mark of the beast it was 12 o'clock in the night in the midnight and i i stood up on my feet i said from this day on i will accept the doctrine the teaching of this man and i make a full surrender when i did that the holy spirit changed my soul since that day on so i know what it means the holy ghost baptist without sensation not too many people are happy to hear that but the only things that kept me on track the only things that kept me away from all the compromises not for sale you know why because i made the full surrender and the message took over my life oh hallelujah by accepting then his word brings life brings christ back in us brothers is so simple why i should make it more complicated why i should have a church spirit over me instead to have the holy ghost why i should not be enough sincere to realize that you are not my property you are not my sheep you are his property you are not my bro you are his bride he purchased you by his precious blood on calvary and all these ages it was ignorance and he had to stay there for the ignorance of the people but in the end days lord god was open his heart and he was not afraid to do it because on earth he will have a sensitive bride to his world hallelujah because christ is the world now he continues you don't have enough place for me to preach because you know what the prophet said i am stimulated by revelation i am still the only thing that stimulates me let the prophet say something anointed and this is enough for me to have a revival to change my life this message is this greatest life that struck the earth forever since the foundation of the world there is nothing like this message this light and we are the children of light blessed be the name of the lord you shall know the truth and the truth make you free because christ is the word the spoken word all right my goodness hallelujah christ is the word brother bit spoken word amen this will our this has to be our satisfaction spoken word is christ we are uniting so the third step is receive his spoken word receive not understanding not agreeing not believing but accepting even the devil knows we spoke with your pastor said even the pope knows that the message is not only be agreeing yeah yeah we know the message is good the message is from the road in the bible yeah yeah it's biblical it's biblical accept not agreeing accepting and you say praise the lord dean of god his faith accepting his spoken word the fourth thing you must take the right decision slowly so we are coming in the message parables message parable i like that hallelujah you remember the situation this is in in standing in the gap 63 standing in the gap are you happy maybe i behave i don't look to my wife in other than i can be free she will tell me later on then don't love brothers you are the same be sincere hallelujah if you are the perfect husband [Music] so brother branham wanted to have a good desire he wanted to a prophet like in the world he wanted to go in the mountain and the anointing strike him had a message for somebody come down the dust says the lord many are so spiritual but you need to take the right decision that's right now listen to this parable paragraph 117 so he speaks how he was driving to canada you know better reading this message at home and then brother brahm is telling oh he went to sleep and he went speeding down i went leading down he was driving 55 mile on an hour in the truck over the mountain coming home to arizona but i was coming now into utah and as i got there coming down from the mountain about 20 miles out of the city you you have heard it as i told you about the morning about the squares and all these things somebody went talking to me a voice just the same as you hear mine i like that let's put this this way somebody was talking to me a voice the same as you hear mine so what we hear is his voice hallelujah the voice just the same as you hear mine for somebody for us it makes sense we give something to it because when we hear the prophet we hear his voice so i know it sounds neurotically but as i i go through expressing have i ever told you anything but was right i like the way the creator speaking to him is like husband and wife and the voice go a voice got to talking i was talking to him and it said now listen now open your spiritual ears carry out your plans and you will be like that we need to take the right decisions how can i overcome we need to take right decisions because you have creative power in you every son of god and every daughter of god have creative powers now the devil knows that that's why he went to jesus say you can change these stones in because this is exactly how we are we have creative power now if we accept thoughts from the devil it will come in manifestation so carry out your plans it will be like that before that he had the dream that he will be like fletcher you know his his brother-in-law how he was hunting between the like a bomb so the lord warned his prophet he sought his right and he was driving here and the voice i am so happy for the voice somebody said the voice the voice is not there with different churches and ministers the voice is here working among us hallelujah and said look at here no remember think about think about think about now this great ministry there is no other ministry like the ministry of the prophet is god prophet fight for ministry come on say amen we are under him we are not equal with him we are never above him god messenger fight for ministry we need to be humble enough to realize and to say only what he said but also my brothers with this great ministry he had a wife now think about sister meda you know what madam means prophetess now meda prophetess she had a great influence over his ministry your wife has a great influence in your life you need to be wise enough to treat properly your wife look at here are you still with me so the voice told him your wife will go too she will leave you she won't live up there in them hills like that so don't try my brother to be too spiritual if a man with this caliber with his quality with his high position his wife what he she saw she knew his problems he she she lived with him in the house with such a prophet she will leave him my for me was really shock striking when i realized how important is the relationship between husband and wife she won't live up there in them hills and you will become a bum this is god speaking to william brown and the prophet the messenger think about only think about just as the dream showed you you would now i said i don't want to be i did i don't want to have to live like that i just wanted to do something different you know lord that you have called me to be a prophet i want to live in the wilderness like a prophet but you know i was using my own excuses so i could hunt brothers let's be more sincere my own good and he said but that was the prophet the prophet of the old testament you have been called to be there in a much higher office than that you have more gifts beside that you was called to pray for the sick and to preach the gospel in an apostolic form of greater things many great gifts he said why do you wait for me to move you every time you move where is your reward we need to take the right decision brothers are you sure that if you want to move is that says the lord or is that says i then i seen and then said do you remember i told you do you remember what brother robertson told you in your dream in his dream or vision that you had done like moses i like the message parables they are sweet you've forgotten the feelings of your people you forgot the call that i called you quote number seven we need to do to take good decision if we are the seed of god a gene of god the bride we need to take good decision standing in the paragraph 136 in the same line of thinking the prophet remember to the church what the holy ghost told about him now here is what he said because thou have chosen the narrow path the harder way thou has walked in your wall choosing now i can see that moses had to make his choice too see tao has speak the precise and correct way correct decision and it is my way it is it is good with microphone shall i put it okay it's my way underlined my way the holy spirit speaking back because of this momentous decision i trust that the lord can say about me that i take good decisions a huge portion esther a huge portion half of the kingdom half of the kingdom is not half of america is the same power that jesus had half of the kingdom is half an authority is the is the same power as christ spoken word awaits you and you know what is heaven consist in the world to be in the heavenly poor in the heavenly places is to be in the world what a glorious decision what a glorious decision now listen across the prophet said tau has made this is in itself and that which will make and come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine can you say praise the lord first gen of god second his faith third receive his spoken word you have to take the right decision now listen to his to this this is in the countdown when they beg began with believe the sign and all things against the message i was so curious what in the world they have against this message because this message is so biblical if we don't see it in the bible it's good to see it and to find it in the bible because you know the bible they cannot throw away the bible and the message we have is nothing but the bible is the perfect interpretation with divine vindication hallelujah so you know sometimes when they throw to the garbage it's good for me what they hate i love what they stumble is making me happy hallelujah so they they speak about the brown bear the big one grizzly bear so i thought to myself lord how comes that they they speak against these visions and the way it is something hidden they cannot see it but for us we have eyes to see and here here to here and then i i started to study a little bit about this parable of the message and i found something so sweet i i preached that homo sermon about it is is wonderful and is a lesson for us and what branham was world he said three times to take the right decision so the god's vision is the bible god's vision in our time is the message of the hour we when we know what's next because the message already taught us what is the next stage what expectation we don't need somebody to tell us what we expect because already the messenger told us what's next tell to somebody what's next you read it in the message is the sir pulling manifestation hallelujah we praise god for the message of the hour so brother brahm said in okay is that so in this 30 going on 32 years of ministry i have tried to stay true to the world may the lord help us to have the same testimony we have tried to stay true to the world i don't know of one things i ever had or on to alter on because i just read it about in the bible say just what the bible said and let it go like that and so i haven't had to take back on rearrange or tell to the people that this vision happened in this way the message don't need to be defend defeat defended the message is nothing but the truth he will prove prove it by manifesting it just wait a little more sunset you will see don't miss it the prophet said in one golden nugget this is my new ministry 59th he said one of these days the same pillar of fire that lead israel in the wilderness will lead us again loaves and fishes will be multiplied so don't be scared about the squeeze and the prices because something something huge is going to happen that person that is speaking to our hearts is going to be materialized again among us because this message is not coming from the baptist or the pentecost this message is coming from god that's why we cannot be measured with different doctrines this message is not to be measured with the baptist doctrine or pentecostal doctrine of adventist doctrine this message is coming from the throne of god so i try to i try to stay true to the world and so i having to take tobacco rearrange because i said i just said it the way the bible says it and i found out if god has spoken anything we must go with that word in order to make it be fulfilled my we are coming to know something now we must stay with that message in order to make it be manifested don't try to say the message is not true it is mistake is his opinion you know maybe miss this on that you maybe may better be sure that you did exactly how he said because noah did exactly according with what the lord has shown to him because he who is behind his word we seen that as i told you last night of a vision just recently and he speaks about this vision about that are you with me okay now look at this i headed to be there and learning to be there so in that vision the lord told to the prophet take care is that says the lord is it will be exactly and never failed and telling me six months before to be on that spot and stand there and saying go down there three times with them my brother and sister you better watch to go with the right kind of crowd who is the right person go down there so the same god that gave brother branham vision and never felt the vision the same god warned him it's a parable for me and you to realize stay with the truth in order to see manifesting what the prophet has said you need to stay exactly with what the prophet have said that's what happened with this it's a wonderful lesson for us to don't do that's right somebody say praise god so the when he heard that says the lord brother brown said it that says the lord never fell will be there and then he is there in the intersection and then the lord is telling him go down with them because the group of hunting was split into so the spirit of the lord told to brother iran go to this group three times i like that and i just walked one with the other man to whom are you working to whom i am working you know in the internet it's a net we have access to all kind of people you don't know exactly who is who till you are there when you are there you find out that you jumped from the lake in the battle in the battle is the saying we have it in the vision pass passage rise to exactly god's part and i was left standing so don't let us not blame the message because this is only for the eagles ghouls i try to say right eagles it is only for the bride this is nothing this is not from buzzards this is not from hoax house oaks this is for eagles for me this is an extraordinary lesson for it's blessed my soul because the message is no mistaking more than 30 years i was i feeding myself from this message i never saw a mistake when they say this is something wrong and not don't happen what with umbrella had a vision and they are so intellectual they are for me they are totally blind and i'm stimulated and i have a revival oh lord thank you for this because i see hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord the vision pass it right through exactly god's part god's part what about my part the bright revival is when she started to speak in tongue and prophesying having vision he get it bravo when she line up with the world this is the kind of revival i want to line my life with this messenger this is a revival not to play tricks and to we are not here to entertain people go to jimmy sogart or different we are not jimmy subwood revival i don't it's not coming in my mind some peristome no we have a dividend we line up with the message of malachi 4. this is my revival if they come to my church and say do you have a revival what do you mean look to my people how they are dressed look how they live look how they think we have a revival we have a spirit the revival is the spirit is the spoken word spirit is the same spirit as prophet have over it i am happy to to see that in the real real ministry have the same anointing because we received the message in the spirit was given we don't put words in prophet mouth we want to see the same spirit of the same anointing coming that that is over the because brother brown said the anointing is on the tapes so we want the same anointing to come it is not what i say what i preach the more complicated or interesting i preach but at the end has to come the same anointing and the bride is so sensitive because we are seeing the bright people are simple people but they feel the same anointing and we are not feeding on a man we are feeding on the body world of the son of man which is the holy ghost himself blessed be the name of the lord god's part and i was left standing sometimes you know we are left standing so we want to remember you've got to stay on the world just stay right with the world and where the world leads you go right with the world and will bring you out all right i'm sure can you say praise the lord gene of god faith of god accept and receive the spoken word take the right decision the fifth one is in the quote number eight i am finished the quote number eight adoption 60 and that's right the prophet said he foretold me things that i never felt to happen just exactly i'll bring any man to trial for that that's right i don't claim to be a prophet but you listen to me thus says the lord it will take perfect love to put you in that place is not it's not all doctrine you know to tell explain everybody all the doctrines sometimes the people need bread you don't give a quote you don't give him a bible verse the people need heat they are sheep the sheep need to be careful to be taken care of perfect love to put you in that place and that's all there was there no matter what money how much religious demonstrations how many good deeds you've done whatever you done that won't count nothing on that day it will take perfect love perfect love somebody say perfect love my you see you are prophesying again so whatever you do lay aside everything else until you are just so filled with the love of god till you love those who loves you no who hate you john 21 i finished john 21 i don't want the children to say always he said i am finishing and he still preach half an hour more this is not nice it's father's day hallelujah are you happy we are a family here you know this is the family of god we are on our way we have heard the message shalom we are the sons of daughter of god praise the lord john 21 it was in his appearing after chapter 21 verse 1 after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples of the sea of tiberias this is in galilee the place of revelation and there were seven disciples seven simon peter said unto them you see the intellectual faith he was not yet you know born again he didn't receive the holy ghost yet he was still in audition condition till he received the holy ghost and the you see the intellectual face we also go to tea so they went and they started to fish and you know how today we try to fish with all only intellectual conception not be really send commissioned so they entered in a ship and they they caught nothing you see why because only the third pool will catch the rainbow trout the rainbow trout are catched by the silk pool not what people tries to do to catch them and then in that morning when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore you see revelation 10 putting the feet on the on the on the on the dry land and one on the water jesus was there so but the disciple knew not that it was jesus they didn't know that he is in a new he's in a new form they didn't recognize him and jesus said children have any to eat they say no cast the net on the right side turn the picture to the right if you turn again is a heart turn it to the right side do it the way he said it obey to what he said cast the net on the right side and you shall find that they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw before the multitude of the fishes and that disciple that jesus loved this is love told to peter you see only the love will recognize him not peter the intellectual faith but love john bride it is him my ministry is to declare that he is here so love love recognizes him your heart will recognize him maybe you don't understand too much but it is the lord this message is the lord so peter it was still in the laodicean condition he didn't have the garment on but when he heard the message it is the lord the bible says he girled with his fisher coat for he was naked normally when you want to to to throw yourself in the water you take off the clothing he thought he can walk on the water he saw that he could again because he's the lord and he can walk on the water he arrayed with the message his bride prepared herself with the fisher coat and jumped and as soon as they come to the lane they saw the fire and jesus said bring some fish he knew that they didn't have because our own abilities our own programs will not catch that gold or that that rainbow trout and jesus said jesus says come and die and then he he said go again and throw in the right side right in the right way in the right side and it was full of fishes hundreds and fifty three you know how many squares brother branham hunted in his season is this message readers 149 plus 4 to be a full measure this message it's amazing then jesus took peter aside peter three times he was asking him no you don't see it in in english but i tell you in in greek how it is the first the first time when he want to restore peter to put him back in his favor to show him grace because this message is nothing by the grace he said simon do you love me now the prophet told us that we have different words for love eros is the perfect divine love perfect love now jesus here the first time when he want to restore simon peter he asked him do you agape me do you love me you know how peter is answering i feel your tea i don't have divine love i just i just have a human if the message if you listen to my prayer if you do how i say i love you i love the message till the message everything is going exactly how i like it they preach how i like it they do how i like it they behave with me how i like it i feel you then jesus went and then asked him again do you agape me the message was asking peter the intellectual faith do you agape me do you love me with divine love anything what is going on what happened with you you still agape he said no i am filioti now the third time verse 17 he says the third time he says so he understood he understood that intellectual faith even he if he was a predestinated seed he had the key he had the revelation jesus understood that we are a human being he never asked him agape me he said feel me it's okay if you cannot love me now divine it's okay i accept any kind of love if you don't love me the message the way i treat you if you don't understand the way what i am doing that in your life everything is according to the plan in nothing out of order everything is exactly because i am forming you body member when you are going to be mature enough when you have been young your god is your style self you went whatever you want you did whatever you want you decided whatever you decided you had just failure but when you shall be old when you come to your maturity thousands stretch for thy hands and another charge and carry at the end we will have perfect love we will surrender our lives to him and he will take us and lead us amen because you have perfect love in the seed and at the end when we come to our perfection it is not my will thai message be done let us stand hallelujah bless your heavenly father what we have been what what should believe what where should we go what what we have done without this precious wonderful gracious beautiful powerful anointed message of the hour we are trophies of this message lord jesus we thank you for the privilege to be a daughter and the son of god to have a dream in us to have a year to hear what the spirit says to be predestinated to overcome laudisha laodicea in us our own thinking and at the end we know we

see that i'm the riddle you know why did god choose me you know and i don't have one thing on my resume the only thing i know i have on my resume is that he thought of me before there ever was a star before the universe was put in place he put the wedding band a predestination on my finger and said this is the lady i'm going to marry [Music] you say well she's [Music] dirty and she's poor and she's wretched she's blind she's everything you know what he said but i've got the love and the grace to make her different i've got the power to change her i'm going to put something in her that's

his image be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the washing of the water of the word of god amen and i i i'd like to be different but i can't be different i don't trust anything else

white rain that i might be plowed give me gold tried in fire [Music] i you know to hear someone come from so far away and have the same love for this message that tells me one thing there's one spirit
