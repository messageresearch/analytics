and bring them into your union Lord into your word we're thankful for that tonight Lord I pray Lord that you just miss a lot of time that we're going to have together Lord communion and the foot washing whatever what a remembrance of who you are truly father unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me let it not just be in the natural but let it also be in the spiritual where our lives are so lined up with the word of God that it's you that speaks to us Lord Lord that I or that the word of God will be on our lips testifying of Jesus Christ in every opportunity in every situation in every sickness and every battle that the name of Jesus must be lifted up because you're the same yesterday today and forever so Lord we invite your presence tonight to be with us we love you we Praise You In Jesus Christ's name we pray welcome to the house of the Lord I am we're not going to be long tonight I know it's communion so we just want to share a few things that the Lord put on our heart let's just um open to First John chapter 5. and I'm under expectation that the Lord could speak to me I was telling by the Billy in the back I don't know how this is going to come out but I know that you'll place it properly for even for me to get it because when it's the revealed word of the hour we humble ourselves to it amen and so just pray for me please so John chapter 5 verses 1 to 12 we'll be doing a little bit of reading but that's the word of God Amen let's just let's just be very cautious as we're reading through these scriptures the importance of what we're reading because when we're talking about the word the word has a character the word has an identity that's right and he's given us the opportunity to know his character based upon him being the same brother Brandon brought this into our into our time this message how it is based on the foundation of it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's the same amen amen so verse 1 it says whosoever believeth that Jesus is Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is seed that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus Christ is the son of God this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ so we understand brother bam takes that and he says that water and blood is the sanctification in the and the it's the justification and sanctification of the Bride when he was on the cross when he was crucified there was water and blood that came out that was already prepared but yet the Holy Ghost had to be Resurrected so she was already cleansed she was already Justified but he took Jesus Christ himself to reveal himself through his word in the spirit amen verse 6. and this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that Barrett witness because the spirit is truth so you can have the truth but not have the spirit but here it says that the spirit is truth amen verse 7 for there are three that bear record in heaven so there's a record that are in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one the record that is in heaven and there are three that bear witness in Earth and this is the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one so justification sanctification and the spirit Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost himself they agree in one if we receive the witness of man the witness of God is greater for this is the witness of God which he had testified of his son he that believeth on the son had the witness in himself he that believeth not God had not had made him a liar because he believeth not the record that God gave his son and this is the record that God had given to us eternal life and this life isn't his son heed that hat the son had life and he that had not the son had not the life so we realized the spirit has life and that Spirit came with the truth so we have to identify the character of the spirit well let's also turn the Jude chapter one and then we'll we'll take a seat and we'll read from verses 27 that or 17 to 25. because I I was really moved by this morning's service how brother Billy was preaching about contending for the faith of the scripture and how even Brother David brought it out within the last few services and we were talking last night and I was telling brother Billy it's good to content to contend but sometimes we could be we become content so when you're content you're not contending for anything when you're satisfied when you're comfortable there's no contending because when you contend you have to have a brother to contend with I mean it's just the spirit of love you have to have a brother to contend with it's not you know and it's it's in love we're contending not contenting right but we're not just satisfied verse 17. but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how that they told you that there would be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lust this be they who separate themselves Central having not the spirit so having the truth but not having the spirit but ye beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference and others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh now think about what James is what Jude is saying here and brother Billy mentioned it this morning this is about 30 years after or 60 years I believe we were talking this was 60 years after the resurrection of Jesus Christ and all of a sudden he's he's letting us know even back then to be cautious of these things because these are spirits and now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you're faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and Majesty dominion and power both now and forever amen Lord Jesus we just ask that you does this word to us tonight in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you can have your seats so I want to talk a little bit about tonight the Lord put a little bit of a subject out of my heart tonight and it's reaching for Perfection through humility the Lord inspired me because it's it's communion in foot washing tonight and so it's important to know the character of the word and so we see that in the beginning the way that the serpent try to come into Humanity was to this flesh and so brother Banner comes and tells us that the greatest battle ever fought was between the carnal man and the spiritual man it's up here in the mind and so the battle is always going to be with this flesh the battle is always trying to have it come to subjection to something because it always wants to get ahead of God we were here and even the past weekend how the Trello of The Serpent and how he came in through the Flesh and how he desired to do all these things by the flesh trying to accomplish something by The Works of man instead of depending and and and and manifesting what God had allowed him to be and so we understand that the spirit of God is always in the children of God now brother banham says this and this is this is I want this to be a foundation for us because it's simple the Lord is simple God hides himself in simplicity this word is not complicated scent brother bam says this and greater than Solomon is here 63. and he says we've talked about it even this morning brother David even talked about it before and he says it this way he says and time hasn't changed so time hasn't changed God has to remained the same time hasn't changed he says you know he said God takes his man but never his spirit Satan takes his man but never their spirit he comes right back on someone wrong and someone else and goes right on down and now we find that in this generation it says in in every generation about the same so we understand that this flesh is dirt it was it was it came from the ground and it's going back into the ground because it was a creation that God had made in the beginning but because of sin it's no longer righteous because thou it wants to fulfill the lust of the flesh more than it wants to do what the purpose of the creation was it always tries to take you away from the word it always tries to take you away from the truth it always tries to give you an explanation it always tries to give you another road it always tries to give you another view because it's the way of the flesh it's the way that the flesh was always because of sin because of the disobedience in the beginning remember when when the serpent came to Eve he said surely but then he said because if you would then you would be like Gods but they were already like Gods their character was already there but he made them question themselves he made them question themselves so he came to the weaker vessel and he told the RICO vessel that she wasn't that when she was that but what happened was she wasn't obedient to her husband she wasn't humbled she wasn't obedient to her husband so we understand that when this generation now started civilization education it's all of these things that come now they were more fulfilled by the eyes and intelligence of man than really they were by the leadership of God because the world gotten so bad at one point that God sent a flood to destroy them all and even after that even after that the generations coming forth they still started slipping away from the Lord so we understand that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we understand that this message of the hour brought us access to the opening of the seals gave us power the third pool these things that we talk about these things are just not theories they're just not vain words that we're just thinking about this is life this is God manifesting himself and so the character is still unfolding God's still training and teaching his children now I want to I want to just concentrate here because brother Branham makes a statement I didn't bring the quote but he says that people want Power so we're living in an age where people want Power we're living in the age where people want influence we're living in an age where people always want to have this Authority or this power because they want to be in control because they want to be the ones that are is responsible for every decision that's made because they think it's right and that's this human flesh this is the Serpent's way of coming in where now he's trying to deceive Us by these five senses and so we understand that the only way to be able to bring it under subjection is to Humble it to where it was created for and so we're reaching Perfection through humility so what is the message of the hour how do you know the message of the hour that's a very good question because brother Billy read it this morning he says that before the Dreadful day of the Lord okay he'll send the spirit of Elijah okay and then he says before the dead and it says before the coming of the Lord so we understand that there's something that's happening the coming of the Lord is here the coming of the Lord is something that was prophesied about just as much as Malachi 4 5 coming into the spirit of Elijah let's not forget that portion of the scripture as well because now it's bringing he so so remember John the Baptist when he's seen Christ on the scene he said I must decrease so he can increase now what was he decreasing from what was he recognizing when he noticed the word was on the scene he stepped back and he said Lord not my will but thine will and if that's the vessel you came through I respect that I'm humbling myself to that because I notice it it's so much that he questioned himself and he said the disciples are there is that really him yes it is him believe believe but he was mature and he caught the revelation of what the word was saying was to come understanding the character of the word so the message of the hour gives the believer the revelation of the coming of the Lord and it's only through the message of the hour and that's something that God did not man that something that God did but we understand that sometimes man tries to have an influence on something that God's already accomplished and is already done trying to have an influence upon this flesh that is trying to to to lift itself higher than the Creator who is greater the Creator or the creation brother Branham says that the the creation itself is is praising God because of what it was made to do the flowers even the sunflower I was able to experience this was while I was in Romania and it was just fields and Fields of sunflower and me and my wife were driving and all of a sudden we were just looking and and the farmers were telling us that when this when the Sun rises the flower turns its face to the Sun and when the sun sets it actually bows its head because it is it is ripened for that day so he bows his head and humility knowing that that's what the sun did now that's creation you don't have to tell her what to do it just obeys God based upon what it was created to do it's the same with the spirit of God Saints so I wanted to turn to Genesis because brother Branham says everything started in Genesis and so if we turn to Genesis 11 I just wanted to read this this scripture verses one through nine and just see the character of the Lord in every age because we have to identify him the same yesterday today and forever so this is After the flood and now this is what's happening and the whole earth was of one language and and of of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East that they found the plane in the land of China and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and bird them through thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for Mortar so realize that they took from the very creation so they took they took dirt to make brick right and then they took they to make stone and they took slime to make the mortar so they took the very the very substance from the ground now now look where it's going verse 4 and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach into heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole Earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of man building and the Lord said behold the people is one and they all of one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will restrain them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and therefore confound their language that they may not understand one another speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of the Earth and they left off to to build the city and therefore the name is so-called Babel because the Lord did their confound the language of the earth of all the Earth and from thence did the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of the Earth and so brother Branham takes this and he said you see Man by the intelligence of man took from the substance of what God has created build that something of themselves calling it a city wanting to be above God wanting to do things that weren't according to the word of God and he says you know they didn't come to provided way they could have reached the city they could have reached the heavens but brother Branham says it wasn't the provided way so God now had created a confusion in their language even though they were speaking the same thing they weren't able to understand each other even though they were speaking the same thing they weren't able to understand each other brother bam says this and it is the rising of the Sun so I'm just wanting to point to what is what how important it is for a Believer for a son and daughter of God to always humble themselves to the word to always be humbled by the word because once God reveals the word to you it takes away the fear replaces it with love and now it humbles you amen it takes away the fear of unbelief and he gives you the love of God and then that humbles the wife because that's what she is she's of himself it's who he is he came and he was the lowest man on this Earth to show that it's not about this flesh it was never about this flesh and the only way to redeem this flesh is through humility We Gotta Die daily to ourselves we got to let go of this this human nature as much as possible because what it wants to do always it wants to fight back it wants to talk back it wants to talk him properly it wants to start saying well let me put this together I would like to do this and I all of a sudden now arrogancy and pride and all these things the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh all of this the lust of the world all these things start coming because we're not humble in ourselves fully to the word of God Lord help me help me brother Baum says this it says now and there isn't it and it is the rising of the sun paragraph 30 I believe it says now the very essence of the message that was sent he that is risen from the dead we his beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he's alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some tradition of man we can only exactly we can only reflect exactly to what we're pointing to we can only I'll read that again we can only reflect exactly what we're pointing to I'm afraid today that many of us are not getting people to Christ we're getting them to the church to a theory but we must get them to Christ he's the only one and the only one that has life he that has the son hath life and this is the life of a man that's dead to be projected in you you will live the same life he lived if the blood of a man was a certain type and you took the blood from one man and changed it to the blood of uh of what of of the one man into another he would absolutely be that type of that type blood and if your spirit that was in you is reckoned dead and now it says you are anointed with the life that was in Christ is upon you Romans 8 11 said if the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you it'll also Quicken your mortal bodies that same life the same powers does them same beneficiaries that he had here on Earth from God he redeemed you a seed that was foreknown by God whose name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and that the Gospel Light of the Resurrection the confirmation of the word how did we know he was the Christ who do you say that I am personally don't pull somebody else to the picture who do you say that I am it's a personal question well some say you're the son of Jonas some say you're this some say your dad but personal who do you say that he is because he proved what he talked about how will I know the message of the hour God proves what he promised and he talks about it this is the identification identification that we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he talks about amen so if he proves what he's talking about then our very life should be a very proof of what he's talking about if my testimony by confession is that I'm a Son of God my life must be able to be matching to the word of God to be in the life of God you gotta humble the flesh you got to Humble the flesh I have to Humble My Flesh this is what he did when he came he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he learned obedience by the things he suffered he put down this flesh but he was so great in the spirit because he was dating a character the character of the word Romans 8 from 8 to 10 says it this way it says so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness so the spirit is life because of righteousness it produces righteousness the spirit of God produces righteousness brother Branham says this in images of Christ in 59 May 25th so humbling this flesh has been something that God has always proved the same yesterday today and forever because I I I I I I was so blessed when even brother Billy was talking about Isaac you know he was a promised son that was given for 25 years and then the lord gave him a son and then God wanted to prove Abraham you know how he wanted to prove him to sacrifice the very blessing that he gave him he said he told them in Genesis 22 he said take your son and bring him unto me as a sacrifice now Abraham humbled himself to the word even though it had hurt as much as it did Lord you gave me this promise you gave me this son 25 years I've prayed and Lord you gave me this son this is the promised word that you've given me you're giving me the Sun and now you want to take it away from me now you want me to go sacrifice my own son Lord if that's your will I'll do it if that's your will Lord I'll do it because I know that I'm more safe in the will of God than I am in the will of man if I'm under the will if I'm under his blood if I'm under his protection I know that I'm safer there than I am in any other place any other time in every other decision and every other circumstance and so I I can I can re I can relate to Isaac being a lad he told he told his he he told his guards he says stay here with the mule with the with stay here and some let's go I gotta take the lad we're going to go up to the mountain and do a sacrifice I could only imagine Isaac he knew because there was other sacrifices that were done in the past why is this one so different why don't we have the sacrifice why don't we have I mean you brought the word you brought all the stuff that we need to do to put it on the sacrifice but where is it at why can't I see it and so much that Isaac himself was humbled that Abraham had to tie his hands around his back and put him on the altar ain't so much that he tied his hands behind his back and he was laying on the altar and he said okay Lord and he was just about to light up the fire and the Lord stopped and says oh Abraham now I know now I know how much you love me now I know how much I mean to you now I understand I can trust you now with my word now I understand that you would do anything brother banham says it and and in images of Christ what a difference of so-called reflecting Christians today and Saints I I want to say this we have to be mature in everything that we do so if the word speak into our hearts we're mature enough to understand and we can take it because it's for us amen and so it says what a difference of so-called reflecting Christians today what a difference why the so-called Christians today wants to be served oh he begins to think that he's somebody what a difference from what it was when it says when reflecting him he never came to be Minister too but he came to minister and he that is greatest among you be the servant of them all and we have seen today that are more our Modern Trend of Christianity it says is I'm somebody of and you're nothing oh it's wrong it shouldn't be that way we are trying to reflect Christianity in the wrong way God doesn't want us to do it that way we sing the song to be like Jesus but when it comes to Humble our pride and to get down like he did then we draw the line and in do it so man has formed the nominations that that can separate themselves seeming not having the spirit as the scripture says they separate themselves we belong to a certain Church our church it says uh it's a bigger church it's a it's a better Church a denomination is a greater denomination that doesn't act like Jesus that doesn't reflect his love and his personality that doesn't reflect this love and his personality he came to the lowest he came to the street Harlot he came to the beggar he came to the bum and got right down in the dust of them that's the Christian Life that's the way it should be to reflect them in that way oh I know people say that these days are past it isn't it if Christ do remains Christ if his spirit is still the holy spirit that was in him being you it'll make you take that position too but today we try to think that we're different how far it is from his prayer when he prayed that this would all men know that ye that that we were his disciples when we have love for one another and instead of that we fuss at one another we despise one another we don't agree upon the certain things and we go out and accuse each other see and yet claim to be Christians I know people who claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit is guilty of such things going out and really saying evil things about the other Christians when they ought not to do those things now brother sister when we have that kind of spirit we might as well get it in our mind that we're not Christians yet no matter how much we confess it's what we possess that counts we cannot be Christians and not love all people we might differ with people but Jesus didn't put it and say well now hear all you Pharisees you're going to hell and there's no chance for you because of this that or the other because you're a Pharisee because it says but he went to them and he ministered to them and helped them and he done everything that he could to help them but today education and church membership and ties of the world has brought this church together in such a way until the intellectual has taken place of the spiritual you cannot get to God except by the spirit that's the only way that you a man can come to God and not through the Holy Spirit Jesus said no man can come to me except of Joy the father draws him first that's just as true as can be Christians we want to take a little notebook tonight in our heart and count up all these things Lord let me count up all these things let's think of this oh some of us claim to have all the knowledge we have to say now wait thy love it says they love to be doctors and holy fathers and so forth but knowing it says knowing of all this If he if you had all the knowledge it wouldn't do you any good except you had a spirit in you of love the Bible said though I know do I have all the knowledge and not have charity I'm nothing and what God what good does it what good does our knowledge do when someone says I wouldn't go to a Revival like that because those are not educated people I wouldn't associate with them no matter whether they don't know their ABCs or not they can know Christ certainly you can never get too low you can never he says you never can get too low may God always give that spirit in me no matter how what he believes what he does what Creed what color what I want to I want says I want to reach a hand and to help me because he says sure I want that Spirit In Me I will not think I'm better than somebody else and this is a prophet speaking this yes this is this Prophet taking the position from his from his perspective and how he looks at the word now if the First Brethren that was born among many brethren in our time born in a manger came into this world trying to understand God and by the sufferings of his life he learned obedient in the love of God and you know one thing that the devil tell him told them when he was dealing with Sharon Rose and he went into that depression he told them God don't love you you see he went directly to where he could attack him God don't love you but God loves you because there's still Mercy there's still Grace and if he Reveals His love to you then you should be a vessel filled with the spirit of God Isaiah 57 15 says for thus say at the high and lofty one that inhabited eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and the holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contract ones to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contract ones and so you see how God hides himself in humility you know brother Bram says that he preaches God hides himself in Simplicity in 1963 and as he's preaching God hiding himself in Simplicity the whole time he's talking about humility because it's never so hard to be so simple so simple that you don't miss God because God is simple God is simple Luke 6 says it this way and I'm applying this to my I'm applying this to my faith I'm applying this to to understanding that God wants us mature God wants us mature in his word God wants us to know what we're talking about God wants us to understand that if something was to come and our foundation has been said nothing would move the Bride of Jesus Christ because she is not like the one that was in the beginning because there has been a Ministry that has come forward that has perfected her that has got her to a point where now she could stand for what she is and now from the very revelation of the word no matter what man say she only hears the voice of God because it's that that brings her into the maturity and the character of the firstborn that was among many Brethren and if the spirit of a prophet if the spirit of a prophet as uh you know I I know that sometimes um it's hard to say even for myself you know just being as young as I am that I can say that I've seen William Branham in the in our days I can't say that but you know what I can say by the revelation of the message I can see what he was going through and how he was able to obtain the stature of a perfect man because we're going through it and I can testify and see yes I have seen what he's seen because now it's fulfilling today in this hour and I can testify of the very word that God is doing lifting our faith up because that's what we need to have to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye in humility to the word it brings us up it brings us up Luke says Luke says 6 verse 40. the disciples it says the disciple is not above his master but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master so everyone that is perfect shall be like his master and why behold it says why behold this doubt the moat and thy brother's eye but perceive is not the being in thy own eye either how can thou no say to thy brother brother let me pull out the moat that is in thine eye when thou thyself behold thus not the beam that is in your own eye thou hypocrite it says cast out first The Beam out of thine own eye and then shall thou See Clearly to pull out the moat that is in thy brother's eye for a good tree bring it not for corrupt fruit neither there a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit for every tree is known by its fruit four of thorns of man do not gather figs or it says nor of of a of a Bramble Bush gathered their grapes a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for although the it says of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaking and why call ye Me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say whosoever cometh to me and hear it my saying and do with them I will show you to whom he is like and then he goes into the subject of having your foundation settled because if we say we believe the word we must also act as the word says we should be it's a life now that no longer could remain on paper because the Bride of Jesus Christ she is an epistle that has been written and read of all men and she is the Bride of Jesus Christ reflecting The Same Spirit like Jesus Christ there's no difference between them two this is what brother Branham says and now the spirit of Love which was Jesus Christ himself is expressing now I must decrease so he must increase Perfection by humility because we want nothing but the word of God I want nothing but the word of God John 13 and this is going it's just I'll be finished here quickly I'm not going to be long we have communion but this is the scripture of the foot washing verse 12 it says so after he had washed their feet now Jesus Christ himself sitting in a room with the son of perdition Jesus Christ himself sitting in the room with Judas the Son of Perdition and he humbled himself to wash his feet he humbled himself to show the act of love to no matter what your position is God wants us to reflect love all the time so he says and he take he had taken His Garment and was set down again and he said unto them know he what I have done to you the example of Jesus Christ the love of God Jesus Christ was the love of God a hundred percent man and a hundred percent God the prophet says and he put his flesh so low that it didn't matter what man or a people thought of who he was be but he would fulfill the very work he sent to be because he was to manifest every word and every scripture that was prophesied of himself and so is the Bride of Jesus Christ supposed to get the very word that is prophesied for this hour to be able to manifest it it says he called me master and Lord and he say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye are also to wash another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I've done to you Awakening Jesus brother Benham says this in 1963 he says Jesus invited them to do it he did he says if he didn't meet every qualification of Messiah then you tell me where I've missed them it says it says that's good isn't it tell me where I've missed it if I didn't meet the qualifications if I did I haven't done exactly what the scripture said that I would do it says o Christians if we would line ourselves up and there do what the scripture says that Christians should do they should have it says they should have known he was God of creation and he says he was the very one that created the water and the wind and they should have known that and if they know that he was that did they not understand that this creation of the Creator would have to obey his word he says oh my if he created it who's the greatest the creation or the Creator like Jesus said who is the greatest that is is it he that is sent or he that has sent him which is the greatest the creation or the Creator the Creator then they seen and he proved and he was the creator and then if he was the creator would not his creation obey him let us remember also that he created our bodies when our bodies come obey his command spirit is to spit out that cancer it says he says to the body and away it goes you just take that word and plant it in there and and see what happens yes sir our bodies has to obey his command you say you're a Christian I believe you are you believe it says what are you resting in someday you raise our bodies up after they've absolutely completely perished if you don't believe that then why do you go to church if there's no Resurrection are we amongst man most miserable but his word is a promise he that believeth in me though we were dead though he says yeah he shall live amen I am the resurrection in life amen he that it's my flesh and drinks my blood as it has eternal life and I'll raise them up at my last day it says my it says the body the ashes the volcanic ashes that were made out of it says obey his command because he's the creator of it the life that's within us is not only a creative life but it's part of his own life that's the reason we have the authority to speak to a devil because it's God's Own created life if you're anointed see correct now you it says it's not you that speaketh but it's the father that dwells in you take no thought what you'll say it'll be added at that time just go on stay with them I love that amen amen I'll close here I just wanted to read this last quote brother Bantam reads this and humble thyself 1963. you know there's there's a point where the devil will always try to come and influence the flesh and it's always deceiving it always brings that feeling of uncomfortable of being uncomfortable always makes you where you're in fear it always makes you sit back where you're like well now I'm unsettled what decision should I make where should I go what should I do well the Lord told me I'm Healed but why why why why why am I not believing why is there not something inside of me to believe and then and then all of a sudden God just comes and he's he strikes his word to us and by the revealed word you're like oh now I have hope Lord You've spoken to me you're giving me life you're giving me something that I could overcome by now I want to obey that word that has been revealed by the love of God because as I walk in it I'm also walking in the footsteps of his his path that he wants me to walk in it's obeying and humbling ourselves to the word because that's what he did Jesus Christ came not only to live the life in the flesh to show the character truly that we can identify with but he came and resurrected so that same spirit that overcame there could also be in us to overcome now that's why we can't be deceived that's why the Bride of Jesus Christ cannot be deceived because she is born of his bone and flesh of his flesh and spirit of his spirit amen brother bam says this and says I was thinking here of a little illustration it says to back up what he said he says now we look at this watch we find out what time it is unless that every instrument in that watch is coordinating one with another will never know the correct time is that right and it takes all of us together all together if we want to see the third pool really do something for God it's coordination with every one of us together to Humble ourselves before God and confess our wrongs and pray and believe God for these things he says I truly believe that what brother Vale said is the truth that God will never put his Spirit into an Unholy unrighteous disobedient Temple it says no it's got to come in the way of the cleansing of our heart from Argyle and iniquity that we might be pure before God that we might work he's pure Holy Spirit through us to bring these things to pass I think that when you go home tonight if you just read that little book of Jude you'll just you'll just learn a lot a whole lot now what brother Vale has said it says I earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints they got away from it how man of corrupt minds and so forth had come in and beguiled them away from the word it says from the real things of God it says and God can only operate as we let him operate and there's so many wonderful things he always says this it says you know people want power and really they don't know what power is see they don't really know what it is and what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you've got more power than a man runs around the whole building and making a bunch of noise he says see because you have been able to conquer yourself because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ you see to humble yourself before him that's real power you show me a church that's humble real Humber not an arrogant City not a church it says not an arrogancy a church just a sweet Humble Church and I'll show you a church that has the favor of and power of God in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise let's just bow our heads father you're you've been so good to us your word has been so good to us Lord lord it's it's life Lord it's not just words that are on a paper but Lord the very message of the hour that we believe is the is the very person of who you are through Jesus Christ Lord that character the one that that didn't even have a place to lay his head that he was looking more of the needs of others than he was looking on the needs of himself he was more of a servant than he was served too he humbled himself in so much that he was praying day and night Lord I can save and in this generation you've shown this Same Spirit revealed to the prophet messenger of this age Lord you showed us what it's like to live a life according to the word in humility and love and peace and unity Lord Lord I pray tonight that you just grow us into the statue of a perfect man and as we gain more love that you give us more character Lord because we want to have the character of the world inside of us Lord I pray tonight that you just bless the remaining of our service Lord are you just blessed the bride of Christ Lord just the way that she's getting ready just the way that she's expecting you Lord just the way that she she's she's gaining her oil and her candlesticks and she's waiting for you Lord because you're coming to get us out of here Lord we'll be changed in a moment in a twinkle of an eye and and the prophet says that it'll be so sweet it'll be so humble that the people would even know that it happened Lord give us the spirit of Love let us unite each other in the spirit of of God that's in our meds we love you we just commit the rest of the service now into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen I really like that I really really like that I I and I just hope when we hear a word like that we can make it a collective effort all of us together to be that that representative of that church we just heard I because I I believe with all my heart is the desire even of our pastor we are not built on big and small great shows we we are trying we are taught to be built on the very Foundation where real people can come with real need and be touched by God where we are not ashamed to say I have a problem I have a need and I need God to comment not where you know we get the the spiritual on one side and the non-spiritual no a group of people that can humble themselves by the word that's been sent by a messenger and really receiving and be molded into the church we just heard of that's really my heart desire no big guys no little use no show off not what I know what I don't know but God being the leader coming and moving in our midst to do according to his promise I like that the Way Up Is Down you know it's always humble it's always looking it's always I believe in I truly believe each one here big or small young and old God has a place for you a position for you to play and and I think oftentimes when we say that people think it's just maybe coming to the front or doing something no it could be something behind the scenes it could be in your closet on your knees you're praying for the body you're praying for a need you're praying for something each one can play a role where we can really become the mighty Army but we have to work together not against one another we have to support one another not criticize one another and I believe that's really where God has taken us brother Cosman mentioned something that it was just you know but one of them says God proves his word by believers and he makes a statement he said wouldn't it be nice for him after the resurrection he would have went to pilate and said you see what I told you was the truth you see I I told you that I came and I was gonna die in a but when I said even if it did that they wouldn't believe him why because when he came at the first time when he spoke they didn't believe they would find another reason not to believe even after he showed up oh that's a ghost oh that's not really him oh he really didn't die isn't that what they said but a believer that believed the first time he will believe the second time you believe the third time it is there to always believe and that's why God proves his word by Believers and I believe we are here for us to be that group of people that God can come and prove his word by amen if the we'll have the brothers just get the communion ready let's just open our communion scripture at this time thank you and I sit stand and read it first Corinthians chapter the 20 uh sorry the 11th chapter the 23rd verse he said for I have received of the Lord that which I have also deliver unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given tanks he had taken it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me and after the same manner he also took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood do this do ye as of as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as of as ye eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whatsoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord and worthily shall be guilty of the blood and the body of the Lord but let every man examine himself so let him eat of this bread and drink of that cup it says for he that eateth and drink it unworthily eat it and drinking damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep he says for if if for if we would be judged if we will judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore Brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another is that humility again Terry one for another don't just look and you know don't don't have this attitude that one shouldn't eat that one over there shouldn't eat you don't know what's going on with their lives you don't know if they ask forgiveness before they came you don't know what if they made it you don't know anything all you have to do is come and tarry one for another you know the but it makes it I said we we should always we should always try to avoid because there's things we have to understand but when I said it's not the man it's the it's the devil even if someone does your wrong don't take the man and throw him with his hair understand that it's the devil that caused him to do that so the goal is always to preserve your brother it's never to cast them out the goal is always to preserve it says tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I said in order where to come hey man let's just pray our gracious father we're so thankful
