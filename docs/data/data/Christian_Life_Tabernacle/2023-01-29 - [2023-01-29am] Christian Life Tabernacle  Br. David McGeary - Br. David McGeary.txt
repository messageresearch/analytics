welcome you this morning amen amen you may have your seats this morning as you're invited by the Mike before I saw him reading good morning we're gonna turn to Psalm 112 this morning there's a verse there that just kind of caught my attention said uh in verse five it says a good man showeth favor and lindeth he will guide his affairs with discretion and then from there all the way to the end of the chapter it describes the characteristics the testimony the actions of a good man it says in verse 6 he will not be moved forever it says in verse 7 he shall not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord it says in verse 8 his heart is established he shall not be afraid in verse 9 he hath dispersed he hath given to the poor his righteousness endureth forever his horn shall be exalted With Honor what a wonderful testimony what a wonderful set of characteristics a good man but as I was thinking about this there was once a man who approached Jesus in Matthew 19. and when he called him good master he said why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is God who in fact David says in an earlier Psalm Psalm 14 he says the Lord looked down from heaven upon the Children of Men to see if there were any that did understand and seek God they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one in fact this is the same verse that Psalm that Paul quotes in Romans 3 there is none that doeth good no not one so you have a paradox here to use the word that brother Branham did you know on the one hand the word makes very clear that there is a good man that has all these characteristics but on the other hand says there's no such thing as a good man you know it I got to thinking about that is how do we how do we reconcile that how do we connect the dots that there's a good man here's what it looks like but there's no such thing as a good man you know we live in a world that defines good by man's standards you know they define a person as being good by the good things that they do based on what the world describes or Society describes as good right what looks good what feels good what sounds good you know what you know what's a good work you know a man's version of good Looking Good Feeling Good sounding good good works is at its best filthy rags amen you know if we're not careful you know we can even allow that thinking to influence us even in church right where a service is good if it feels good a sermon is good if it sounds good or looks good or feels good our fellow brothers and sisters are good if they do good works or if they sound good or look good we can look at ourselves and we can say I'm no good because we don't look good or we don't feel good maybe we don't always do good things or Worse we can look at ourselves and say we are good because we think we look good or are doing good things but you know folks we don't even know what good is until we've come in contact with the good one amen you know I got to thinking about that as we were reading Psalm 112 you know John in third John a book that's so easy to miss the one who was perhaps one of the first to meet this good one said in verse 11 beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good he that doeth good is of God but he that doeth evil hath not seen God he that doeth good a good man is someone whose God made God crafted God born someone who is of God it's interesting in Matthew when this man came to Jesus and called him good he was looking for the right formula the Right Mix of goodness that he could put together to experience eternal life you know when Jesus quickly identified that no matter how good he was how many good things he had or how many good things he'd done how good he looked or how good he felt good couldn't happen until he surrendered every good thing and came in contact with the good one you know until he died to everything that was good from man's definition the feeling good the looking good the sounding good the good works you know he could not enter in and we know the story he walked away sorrowful because there were so many good things he couldn't let go of it says in Romans 12 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your body as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world this Society man's definitions of what is good but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove demonstrate show what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you know if you want to go ahead and stand this morning we're going to read Psalm 112 which speaks of the good man you know and interestingly enough in verse 2 it says his seed shall be Mighty on the earth I think we all know he's speaking of an offspring he's speaking of someone who's God born God crafted God made to be in His image just as sons are an image of a father that there might be someone on the Earth who could be the good man that's Psalm 112 is speaking about you know if we start to read Psalm 112 this morning the question I would ask do we have any good people in the house not those that have done good things or look good or sound good but who have met the good one and see that his hand evident in our lives let's read that together as our testimony starting in verse one praise ye the Lord blessed is the man that feareth the Lord that delighteth greatly in his Commandments his seed shall be Mighty upon Earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endureth forever unto the upright there are a rise of light in the darkness he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous a good man showeth favor and lend it he will guide his affairs with discretion surely he shall not be moved forever the righteous shall be an everlasting remembrance he shall not be afraid of evil Tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord his heart is established he shall not be afraid until to see his desire upon his enemies he hath dispersed he hath given to the poor his righteousness endures forever his horn shall be exalted with honor the wicked shall see it and be grieved he shall gnash with his teeth and melt away the desire of the wicked kids Shall Perish amen have your seats man why don't we sing meeting in the air give hey man [Music] oh we have heard of Oz [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh as I sing in everything [Music] a meeting oh I made it thanks before the

she could bring it at this time [Music] [Music] thank you lately I've been looking back along this Winding Road to the old familiar markers of the mercies I have known I know it may sound simple but it's more than a cliche there's no better way to tell you than to say God's been good in my life I feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams when I go to sleep each night though I've had my share of hard times I wouldn't change them if I could [Music] oh God's been good times replay and I can see that I've cried some bitter tears but I felt his arms around me as I face my greatest fears you see I've had more gains than losses I've known more joy than hurt as his grace rolled down upon me undeserved God's been good in my life I feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams when I go to sleep each night and though I've had my share of hard times I wouldn't change them if I could cause through it all God's been my father my savior and my friend his love was my beginning his love will be mine I could spend forever trying to tell you everything he is but the best way I can say it is [Music] I feel so blessed beyond my wildest dreams when I go to sleep each night and though I've had my share of hard times I wouldn't change them if I could cause through it all [Music] oh God [Music] [Applause] for his goodness this morning amen amen we have a couple of requests and we have an announcement there will be a donut in the back after service for the kids and I mean if if there are some leftovers the parents can grab to you know kids first man from Brother Adrian amen amen sister Leslie writes

says ask abundantly that your joy may be full we could just this morning intercede for our sister God I believe God will come and touch her but in my Thomas said right brother Justin is out of the hospital in Congo he had been delivered from malaria they said I'm the Lord who healed all that diseases amen hallelujah just want to pray that the Lord will continue to strengthen him and bring him

knowing that I know God is here and he will hear my prayer this morning hey man the brothers that are taking the offerings if you can come but it tell me if you could just come in take this needs before the Lord now before I pray I just wanted to to just say something because I was talking with Brother David and brother Billy yesterday and you know we we go through a lot of ups and downs through our walk and I just something really struck me and um and and I see it real heavy and a lot of my family and loved ones you know we get down and we're up and we're down we're up and you know I just I was reading and it said uh in second Timothy Chapter 2 says Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that that worth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier and you know I just I thought about that and and just the Lord really dealt with my heart and you know we sometimes we get downtrodden and we don't even mean to we don't even realize we're doing it but you know God always every time he's brought me through and I I just wanted to put that out there for anybody that when you're feeling

another Lord we're gathered to sing in worship [Music] we love to sing and worship Lord and praise Lord we love the blessings of your spirit and the inspiration of the singing but father above all this morning we've come that you would speak to our heart Lord that you would just talk to us individually wherever that we are whatever station in life whatever mile marker on the trail the glory that we've arrived at Lord we believe you have a word of encouragement instruction correction and guidance and Lord we long to hear that this morning [Music] Lord with all my heart I believe that you sent an angel Messenger to our age and father he was designed in made to be a prophet to speak with you lip to ear and and father he delivered to us truth father We Believe with all our heart that that truth has been stored and placed in such a manner that you would open it to us a long life's journey that we could feed and gain strength to continue on our journey we asked this morning that you would feed our hearts and our souls touch our bodies give peace to our minds and spirit because we love you this morning with all our heart in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen God bless you while you're standing let's just read one quick scripture in the Bible before we go forward this morning in any way I I I love this um uh this is a portrait somebody gave me of me preaching I thought that was that's pretty good uh I was thinking of putting that in the foyer but I got a pretty big mouth and so I don't I I don't know if there's a hidden message there or not but let's turn to Genesis 1 1. and uh and it said in the beginning God in the beginning God and we know we have a greater understanding of that scripture than most people because our messenger told us that he wasn't even God in the beginning because there was nothing even to worship Him so he made angels and he says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word this in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be heated um we're going to play uh 26 minutes this morning out of uh the message Christ revealed in his own word but I'd like just to make a few comments uh beforehand this morning more as a just a Sunday school lesson and to just uh uh stabilize this if I could say that brother Brown makes this statement in the message that we're going to listen to he says now my text this morning is Christ is revealed in his own word that is a great statement isn't it so if you want to find him you have to find him where he's revealed so he said Christ is revealed in his own word now where I uh he says he says and where I come to the conclusion to talk on this was because that Christ can say this is why I I want to talk on this subject so the prophet of God's going to minister this message called Christ is revealed in his own word and there's a reason that he's motivated if I could or led by the spirit or inspired whatever words in the vocabulary that you would like to use to express this but he had a reason for preaching it and so he says this here and this is in paragraph 17 he says knowing that we say we mustn't just say because we're gathered together to just haphazardly speak on anything but it's something that will help stabilize the people and I thought you know that was kind of uh I took that as my motivation to this morning that um uh what what would be the reason that I would preach this morning maybe not to bring an inspiration to bring a teaching or to motivate Faith uh that you might receive healing or that to preach in a manner that there might be conviction to bring repentance these might all be different motivations for a person bringing a sermon uh maybe sometimes it's Cur for correction but I thought we we want to approach this this morning to make sure that we're stable you know to be stabilized this morning to understand uh that we're standing on a rock and that rock is stable and if you have confidence in that rock you'll stay with that rock and and so the things that we're speaking this morning are uh may be not so much to Enlighten you to something that you haven't heard foreseen or to put something in a certain light that you can understand it better but the motivation this morning stabilization just to be stabilized because uh uh there's uh we're in the hour of great storm and let me say is as I continue to read he said to talk on this was knowing that that what we say we must mustn't just say because we're gathered together to somehow paddlers speak on anything but it's something that will help stabilize the people so if this is a good uh understanding so if you find yourself in a place of unstabilization or wonderment here's the message that'll help stabilize you for we are going to pass through dangerous and treacherous Waters now and we'll you'll hear all this I'm just giving you some of my motivation this morning and why that I'm doing what is more treacherous than Satan appearing as an angel of Light um and that's what this is this is the age of deception and you know you can't be with somebody every place they go you can't sit down with everybody and help them walk through every decision that they have to make you can't undo decisions that people have made but the best you can do is to to bring them something that will stabilize them so when you're stabilized and you become stabilized if I could express it like this the maybe you've made decisions and and there's Tremors uh from those decisions there are side effects there's there's results in everything and those waves are still uh trickling through your life well you you can't go on like that you've got to be able to get stable you've got to stabilize you gotta once you get your your feet back under you and you become stabilized and and you start getting on some ground uh then you can handle the things that come look when you're unstable then you're you're really not good for anything and you'll just continually to be tossed to and fro by every wind of Doctrine every wind of circumstance but when you can become anchored and stabilized in other words you know what you're standing on and you know that what you're standing on will not be washed away you know everybody in the great storms they had many people they could they they refused to evacuate because uh the prior storms weren't so bad and all of a sudden they found themselves in a storm that was greater than that they had imagined and then they begin to lose confidence in what they were in good very good we don't we've got to have confidence going forward we've got to be sure where we stand what we're standing on why we're standing on it why we're holding to it and we've got to know no matter what it looks like no matter if how he appears that angel of Light with signs wonders and everything you know you've heard the voice of God and you're staying with it and so we see that and he says in and he says and we are sailing through them and sometimes I guess it's with you like it is with me that it seems like that so much of it is such a scare amen now is not the time to get afraid all right so that's what why we're going forward this morning is we're we just want to anchor down and be sure I I so this brought me to um uh a few statements out of the message called God is identified by his characteristics and uh let me see if I can give you the date on that if you would like to put that on the board it's a third the third of November 6th oh three eleven and this is starting in paragraph okay let's just start with the 18th he says now I believe the Bible says that he won't I don't believe God will judge the World by the Pentecostal Church by the Methodist Baptist or Catholic he'll judge it by Jesus Christ he said so and Christ is the word in the beginning was the word in the beginning was God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the same yesterday today and forever Coke it's all been settled from the beginning he said the whole thing is the great eternal now that statements like that just sit me in my chair the whole thing is just the great eternal boy a lot of stuff goes on in this world that don't mean a thing all the rocket ships all the trips to Mars uh all the exploring of the deep all the libraries all the education everything they got is all going to come to naught it's only going to be the way he said it was going to be he's Alpha he's Omega he's the beginning he's the end it's one big eternal thank you aren't you glad you know that why of all people did he elect you I don't know like I said he didn't allow me to pick the church boy they'd have been a bunch of Rascals they would have looked good on the outside like our brother said this morning you know but would they have been good I remember a man came to me one time and he put his finger in my face and he said you use mind control I said buddy if I use mind control I wouldn't have people like you in my church you know well I'd have uh you know people like Bill Gates and and Edwin Elon Musk and you know what I mean you'd be great I I I'd get people with a lot of cash right but how far would that be away from God's word because God didn't come to the rich in this world but he came to the poor of this world rich in faith amen dollars will keep you here the spirit of God will get you out of here so we we you just you got to just put it away it's by his choosing in his election he said the whole thing is just the great eternal eternity never did begin and can never end therefore in this great Eternal one was attributes to be a father to be a son to be a savior to be healer and all these things was in him and only thing that's happening now is displaying his attributes that's all right now so I don't care what everybody else says is going on riots and and trouble here in economy and and all this it's not the reality what's going on is God is displaying his attributes that is all what a message what what a word of comfort to his church he'll come out and say I know it's dark because perilous times shall come men shall no longer desire to retain God in their thinking and God's going to give them over to a reprobate mind and and we see that we look out we see the darkness we see the floods of darkness and if we don't we look at those windy storms and we wonder will our Rock hold but now we stand up and we can say but wait a minute all that's really happening is God's displaying his attributes he will display his power to deliver his children out of the spiritual Egypt just the way he delivered his children out of physical Egypt which with the power of His spoken word so we can rest let us read on just a few statements because it's wonderful now our names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world so how many of you had anything to do with that three I believe it was God talking with job he said where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy before the foundation of the world where were you no wonder job finally got the answer to that he said though the skin worms eat my flesh yet I'll see God he finally knew where he was amen he said world and and when the word strikes that if it's any light in there that been ordained to life Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws and all that my father has given me will come so you see its word constantly the word the word it's just run that back because this is this is one of our things that we've got to be sure of and understand to be stabilized it was there before you knew it right found he says now our names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and when the word strikes that if it's any light there that's been ordained to life Jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him and all that my father has given me will come so you see it's the word constantly the word now I'm speaking tonight upon the subject drawing from a text out of our text that we read God is identified by his characteristics the prophet of God takes a few moments to discuss the different birds and different animals and how they're identified by their characteristic we're we know you've heard those things many times but let's just drop down to the 26th verse and a verse is I guess it's still a verse even though it's not a Bible verse it says then we come down to a human life the characteristics between a man and a woman there's a difference they're both human beings but the characteristics of the two sects detects them I was reading some time ago about one of the problems that was put to the test of Solomon by the queen and she had some woman dressed like men and and Solomon had them to walk and do a few things quickly and said them's women see because that he could tell the way they did the characteristics of them was woman there's something about it that you can't hide it it's a woman because her characteristic disnotes her as to be a woman why do you think Satan is on such a great battle to obscure characteristic because God's identified by his characteristics you understand that it's constantly the word in the beginning was the word Phil he wants to obscure that identity of characteristic so he wants to change the way that man discerns and looks at things okay you realize that it starts a lot of times the course of unbelief it starts in the carnal Realm and the carnal world gets there and because the church world is dependent and relying on the carnal world for its existence did that you understand that that as the world changes they have to change their gospel to appeal you know the Baptist Church and I I've heard this with my own ears from Dr Criswell who was the president of the Baptist and the pastor of Dallas he said there was a time that the women in the Baptist Church would not wear pants to church but then the pants suit came in now what was that little way it was a way that the woman that was going to work could show up in the business World in a suit that's where they started they were pants suits there were suits for women and as that became accepted in the carnal world then the church world had to adapt to it you want to be stable God's word doesn't need to adapt because God's eternal so the all of it the whole of it is just him manifesting his attributes so what goes on outside of God doesn't change God so we have got to quit trying to take the word of God and trying to fit it to the world and trying to fit the world to the word there are two different separate things I get a lot of questions about should I go to Bible studies I don't care if if you want to get together with some people and have them I don't have any say over that I don't you want to visit churches I don't have any say over that I I don't want to rule people that way but let me tell you what happens you go there and they're reading the Bible and they're sweet and they've got an anointing and they they love God I'm saying this because I know what we're going to listen to and they love God and and and pretty soon you look at me and says well how can they not be Christians and naturally you have sympathy naturally you you and you want to know something are they elected I don't know that are they Christians yes what else could you call them but they're there's something that has not happened within them that can only happen to the elect and so that's where that that's what starts to happen there's another characteristic that you've got to be able to identify they can have all all those guys they did all those things right and then Solomon looked at him and he said do this they couldn't quite do that just right somebody said do this it couldn't let you gain no men and women you know they're all sweet until you say you know there's no such thing as a trinity the Bible says the woman shouldn't put on a garment pertains to a man oh what's starting to happen they're characteristics to that sweet little person that was wooing you into their fellowships will will grow fangs you know that's biblical right I believe it was improverty so she looks my mic's off oh I'm bleeding all right that's that's what happens when you get old I wish this flood could do you something good but all the blood's already been given to you that doing any good Gary run around see if there's a Band-Aid in my uh I bump my uh my hand on the corner of the pulpit here uh so you know that now you kind of now that true characteristic is identified so let's just read on here he says he says he says down here he says so everything is her characteristics to note that she's a woman it's just like right-handed and left-handed people they're both people you watch one of them is right-handed the other is Left-Handed watch the way their characteristics detect them you can tell whether they're right or left-handed or not I got a nurse putting my my band anybody no Deacon can do this I I got I got nurses around here is there a doctor in the house thank you brother so much I like it amen he says he says watch their characteristics the attempt to attack the left or right-handed he says yet they both got hands they both look exactly alike just exactly alike so what are we talking about being stabilization first of all to be stabilized you've got to be able to know how to remove things that are not determining factors yeah now when you read this message we're only going to listen to a little bit of it but when you read this message at Christ revealed in his own word the whole message is brother Brahms going forward is he's peeling away things that aren't the word he peels away baptism he peels away evidence he peels away this he he's taping all the things out of the way that are keeping the pure True Word of God from coming in full View now he's identified in his word right so everything that he spoke in the days of Moses he was identified in that day didn't matter what anybody else was doing what Pharaoh was doing or nothing it's what God was doing let's just hold what we what what we want to really be anchored in foreign that we find can be identified by its characteristics not its anointing but its characteristics so uh we're reading down here he says they look at just just exactly alike I might drop a little something here Jesus said in Matthew the 24th chapter that in the last days the two Spirits would be so close together until it would deceive the very elect if possible now you better know what you're looking for you better have a clear understanding when you come and contact things what is it that I'm looking for if and we'll listen to it in just a few minutes 25 minutes is it anointing wait till you hear it prophet of God says about an anointing is it signs and wonders wait till what he says about signs and wonders is it worship wait till you hear what he says about signs and wonders there's something that identifies the believer what separated the eagle from the chickens now that's just like looking at the right hand and the left hand they both got thumbs fingers nails small fingers middle fingers and so forth index they're all different fingers they both the thumb prints only one's turned one way the other the other both the same print made the same way only thumb prints everything is identified alike the only difference is is the characteristics of it no the one on the left hand and the one on the right hand that's the only difference so they're the same number if they're just turned different right that's the way the spirit will be in the last days they will just the characteristics of it will detect whether it's God or not one of them will be right and the other will be wrong and you'll only know it by the characteristics of God just perfectly it'll have to be that way the right hand would say it's right in the left was wrong see or vice versa one of them is determined by their characteristics you can only know it by their characteristics see they get so close right that you fall into the Trap of their personality their people people you know people you love and and if they're wrong they're wrong you can't defend it you can't explain it you can't make it fit you can't trim the puzzle piece it's God's puzzle he's going to put in there who he puts in there I'm not the maker of the puzzle I don't have to worry where the other pieces go I've got to make sure that I fit the spot that he spoke for me and that my characteristics match up to the characteristics of the spot that he wants me um he says you'll know it by its characteristics and and that is a uh just such a wonderful a thing there's so much more in that message uh but so it this morning one of the issues that the prophet of God brings up as we'll read it here uh see if I can find it he says today so much confusion about the evidence of the Holy Spirit and so forth one of the greatest confusions that our young people have and people have is the terminology borned again you must be born again well you can be living like the best you can live and then you get in a sermon and they're going to say you must be born again and the first thing you're going to ask am I Born Again am I Born depend am I Born Again so how can you identify whether somebody's born again or not it's got to be by characteristic now not by mistakes or no mistakes that's not the characteristic they're so close it would deceive the very elect now remember I'm just laying that Prelude because when we listen to our messenger talk it's only 25 minutes if it's just the start you can go home and finish the rest of it we'll touch on it here here and there but when you begin to understand what it means to be born again the birth is not the results the burst the baby I've seen some awful small babies that have grown into some awfully beautiful people I have two in mind Kayla Bill who's a giant he weighed like two pounds eight ounces or something and I don't mean to embarrass Natalie but she was uh very teeny baby and she's I think she's as tall as you isn't she like she's getting close the purse the baby and I want to just give a definition if I could say it to be borned again there's got to be something in there first okay to be born again is is having the predestinated germ seed that's in there quickened to live and grow to its predestinated end oh yeah that look like what does it mean to be born again now this is great paradox I I like how the whole thing just weren't I thought that's right down my line that almost came up and sat in the Pew and said keep going we we get in that question because we don't know how to identify the characteristic of the birth is constantly the what the word the word the word when it comes to that word just like King David just like many other people in the scripture when it came to that word despite their condition despite what they had done despite what they'd been through when it came to that word that part inside of them said that word is right I'm wrong I'm in sin I have failed but that word is true am I because that had been brought to life in them by the spirit of God remember it's the spirit that quickens the word spirit is not a second person it's not a third person it it's it it it it it is God in action the scripture even says the spirit of God didn't come to speak of itself but to bring you into remembrance of all the things which I've taught you look America you you are brought to life by life your birth no I can't get into all the things of who's false and who isn't that's not given but you personally have got to come to the place the evidence of the holy spirit is Jesus Christ revealed to you personally that's right in fact you know you're wrong because the spirit convicts you of sin what do you do you don't get reborned again you say I'm wrong I'm sorry Lord help me but if you're his child you were birthed his child your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life that germ seed was in you and the spirit of God comes through the preaching of the gospel and awakens that Revelation to you that that word is in you and now you're on a journey and every day on that Journey Satan's going to tell you you're not born again you're not his you got stink and flesh you're no good you can't do it you can't make it you did this you did that but a stabilized person knows if he planted it he'll finish it because the word of God cannot return void now I might have to go through some changes I might have to overcome some fears I might have to overcome some doubts that's why it's given to the overcomer but he also said all the father hath given he will come and nothing can plucked them out of the palm of my hand amen word word word it's always the word so as we listen you'll hear statements like so God and Sunday Times a diverse manner spake we won't listen to this but I want to read this just right before we play this is paragraph number 107. uh brother Mike if you want to put that up there and and read this before we listened this morning you'll you understand my purpose this morning there's a lot of confusion there's a lot of voices there's a lot of spirits a lot of anointings many people come into contact with places and they leave with the feeling they've got something we've got something you don't got right oh my answer to that is we got something we want you to have the only thing the believer wants is the word the only place you're going to find the word is in the word the word is in the promised word of the hour so this is what he says in this paragraph he says God took his own fingers and wrote on the sand one day and spoke he preached he prophesied with his own lips God did when he was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God manifested in flesh if he can write speak can he also tell others what to do certainly can he can talk to them in the human voice he can write and show them what to do he has done it so God in sun-dried times in diverse manners speak to the fathers through the prophets and he said as it is written that not one jot or Tittle shall pass away until it's fulfilled and then it's manifested then it will pass because it's manifested it can't pass then but just the word itself is made flesh jot means small word Tittle means small Mark not even one punctuation one expression anything shall ever fail in the word of God it can't fail because it's God manifested in the form of human flesh for it's God himself in letter form Prophet form manifested in flesh now that's the reason Jesus said the ones who spoke to you you call them Gods all gods if it's on the board who spoke to you by the word of God said and they were Gods those prophets when they were Anointed with the spirit of God they brought exactly the word of God then they were Gods it was God's word speaking through them thank you bring it over bring it over you have a prophet a Vindicated Prophet who was it speaking it was God speaking you want to be stabilized know who's speaking we don't need second-hand revelation that that's where the stabilization gets broke down people say things and it's it appears spiritual it it appears anointed it appears wonderful it feels great not how you identify it God's identified by his what his word that's why when you make a statement and it's in this next 25 minutes you'll we'll close with the plane of the tape you will understand anointed once at the end time you'll understand all those things it gets back to The Germ seed that's in you and its connection to the voice of God it's personal connection to the voice of God can God speak to you yes will he speak to you contrary to his word no a woman could come say God told me to preach Prophet God said well I'm not saying he didn't but it's contrary to his word if he told you to preach it's just to go out and deceive everybody he's going to listen to you but it's not the word it's not the word the only thing that stabilizes the believer is the word the word the word may manifest and we're just reading here he said in those prophets when they were Anointed with the spirit of God any bread he brought exactly the word of God then they were Gods it was God speaking through them the only they only interpreted as God would permit them to interpret now if you want to find that it's second Peter 1 and 20 and 21. all right because this were God's there's no private interpretation he does his own interpreting God speaks and interprets it himself then reveals it to whomsoever he will hides from all others he don't have to reveal it to anybody unless he wants to and he don't he he has expressed his whole thing in the scriptures therefore the whole thing is already made known it it's just he's just sitting there watching it happen see just seen the body be made and come back to its to the form his bride again I like that so this morning as we talked about it I want you to catch a couple notations that he's going to make he says if you took the wheat seed the heart and put it in a cuckleber and planted it it would come wheat now you say why because I feel that God planted a wheat seed in a cuckoo bird right but it was predestinated the wheat seed so I guess you listen this morning prophet of God's going to talk about gifts he's going to talk about anointings he's going to talk about a lot of things in this 25 minute but he's going to bring you back to the one thing that stabilizes the believer and it's the word it's this made flesh in our day is the word for our day God bless you let's just listen he's gonna if you have your Bibles open to Hebrews the first chapter and what we'll do is we'll stand as the prophet of God reads Hebrews 1 I believe one through three and then when he's done we'll sit down and listen to 25 minutes God bless you now we want to get ready and speak now on a little subject here that I chose for this morning by the help of the Lord and we'll speak just as briefly as he can because the hookup of the people I hope you all got a all across the nation got a fine morning like we have here in Indiana nice cool fine weather we're having now since the rain and it's very fine now I want to read from the book of Hebrews the first chapter and from the book of Saint John the first chapter Hebrews 1 1-3 and Saint John 1 1 for a text my subject this morning is a study in the scriptures now let's read Hebrews 1 1 God who at sundra times divers manners fake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets but in these last days spoken to us by his son who he has appointed heir of all things but whom also he made the world through being in the brightness of his glory and expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins set down on the right hand of the Majesty on high what a beautiful reading now Saint John 1 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now and my uh text this morning is Christ is revealed in his own word now where I come to the conclusion to talk on this was because that uh knowing that what we say we mustn't just say because we're gathered together to just haphazardly speak on anything but it's something that will help stabilize the people for uh we are going to pass through dangerous stretches Waters we're already sailing through them and sometimes I guess it's with you like it is with me that seems like that so much of it is such a scary eye just talking to a young Minister and his wife in the room just a few moments ago and both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world rest of the human beings on Earth I said remember Satan's got a Punch coming at you I don't care who you are God he's got to write for that one punch which had your rather be that punch be blind or be an arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous think he's got somewhere he could punch him he's got a right to that open place now that's the spots you got to keep covered all the time and to see this nervous age that we're living in and last week's tapes I think will reveal to you the great hideous things that we're going to speak on one of these days when we could get a place sufficient all the opening of those uh last plagues to be poured out upon the Earth those vows rather pouring out of the vials and the Seven Thunders and those hideous sites is coming up on the Earth man I now and people today are in such an erotic condition the whole world you read this last month's Reader's Digest you'll notice the subject ads on Billy Graham the great evangelist he got so tired he just couldn't hold his meetings and he he went to Mayo's clinic for a physical checkup well nothing wrong with him only it just doesn't do enough work and they put him to run in physical uh exercise he runs a mile every day then the article goes on to say that science has proved that today that young children these little boys and girls hit their middle age at 20 years old and by 25 many times in many cases your girls are out of menopause at 25 years old I don't know if you knew it or not but a few nights ago while the Holy Spirit was speaking here in the meeting a little girl sitting down here that's exactly what was wrong with that child when he called out I looked at her a second time looked again and I seen what was the matter I thought it can't be that child's too young but it was menopause about 20 years old 23 something like that see my mother and your mother struck that age about 45 to 50. my wife struck that age about 35. now it's down to 20. the whole human race is rotten well if them physical beings of our body is tearing down like that from eating hybrid Foods pensions as rotten it does not that also rot the brain cell then we can see how women can get on the street naked we can see how they can speed through the uh the streets at 120 miles an hour all these things it's come to a place where the whole nation whole world not only this nation but everywhere mentally gone and then when we opened up those the Lord willing on those seven vials that show those hideous things man will be so insane after a while to you imagine they're seeing ants the size of a mountain it'd be tormenting women be locusts come upon the earth a long hair to torment women who cut theirs off hair like women hanging out in long teeth like a lion Stingers in their tail like a scarf and and so forth the torment man upon the Earth but then it'll be too late to do anything about it you get right now Harmony and last Sunday when we was going into those Cycles about how that the five senses on the Outer Rim that's the inlet five senses to the body there's only one way you can get into the body that's for those five senses see tastes feel smell in here there's no other way to contact the the body on the inside of that man is the man called spirit and he has five senses think thought and uh thought and love and conscience and so forth all right now you can't think with your body you think with your mind and in there it's where too many of Christians only stop and they can just like the corn in the field and the weed in the field they can be Anointed with the same holy spirit that the real Believers Anointed with but down on the inside of that next Rim the third Rim is the soul and that's predestinated by God there's where the real sea germ lays is in there and remember if I take a of Burr and cut it open draft into it the heart of a of a wheat and put it there period it would bring forth a wheat out of the cocklebur no matter what the outside is what the emotions today so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of gift that God's Got it but he cannot bring that word word by word that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he's always failed that's where them the tape on false anointed ones are naughty ones they can be Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues thanks shout preach the gospel and steal the devil it's the inside I remember Jesus said all the father has given me will come to me no man could come except my father draws him first now we take it through the lesson to show that in you were in your great great great grandfather all the way back physically speaking then that's what you are in physical being natured sometimes a child will be born a family redheaded it astonishes the father causes nobody he knows of his people read it or the mothers but if you go way back to several Generations you'll find out somebody was redheaded that seed keeps coming on down and you come the nature of one from way back like as Hebrews the seventh chapter said that Melchizedek Abraham paid tithes to him when he's returning from the slaughter of the Kings and Levi who received highest paid tithes for he was in the loins of Melchizedek at are The Lawns of Abraham rather when he met Melchizedek now the same thing as this if you are a son of God and if I am a Son of God or a daughter of God we were in God at the beginning and when Jesus became the fullest of the word then we were in him germ Farm when he was crucified we was crucified in his body when he rose from the dead we rose with him and now since we have recognized it now we sit together with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus for he we if we are Sons and Daughters of God we are God's children then we are attributes of God then we were God eternal life and God is the only eternal life there is then we were in him from the beginning and when Jesus became all that word then we were part of him then amen there you are that's in there there's no devil no powers no nothing can ever move it that's the top post of the soul you can be anointed out here in this spirit and desire and do all these other things but when it comes to this top post to that word you'll never move from that a whole right studying true to that word as it can be outside of that regard so watch you do you're still lost that lady of seeing churches naked blind miserable don't even know it anointed Anointed with the real Spirit see that Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul is his germ that germ is the word they and how I don't care how much you preach how well you do this and how much you love that's one of the inlets the spirit you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the inlets and you can love and even love God still not be right you cast out devils and Priests and do these things still not be right Jesus said so that many would come in that day that word settles him in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelled Among Us notice I'm going to speak on this subject of the Bible of Christ revealed in his own word where I draw of this conclusion is in my room some dear person may be sitting here this morning I got a picture hanging in my study up there that's a picture of Hoffman's head of Christ wrote in the Beatitudes and right where you would come the place I can eat a part of the hair they press a little harder on the pen as you pass that part there he is setting in his word looking right out Christ into Beatitudes someone ever who it was a thank you part somebody brought that picture in put up a study there of Elijah going up in a chair to fire we appreciate these things many times big crowds I just don't get a chance to speak and say these things but I see it brother sister I I know it God knows it now I'm going to speak on this subject of Christ revealed in his own word how in the Beatitudes there stands a picture of Christ standing right out like that's where I thought of this subject uh Christ and the word is the same see you say how was the Bible people says us riding with a man not long ago he said think of it we here on this Earth the way we are and we only know or can only say that we're saved by some Jewish fable call the Bible I said sir I don't know how you say that but I don't believe it's a Jewish fable I said he said well you pray what do you pray to I ask for so and so on certain things I didn't get it I said you pray wrong we should never pray to change God's mind we should pray to change our mind God's mind don't need any changes it's right I said now what You Prayed For unto a young Catholic boy one time has had a prayer book saying prayers for his mother to live and she died and he sold a prayer book in the fire well see I don't go for the prayer book but anyhow see you take the wrong attitude you're trying to tell God what to do prayer should be Lord change me to fit your word not change uh not let me change your mind you change my mind you changed my mind to your will and your will is written here in the book Lord don't don't let me go till you got my my mindset it's like you're mine then when my mind is set like your mind then I'll leave every word you wrote and you said in there you make everything work together for good to them it loves you and I love you lord it's all working together for the good I've been this week down the country stand with some very dear friends I asked some of them at the table yesterday when I was eating we always sat around have a little like a little study on the Bible let's talk about love there's a certain person said to me said I believe you're an antichrist I said if that would be pleasing to my Lord that's what I want to be I want to be whatever he wants me to be I love him if he should cast me into hell are still up we're loving if I go with the same spirit I have now you looked at me kind of strange I've seen four or five of them there a young man young wives fine women I know how their boys love their wives so I said to them I said here's the way to test it if your wife before you were married now you go back say you this married life you've been dreaming you were married you really wasn't married but you dreamed you were and you woke up and you went and talked towards your girlfriend and said you know what I dream that we were married we had children we living happy and waiting for the coming of the Lord and everything and then this girl would say to you you know I love another man better than I love you I could be happier with the other man could you from your heart love her well enough say God's blessings rest upon you my dear go with this other man now now check that each of you man are you women see well if your love is correct you would do that for you are interested in her welfare what you know you could have her you can live with her yes she's your wife she will be she'll marry you but she won't be happy she'd be happier and then if you love her then you want her to be happy therefore whatever the will of God is that God's will be done whether I'm happy with it or not I want to live so he will be pleased with what I do therefore Checker your objective and your motive by that you know where you love God or not what if he'd say uh are you serving me if I'm going to cast you away I love you anyhow therefore if the churches would see that and could believe it in that manner it wouldn't be one trying to jerk the football away from the other fellow when he's running with it he'd be protecting that one when real true motive and objectives with me one try and say hey I got this too uh this is me and this see God can't use a man so much impersonation follows it and that's Satan and the people can't realize that you're trying to take the ball from somebody's been given let God raise up a certain Ministry and watch how many goes after him okay see now genuine love for God no matter what part I Am Lord if I can only say a word for it help protect you let me do that that's the same thing would be about your wife if you really love her see it's not a it's not a a filial love it's an agopal love a genuine love she could live with somebody else happier you're not married now of course you can't evaluate people listen to these tapes some so many sins and said well in the marriage of divorce you said this and you said that I've said that so many times these tapes goes only I'm speaking to my congregation brother I'm not responsible for what God gave you to Shepherd I'm responsible for what kind of food I feed these people this is for this Tabernacle only see now if the people want to listen to their tapes that's up to them but I'm speaking to what God has given to me it was their sins that was omitted someone wrote out said well I've done this and I've done that you said our sins I I didn't say that I said see it to this this is only to this people right here the people here in the Tabernacle my own flower now people want to hybrid food and stuff not there you you get the Revelation from God do what God tells you to do I'll do the same thing but these messages are to this church notice how we come back we've got to have something another that we have to hold on to something has to be a time folks in other words it's an ultimate and everyone must have an ultimate or an absolute I've preached on it one time years ago on an absolute a place that's the last word like the Umpire at a ball game if he says it's a strike that's just exactly what it is no matter how you've seen it the Umpire said it's a strike you said I I it wasn't a strike it went I see the no matter what it is when he said strike that's it that's settled he's the ultimate and the traffic light is an alternate if it says go uh you say well I I'm in a hurry I got no uh it says you stand still while the other fellow goes it's the ultimate now there's got to be an ultimate to everything you do there had to be an ultimate when you chose your wife there'd be a woman you had to select now there has to be a time where you're going to buy a car what kind of an ultimate you're going to make will be Ford Chevy Plymouth Park car whatever it is you got to have an Alderman and so is it with Christian Living there's got to be an ultimate now if a man said went to another man and said heard somebody say well you should be baptized and this fellow never maybe he is some church he didn't baptize it just sprinkled I think say Francis is the Methodist they do baptize if it's requested I understand or maybe the a Catholic I think they sprinkle only so then if if a man heard something about being immersed in the water but he didn't understand that he's raised Catholic so he goes up to the priest and said the father uh I understand that we're supposed to be baptized by any Mercy what does our church say about that why it says we're to be sprinkled that that church is his ultimate that settled it oh Strife is over the church said so and that's all what if the if the Baptist brother heard us say that we believe in being baptized by Mercy he said I believe that and in the name of Jesus Christ yeah this this member of the church goes back to the pastor says Pastor I heard a fellow say to me that we should be baptized by immersing all right but in the name of Jesus Christ well he said now let us see why here the book says that we're to be baptized using father son Holy Ghost if that church is the ultimate that settles it you don't care about what anything else says that's his ultimate whatever denomination is an ultimate to their believers but to me and to the ones that I hope that I'm leading to Christ and by Christ the Bible is our ultimate no matter of course God said that every man's word be a line mine truth and I believe that the Bible is God's ultimate no matter what anyone else says it's the ultimate the Bible is not a book of systems no sir it is not a book of systems nor a code of morals the Bible is not a book of systems so many systems and so forth no sir it is not a book of morals no sir it is not nor is it a book of History altogether or neither is it a book of theology or it is the revelation of Jesus Christ now if you'd like to read that you who have your papers marking it down that's Revelations 1 1-3 is the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ let us just read it while we got time I believe I haven't got too many notes here to speak from if the Lord Teresa we'll try to get from them the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him to show to his servant Saints which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified by his Angel to his servant John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that you're the word of this prophecy and keep the things which are written therein for the time is at hand so the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and it was wrote by Prophets Hebrews 1 1 in God who in sunrise times speak to the fathers by the prophets in this last day speaks to us through his son Jesus Christ which was the prophets all of them put together Jesus was Malachi Jesus was Jeremiah Isaiah Elijah all that they were worrying him and all that you are all I am is in him words Witnesses of the word so it is not a book of systems a code of moral ethics neither is it a history book or a book of theology it is not but it's a revelation of Jesus Christ God himself revealed from word to flesh that's what it is the Bible is the word and God is the flesh God in God is the word brother and Jesus being the flesh it's a revelation out of God the word was manifested in human flesh and revealed to us and that's why he becomes a son of God he is a part of God you understand now he is not the body is part of God so much that it's a son you can all go home and finish and then come back tonight and you'll be stabilized you understand what he's that what he's saying is so easy for us to go with anointing it's so easier for us to go with emotion it's so easiest to lean this way and lean that way he said but when it all comes to settling it when it all comes to getting your final answer your final determination go to the word now many people will take this Bible and you'll sit down with them they'll start reading this scripture in this scripture and you see all that you just stay there and wait and I'll guarantee you you'll find out that we had a Divine interpreter of the word in our generation it says exactly what it means to say so we can't go by what so many other things but there's one thing we know that if this has been quickened in your heart nothing will move you from it so don't even let your mistakes and your failures and the sin that so easily besets you move you from the word of God don't take a substitute for anything else the word of God's been given to you and you're a part of it and it was put there and now God's I just like how he said it it's all been finished in the scriptures now he's sitting back and watching his Church watching the word transform into his bride do you love him this morning just a little Bible lesson this morning just I wanted you to hear some of these things from the the messenger himself so you you don't get all uh when no matter what you see because they they Shout with her they all do that just stay still until you see that word come up and when it's the word is life amen God bless you let's stand this morning I hope that helps this morning for some you know it's it's it's wonderful uh having Congregation of veterans of different people at different places in life young Christians but we're all growing and that word's been birthed in our heart because we've heard that eagle scream and we're all going to grow into the sons and daughters that he wants us to be let us pray if you have a desire in your heart this morning you'd like to raise your hand and ask God to touch your heart you've had questions and even wondering about your own life wondering about your past wondering about things that you've said or done or if you could just sit still for a moment and realize that the word has your answer the word has your course and you'll not find it with your own feelings you'll find it in God's word let God's word speak to you Heavenly Father Lord you know the hearts of your people this morning they love you [Music] ordain in my heart I know this is treacherous times and lots of voices and lots of movements and but Lord you gave us something that was sure something that was Vindicated father in your great wisdom you allowed it to be caught and recorded knowing that this would be such an age of technology and fast-moving ideas and but you gave us a place that we could go to and that we all could be subject to we could all have the same absolute the ultimate and as you we heard this morning that a Christian life in order to have a Christian Life you have to have an ultimate you can't live without it you can't live with having many different voices talking to you you can't live with having many different feelings and emotions and anointings you have to have something that's settled in your life if he said it that settles it whether I understand it or not it's exactly the way he said it would be that's the stabilizer of our boat that's what keeps every wind from driving us to and fro but we're anchored father that you have spoke and we have heard and we have heard and we follow we're not hearers of the word only we're doers of the word Lord I ask this morning that the word of life we take hold that if there's a seed in our midst that hasn't been terminated father that you'd bring it to life and let the Christian that's within that life grow fathers it pushes out through
