house of god so you want to welcome everyone and it's certainly happy to be gathered here amen uh let's open our bibles we're going to read a couple of scriptures uh i think two of them we read them last time when we're here um first if a very familiar scripture reading hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and in first john chapter 1 verse 1 it says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes that which we have looked upon and our hands have handled it of the word of life for life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you the eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and have heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full so our joy comes from the fellowship when we realize we're coming to that same fellowship that we are being invited into it says this is this then is the message which we have heard of him and declared unto you that god is light and in him there's no darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness will lie and do not do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sins amen also for uh in john chapter 1 verse 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same with in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and life was the light of man and the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same this he says the the the same came for witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of the light amen god bless you may have your seats man we'll try not to be too long tonight i read in the bible where it says speaking too much is a sin so i try to it's just one phrase that um really spoke to my heart and i've been meditating on this for for a couple of days and and and i hope it will be a blessing to you and this came from the message that we were listening to things that are to be and runner makes this a statement it's paragraph 32 things started to be and he says now the only way that you could be a son and the daughter of god it says because you have you have be you it says you have to be you have to have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life it says only one form of eternal life that was god it says to be a son you have to be with him you have to have been with him always so there's never a time where you left him you always had to be with him and then it says the gene of of your life now he speaks is now saying the spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule if it says and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god amen and i want that to just sink in sometimes we hear those things and we just skip over it i want that to sink in so we were always with him and the gene of life all we are is the manifestation of the gene that was in god it says now you are expressed after the after his word has come to you in you to light up this age you are ex you are expressing god in you are expressing god's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of god therefore it says therefore you get what i mean you can't guess it said man it says you are now made you are now made you are getting in it says you are sitting in the church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation to this people to this neighbor where you associate and my title tonight is duty of expression amen duty of expression now as we read this and i want this because we the things of god are marvelous and oftentimes when we go it's easy to get lost in the greatness and the goodness and the things that god is speaking to us even the revelation of the word that we have heard in this end time but i i want us even tonight for just few moments like i said i won't be i won't be long but just for a few moments to just come to the realization of this last statement that he made it says you are sitting in this church tonight and we can literally say we are sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation to these people to this neighborhood where you associate so yeah you you you have to constantly be reminded that our existence is not this mortal life that we know our existence as we have it within the natural is not this earthly bound person who has to get a job who has to do this who has to do that but it says that our duty is to express god it says so so we we we have to understand that we are here to express something our lives is an expression of something regardless of whether we understand it whether we know or we don't know every day when we woke up in the morning from the time we woke up till we go to bed we are expressing different things when we go to work the way we interact with people the way we talk the way we conduct our business it's an expression that's going forth everything about us it's an expression the way we we conduct ourselves on the daily basis is an expression and our duty on earth is now being brought here in the he says is to manifest god firstly and that's our problem if we ever had a goal in life if we ever had a motive if we ever have something that would that's supposed to drive us that's supposed to excite us that we can walk up in the morning and find out that i have a family yes i have children i i have a job i have responsibility but what's my primary goal as i'm sitting as i just walking up and taking the breath of life within my lungs what is it that i'm supposed to do is saying is to express god to express god to our family to our neighbors to our coworkers to people around us to to have that's our primary duties as christians now we why is that important because you realize i was thinking about you you look at the elements of the world around us everything that we see happening the seasons and the times that we are living in it's only built for you to express frustration it's built for you to express some type of people giving up and it's constantly frustrations you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow we look at its disappointment it's lost of hope and people losing the children all kinds of chaos it's not an environment that's set for someone to walk up in the morning and be happy and go out and and just be happy and come back everyone everyone has a concern people are looking and what's going to happen tomorrow whether it be christian or non-christian it didn't matter they go out there and and it's it's constant frustrations and and the way the system is built my goodness it's made uh every dollar you make it's try to be taken out in every manner you know you pay the bills the bills never comes the same today it's more tomorrow it's more and it keeps going up and and there's no loyalty a person who's been subscribed to to some companies for years and years and every year they'll go up and you have to change and go somewhere so it's never built for you to have a peace of mind and say oh it's so wonderful it's built to have this frustration a constant frustration a constant disappointment and people don't know they can't trust politician they can't trust the economy they can't trust all of that but it's in that condition that god is putting you here as we read for you to manifest the expression of god and that expression is if i can sum it up even perhaps this being the summary of the whole thing i want to talk about is for so that the world out there they'll know that they they're not stuck in the condition that they're in that there is another option that exists and god is here to do that amen yes sir a person can have could have gone to a doctor and gotten the worst report that the reason a person didn't win and they lost their job and and then constant disappointment and and meeting the needs and and don't know where they're gonna get the next meal and but when they come in contact with you you have to remember your job is not to share the frustration your journey your job is not to to include or to sympathize within the frustration but after all is said and done your job is to let that person know that this is not the end of you that there is a living god and is here i am his ex his expression i'm here to express to you that this is not the end of you amen and if we can have that every day that we work up in the morning every time certain tries to rattles us if we can come back to the place and come back and realize listen i'm not here to multiply the frustration i'm not here to perpetrate the frustration i'm not here to take my frustration and give it to another my job is when the frustration comes that i can reach back and know that i am the expression of god to this generation yes sir amen but speaks about uh the age being such a neurotic age it says it talks about how a doctor needs another doctor and and and this one needs to go and see the psychiatrist needs another psychiatrist that he could talk to you you know i was thinking about it you know you i i grew up in the time that i grew up uh you know in the 70s towards the end you you know you you come you grow up and they tell you education is very important you need to be educated you need to go to school you need to do this and you need to do that now we live in a time where people that are in entertainment people that are playing sports and all those things people that are not in the education they make more money than a than a doctor who can perform a a brain surgery everything is upside down it don't make no sense anymore but it's in that time that we have to be very aware of what is it that i'm called to express what as i'm here during this condition what is it what is my purpose of being here is that i'm here to express god in this multitude of things that are going on yes sir what madam says in the message it says here in the message identification the uh identification he speaks it says then see god came down and the character of god was in christ it says and he he was he was the reflection he was god made visible notice god made visible it says in the beginning was god it wasn't even god then but god in he says in an object of worship the only thing that was it was eternal in him was attribute and the attributes were the thoughts and the thoughts were were expressed in the word the word was made flesh it says what is it it says it's all god becoming tangible and you are part of god and jesus came to redeem those that was put that was that was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world he was in god's thought and that's what he came to redeem and then as soon as he strikes them it strikes it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there it says but if the life is in it isn't there then what can they do he says see they don't see it they will never see it and the whole thing as jesus says all day it says you'll know that i mean god that i mean the father and the father in me and i in you and the whole thing is god becoming material like a husband and a wife becoming one together and god and his church is becoming one now it's very important because i was thinking about this i said yeah we are we sit here and you know we we hear those things it's god becoming material it's god becoming material and oftentimes i expression when we say we're here as the bride of christ to express god all we think about is oh to come to a place where i need to create the squirrel or i need to do something marvelous i need to touch somebody and they get healed instantly then i'll know that i'm the expression of god no that could be the ultimate expression that could be where we are going into but as for as far as it begins there has to be someone playing that role from the beginning he was faithful in little could be faithful in much there has to be the expression that starts to show out of you in order for you to grow to that level that's right amen now we we as we read yeah you see the the scripture says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god how is it going to happen the same word that created the heavens and the earth the same word that came and and the scripture says he was there the same word that abides in the prophet and he expressed himself through the prophet why because it was the promised word and that same word that came to mary and when that word came to mary that same word brought the expression of jesus christ when that same word comes in you it's supposed to bring the same expression of the same god not a different god of the same god and how is he going to do it he's going to do it the same way he did it in mary because he says the word is in the bride as it was in mary yes sir amen so therefore uh we we it says we are now made we are sitting in church tonight because our duty is to express god to this nation is to express god to this people to the to to our neighborhood and to our associate so the purpose of life the duty that we have is the duty of expression and the expression of who not the expression of ourselves but the expression of the living god but one of them says in the message sir we would see jesus he says all these attributes all things all these things are attributes of god it says the bible says it says you will know that as i am in my father and my father in me and i in you and you in me it's god becoming tangible he says again it says your own life you and your husband your your so your own your i says you you own your own wife you and your husband it says is a shadow or a negative of god and his wife the church it's just the app it's just god's attributes being displayed in shadows and type like the old testament and the new then in the end it will all wind up god tangible god in christ tangible made flesh dwelling among us in the great millennium to come god in the form of christ sits up upon the throne of david and the church his bride husband and wife together why it says it says it's it's enough to set our heart the heart of a believer on fire if the it says in this great hour that we are living in when we hope when the hope of all the nations and everything else is crumbling on us under us we've got a kingdom we are baptized in this kingdom so now a year he is he's he's bringing it back to us to to come to the place where we realize it says as god was as my as my father was in me and i in my father says so will i be in you was in me and i in my father says so will i be in you and you and me is bringing to show you that it's the same manifestation that's going to continue so god's intention was not for him to be manifested in christ but yet when it comes to the manifestation of the end time it becomes differently but here is saying he's saying it's the same expression it's going to come to pass the same way that he did when he was manifested in christ in other words it was a word of promise the scripture says that isaiah stood up and says a virgin shall conceive and that word travels for thousands of years and and yet he came and he anchored into the womb of mary and mary the angel came and visited her and spoke to her the word and he says you shall conceive that which was promised was going to come to pass she wondered perhaps as we're wondering tonight how will that come to pass it says don't worry the angels will the holy spirit will overshadow you and that which will come from you will be from on eye but you shall bear a son and her response to the word was let it be unto me according to thy word and through that word or through her belief in the word of god the expression came forth she all she did was to believe and receive the word which came to her where that was spoken to ever an angel and she took the word within her she believed the world she professed the word she confessed that she had heard from an angel she confessed that she was going to receive a child without knowing a man she confessed and she went and in fact she spoke and the child john who was an elizabeth womb who was never who was not breathing who was not alive when the first name of jesus was pronounced he came back to life it wasn't mary's doing mary believed and the promise came to pass and the same god is here saying he's telling us he's saying that the same way that i was in god and i was manifested the same way that i was in god and guarding me it says the same word i will be in you i will come for that same manifestation at the end time and you shall be an expression of even me how am i going to express it it's by the promised word of the end time that it said that he will come the manifestation of the end time he will be him in the bright form and by believing that manifestation we are allowing him to come and be manifested through us yes amen but if we continue to look at ourselves and say how am i going to bring this you know how am i going to bring this to pass and what do i need to do to bring in the breath believe the word believe the word walk in the word do what the word says continue to believe the word and let him perform what he promised he will do god didn't intend for us to just come here and say oh the lord is good and and he died for us and he did all that he can and go home and say i'm gonna do my best to just please him that was never god's intention every promise that god has ever bring it's always him coming on the scene it's always him becoming material he says the whole thing is god oh if we can understand the expression of god didn't stop when he made the creation that was just the first expression that he wanted and when he came in he was manifested in the prophet that was not the end of the expression when he was manifested in christ that was not the end of the expression because when he was in christ in fact he did it but i i have a quote somehow but he says that he did it knowing that there will be others that are going to come behind him to fulfill and to perform and to do the same thing that he was doing yes sir amen why because they were part of the word just as he was the word yes sir amen and i'll say this the word doesn't need us to vindicate it if we are the word we don't need somebody to vandicate us and tell us you are the word oh yeah you know this is why what the word no when god is god and because he's god he does godly things because of who he is he does what he does it's part of his responsibility it's part of who he is it's part of his makeup and as the children of god we don't need somebody we don't need to be vindicated we know when we hear the word we believe the word and the word out of us will be vindicated authentication is not something that comes from outside to show us all yeah this is it this is you no our vindication is we have heard the word something within our heart believe the word and because we believe the word we become performers of the word now he says here he says here he says in the message what was the holy spirit given for he says we are we are in the day now back there there was half as smart as today they could make atomic bombs and and uh automobiles and he says they didn't they didn't have science or things as we are as we have now but but things of mysterious things to try to say man blowed up blood together by some dust and so forth and take the analysis and try to prove uh to try to prove it to make infidel out of people but now we need it it says the spirit of god the spirit of god raises the standard what is it his pouring is pouring his spirit then those who are resting out yonder in the grave out on the altar of on the altar of god as the scripture says are crying how long o lord how long how much longer god is waiting on me and you so as we see here we have to be reminded that we are the expression we are put here to be the expression and it's not what god needs to do it's what we need to believe in order for us to be to to fulfill or to perform or to walk in the expression that's been given to us so it's saying that god is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when god can pour into us his fullness oh i thought we're supposed to only have a measure so god can pull into us is fullness his power his resurrection then when the church and christ become so close together till christ becomes visible among us and raise the dead and we go into the rapture amen oh my let it pour himself into me let him pour himself into us what we need to do is to empty of our own thoughts and empty of our own ideas let our empty of our own thinking often time we we go and we we have some millions on how god is supposed to perform it well if i do this god will perform it if i do that god will perform it if i go here god will perform it no no let god be his own interpreter let him take our lives let him walk you up in the morning let him tell you where to go let him tell you what to touch let him tell you who to talk to let him bring somebody let you just be ready that when he comes that i am the expression and i'm supposed to speak out amen we try to interpret our own lives and we try to give meaning to our own lives where god is saying you believe the word and let me do the interpretation amen the scripture the prophet tells us that god's interpretation god interprets his word by bringing it to pass in other words when we read this word of god god's intention was not just for us to read it and say god said so god said so no god's intention was for the word to be a living word a word that can touch somebody a word that can talk to a sinner a word that can touch a sick body and the body gets healed a word that can move a word that can talk a word that can act a word that can go and perform what the word said it would do yes sir amen and that word this is the written word that gives us the framework of what the living word is going to do this is what's written that becomes alive and walk in the midst of the people yes sir amen now i want to say this i said i was speaking on duty of expression now when you when you when you when you say duty the word duty means moral or legal obligation or responsibility to repeat that the word duty means moral or legal obligation or responsibility and to express is the process of making something known once thoughts of feeling it's also to convey express is to convey a thought or a feeling and it's done either in words or gesture or conduct now i want to now tie the two so our duty of expression when you when you say the word duty moral obligation or responsibility you you it's directly connected to a position i don't miss that when you it's it's somebody's duty it means there are some responsibility some position something that ties them to it like i'll give an example like for instance a person who's in the military uh they will go and they'll go and they'll get trained they'll get given uniform they get given everything and then they go so if they need them for duty they were trained they were given what it takes for them to perform the job therefore when they are called to be to express they are only going to express the training that they've been given they're only going to express everything they can only operate within the duty of what they're given we we can say as parents we have duty to our children we have a duty to feed them we have a duty to to dress them to take care of them why because we have been given the power to have children and therefore we are giving even also the duty to take care of them it's like an employer and an employee when you when you get hired and you get a job uh your duties are based on what position you were hired for in other words they cannot ask you something that you were never hired for that's not within your equipment they cannot ask you to do the job without the proper training for that job because if you messed up it's not your responsibility it's the responsibility of the one who hired you my brother my sister we've been made christians we've been called to be sons and daughters of god god could not call you a son or a daughter without equipping you with what you need in order for you to perform that job so when he says it's your duty to express god that means there is a part of you that comes from god that means there's some ability that god possessed that is deposited in you that means there's a part that is placing you that gives you the ability to carry out what responsibility he wants you to carry amen hallelujah otherwise he's asking us to do the wrong thing otherwise we are operating in venture otherwise we are doing we are impersonating something but oh if he called us to be the bride of jesus christ that means he has equipped us for us to be able to perform the job at hand amen he says in christ identify christ identified the same in all ages it says god like in the beginning he was he wasn't really god it was just eternal god our english word means object of worship and he's nothing there it was nothing to worship him it was self-existing hello him he said so there was nothing to worship him so he was just an eternal god but in him was attributes and attributes is a taught that just like you are just like you have uh you have to think of anything before you speak it then when you speak it it becomes a word and then he is eternal and in in in him was it was attribute and he spoke it and it was the word and the word is manifest and he was the word manifest god becoming material in in in god's provided way he says look i will prove i will prove it to you that it's satan when satan met jesus and says if thou be the son of god you you can do uh you can do this miracle now you are a divine healer it says make those stones uh bread and i will believe you is that right see the fatherhood of the spirit is it says took him up to the temple and now look it's written in the scripture here like like the point in mark 16 to us today says it's written in the scripture here he gave he gives angel charges over thee lest at any time thou dash thy foot uh their beardy their bear up it says jump down off this and then when you get to the ground they'll bury yourself they'll they will they'll bear yourself up see he gave him a scripture jesus turn around and say thou shall not tempt the lord thy god that's right is that is that written that's right he put the scripture right back to him god has a provided way if a doctor sure if it's it's the doctor do it's your duty to go to the doctor it's your duty to do whatever he says to you but look brother when you when you go to the place where the doctor can't help you you've got the right to call on god oh i tell you when i read that it just sparked something on my heart he begins to detail what duty of expressions that we have as a believer as we go around and as we live in this world what what's the duty of a believer he says if you are sick you have a duty to go to a doctor you have to go and see him and everything but if that doctor comes back and he he's done all that he can for you and he can't help you you have a duty to go to god because remember at the end it's god who works through the doctor but if the doctor can do it god is obligated he says when you when you are dude when you stand and you do your duty for god it says god has a duty to back you up yes sir when you stand and believe god and stand at your poster duty and say i'm standing on the word of god i'm standing here because the word taught me to do this it says when you stand and you do that if it doesn't work it says god is obligated to come and back you up if the doctor can't help you god will come and back you up he says we have a duty to win lost souls think of it i want you to think about this i'm talking about god becoming material again it's easy for us to see here and talk about god's manifestation in christ we love to talk about it how that he went through the cross and the things that he had to do but we forget the prophet tells us great is the mystery of godliness it was god manifested in the flesh like the flesh you're sitting in with that tonight it wasn't a heavenly flesh that never felt any pains or anything it's a flesh that got hungry it's a flesh that felt pain it's a flesh that cried it's a flesh that got tired it was a flesh just like the flesh you have but it within it there was god expressing himself through that flesh and though he was tired all those things will happen that flesh will stand up and say i have need to go to samaria why because it was time for a different expression why it was time for god to move and go do something that flesh will go to the pool of bethesda and see one who couldn't throw himself in the water and look at him and says take up that bed and walk why it was the same flesh it was the same flesh that was hungry couple hours ago therefore we cannot use our humanity as an excuse god wants to take your humanity he wants to take it and out of that humanity manifests the expression of himself amen he is not interested in doing it in a heavenly body he wants to do it within this body of flesh with his failure with all that he contains with his mistakes and with all of those things he wants to take the flesh and make you realize that it's a duty for god to reflect himself in this flesh he i remember he was talking about a story where i believe he was in the museum and he saw this group of children they were going and they had this tour guide and and they stopped by as i believe it was this skeleton a whale and something like that he began to show them it says oh look at this well it says the bible tells some story about a person being swallowed up in here and look at this it says and then he began to measure says how possibly can a human be swallowed up by this look at how big it is the prophet said i heard it i heard it and i couldn't take it oh he had he felt he had a duty to let that person know you are mistaken you don't know what you're talking about he came back and he says so i want to let you know it wasn't just a fish it was a special prepared fish a feast that was made to do the job and i want to say this we are a fish that's meant to do the job you said i'm just a human yes you are but you are not just a human you are a person your upbringing brother what a david just said it a moment ago how you were born how you were constructed from the family that you were born in the complexes that you have the fears that you have everything about you just like it was in christ just like it was in the prophet the same god is here manifesting himself in you yes sir amen you think he wasn't aware of the prophet complexes absolutely and new jersey said to you moses said i can speak in the first place he said yeah i know i'm giving you aaron to go with you god wants to use our weaknesses for his strengths god but if you can understand there's more god to be revealed than we can ever understand within our human mind it says the whole thing it's god the planning is god the execution is god the timing is god the words that you speak is god everything is god he's just looking for willing vessels that are gonna stand and say god use me i yes i have weaknesses yes i can't speak yes i don't even know how to start i don't even know what to say he says you not worry about it you stand as a vessel and i will fill you up it's not your own expression it's my expression that i'm trying to bring out it's my expression at the end time the same way i was manifested in christ the same way we've seen him take the vessel in the end time and we've seen him fill that vessel so much that we called him god we looked at him and people mistaken and says this cannot be a human this is god now remember in perfect faith but when he speaks about the scroll he's saying that god did that to challenge his own faith he did it so that he will know that there was more that he was able to do that is more that god was trying to bring out of him it's the same way when we see that when we see a man that's so give himself in the hand of god until he can act and and and speak and and see things that are far off an act of same manner that god will like it's for us to know that that's what we are coming into yes sir it's the chief way of offering but the expression cannot come unless there's a complete surrender unless is a complete giving up unless there's an awareness listen i don't have to partake of the things of laodicea i'm not here to partake of the pleasures of the world i'll say this but when i'm says jesus had the right to marry he had a right to have children he had a right to have a good time he had a right to do everything that you're doing he had a right as a human to all those things but oh my he understood that he had an expression to bring forth therefore he surrendered himself into the hands of god he said father let it not be my will but let it be your will so the father came and filled up that vessel so he can come and bring forth and why did he do it why is it so important we can see the humanity of jesus christ it's because god wanted to see for us to see that he's operating the same way with you and i am yes sir he says and i tell you brothers when i feel when i feel that resurrecting transformation power of the lord jesus christ circling through a human body it says that gives that perfect assurance it says there's more joy in that in five minutes than there is in the whole world pressure it says that could have that the whole wide world pressure that could ever be given that resurrection power it says well the night a sinner comes to the altar she was sitting back there and crying too and i said look i said now look says you see you see you see where's where my joy is i said i'm happier right now than all the things that could that that you could give me in the world the world and all its power would never take the place of this see you say see souls coming there's something in there say what is it there's there is there's none of you it says that's that's none of your business oh yes yes it is too it says it's the business of every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god to see christians coming into the kingdom amen it's your duty it's your business what a joy it is when that happens over everything that god uses he brings into the mid into the kingdom he brings it as part of the restoration plan as part of the redemption plan it says it's it's it's her duty he speaks as a believer it's our duty to pray when we hear that somebody's psycho when we hear something is happening we hear this is needed this is needed we can't just come in here and say oh you know what we already prayed about it over the altar somebody went and prayed and i'll go home it's none of my business no it's your duty to pray it's your duty to pray i i was reading a story where random speaks about it says a woman she was praying she was fasting and praying in order to cast out some devils and everything and she said i prayed and i prayed and i fasted and i came and i prayed and to try to cast the devils he said they wouldn't go away but one of them said it says it's your duty to fast but it says and pray but it's it says but as you do that the holy ghost will move upon somebody else to go and cast those demons i said oh my we here we are we want god to move we want god to move among us we want to see the expression it's our duty to express god to one another but one of them says it's the duty of a believer every time the church door opens for him to be there but how are we going to get to the greater expression when we keep missing this step-by-step expression that's actually building up to something what if you were needed for something to happen what if your presence was what was needed in order for something to move forward what was your contribution what if it was your contribution that was needed in order to bring it right where it was needed right good brother amen we we have a duty i'm a christian i'm i'm i'm called to live right i'm i'm called to do right i'm i'm i'm constant i'm called to think right i'm caused to do i'm called to do those things why because it's part of the expression it's part of the expression it's those expressions that leads to the fullness being put into the body yes sir therefore when we come we have to be under the expression but it says the church will come to where where sin is called in where a sinner comes in sin is called right in at the door is it our expression is it our expectation to come to the fullness where those things are being manifested they said god i want to play my part what is my duty as a christian what is my duty to my brother what is my duty to my sister what is my duty to the body what am i what is my contribution what is my responsibility what is my part to play because only when those things are happening that's when the body is fitted and joined each one supplying the need of the other yes sir who's that that's christ in his fullness in his body i tell you i remember a time where you know not even long ago you know you sit there and your body is sicken and you hardly can say a prayer you hardly can say much you hardly have the strength to even pray or say much oh i tell you it's such a comforting to just know or to just have hands laid on you it's not the people's hands it's christ's hands when a person goes with doubt and and then you just hear a knock at the door somebody brings food or somebody brings you some food or something to eat it's christ's expression when when when the need is somewhere and and you put it within your heart i'm going to do what i can in order for me for me to fulfill that need if there's a need somewhere god i want you to place a burden on my heart so i can go and take care of it what is it it's the manifestation of the same god oh my part of my sister we are called to be an invincible army the scripture says what random tells us that it says when she realizes who she is what is the realization who she is in knowing what duty she has what responsibility she has what's been given to her for her to fulfill all of those things when she realizes those things and she begins to take care of all of those things that's when she becomes an invincible army when one of them is sick they know you devil you have no business being there devil you have no business taking uh holding hostage one of the sons and one of the daughters they go and they pray and they shake the devil out of it why because they realize it's their job it's their responsibility to do it christ being manifested in his body it says it's your duty to manifest to express god to your to the people through your neighbors through the church to everybody you come in contact with and i say god fill me with that expression let me be aware of it as i walk this world i want to be aware of my expression i don't want to let anything slip i want to be aware when i see time for the expression i said this is my time to worst price itself you hear somebody sick you said can i pray for you i hear you're saying i don't you don't have to know the person oh i'm sick and this is you know god can heal you well i'm just showing you another avenue well the doctors have told you that but that's not the end of it i know there's a god that could heal you know i know you're going through hard times but i know there's a god who could deliver i know you're struggling but i know a god who can restore but this what is it it's his expression being manifested everywhere oh parvanam says he was walking and there he was just walking and this woman with his holy child dead and they were taking him in to go bury him and then he came in contact with life what do you think happened amen in the same way that that dead child came in contact with life and he was raised from the dead the same way people that are meeting you they are coming in contact with life don't let them dead don't leave them that i say just talk to them and see if life could be restored in there amen it's not your job to know whether it's going to happen or not but it's your duty to do that yes sir to express him and he is duty bound to come and manifest himself if you can stand tonight [Applause] one place and i believe it's on the prayer line it says speaks about christ it says you're the word and there were all of this and they were crying and he came and says he stood right there he says who was he he says see he was the word in action the word in action and as he said that that word just stuck to me i said we're called to be the word in action the word that actually goes and touches somebody you know but when it says they stop reading the bible they stop going to church they stop listening to anything that has to do with god and the only contact of god they has is you and there's never been anyone who's come in contact with god and remained the same now i know we can easily attribute that to jesus but we can also easily attribute it to ourselves we're not called to just believe the simple things and the easy things we are called to believe the body changed we are called to believe things that the mind cannot understand how is it that i touch somebody with my hand and somehow there's a power that comes on the person and heals them i don't know but i believe it i've seen it come to pass i don't understand how can it be that they lay hands on you and supernaturally you are well i don't know but i felt it i can't explain it i felt it how is it that you can speak to somebody and they had thoughts to suicide and all kinds of things and all of a sudden the mind is changing they go on and they go on to do right what is it i don't know it's the word of god it says to do it and i did it and it happened oh my brother my sister let god be the interpreter of his own word let's do the duo let's be the doer and let him come and interpret what he wants to do with us let's just bow our heads our gracious father so thankful to be your children tonight and lord our joy is that you've called us lord in this end time and and father we are so happy and so motivated lord to do your will and to do your to go your way and father i pray tonight that father that we may come to that realization of the expression you're trying to bring out of us father to walk in the way that you have played before us lord the things which you have promised lord that's our desire that we may manifest each and every one of them we thank you lord we commit all where we are father we ask that you may come even right now if there be any sick and father those that are sick and whatever they need is tonight father i pray that you may touch it oh god and heal them all father i pray that you mary restore our sister lord his finger that you may just remove the pain and touch your lord we committed to your hands we love you and ask us things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen hey man just play something i'll pick up on it you know what billy shared with us tonight was the first thing that satan took away from the church it was called nicoladianism and so we say they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover they created a day it was they the preachers they the people they they they they gave up me for they they gave their position away in christ to a clergy to a doctrine to somebody else to man [Music] and you know we're here to do this message was to do it was to restore us back to our rightful position i'm the one that lays hands on the sin i'm the one that passed out devils i'm the one that goes into all the world and is a witness that's me that ain't brother mcgary it ain't the church it ain't the ministry i wish there wasn't even such a thing as the word minister [Music] it should be servant when did it become reverent and exalted above the people anything that's exalted above something robs that person of the dignity and respect that god's given them paul said you're not the lord over god's heritage but you've got to rise up we've got to break the curse of nickelodeon-ism [Music] you've got to break the curse of looking at people and think an ability and and the ability to speak or the ability to stand in public or the ability or or the position you've got to break the curse of that holding you down you've got to rise above it

tonight glad your hands are ready you believe that you've got god's equipped you to bless the person that you're praying for are we going to be a body that ministers one to another tonight are we going to believe that within me there's something that god put in me that can go out to others our heavenly father [Music] our hands are laid on one another because it's our desire that we can express the love that you've had for us that they'll know that we are your disciples by our love one for another that these signs shall follow them that believe father that they shall lay their hands on the sick they shall recover they shake take up deadly things and they shall not harm them for they shall cast out spirits and and doubts and fears lord each member each person full of your spirit full of
