don't he loves you and he can woo you and and come along as our brother said he said he Broods over you you know and and brooding is to give attention to something and nurture it because you have an intended result and the Holy Spirit can come and brood over you tonight you might not even want him to and you might be fighting God but he'll just come around and wrap those Arms Of Love around you and start brooding you and pretty soon you know what you'll find out you'll find out he's worth it all he's more than precious he's wonderful amen so let's stand together tonight we turn the service

the desire of your heart and he said you know people don't have because they don't ask and he said ask believing you say you know you don't know what the result might be or how he'll do it he never asked you to figure out how he was going to do it he asked two things one it's your heart's desire another words you want it done and two you believe that he is God and he's able to do what he

we had a wonderful young people service and the little ones just entered right in and I just feel real at home and so I appreciate a meeting where they're asking the Holy Spirit to have control and so we're just trying to relax here this evening we'll go straight to the scriptures if we can turn to Romans chapter 8 I appreciate it musicians God bless you and I would like to start with Romans um chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 and we'll start with verse one everybody there there's the therefore now no condemnation Amen to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are of the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it shall not for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you are not not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be the spirit of God dwell in you right and if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the but the spirit is life because of righteousness and if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised rais Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you I would like to preach tonight on the law of the spirit of life and I would like to subtitle this this evening two [Music] laws if you have a need you'd like to lift before the Lord you just raise it to God God sees your hand he knows your need God cares for your need let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus Lord we have done everything we know to welcome you in this place the songs have been sung worship Lord from our hearts and Lord we thank you for an opportunity to come in your presence and I pray Lord God As We Gather in faith dear God that the darkness will begin to disperse and Lord that life that the Holy Spirit Will begin to move among our hearts Lord draw us closer to you and I pray dear God that you meet every need every hand that was lifted I pray God you supply everything we have need of God we love you from the bottom of our hearts we ask these things in Jesus name amen God bless you you can have your seats thank you brother thank you so much brother brandham taught us that sin did not originate in the Garden of Eden but that rather sin had originated in heaven and I I would not even be able to describe what the Angelic Wars look like as we know that there were Angel Angelic Wars between Michael and Satan and there was angels I I could only imagine what war in heaven would look like but we do know that Michael had cast out Lucifer and brother brandham said when Luther L Lucifer was cast out Angelic War became human battles and Satan came into this place to kill to steal and to destroy and now there are two governing Powers there are only two powers that is God's power and Satan's power there is life and death and we're in a battle right here tonight amen how many can say amen amen and we know here if you will pull up that first slide I've got a lot of scripture so if you will just stay right with me tonight it says here wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin so death passed upon all men for all have sinned so Satan gained control of the earth through sin right and Satan is the author of sin he is the author of sickness he is the author of disease he's the author of confusion he is the Prince of Darkness he is the father of lies he's full of perversion there's he is only death he's the author of death and from the scripture the law of sin and death came into the human race can you say amen amen next slide please The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law that sounds a little strange but to to to get a an understanding or a grasp of this where there is no law there is no transgression that's right but when God brought a holy law what it did was it showed us we were transgressors that's right and the law brought sin into view and When sin come into the view the law brought death to the human race because God is just and a law without pen Y is not so if there was a law then there must be a penalty to it and that penalty condemned everyone who was born in sin so the law that came from God condemned us and could not save us it was a policeman it it would put us in prison but it could not save us so how many remember on SI Mount Si when and God gave the law to Moses and bear with me follow me now and uh I'm I'm moving somewhere how many remember Sinai if you ever see the pictures the Bible said God thundered upon siai the whole place quak and and and not even an animal could touch the border of the mountain and and he said it'll be killed anything that touches the mountain it it was it was God's just law and the people begin to scream let us brother bam said it was God's judgment seat next slide and the Bible said we know that whatsoever things the law saith it saith to them that are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world become guilty before God therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin so as good as the law was there was no salvation in it that we could never be saved by a law of God it only showed us our condition turn with me if you will got your Bibles let's turn to Romans chapter 7 praise the Lord amen say Amen when you find your places Romans chap 7 verse 7 he says what shall we say then is the law sin God forbid nay I had not known sin wrought in me all manner of co uh cence which is lust and without the law sin was dead in other other words he said the law was damning up the flood of my own sinful lust and and that law just caused it to swell meaning that the law the when the law said Thou shalt not my own lust rose up within me that's right and he said I was alive without the law once but when the Commandment came sin revived and I died and the Commandment which was ordained to life I found to be death wow for sin taking occasion by the Commandment deceive me and slew me wherefore the laws holy and the Commandment holy and just and good was then that which good is good made death unto me God forbid but sin that it might appear sin working death in Me by that that which is good that sin by the Commandment might become exceeding sinful everybody staying with me so now God's justice which is the law required blood and God's God's requirement was satisfied at Calvary Hallelujah and God by Grace cleansed away back into the heart of men is that right and that day at calary when Jesus when Jesus was crucified he paid the penalty for our sin he took the law upon he took the all of our sins upon Him amen see s through the entire creation into bondage it throwed Every Creature into bondage it threw every teenager into bondage it threw every man woman and child into bondage and we were wanders upon the Earth we were lost without God but that day at Calvary nobody could ever visit Calvary and be the same that's when God's law was satisfied that's when God's justice was satisfied and that's where Jesus brought a death blow to the power of Darkness Hallelujah brother Brenham said Satan's back was broken at Calvary every one of us was set free at Calvary Hallelujah do you believe that Jesus opened the prison doors at Calvary he set every man woman and child free at Calvary if you're ever going to be free it's because you will see Calvary and what had done for you if you're going to receive something from God tonight you'll be looking toward Calvary to get it if you want the Holy Ghost you got to look to Calvary if you want healing you've got to look to Calvary if you want Victory you've got to look to Calvary Hallelujah that's right because SI was the law of death but Calvary brought the law of Life Hallelujah Sinai condemned the entire race but Calvary liberated mankind do you see it and the blood of Jesus Christ remove sin which condemned every one of us so what is stronger light or Darkness a little bit of light can overcome a lot of Darkness what is stronger life or death Hallelujah life is stronger than death I'm preaching on two laws tonight because when Jesus died God put a word over him he will not stay in the grave and after one day two days on that third day no devil on Hell could hold him down death could not hold him the grave could would not hold him up he came by the law of the spirit of life because life is stronger than death and it was because Jesus word I will not leave my my my righteous one in hell and I want you now to be thinking about the spirit of life and I want to bring Old Testament examples to start with because every old test example is pointing to Calvary and Calvary is pointing to you and so in the scriptures we we see examples like the shunamite woman and you know how she was good to Elisha and she made a place for Elisha to stay and brother brandom said she refreshed him God serving and one day Elisha looked at gahaz and said what can we do for this woman who showed us such kindness he said they don't have a child and God used the man of God to tell her you're going to have a child and God bless that family with a child because she was good to God's representative and then about 12 years later the Bible said he was out with his daddy working and he began to scream my head my head and they took the the father told the servants go take the boy to his mother and the boy died right on her rap that was the power of death and that woman took that baby and she placed him on the bed where Elijah slept and laid his head and she said saddle an ass and she started to Mount Carmel to find God's representative and when Elija looked and he said Here Comes the shite God never told him what was happening and when she came he said is all well with your husband is all well with your home is all well with your child she said all is well because she was speaking faith in the word of God and she said I need you now to come and pray for my baby that's and and you know the story he gave his staff and he comes back to hael said the boy still dead and Elisha goes into the room and shuts the door now death the power of death took the child's life and Elisha laid upon the child and the Bible said his body got warm but he did not revive and the Bible said that Elija paced to and fro brother brandham said he was waiting on the Holy Spirit and when the Holy Spirit came the boy revived and the spirit of Life pushed back the spirit of death and the boy lived it was the law of the spirit of life we find that Elisha the same just a little while later there's another story of him where he uh there's dirt in the land and the people made a big pot to eat and they threw poison gourds into the pot and the people begin to eat it and they start screaming there's death in the pot there's death in the pot and Elisha said Don't Fear he took some meal and that meal was a type of Christ they ground that meal just like Christ was ground at Calvary and he threw that meal into the pot and it turned death into life because life is stronger than death how many believe that God is stronger than the devil the spirit of life is stronger than the spirit of death and then when Elisha died they put his bones into a seure and and a long time later A man was lowered in there in a time of War a man had died and they dropped him into the prophet seure and when he touched those bones he came back to life again because that was God's representative and he was representing life how many knows the gospel represents life how many appreciates the Lord God was still on those bones Hallelujah now the law of the spirit of Life Jesus never preached a funeral watch him watch The Gospel he never preaches a funeral ever there's a time he's tired and he's weary and he hears a widow cry and a woman crying and her son had died and they were packing him uh not in a closed casket but an open casket and his body is wrapped brother renam said he might have been dead for two days and he said that they come right by where Jesus was and he stopped it and he tells the man to rise and the grave clothes start moving and the boy sets up and he's brought back to life again because life is stronger than death how many believe that with all their hearts jeras had come he had he had run hotfooted it for three hours he found an audience with Jesus and said my daughter is is is dying I need you to come and lay your hands on her and Jesus said I will go and is there about halfway there a Runner comes and said troubl not the Master she's dead he starts quivering and shaking oh God God no and he looks at Jesus and Jesus doesn't Flinch he says only believe life was not shaken by it life was not driven back by life why uh life did not was not intimidated by it but she's dead but it's not over I don't care what you done it's not over because life is stronger than death brother brandham said he was calm and Collective because the word has a power to raise you out of addiction the word has a power to raise a man out of sin the word has a power to raise a man from Death to take a dead man and make him live again I was a dead man and God made me live again because the law of the spirit of Life Set Me Free hallelujah it's not over Hallelujah I don't care what you done it's not over Jesus marches to the house and the people are crying and Jesus said quit making such a fuss she's not dead she's only sleeping and they said what a false prophet we've embalmed her already yeah you know what Jesus did pushed him right out get out shut the door took Peter James and John and put Faith around him Hallelujah because something there's going to be a resurrection in here and we want all the unbelief to leave this girl's going to live God's going to turn the situation and he stood over the child without any whimp or worry will it happen and he commanded her rise brother brandham said way out in the Supernatural realm God Supernatural hand caught her spirit and brought it back into that body and that little girl opened her eyes he said feed her because the law of the spirit of life is greater than the spirit of death if your soul ever comes in contact with the Living God it'll raise your thinking it'll raise you from the dead it'll turn you around but they just have to have contact Brother bam said the life that was in Christ came back upon the sinner the repented Sinner and that Jesus perfect life was given for us how many believe that he it so we could go free and the spirit of life of Jesus Christ makes us free from the law of sin and death turn with me or I'm sorry pull it up next slide now watch this Romans 81 pay very close attention there is this is our opening scripture there is therefore now no condemnation say it with me no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death praise the Lord isn't that wonderful you're a free creature you are a free creature tonight am I want you to say I'm a free creature a free creature amen you say but I'm a Christian and I find myself when I should be experiencing the fullness of joy when I should be experiencing blessed peace and Assurance of God I why am I struggling why if it's so Victorious and so powerful why in the world you would think I'd be the happiest person on Earth but why am I struggling I've renounced the world I love the Lord Jesus but it just seems like what's wrong have you ever felt that way my mind is bombarding and and I seem to constantly be struggling I feel ashamed and condemned when the Bible said there is no condemnation what's hindering my life have you ever been there let's look at it real close that next slide there this is Romans 7 now watch for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of the spirit and not in the oldness of the letter and what Paul is saying here is we cannot be Christians in the flesh if we're going to be Christians we must be Christians of the spirit can you say amen amen the law of sin and death is in our members it's in our body we are still subject to old age we are still subject to sickness we are still subject to death but God has redeemed the soul salvation is not complete yet our souls have been redeemed but we are waiting on new bodies and Satan will afflict the body in order to discourage you to make you doubt and to tempt you we will receive a body that is not subject to temptation but now we are subject to Temptation now the devil hits the weak spot and there is a war between the carnal nature and the spirit man amen turn with me Romans 7 verse 14 Hallelujah stay right with me now Romans 7:14 everybody there for we know that the law is spiritual verse 14 but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I do I allow not for what I would that I do do I not but what I hate that I do if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good but then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for I know that in me that is my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do the would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me stay with me I find then a law when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man amen but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind G and Paul said I have the mind of Christ and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death I think God through Jesus Christ Our Lord who with my mind I may serve the law of God but with flesh the law of sin now Paul is saying that he is in a constant war between the spirit and the Flesh and this war is going between good and evil you pull up the next slide stay with me now you're doing great pull up that quote there we go this is a questions and answers in 1964 and they're asking brother about uh brother brandom about Romans chap 7 14-18 he said we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I would I do not that which I would for what I would that I would not that which I hate that I do if I do that which I would not he said and he goes on I consent to the law that is good now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me he says I cannot understand this 1964 now brother benam picks it up as you're reading there he said Paul is speaking to the Romans he said now let me just polish this up so you can see it in me is two persons right one wants me to do wrong and the other wants me every time I start to do right the wrong hinders me next slide and as long as you are in this life you're are going to have a sticky and a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but inside of you you are born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin goes from you now if you continue to read the quote brother brandham talked about the Indian how he said how you doing Chief since he got saved he goes good and bad he goes what do you mean he said since Chief got saved there's a white dog and a black dog and they fight all the time brother bam said which one wins the most he said the one she feeds the most because inside of you is a war we are in a war from Angelic War down to human battles 1 Peter chap 2:1 look what Peter tells us dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims to obain stain from fleshly lust which war against the soul there are two laws you live in a contaminated body but your soul is redeemed Hallelujah now brother brandham told us and listen closely and who is this MDC that Adam bypassed his theophany uh and took a human Spirit in order to be tempted wow he said now when we die we'll go to a word body but we bypass that word body to take a flesh body Hallelujah he said now you had to come here in flesh to be tempted by sin then brother Brandon brings great insight to us in the greatest battle ever fought when brother Brandon preached the greatest battle ever fought he taught us which is vital to this hour he taught us that God had to have a meeting place and he said when a man is going to go to war they have to have a Battleground and the chosen Battleground is your mind amen he said why the mind because that's where decisions are made that's where choices are made and brother bam said that is where the battle begins in your life and we are made up of Body Spirit and soul and the outer man has five Outlets see taste feel smell and here the spirit man has five Outlets memory reason conscience affections and imaginations but in the soul there are two outlets and that is Faith and unbelief and he said Satan approaches you from the inside wow when when job was perfect in the eyesight of God the devil approached God and said let me have him skin for skin yes I will make him recant so the devil attacked the outer man because he could not shake his soulall Hallelujah now brother brandham said now you're not safe because you feel saved hallu he said if you're saved it's not because you fell the chill bump the devil can stump you on any feeling but you are safe because of your revelation of thus sayith the Lord you are saved because the word says so hallelujah hallelujah how many are saved here tonight the prophet of God is teaching us how to fight that next quote pull up that next quote watch this now I know I'm laying a lot in but I want to establish you firm upon thus sayith the Lord I want to establish you upon the word of God and the word of God will defeat the Devil anywhere any place any time I'm not preaching to the flesh I'm preaching to the soul to establish you in the Kingdom now watch this here he said now I know I've often thought back here in the spirit of man the next is a soul the next to the mind then is flesh Satan does not tempt down here which is the soul he tempts the flesh for instance you're coming down the street you're walking you're singing Christian songs and he said you know she or he is just a hypocrite talking about you the first thing your flesh picks it up in the ear and suggests to the Mind get even with it beat him into a puddle and walk him dry Vengeance then the spirit says vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord I will repay so the temp the the Satan tempts out here he said but down here you're Immortal yes it's the flesh that he is tempting next slide young man going down the street young Christian boy young lady coming immorally dressed the eye picks it up the flesh suggests to the Mind evil then time it gets to the Mind goes to the soul the soul of man and the is the nature of the spirit I know that this goes way back brother B made these Corrections he said whosoever lookth now he the spirit speaks who who soever lookth upon a woman in lust has committed adultery in his heart already the young man turns his head and walks away see down here it's got to be not out here it's got to be in your heart where God lives now the mind is the gate to the soul this is how the devil's going to get in the mind opens the door or closes the door hallelujah how many believe that and brother Bram said when your mind closes itself to every doubt every sensation every feeling nothing there but the word of God you want to talk about an invincible Army I I am I'm fortified behind thus sayith the Lord this is the front line you are on the front lines tonight Hallelujah this is where the war rages and every one of us are in it but brother bam said this cannot harm you unless you open the door wow it's all on you the devil made me do it no you let him in we have a responsibility that's right and more with the revealed word brother brandom said when you let him in he will take control but you got to accept it you're serpent seed you don't belong here you're not elect you're from the devil you came from serpent seed you're the brother of Cain you're just make believer you're fake that that's where you must rise up and say the word said that I was made free at Calvary the word says whosoever will let him come and here I come Satan contempt all of these channels C taste Phil smelling here memory reason conscience and a affections he's trying to get into your mind and make you amen him right he wants you to amen him true you're a loser nobody likes you everyone is against you and you start going on pretty soon you'll go from the front row to the middle all the way to the back out the door defeated because you amen the devil brother Brenham said the holy spirit always say amends the word hallelujah how many want to say Lord I want to amen your word we're in a fight every hour of the day every minute of the day every day of the week every week of the month every month of the year we are in a battle every one of us don't let the devil fool you every one of us preachers and all we are in a war and and brother brandham said temptation is not a sin yielding to temptation is a sin matter of fact we were sent here to be tempted of the devil that's right next slide I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself Shall Serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin listen to this brother brandham said this here questions and answers 1959 he said Paul said with my mind and he said I have the mind of Christ I serve God with my mind but the flesh is the law of sin the flesh says tonight you're tired you're sore you've been out in the wind all day that is the law of the flesh he said but my mind on the inside the holy spirit says keep your promise amen the flesh says you're too tired the fles will say there's no need you're the prettiest little girl in school why you're the best looking girl in all the school he said he'll attack the men you're just the best athlete or you're just this or that pull up the next side watch this Paul said My Flesh wants always to yield to that and your flesh does too but the law of the spirit of God in the heart overcomes the Flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says to do yes woo then if it'll look for us he said if that'll work for a sinner will it not work for sickness too the law of the spirit of God in the Heart Says by his stripes I am healed they stand there with their power to make the sickness in the body obey them because it's the devil next next slide now the law of sin and death works in your flesh but the law of the spirit of Life Works in your heart so your heart your spirit in your heart will make your body obey hlu did you hear what I just said the law of the spirit of life is greater than the law of sin and death the law of the spirit of life is greater than complex Lexus is greater than sickness is greater than your weakness the law of the spirit of life is greater than any power of the devil the law of the spirit of life will bring this flesh into subjection to the word of God hallelujah grab your Bibles turn to Romans chapter 6 verse 8 Hallelujah Romans chapter 6 ver8 say Amen when you're there doing great tonight I know I'm pouring a lot in and I'm intentionally doing it because I want to establish you in the word of God so the devil has no ground are we safe tonight are we free tonight are we on our way to canaan's land Hallelujah Romans chapter 6 ver8 now if we be dead with Christ We believe We Shall also live with him knowing that Christ has raised from the dead dieth no more and death has no more dominion over him in that he died he died under sin once in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon you also yourselves dead indeed to sin but alive unto God through Christ Jesus our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof wow neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but you're under the law of Calvary under grace What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid know ye not that whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants you are whom you obey whether sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness but God be thank that you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from where from the heart the form of Doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you become the Servants of righteousness I speak after the manner of men be because of the infirmity in your flesh for as you have yielded your memb servants to uncleanliness and iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto Holiness for when you were the Servants of sin you were free from righteousness what fruit FR you had in those things wherein you are now ashamed but the end of those things is death but now being free from sin you become the servants to God and you have your fruit unto Holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord the reason we have many people that have so much uh failure in their walk with Christ is because they're Christians trying to live on Mount Si but Mount Si is the law of death the law of dos and don'ts and you will fail there look away from Mount Si and look to Mount Calvary where Christ took the law upon himself and freed you from the law Hallelujah hallelujah how many are free from the law now brother brandham said God put a control tower on the inside of you he said this in thirst 1965 he said and the way you want to know what's driving you is watch what is motivating you what kind of Life motivates you he said you can tell what you are by the desire that is in you he said now the desires of the body will war with the desires of the soul and he said too many people live between these two desires and when the devil he said you're trying to do something good he said the devil will come in and try to throw you off or to upset you the devil will try to block it he said but don't you back off you press right to the Holy Ghost you press right on to the to Victory because the devil's trying to beset you right that's right what do feelings Got to Do With It many of times I've preached and said Lord if I could get out of this service and the devil bombarded me I don't even want to preach have you ever been there and come out and preach and the glory of God falls upon the congregation it is the devil trying to hinder you you got to recognize what is the Flesh and what is the spirit because the inner man there is a desire for righteousness and the devil's trying to beset that but what is your desire I don't want the world I don't want the lust of the flesh I don't want nothing this world has I want to be an eagle I want to spread my wings and fly I am an eagle I am an eagle I'm getting ready for flight Hallelujah I'm going to break through the [Applause] atmosphere the devil said no you're a chicken the devil's constantly trying to play with her mind you know you're a chicken he does that to preachers too you just you know brother brandom said it he said he got in the car and he he said he heard someone on the radio saying you know all that Christian stuff he said is there nothing to it we We Come From Evolution and the devil started getting in his mind a a prophet of God who spoke to Angels had 30 to 40 Visions a day and actually it starts getting to him don't under estimate his power and don't flirt with unbelief you must stay far from unbelief because it will anoint you Hallelujah if you're seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit when the devil starts to throw up obstacle press right through to it because it is for you he died that you might have it you just press right in take your god-given right by the spirit the law of the spirit of life is greater than [Applause] unbelief resist the devil and he will flee from you what what is stronger day or night light or Darkness I want to ask you what is stronger sin or Life Death Or life God or the devil turn with me Romans chapter 8 verse one let's read it again this is our opening scripture this is one of the most incredible scriptures of the entire Bible say Amen when you're there there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free fre from the law of sin and death Hallelujah for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh before I go any further brother brandom said the Old Testament sacrifice they went in a liar an adulterer a murderer they sacrificed when they left there was not enough Power in the Blood of those gats to change his desire he came in a liar he went out a liar he came in a hormonger he left a hormonger there was not enough power in that blood but there is enough Power in the Blood of Jesus to change your desire and though your flesh is buffeted your soul stands on the word of God Hallelujah and you can judge what you are by your desire amen amen verse four that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after to the spirit the things of the spirit to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God and it for it is not subject to the law of God and neither can it be h so your soul is subject but your flesh is not but your soul can bring it in subjection to the word of God hallelujah verse eight so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God that's why the devil tries to make you look to SI he wants you to live by a law I wear dresses I wear my hair long I go to church I pay my tithe you will never find peace on Mount Si but when you look to Calvary you're ruled by the law of life and the law of love where your desires follow the word of God I'm going to church because I love him I pay my tie cuz I love him I turn my head because I love God go it's the law of the spirit of Life made me free from the law of the [Music] flesh hallelujah hallelujah is that verse eight my eyes are that bad is that verse eight but verse nine he said but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be the spirit of God dwell in you that that if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his so you you can't live Christianity In the Flesh and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brother we are dead not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you die but if you through the spirit mortify which put to death the Deeds of the body you shall live hallu for as many are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God hallelujah hallelujah now brother bam said we have a right uh brother you were inspired in your prayer because brother Brenham said in restoration of the Bride tree that the holy spirit is our lawgiver and he said here is the angel of God and the only way he can work is if you let him work you've got to believe him that's right brother Matthew was talking about sending the Holy Spirit after the man that stole the car he said it is a law it is the law of the spirit of life he said the only way he can work is when you let him work you must believe him there's a law to everything he said there's a a fish has a law and that law is inside of that fish he said that fish can go Plum to the depths of the ocean and he can be H unharmed because of the law that God placed in him he said a bird cannot do it you cannot do it because you do not possess that law he said there is a law that is in a in a bird that it can defy gravity it can break gravity because God created it with a law that it can defy it we were not made with that law but the bird was made with that law but you were made with the law of the spirit of Life Hallelujah God created you with a law in you that you can lay your hands on the sick and they recover that you can cast out Devils you don't have to knock down to the devil you have a law in you a bird does not struggle a bird lives by the law that God plac in it we ought to struggle as Christians we ought to live by the law of the spirit of God you need to tell the devil get behind me I'm free in Christ Jesus thank you Jesus you've got you've got a law as Michael cast The Devil Out of Heaven you've got a law to cast him out God help us as many are led by the spirit that are the sons of God we are to live by this law yeah that's right not afraid Jesus lived by this law when he faced with Devils they cast out when he was faced with fever they were healed when he faced with the dead they lived again the same law he lived by we live by that's right God created this church with a law he said no matter what he said if you go down in the grave that law raise you up now he said you have come like Adam you have become an attribute of Flesh for one purpose you know why you come like Adam because God ordained that you must be tempted you say I'm going through so much Temptation that's why you're here Hallelujah he said but when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have a word body that's free from Temptation he said now you must stand the Temptation you came down to be tempted by sin you bypassed your theophany you become a flesh man to be tempted by sin when this body receives the spirit The Immortal Life inside you throw your body in subjection to the word of God this is your Victory there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not according to the flesh but by the spirit he said it throws your body into subjection just get in Christ and your whole body is subject to the Holy Spirit how many what victory you must get away from the Flesh and you must become subject to the spirit of God he said get in Christ and your body will become subject he said no more subject to the world they are dead your sins are buried in baptism you're a new creation in Christ you're becoming subject to the spirit the spirit has been Qui quickened I want you to think of this the law of the spirit of life when Jesus spoke to the woman at the well that light struck her soul and out of death came life when God when God made con when Legion made contact with Christ from Insanity into his right mind everywhere Christ went he carried the law of the spirit of life you you were once subject to sin but now your body is subject to the word of God God has changed your desire I know the devil tells you you're lost I want to ask you this because the Devil is a is a master at mind games do you love your mother you love your Mama brother that's a lie that is a lie do you love your mother lie I don't believe it do you think that I could convince you that you don't love your mom I could stay here all day and say brother I don't believe I think you're lying to this whole church where's a spotlight we need a spotlight on this young man no there's nothing I could do to convince this young man that he don't love his mama why because he possesses that love he possesses that love so when the devil bombards you and said you don't love God why in the world would you knock down to the devil I am here because I love God I'm here because I'm a Child of God I'm here because God is called me you're not going to tell me I don't love God get down behind me I'm living by the law of love I'm living by the law of the spirit of God and you've got to tell the devil where to go you've got to bring your body into subjection bring your mind into subjection bring your character into subjection Hallelujah I was just talking to your pastor in the back room he said we need to think like God we need to talk like God we need to walk like God hallu how many want to think like God makes your body subject to this word come on Hallelujah you're going to church tonight you're going to amen the word that's right Hallelujah you're get to shout Amen to the word say amen amen that's give him another one amen that's right you've got to bring it into subjection tell the devil I'm not lost tell the devil I'm not defeated tell the devil I'm not sick tell the devil I'm not lost out of my mind tell the devil I'm free tell the devil I'm Victory hallelujah hallelujah living by the law of the spirit of God the law of Life the law of healing the law of Victory The Law of Peace the law of assurance the law of God's life the law of Resurrection Hallelujah tell the Devil he's defeated point to Calvary point to the law of life he can't undo Calvary as long as he can place it on your flesh you're up and down up and down but when you can place your faith in Calvary the Devil's Backbone was broke he is defeated and the spirit was released that you could rise above the bondage of this body of death and in this body of death we would confess Resurrection in this body of humiliation yes we would confess a new land and a new home and a resurrection that has already begun in this body of death we would shout the victory before we came to Total Victory that's right living by the law of the spirit of Life Jesus said destroy this body I'll raise it up hallelujah hallelujah how many ever heard of John CH Lake he one of the greatest in my opinion one of the greatest men ever Christian men God used him in Divine Healing and supplies to bring help to the people of Africa and John G Lake was a firm believer in Divine Healing and he was working right among this plague people are dying left and right and he's unharmed and so the doctors called him and said what's the trick how in the world are you living in the midst of this plague and not even being harmed he answered it is the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus he said I believe as long as my soul is in contact with the Living God that spirit is flowing through my soul and my body and no germ can attach itself to me the spirit of God will kill it and they said don't you think you ought to use our safety measures he said no doctor would you like to do an experiment on me he said I want you to go to one of those dead people after they die and take the foam out of their lungs he said I want you to get a microscope and place that foam on my body and he said when it makes contact with my body those germs will die instantly amen they did and when they put the germs on John G Lake's body they died instantly because he believed that the law of the spirit of Life had made him free from the law of death now God's law Works in US God's law is working in you right now that's What Makes You hunger for God that's What Makes You amen the word that's what's turned your back from the world and brought you into Union with Christ the law of the spirit of Life can bring death to a cancer in a human body how many believe that if the devil can make his laws of sin and death work CU I'm preaching on two laws tonight we know what the laws of sin and death do and if the devil can make his laws work how much more can God make his laws work and we have already proven that the laws of God are so much higher than the laws of the devil Hallelujah that's why when sickness came God sent a savior when darkness came God sent light it is the law of the spirit of life that makes us free from the law of sin and death where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty are you free tonight has Christ made you free he said you are free indeed I don't care how old you are I don't care how sick you are I don't care how lost you are the spirit of the love the life of Christ hallelu says whosoever will let him come Hallelujah brother brandham when they'd say God Is Not A Healer he said you tell me what life is and I'll tell you what healing is he says because life is God how many believe that and Jesus said I come to give you life and to give it to you more abundantly that God was going to give us more than human life God was going to give us spiritual life and the Holy Spirit has power over sickness the Holy Spirit has power over lust the Holy Spirit has power over pornography when the devil says you're in a cage Jesus set you free and there is a power in his word he sent his word and healed them there is a power in this law that will free men from from por pornography will free people from uh from confusion of their mind it'll free people from the complexes that hold them down we need to cut all the gravitation we need to flap our wigs we need to be Eagles because God put a law in you to be able to Fly Above the Judgment Hallelujah brother brandom said the greatest battle ever fought is going on right now he said it's between life and death it's between sickness and health it's between faith and doubt it's between Liberty and bondage Satan's Army brings diseases and God's Army is commissioned to cast them out God's Army is to cast them out that's the way God's method is you cast out the evil one cast out the ugly one I want you right now to say I'm casting out the unbelief I'm driving this Darkness out of my life I'm driving this stronghold out of my life and and the law has an enforcer behind it you need to flash your badge as a Believer take your hand off my sister take your hand off this church we are rising in Resurrection we are rising aming in faith the devil has nothing on you he's placed under your [Applause] feet you must stand in your authority Jesus Christ made you free and you can stand there by the grace of God and say he has freed me from my bondage he has freed me from my fear he has freed me from the thing that has held me down he has freed me from suicide he has freed me from video games he has freed me from being a whoremonger he has freed me from homosexuality Hall law of the spirit of Life brother brandham would lay his hand upon somebody and his hand had a gift in it that would detect germ related to diseases and when he put his hand upon them his his hand would become agitated like Angry bumps would go all over it he said what is it he said death is in that germ of death he said but life is pulsating and life and death cannot exist in the same place that's why when Jesus came to the tomb of Lazarus life and death cannot stay in the same place I am proclaiming the gospel of life tonight and the devil cannot stay in this place and sickness cannot stay in this place lies cannot stay in this place it is the law of the spirit of life and we have authority with an enforcing Angel behind it Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life whosoever believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this I don't care how dark the stronghold you could have been molested from a child dealing with a stronghold that you have hidden all your life and God can set you free tonight Dark Places could be molested things you could not share with nobody and you live you live in darkness like a leper that don't even want to come out but but the Bible said that Jesus healed the leper when there was no cure at that time Jesus could heal that leper by the law of the spirit of life and he would touch him and say be clean and in a moment's time the man that was hidden in obscurity and outcast from the people in a moment's time is made clean I believe that the spirit of the Lord can touch your soul and That leprous Hideous Soul could be made wide as snow I believe in the freedom of the Holy Spirit and I believe that freedom brings life behind it I want you to believe Bel tonight how many are believers I want to show you Authority in God's word the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free has made me free from the law of sin and death how many want to be free from the law of sin sin and death let us stand our feet as the musicians will come I want to close in these words there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit as we just bow our heads and the musicians can play whatever's on their heart Lord Jesus we stand right now in the greatest battle ever fought you've sent us a message to teach us how to fight to teach us how to [Music] rise above the enemy and to walk in Christian Victory Lord we would never make Grace disgrace but now we understand why the fight the flesh versus the spirit the two laws that we wrestle with help us Lord as we bow our heads and look to Calvary yes to that place of infinite Victory amen every devil was defeated every sickness Was Defeated Hallelujah every spiritual oppression was defeated the powers of Darkness Was Defeated hell was defeated you Rose Again by The Power of life and you poured out your spirit upon your subjects Lord and in Jesus name anoint Us in faith I pray that the spirit of God will go to every need Lord go to Every weary heart I pray Lord God go to everyone that is crying to you free us Lord Break Every Chain open the prison house heal your sick Lord raise those from the dead break the powers of sin and free your people Lord I pray for these

time everyone together lift our voices and [Music] God my heart [Music] my [Music] my I want to be so that you can [Music] come Lord and F me amen the law of the spirit of Life the law of the spirit is greater than the law of death the law put you into prison yeah has anybody ever been locked up you ever been behind bars you don't get to eat what you want to eat amen you don't get to go where you want to go amen you don't get to sleep where you want to sleep you sleep where they tell you to sleep you eat what they give you to eat cuz you're in prison you're locked up behind bars because there was a penalty for the law and now you were subject to it yes but there comes a day when the penalty's been satisfied and they come down to your cell and they say guess what you're going home I'm going home what does that mean it means you can go where you want to go you don't have to stay there any longer you mean I could worship like I've always wanted to worship I don't got to stay in the prison house any longer you mean I can walk out of these complexes I can walk out of these fears I can walk away from pornography I can walk away from lust I don't have to eat this nonsense anymore I'm free because whom the son has made free is free indeed are you free tonight the law of the spirit has made me free from the law of sin and death Hallelujah I think it's no coincidence I had this quote written down here and I want to read [Music] it in force yeah then we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is a law and God in this word word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back and he has to do it a sudden struck me while brother Craig was preaching Jesus said if you destroy this Temple if you destroy this body I'll raise it up I want to ask you where were you on where were you you were in him make my body sick destroy this body try to bond my body I'm going to raise it up you come under the law of sin you come under the law of sickness but there is the law of the spirit that says I'm going to raise it up if that same spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you it shall Quicken your M body you are free I think it's start time we start acting like it start living like it we start eating like we want to eat we start living like we want to live tell that old devil get out of here when Jesus wanted a result what he do he put all the unbelief out surrounded himself with faith yeah that squirrel's been chattering no it's not for me the law of sin says you're not going to make it you'll never be free you're just going to go through Cycles you'll never be born again and filled with the Holy Ghost okay that's what the law of sin is saying but there's another law the law of the spirit says where the law of sin says you're never going to make it the law of the spirit says you already made it the law of spirit says I put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it's impossible for you to miss [Music] it I think it's time the spiritual Amnesia starts to roll away as our Pastor said it's it's time we start thinking like God we start speaking like God we start living like it and my prayer is you don't go from these build this building tonight without total Victory what are you waiting for what did the word say tonight which side are you going to aim in if you say I'm in bondage I'm in bondage and yeah that's just the way it's going to be or can you start looking to the law of the spirit of life that says you're free the penalty's been paid it's all over I've already unlocked the cell I've already swung open the door he the spirit saying go ahead that's right you're free now there has to be something in you that says amen yes sir I I had complexes I had fear I was in bondage I I was given into lust I could never get over this but what's this other voice saying you're free you don't have to be in bondage anymore go ahead and walk on out you can praise God be why because there is there for now that weight of condemnation that feeling that you're never good enough you you can walk right out from underneath that why because there's therefore now no condemnation there's no sin there's no failure there's no mistake that can hold you down anymore because the penalty has been satisfied the price has been paid now you can walk out and say I'm [Music] free so while we sing another song why don't you start aimen in the word saying I'm free free yes pour your spirit out on [Music] me I'm free I'm not going to settle for anything less I'm going to enforce it because the spirit of the word the enforcer of the holy spirit is here now you lost your joy Satan you robbed me of my joy I once was on fire I was once living in Revival I had cleaned up my life I I kicked everything out but everything poured back into my life you stole my joy you stole my victory you you stole my enthusiasm you stole my amen I used to come to church I used to smile at the preacher I used to aim in the word uh everybody knew that something had taken place in my life but I found myself shrunk back I feel like I'm under condemnation I feel like I want I'm not that anymore don't look to that to what the law of the spirit done yes he says you don't have to live under that condemnation it's time to get back up you made a mistake say Lord I messed up I made a mistake he says I already paid that penalty why do you keep trying to pay a penalty for your sin you don't you don't got to do pendants tonight you don't have to say woe is me and come up mopa and hit yourself on the back and you don't have to come down to this Altar and show some type of work now if if you want to do that you can but all there has to be is an Awakening in your soulall I'm an eagle I was born for the heavens I don't have to be down here in the chicken yard anymore I don't have to be down here in depression and down here in sin anymore I say you just spread your wings well brother Matthew I ain't going anywhere don't worry the Winds of the holy spirit's here hallah just to pick you up and lift

your word thank you for what you done hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we'll invite our pastor to come in this mes tonight amen amen [Music] amen I'd like to rename that sermon I think I can do that can I the reality of Christian life amen amen you know this I'll be 75 this here and I guess I became a Christian 50 some years ago but he's fought me every day yes right you know and the Lord knew that he knew it was going to be a battle he even told Peter Satan has desired to sift thee like the sand you know he says but I've prayed for you and in knowing that there's this great battle that every Christian is going to fight cuz Satan hates you yeah he said I'll not leave you comfortless he says I won't let you go through this battle alone he said I'll not leave you comfortless amen he says but I'll come again hallah I'll send you another comfort and he'll lead and guide you into all righteousness and you know I mean we fight that battle out there all day long that's why I love to come to church church and just praise the Lord and just get out of it for a while right and and just feel as goodness and and I guess we would call it in the world take a breather you know what I mean that it's where you go back to the corner in between rounds and you talk it over with with the great coach and you go out but I'd like to say this Jesus said I'll be with you and even in you till the end and and I see this so many times that you have a wonderful meeting like this and it's the presence of the Lord is here and the word of God's just flowing and you get that excitement and you get that expectation and you think that you're going to go out by inspiration and get the victory but he said I I'll be with you Hallelujah and even in you I I will not leave you comfortless but I'll come and that's that's what you got to realize is that you can't do this by yourself that's true that's right you can't that's right brother and you you've just got to know that he wants to go with you and and you know and you've got to stop somewhere along your life my life started on a rooftop reading the first chapter of the book of Romans and I knew I couldn't get out from where I was at unless he did it for me yes and I found myself many many tight places and I've had to always go back to that one spot amen say Lord I can't get out of this with without you yes and and I encourage you to don't don't try to face it by yourself brother remm tells the story of the woman that washed Jesus's feet and he said she sat there and she watched them everybody mocking him and she wanted to go down there and then in her heart she said but he'll know where I got this money from he'll know what I do for a living he'll know that and she finally came to one conclusion the prophet of God said she knew that he was the only one that could help us amen amen amen so it didn't matter anymore there was only one that could help her and whether he knew or she got that money whether she knew what she did for a living she knew one thing he's the only one that could help Hallelujah and that's why you hear so many times we say it's an individual Affair it's a personal Affair you've got to take a place sometime in your life where you you sit down and ask him to help you ask him to come into your life invite him in to your heart and say Lord I need you to help me walk this walk I need you to give me the victory over this I need you to help me put this behind me and let him do it because he wants to do it yes and so as we dismiss tonight I hope that each of you that you know in your heart whether you've asked him to [Music] help and I know there's a lot of things I need is help in and I was encouraged tonight to go find me a place little cliff in the Rock somewhere yeah and talk it over with them and and invite him back in and ask him to guide me in the places and wonderful take the old crabby rough Spirit out and make me sweet and and loving can't do it no matter how hard I try or how bad I want to I can only do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me so I encourage you tonight to make that contact again and ask for that help and let him become personal to you and there's nothing like him there's just nothing like him amen let's pray our heavenly father how lovely the word was spoken as we went through the book of Romans and saw the reality of Christian Life an enemy that's cast his vote against us a God that's cast his vote for us and as the prophet spoke he says choose this day who whom you serve as for me in my house will serve the Lord Lord and we've been challenged tonight not to try to do it on our own but let the gift of your spirit the gift of your person yes I will not leave you comfortless but I will come again and I'll be with you and even in you till the end and I'll lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness Lord would you enkindle that personal relationship within each of us amen Lord and each of these young people no matter how old they are may they know that they can ask you that they not be ashamed to ask you for the help and your spirit for it's not by power yes and not by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord father we pray that each person here this evening that they got a glimpse and a taste of your indwelling spirit the fact that you can come and live in our Liv lives and live in our hearts and be in us a reality of your presence a Fountain of Living Water springing up from within us Lord that we know that you're with us and that you won't leave us nor forsake us and that we'd go forward from this place with you yes and father May if someone needs to just sit a moment after we're dismissed and just sit and talk it over with you maybe they could go through all the wrong they've done and all the thoughts and things they said and no doubt that would cause conviction but at the end of it all father may they look to you and say Jesus I need you I need your help I need you in my life and I'm asking you to come into my heart and make me different Jesus and you said if we would come to you that in no wise would you cast this out and I pray father that we would have that courage and that Honesty to ask you for the things that we have need of father bless us the rest of this evening the fellowship the food and all that we would have and do May our hearts be glad because you are so good and so wonderful we ask it in jesus' name amen is God good all the time let's sing that for our dismissal do you have any announcements is service service at a are eat is there food there that's all for us I don't know I don't know what's going on Amen is he good all the time amen amen let's sing it if you're walking oh if you're walking through the [Applause] and
