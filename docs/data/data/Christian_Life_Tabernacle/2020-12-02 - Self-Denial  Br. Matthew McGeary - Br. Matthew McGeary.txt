can lift their hands to you right now and say lord we're gonna praise you in the storm lord we see darkness all around us we see a world that's decayed and cankered with sin lewdness and an antichrist spirit that's moving his eden into position but oh god we see that on one side but we look to the other side and see that there's a new testament church that is rising up with the same power and life and resurrection that you possessed lord that you have sent into the believer in this hour and lord we know that we possess everything that we have need of because we have you we have your revealed word of the hour lord we've put in all of our faith and all of our trust in that word and that word alone lord we're not going to look to the right we're not going to look to the left but we have our eyes on christ the word and christ alone lord and we're in that great expectation for what you are doing lord we're not discouraged by the things that we see around us in a way that would cause us to take a step back lord but it causes us to take a step forward knowing that you are with us lord and you're willing and more than able to do above what we could even ask or think lord we just love you we commit this time of fellowship to you all those that have gathered together the needs lord those that are not able to make it those might be streaming online lord we're just committing everything into thy wonderful hands down we ask it in your precious name the lord jesus christ amen amen praise the lord you have your bibles we'll be reading out of matthew chapter 10. and i believe we have a baptismal after service we're going to be baptizing little benjamin we're gonna have to call him little brother benjamin but we're we're happy for that we'll be reading out of matthew chapter 10 verse 32. it's good to be back in the house of the lord with each of you on a wednesday night and we we just just want to talk to you for a little bit i don't presume will be very long but just a little something the lord put on my heart and just pray that it would be a blessing to you man just keep our pastor in prayer he's he's weary in body just doing some labor work and whatnot so he's just a little weary but i just keep him in prayer matthew chapter 10 verse 32. whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men and will i also deny before my father which is in heaven think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came to send i came not to send peace but a sword i think many many uh preachers or ministers maybe even in the denominational world and this come as you are gospel forget that jesus christ didn't come necessarily to bring peace but he came to bring a sword and just listen to these words for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be they of his own household why this is already a gospel an invitation to be a part of something that doesn't sound too desirable he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross just focus there and he that taketh not his cross and we're going to have a cross to bear church my cross might not uh look to appear the same way that your cross might be brother brandon mentions at one time about a moses and his wife's support that was his cross that he was bearing and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me amen we just ask a blessing on the word you may be seated we also just want to read out of matthew chapter 16. you're reading verse 24. then jesus said unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with angels and then he shall reward reward every man according to his works verily i say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom amen and just maybe pulling from that verse there matthew chapter 16 24 he says if if any man will come after me or if any man will follow me and these this just stuck out to me he says let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me so there's a denial of yourself we're going to have to deny ourself and then there's a cross he always says take up your cross there's a cross that we are going to bear and so we deny ourself we take up our cross and we follow him and just in even reading the scriptures that we have read you know this is completely contrary to human nature to deny yourself um you know and and to take up your cross and and to follow him you know we rely on our human nature relies on our our five senses and touch taste sees smell and our conscience memory reason and affection and all of these things that we can contact our earthly home that we see by and that we understand by and what the word is saying here all of those things that that you use to contact this earthly home all of those things that that you depend on i want you to deny those very things that are contacting your earthly tabernacle the very things that appear to be an absolute to you the very things that you would you you i mean look you see something that's green it's it's green you can't you can't tell me any other thing and then you think of family and you just even think of the patriarch abraham and the hebrew childrens of certain ones where they were they had to deny the very self-preservation that they're the very thing that would even preserve them or keep them there was something that was beyond that there was a sick sense there of faith that could look to god's word and deny the reasoning of the mind deny the condition of the age and so we're just maybe looking uh down a path as we would go that way because you know you just think about the age that we're living in everything is governed by the carnal mind and if it feels good do it and if oh it's it's an age of people's rights and and you know if if you want it you can have it and if somebody's in your way oh oh my if they're keeping you from it they're an offense to you and and all they're they're just so selfish and they have their own objectives and their their own goals and agendas and and but we're called to deny ourselves we operate by another kingdom we operate by faith we operate by revelation we operate by the spirit of god and so we're not depending on those faculties but i say that's the challenge we say we're not depending on them but too many times we are it's hard to be an eternal being living in this little old pesthouse shaking off some spiritual amnesia because the world that's set around us is designed to just keep that spiritual amnesia on you it wants to keep contacting the flesh and contacting your mind and stimulating you in such a way so you're engaged with the five senses you're engaged with your conscience and your memory and your affection and so you're in a position to where those are the things that are engaging you and that you're that's controlling you and and you're using these things to navigate through the day but oh there's another sense there's another kingdom there's another leading there's another spirit that we need to tap into and that needs to be the first place and the priority it needs to be what's on the control tower that's governing us and moving us into action at verse 25 said for whosoever shall will save his life shall lose it this is contrary to to mankind that doesn't even make sense what do you mean lose my if i lose my life i already lost it i'm going to save it if i lost it that's in the natural but whosoever will lose his life for my sake there it is look you can you can lay down your life for a family member you could lay down your life in battle you can lay down your life for your country and all how we appreciate veterans and the self-sacrifice that they laid on the altar of freedom we appreciate that we honor that but oh if you haven't laid down your life for jesus christ you're going to lose it oh we got to we got to take up our cross how do we take up our cross how do we die daily how do we deny ourselves the prophet said every believer that comes to christ must come to the same cross of self-denial you'll find that we just want to maybe move down that channel a little bit of self-denial and denying ourself because you know i'm just a young and i i haven't been serving the lord that long by god's grace i believe that um i believe i'm seven days from what would be what i would call my anniversary i'll be have having served the lord for 21 years and i have to admit i've i've looked forward to that because if the lord would tarry of course because i i was 21 years old when i gave my heart to the lord and so i i just have to say it i've been waiting for that little tick over the clock be like i've been serving god longer than i was in the world but hey that's just in the carnal realm i came from god i go back to god look at the thief on the cross how long was he serving god on the earth oh and we we think we can figure it all out and we look at works and how good you can you can follow this or explain that what about the thief on the cross can you imagine you can you imagine that you know i often think about how he just maybe appeared over there on paradise and coming to the saints of god they're like who are you he's like look out he's coming who's coming the messiah the savior what do you mean he's coming where did you see him he was hanging on the cross next to me oh you you know i can't believe it he was a sinner his whole life and and he had never even served god at all oh praise god there was a thief on the cross because if he could make it in it gives me a little hope that i can make it in because it's not by our own merits it's not by what you have done but it's because of what he did and just thinking on this self-denial let's just read here in math in mark chapter 10. just maybe a little bible study mark 10 17. let's pick up the story of the rich young ruler and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running annealed to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good there is none good but one that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and thy mother and he answered and said in a master all these i have observed from my youth i'll give them the benefit of the doubt then jesus beholding him loved him and said in him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me now i want to point out i believe that jesus was identifying his cross the one thing that he had to do to be able to follow the lord to surrender all jesus christ identified look the one thing that you lack and i pray by the preaching of the word that something can be identified in our life where maybe there's a lacking or something that we can have a greater surrender that we can come into the position and to the adoptions of sons in this hour one thing thou lackest and if we can now just allow the holy spirit and by the word of god come forth and we can start looking at your not look at that i've observed everything in this word and in this message from my youth well i i've i've i've i've been i've been in it a little bit a while i've been feeding on a little bit of a while and i got all this but no let's let's look past all that say lord what do i lack and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possession and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that of riches enter into the kingdom of god see the price was too much for him one thing thou lackest is the price too much for you in your self-denial now his self-denial was his riches it was his accumulation of wealth but that's not maybe the self-denial that you're faced with not all of us have houses and lands and have all of these things but oh one thing thou lackest oh he refused to do it the prophet says and forsaking all but that's exactly referring to this very story says but that's exactly what god requires forsake all and follow him that's god's requirement we've got to do it sometimes we've got to forsake our very thoughts if our thoughts about anything is contrary to god's word we've got to forsake our own thinking and follow him and the only way we can follow him is follow his word obey it and god's request and god's requirement is that we forsake all and follow him now this this is gonna be a very simple thought as we move along here and certainly something that could be directed towards the youth but i i think in our and maybe in the maturity of a believer and knowing how much more of the word there is for us and seeing uh uh the the manifestation of the word in the prophet of the age life and what level of maturity that brought him to and seeing the anguish and the agony that our lord and savior had to come to in the garden in his own self-denial i believe there is something more that we can give to him but in doing so we find out sometimes we have to forsake our friends many times that's a hard thing to do now many people when they first come into christ and being filled with the spirit maybe now listen this is just a scenario and this scenario will fit a situation that maybe you have been in or that you are facing might not have the same exact description but maybe like a woman that has been uh you know some kind of a party they've been going to going to every certain night and where they've been playing bunco in the neighborhood acquainted with all the neighbors and so forth and belong to certain societies in the neighborhood and they go play bonco and these women you know no is going to say something about it they're not going to understand it but yet you have to forsake that thing because it's not right to gamble to play cards and you've got to forsake that if you follow christ he's identified friends and in our opening text he's uh it's going to set you at variance maybe with your father with your mother with your brother you're going to have to uh uh some of the societies and the communities that you're a part of and now uh there's societies and communities that are online and and certain interests and and and maybe uh there's groups that you have certain interests that you fellowship around and oh it just appears to be so innocent but i i want to say that if we're denying ourself there should be some reproach or some cross of the gospel in that society you're a part of they should know where you stand but the problem of it is the reason you're not bearing a cross in your little secret society is because you're not displaying the very life of jesus christ because if you were there would become a rub there would become something that would would convict the individuals that you're having fellowship with it and something inside of them would start to want to shun you and want to move away from you because the light that you're bringing forth is shining upon the darkness of their heart and it's making them feel uncomfortable and they will start persecuting you they'll start reviling you but oh you just fit in so easy so nicely you're just a good neighbor they don't know what you believe and everybody likes you that's not what we're called to this just comes to mind we know all the father has given me will come but you know there's a reward every man is rewarded for his works and i'm reminded of the story of the sister uh who was in the balcony i believe it was and she saw a young mother carrying around a child and and the holy spirit kept telling her pray for that child they even had a prayer card now could you imagine like who am i she has a prayer card she's going to speak to the man of god the discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart who am i and and the spirit kept moving upon her and she finally followed the unction of the holy spirit now this is just brother matthew's thinking if she would not have followed the leading of the holy spirit i believe it was god's perfect will for that child to be healed and the story might have been a little bit different as brother branham discerned the scenario maybe would have never even uh mentioned it and who knows how many times a scenario like that might have presented itself where that you have a prayer card or some need it's like well we'll just let them go to the pastor we'll just let them go to the man of god i'll go to the hospital and i pray and something on your heart is telling you just call the brother just call the brother just go lay hands on him why because who is it greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and so this sister here under that answer she prayed for that child the child was healed and the prophet picks that up and says your child's already healed because that sister up there uh obeyed the leading of the holy spirit but yet if she would not have obeyed the leading of the holy spirit as you know like i said this is just my way of trying to say it the child would have been healed through maybe a permissive will because what it appears to me that that was the lord's will for her to follow the leading of the lord and lay hands on that child and so we have a responsibility to be the light to be the witness to surrender to god's leading in our communities in our homes and our life in our workplaces that we might harvest those seeds that might be spread out there and even in that you know that the prophet said my the prophet said that jesus christ the third pool of his ministry was what preaching to the lost your effort is not in vain you might just be preaching to the lost but it's necessary it's needful our lord jesus christ did it and that same life is in the bride and it very well might be that you are preaching to souls that are lost that souls that are in prison we're called to do it but oh oh how joyful it is one day you're working in the warehouse at walmart and you're being alive and somebody inquires about the hope that lies within you and you've been preaching to a dark warehouse for 12 years and no one's ever responded to the light and you've taken the persecution you've taken the rebuke in one day a seed comes out of it it's worth it all i'm referring to brother jackson and brother gary's sitting back there oh we got to preach the word yes it comes with a cost you've got to take up your cross and follow him we could maybe just to move a little faster we won't take up some examples there in the old testament as we just move a little quickly now but in thinking of abraham abraham was called he believed he trusted god you would have thought that was it okay god give me his word i got the promise all right i'm waiting lord he receives the promise and then he tells him now take the promise you've been waiting for and go up on a mountain and kill it look this this message and this gospel defies all logic i was fellowship with a gentleman in time he goes well you know i mean when you when you think about it the bible and everything it it typically it makes sense it's the better way i'm like no it doesn't make sense he's like what do you mean god told abraham to kill his son that doesn't make sense because we're we we can't make sense of it that's why god has given us a sixth sense that is by faith and by revelation because without that you're most miserable hebrews 12 6 says for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth if he endure chastening god dealing with you as sons for what son for what son is he whom the father chasteneth us not look every son that cometh to god must be first tested you got to be tried you got to be child trained yes sir amen it's part of it look we've been predestinated unto adoption we know that the whole world is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god so there has to be an individual work and something that god is wanting to accomplish in your life we can't be looking around at the whole church body and you know i was fellowshipping with a brother here not too long ago about the nine spiritual gifts and operation of the church the prophet said it i believe it and we don't believe it by a handing down of gifts but i believe that each one of us were a body that's fitted and joined together and each one of you are possessing an attribute of everything our pastor has been talking about you possess an attribute and a character and it's something that's in you that will provide and minister to the body in its season or in its time or in the maturity when you come into your position i can't look around and be discouraged that oh you know uh this isn't happening here this isn't happening there i got to worry about this guy i got to worry about denying myself because i mean look we come to church and the church house just two times a week what about the rest of the hours throughout the week that you're out there toiling in the things of the world everybody wants to come under the church roof and be like well hey let's get to hopping let's speak in the tongues and let's interpret let's see the power of god may well what are you what are you doing outside of the church are you witnessing are you testifying are you looking for lost souls and what is your first reaction when somebody gets hurt in the house i hate to say it hey you you're raising a child and somebody gets hurt what's your first thing to do oh i need a band-aid i need this i need that to say oh god may there be another nature may there be another spirit may there be a sixth sense that starts to take the preeminence where i look to jesus christ i look to the words oh god help me in this situation and we have to start living every single day every single minute every single hour lord i'm easy i need thee every hour i need thee and knoweth it not where is men men that's men that stands for principle whereas women that stands for principle where is the church that stands for principle i got a nickel's worth of time for a wishy-washy given compromising spirit if a woman's a woman let her be a lady if a man's a man let him be a man if he's a president where's our john quincy adams where's our abraham lincoln's men of principle where's our patrick henry give me liberty or give me death where's a man that stands for what's right where's a man that's not afraid to speak out regardless if the whole world's against him well if we ever live in an hour where the whole world could almost feel like it's literally against you hey hey you know god's been keeping us it's the grace of god you keep preaching this gospel it might happen you might end up on the news you might have every activist group with their guns pointed on you blazing it can ruin your your your your job it can ruin your career it can ruin everything but i say if that's the cross that i have to bear if i have to lose my life for his sake hallelujah oh if that's what it comes to if it comes to the government shutting down the doors as it comes to me having no career if it comes to me losing my home if it comes to that for his sake so be it i will follow him as for me and my house we will serve the lord this bride won't be shut up she's going to be taken up [Applause] we got to live this word we got to speak this word we got to be the word hey we're we're we've we're being restored back and not to lord help us look the world is god is allowing the world to set up in the exact condition that he knew it would be in to manifest what he has been planning since before the foundation of the world oh he predestinated you to be here to be the super church to be the super race to be that bride that's predestinated not to fall in the face of all ungodliness in the face of the most wicked age that's been here since time began god has allowed it to get to position i believe it's a look away to jesus uh brother branham says it's december 12 29 63 says i know i now know what the third pull is and what it does it does he says you might notice a little stepping back in my ministry you might see me looking back waiting for something to happen to manifest he says but we got to wait for this over here to catch up now this is just little matthew's of thinking and i'm reminded of how abraham was told god told him that your people will sojourn in a strange land for 400 years but the time of deliverance will come but it's not yet because the iniquity of the amorites are not full and i believe it's in uh uh the seat shall not be aired with a shuck i'm not sure but brother brahman says we're waiting for the iniquity of these modern ammonites to fill up it's not full yet but i say to take a look around it looks pretty full to me and he said there will be a moses and there will be a message to take his children in an exodus and into a rapture oh how blessed we are to be living in the time of the manifestation of the sons of god oh my but you know what we're not we're not at the big taking chunks and blocks off of the the masterpiece you know there comes down that time where as brother random preachers the masterpiece and the great sculptor he gets down there and but when it comes to the eyes when it comes to shaping out the ears and the eyes and everything oh it's just that little fine-tuning maybe i could say it like that a little self-denial where we start looking at our personal life we start looking into what we're doing with our time and how we're praying and how we're redeeming the time and realize that those are the things that jesus christ is interested in david says in psalms i don't think i finished out the quote we'll just start here if we didn't where is our arnold one winklers in this world again today where's men of integrity where's men with spirit they're so wishy-washy and garmed up until they don't know where they stand god let me stand with the principles of one man as a minister the word of jesus christ for heavens and earth will pass away but it shall never fail on this rock i'll build my church the gates of hell shall not prevail against it david in psalms 139 verse 23 says search me oh god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting i want to say that there's more that i can do maybe maybe you're there but i'm i'm looking at myself now through the lens of self-denial that's maybe what the burden of my heart is is that we'll look through that lens of self-denial and look at what more can we do there's a greater humility there's a greater surrender there's a greater sincerity that the bride of jesus christ must obtain as that capstone is settling down upon us it must be perfect love and yes we might see it exhibited in moments or maybe if i could speak for myself i see the change i see the supernatural i see the holy spirit of the molding and the shaping and all how glorious it is and the more he molds and the more he shapes and the more he reveals oh i see there's so much more to go and so much more in me that needs to die out to come into that position of adoption and come into that placing of the sun that's the important thing we're not playing church we're not part of a lodge we're not part of some religion we're not some some group like like israel was just because you're a part of it and born in it by by you know by by natural reason no this is an individual relationship with jesus christ where he personally chose you to manifest his spirit in you in the last age and there has to be something in you that's hungering and thirsting for that word to be manifested i'm not satisfied i've got to have more i got to die i want to see him and him alone when i wake up till i go to bed let me see jesus christ in me oh because that's where communion is that's where fellowship is that's where in that self-denial you come so in love with him to everything you think of everything you breathe everything you desire it's all him and him alone god bring us into that place sometimes it takes a squeeze takes trial it takes tribulation it takes the condition of the age to bring out the character in the gold takes a little fire takes a little trial takes a little bearing across takes a little persecution job this great warrior prophet was a mighty man in his day no doubt that he had been brought up and had served the lord all his life i lived had lived such a gallant life to the people all had respect for him but he come to a place to where he calls it here being tempted of the lord but i'd like to use the word being tested by the lord and truly maybe you're wondering why you're going through what you're going through right now maybe you're wondering why 2020 has to be the way it is you know i i uh i i you know i don't mind testifying over 2019 was a very difficult year a challenging year uh for for me and my family and and you know i uh and god given me a son and that name you know uh meaning victory and and the grace of god you know i was looking to 2020 and saying you know 2020 you're a victory well i got a little through the year and i was reminded that you can't have a victory without a battle and 2020 has been a battle it's been a test but you can't have victory without a test and truly every son that cometh to god must be first tested tried child trained and then if the testing gets hard and we think it's too hard and won't listen take heed then he said we become an illegitimate illegitimate child and not a child of god because there's nothing can move a real born-again child of god away from his parents see he's part of him you can no more deny it then you can deny yourself go ahead and tell me i'm not a mcgeary go ahead and tell me that are you coming away too late go ahead and tell me i don't act like one i can look in the mirror and i can see uh that i look like a man i look like my daddy you know i'm reminded at one time i was sitting in church in arizona and they had one of the side doors like this but it was glass and but it was blackened out and i was sitting there and i was praying before the service and i looked up and i was so shocked i said in the reflection i saw my dad i'm like what's my dad doing here and i look back i'm like that's me because i saw myself in the reflection oh hallelujah isn't that just the same thing that happened to you you were out there in the barnyard of sin you were out there living out in the world and there was something inside of you that was crying out for more and all of a sudden that mother eagle come over the barnyard and screamed out to you and called your name and all of a sudden you looked up you looked around he looked up you hey that's me i identified with that why it was calling your name because that's where you came from oh there's something in you that identifies with the word you can't shake me from it you can you can try to become a magiri all you want you can study himagiri you can you can mimic a magiri but there's only two ways that you can be a magiri you got to be born one or married one and i want to tell you the bride of jesus christ the only way you can be proud of jesus christ is because you were born predestinated before the foundation of the world with that wedding band at predestination and you are married to jesus christ oh you can mimic it all you want but all the mimics all the impersonators when it gets down to real tough living when it gets down to the persecution when it gets down to bearing your cross they don't have the ability to do it because it's not who they are all but you you're going to crest every wave you're going to crest every storm because it's who you are and it's not that it's you it's christ living in you oh thank you jesus hallelujah oh praise the lord oh my when you're born of him your party the same life that was in the bridegroom tree is in the bride tree so then everything you do declares him now that sounds and looks good on paper that gets us all excited but i i i'm talking about self-denial because all that seed in there gets to hopping it gets to jumping it gets all excited about the word and then now i gotta live it and then i start looking there's this other me oh there's this other cross there's this other dead man you gotta pack around and you gotta start bringing that guy into subjection you're called to it you have the potential to do it but oh there has to be such a self-denial timothy said in second timothy 3 12 oh my just think of it the prophet would always say if you had the spirit of beethoven you'd be able to play the piano you had the spirit of an artist or painter you'd be able to paint if you have the spirit of a gangster i love how brother brandon uses that you say you'd be packing a gun if you had the spirit of a mechanic i tell you what's wrong with your car and if you have the spirit of jesus christ these signs shall follow them that believe my name they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover my name they're going to cast out devils right because it's the same life second timothy 3 12 says all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution and the prophet said if you're not suffering persecution for christ's sake then there's something wrong the devil if the devil ain't after you he's got you now i'm wanting to encourage us and i'm wanting us to take a step up higher because we know we've we've been delivered from sin we know we've been changed but i'm i'm wanting to speak from the place that's on my heart is that there's more that we can give and there's more that we can surrender and there's areas in our life that may be the reason why you're not struggling there or the reason you're not having uh to keep your guard up is because maybe he's already got you so i just want to bring that to your attention as we keep moving because we're talking about we got to deny ourselves we got to deny the flesh and when you do that there's going to be a cross to bear there's going to be persecution i mean look you might you might lose your job you might get kicked out of your school you might not be able to afford your mortgage and and pay your bills because the stand you make or the job you didn't take because it conflicted with the spirit man the inward man but if it's for christ's sake he'll i've never seen the righteous forsaken or baking bread and i tell you the prophet of god said if you do it for him oh he'll reward you a thousand times over and i challenge you and i've seen it time and time and time again in my own life where i didn't have the ability i didn't have the funds i didn't have the means and every time he was right on time but it wasn't my time it was his time and i say oh just keep waiting upon the lord those who wait upon the lord shall mount up with wings like eagles jesus said in that verse 26 he said for what what is what is a what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his soul and just looking at jesus's words here in luke 22 42 he said father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done now just pulling some things together one thing thou lackest i say lord show me where i'm lacking let me pray like david said and say search me o god know my heart see if there be any wicked way in me i just pray that you could take that to heart look it's we don't have to have it all figured out he's not requiring you to be perfect within yourself you're going to have shortcomings you're going to have failures you're going to have places where it doesn't add up but he wants to be the difference let him be the difference oh say lord i've been struggling with this time and time and time again but lord here i am you're dealing with my heart lord and i want to resolve this i want to give it to you lord i want to deny my pride i want to deny myself and i'm willing lord for you to come in and take control you know a lot of people say they're bearing the cross but really they're just living out the letter and the letter killeth but the spirit is what giveth life and just in thinking of that you know i was thinking about ananias and sapphira they were all going to the same church they were all gathering together in 1104 central drive all coming in and and paying their tithe doing doing what appeared to be like the rest of everybody there in the the new testament setting there all of the the disciples and the converts of the lord they were selling everything they had and they had all things in common well ananias and sapphira decided that you know what we'll jump on the bandwagon it looks good it looks right so let's go ahead and sell sell out sell off our lands but let's keep back a little bit let's not go all in and so they tried to appear to to be a bona fide believer and when they came and placed their works before the lord peter said why why are you lying to god was it not yours when you possessed it now i i say to you if you are holding back you're not fooling anybody you're not fooling god peter said there he says ananias why is satan feel thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and keep back part of the price of the land one thing thou lackest is to forsake all to sell all now we're driving to a point here with with areas in our life where we need to deny our own interest our own times that we we appease ourselves and really allow christ to come into those areas you know the prophet and in christ the mystery of god revealed he said why you hunger why do you thirst he said god's wanting to reveal himself to you he's wanting to give you this this great revelation at the end time he said but you let so many things get out of you he said you let your wife you let your children you let your job you let your church you let your pastor all of those things can take it out of you and if i could just uh uh just bear my heart personally before you as you know the lord opened the door for for for me by his grace to minister the gospel something tomorrow i said lord may i never allow that to appease my desire for lost souls may i never stop uh testifying in the markets and on the street corners because i feel that i have now satisfied something else but i say oh god i don't want to to allow church or church order or just our duty here to appease something that he's calling us to do more out there we don't want to just uh uh uh be given into that but we're hungering and thirsting for more samson gave his strength to god to use but he didn't give god his heart he gave his heart to deliah delilah and he gave his strength to god but you've got to surrender soul body spirit strength everything you are to the will of god become a prisoner to him you're going to be somebody's prisoner you don't belong to yourself you're somebody's prisoner you're either a prisoner of the devil knowing this truth and won't surrender to it i say god god help us if you're trying to serve this message by intellect and in yourself it'll drive you insane and then you go to try to figure out the quotes and try to figure out everything and one minister says it this way and the other says it that way and then you listen to the tape and you think you got it and the prophet says it a completely different way and you're like i know of a a a minister who was a pastor in this message and i believe the reason he had mental breakdowns is because he was trying to pastor a church in this truth and didn't have a revelation of it and he eventually succumbed to it but we got a you're either a prisoner of the devil and i say this he was a prisoner could you imagine that responsibility knowing this truth and won't surrender to it or a prisoner to the world and surrender to god it's one or the other you're either the devil's prisoner to sin or you're god's prisoner to righteousness you're one or the other and just where i want to maybe work towards a close here is you have to know your enemy you got to know your enemy in james 1 14 it says but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of the devils no no they got it up there when he is drawn away of his own lust you mean i got i got my own cross and i got my own lust you mean there's things that i got to do i got a part to play but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lusts have conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringing forth death look your greatest enemy is your self and as we work towards our clothes here that's why we're just laboring there on self denial but you're tempted and drawn away by your own lust and i think the problem of it many times is we run out into the world we're going to go be the the bride of jesus christ we're going to go witness and we're going to go testify and work man we're we're watching everything that's going on in the world and all these movements and everything that's going in the political scene and we go into the stores and and ladies you'll see us just flashing its signs all around and everything and my we got our head down but if you have forgot who your greatest enemy is you better watch out because your greatest enemy is yourself and i'm reminded of how jesus when he was in the garden there in gassimity he was praying there and just think of the agony and oh my this here he's coming to this place of of of surrender and he's in such agony till his sweat is turning into blood and he comes to his disciples and he said watch and pray rise and pray lest you enter into temptation just marvel at that phrase there as jesus is surrendering us all and and forsaking his own will and denying himself that's where it said in matthew 10 33 but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven and i just in closing want to you know it's it it might not be too difficult to go out into the community to go to the store might not be too difficult to come to the church house and to profess christ's name and to be a good example but you know where the hardest time it is to do that if you deny me before men you know that includes yourself i'm speaking personally this is how the lord is dealing with my heart oh you can you can go out there and and and be a good example you can go out there and live a christian life but what good does it do if in your private time and in your life and in your family and how you deal with your wife and your children and how you witness around your personal area in your home if you are not exhibiting the very life of jesus christ in everything you do and everything you say then you're denying do you know you can actually deny him by not denying yourself you know i worked really hard today i come home you know and man i just need to blow off some steam i'm just going to relax i'm just going to look at the news i'm just going to play a game i'm just going to do things that are lawful but not expedient but do you realize in that i believe god is calling for something more a greater surrender a greater dying out we'll just keep moving here paul said we we we gotta mortify the deeds of the flesh in romans 8 13 if they could bring that up if you live after the flesh you shall die yes sir but if you live through the spirit i had to hand write that down there and i can't read moan writing but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live jesus said behold i send you out into the world sheep amongst wolves but what i'm what i'm admonishing is you know we got to be wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove let's not forget about this guy we got to recognize the ground that we're standing on when we go into the world the world when we go online when we go to school when we go to the store look this is this is satan's eden it's rich it's increased with good it's uh uh you know they're rich and don't need of nothing but what was the admonishment and knoweth it not that you're miserable blind poor wretched and naked and i i believe what god is just really wanting to press is that there's areas in our life where we have allowed the five senses and the conscience memory and affection to come into such a way where we don't even know that the devil has a stronghold in your life and i'm going to use a very specific example and i pray that this is the burden of my heart maybe some would call it a hobbyhorse of mine but i just something i just struck my heart it was saturday night uh while i was in ohio it was two in the morning and something just struck me on my heart about who are you following who are you following overcome means to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks so the devil is being exposed and that's what the word said he said you don't know and i counsel of thee to buy me gold tried and fired i counsel of thee to buy of me i sav i pray by the word now coming that we're receiving i save and i just want to point this out the you know the internet now influences you to make a statement it wants you to give your approval it wants you to make a decision or take a side like like do a like i like or i follow it seems so innocent because you seem to appear so anonymous but i wonder if the things that you're liking and the things that you're following if it was physically standing before us would you get in line would you brother what do you what your thumb you're liking that and i did a little uh i wanted to see and i i was with my wife and i looked into some of these things that that people are using you know you like you follow or you give it a thumbs up it's there to engage your interaction and i went on this platform because i wanted to see what it was and it's called uh completely mind blank on it i know i got a written sound somewhere instagram went on instagram and oh my i i went on there to to see and and you know i i uploaded it here and and i mean it's just like a oh it's it's just a social media platform you know that you can i guess connect with people so i hit the explore button and oh my lands that that was uh that was i was like okay that's pretty wild so i i googled uh why would you know there's no interaction why would all these suggestions be there and it said in snapchat what you have to do if you're receiving images and and and people's social activities and and and platforms and their look everything you can think of is on that if you want to go type in a believer's name because you want to connect with him it's going to give you a recommendation of a bunch of nonsense you don't want to see now i'm talking about self-denial and recognizing your worst enemy and so i researched and said what you have to do is you have to click on the image then you have to select that you don't like the image to not receive any more suggestions what a trap of hell and so if i'm going to clean up my portfolio i'm going to have to go to the strip cheese club to see if it's not in me are you kidding me no i'm being i'm being forthright with you now and i believe as believers we're fooling with things we have no business with and if we are expecting the coming of the lord why are we dealing and dallying with the things of the world that are trying to destroy your soul now listen to this oh like or a follower just please if you can give me your attention here as we we just finish out a like or a follower thumbs up rate it but it wants you to engage with the interaction i mean oh my the god of this evil age has made everything the accessibility the availability the stimulation of the flesh is so easy and available through technology through your cell phone through your tv through your computer through your apps now these are the apps i want to talk about here facebook twitter whatsapp shazam evernote messenger instagram snapchat spotify and youtube are the top 10 most popular apps in the world maybe more so in our region i don't believe that includes like asia or whatnot but that's the most i may be over the android and apple platform now if you didn't know satan's eden came up with those and if you don't think he had you in mind you're being fooled and knoweth it not now i believe the lord is speaking directly to you to let you know where we're at tick tock netflix news apps i want you to read an article from the world what do these popular apps have in common what brought them to such heights of popularity despite being worlds apart in terms of functionality if you take a close look at each of them you'll soon realize they each have staked a claim on a specific area of our life by cultivating a habit hey i'm guilty i woke up in the morning to look at my time and my thumb presses the google button okay what are you doing you're also you're scrolling at the news you haven't done prayed you haven't read your bible you haven't done nothing now works calling and all of a sudden you're going out in the world defiled and you totally forgot who the greatest enemy was was yourself now i'm getting down home because it's going home time and some of this stuff we've been fooling with is nonsense and we wonder why there's sickness in the church we wonder why we ain't got no victory we wonder why there's not certain things in manifestation it's because we're not living out the word of god i'm preaching to myself so much so that if you have 10 minutes before your ride arrives the apps you habitually reach for are probably all listed above oh my are we guilty you want to be entertained youtube you want to capture a moment instagram or facebook you want to talk with a friend whatsapp or messenger and so on one of them has been able to engage users and get them to keep coming back so often that it's now second nature to them oh this this this might be juvenile but this is reality listen this is exposing the devil they were bragging about this of what they've been able to accomplish in satan's eden is getting believers to use their apps and their technology as second hand nature self-help got it under control self-help go here i need this i need that where's the lord in this whole picture every one of them has been able to engage users and get them to keep coming back so often that it's now second nature to them this author i thought it was striking he was from israel moved here when he was three years old and wrote a book named hooked once a habit is formed the user is no longer considering whether they should open an app they check the app every day automatically without thinking much about it and that's the secret to their success these are the apps that users return to every day whether they're conscious about it or not knoweth it not maybe if the musicians would come benjamin you can get ready for the baptism an app what is an app short for the name application application the definition of application is the action of putting something into operation well man you know what i i've been allowing the five senses my conscience memory affection to put me into action for the wrong thing i've been engaging maybe in the apps or i've been engaging in the news i've been engaging in the technology i've been interacting with the world around me and it becomes second hand nature i'm just gonna check the whatsapp i'm gonna check the instagram i'm gonna check the news i'm gonna check the entertainment and you're not even checking while jesus sits there with dirty feet because we're so busy engaging with lady aussia paul said that the word came in power as well as voice now i'm looking to the other side now if apps and applications and technology can move people and put them into action and cause a response out of them and be a part of satan's eden you see how easy it is just the press of a button god got some beat you don't even have to press a button you just got to call his name pray without cece i got 10 minutes before my ride comes lord what would you have me do you think brother branham when that plane came down in memphis he was on snapchat twitter instagram youtube he was listening for that whirlwind i tried to take the human humanity out of brother branham but i'm i am talking about an example who came to a place of adoption and maturity if we could just finish the word preach actually demonstrated itself let me just start that oh paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword that went to the conscience of men and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the disease and set the captives free everywhere those early believers went they went preaching the gospel word and god confirmed that word was signs following the sick where hill devils were cast out and they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouths of believing christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth and your heart with it and someday god will give you the kingdom let's stand friends this message has come to put you into action it's come that deep calling to a deep you know prophet said that many men have set out to conquer he starts speaking about napoleon and he said at the age of 33 he sat down and wept because there was nothing else to conquer and he became an alcoholic and died but he said you know what he never was able to conquer himself praise god we got the answer because you are called you are more than an overcomer and what does it mean to overcome recognize every trick of the enemy but there was another young man who come into the world one time he died at 33 and he conquered everything that could be conquered when he was on earth he conquered passions pride he conquered sickness he conquered devils when he died he conquered death when he arose he conquered hell he went up in and conquered everything that was against mankind the winepress of god and crushed it down and conquered death hell grave sickness formalities everything else and overcome it all and rose on the third day and conquered all the atmospheres above and cut the myths between god and man and connected heaven and earth together glory oh my there he stands the mighty conqueror since he ripped the veil into there he is he has the keys of both death hell hanging on his side fear not laid his right hand upon him and raised him up by the power of his right hand said don't fear i'm he that was and he that is and shall come i'm the first and the last i'm he that lived and died and is alive forevermore amen oh lo behold the mighty conqueror lo behold him in plain view there he stands the mighty conqueror since he rent the villain too oh he cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the garden of eden i was going to choke it out but i'm going to say it now this is this is my whole punch to get into self-denial man i'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent did he not say in mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can't you can have what you said what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together to omnipotence something's got to shake whatsoever you say with that creative power omnipotence of god knowing that he's promised it and said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass something got to shake you know what's shaking you can't be shook but all the unbelief and maybe you haven't been denying yourself as this word keeps coming all of that unbelief has to shake and you might as well surrender to it and just in saying this last thing i was thinking about the prophet of god and thinking about jesus you know i was thinking about the third pool and speaking the word and brother branham speaking squirrels into existence and there up on the mountain he spoke to the storm and i thought you know that doesn't sound doesn't sound hard you just speak the word but what it took to get to that place was a full surrender you saw a man stand there and god tell him go up there and die certain death and he had been molded in such a way where he was willing to have self-denial and lay down his life for his sake and say lord if it means my death i will follow you and be obedient to your word and it was through that molding of his character brother man talks about when he lost his baby and his wife there and the devil came he was right there buffing it at him and he was just there to give up but there was something that came from somewhere the inward man praise god we have the inner inward man if we can just deny ourselves church deny our our self-gratification i had that definition written down of self-gratification how the impulses and it's so easy to allow these five senses to gravitate to the things of the world saints if we got ten minutes if we got five minutes when we wake up secondhand nature being the things of the world and the bride of jesus christ i believe the devil's been exposed and i believe i realize we we can have a little bit more self-denial and surrender as we're coming up into that stature of a perfect man what are we playing oh sir [Music] oh [Music] oh just why don't you lift your hands to them oh just let him search your heart i know we have a baptism but just look to the lord if there's something to surrender surrender yes lord [Music] set me free oh search me [Music] you just want to lift your hands to the lord [Music] maybe as they softly play we'll just say a word of prayer maybe if you want to lift your hands as we'll just say a word of prayer as we close the service for the baptism there's something in your heart that you feel that you could surrender there's something more that you feel you can give why don't you just go ahead and lift your hand to him just have a moment of prayer heavenly father as we just close this service in prayer we're just looking to you now as they softly play lord just say lord if there's something in my heart if there's something in my life there's some wicked way in me lord if i've allowed the things of the world to come in and take a place in my heart that i could surrender to you lord jesus i'm now willing lord to lay it all down at your feet lord i'm just asking that your holy spirit would come lord fathers we have to go from the building and go our separate ways lord jesus may this not just be something that would pass by but may have produced a life-changing action in us to where you can come in lord into areas that you should have had the preeminence all along but may we just surrender it to you lord may we find ourselves when we wake up not reaching for our phone uh second nature to reach for our phone lord but may we reach for our bible may we get on our knees and pray lord when we have a need arise in the family may we pray lord when something comes up and we don't know how to do it all it might seem so carnal but we can always ask you lord we realize we come dependent on the things of the world and on the ways of the flesh we're not a part of this kingdom lord i believe you've opened up my eyes to realize how the enemy so easily can come in so deceitfully and and make a stronghold in our life and we don't even know it lord we're surrendering ourselves to you now and giving you the preeminence that you so rightfully deserve lord we commit the people to you now we commit the baptism to you lord if there's anyone here lord it's just unsettled in their heart lord may they know that in the name of jesus christ they can be delivered they just confess their faults and confess their sins and repent they can be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and receive the power of the holy ghost that will fill every fiber of their being we love you lord we thank you for this time in jesus christ's name we pray amen i have a maker here for my heart [Music] is [Music] me [Music] no matter where i go [Music] he knows my name he [Music] when i called benjamin came in and he asked me to baptize him and i said well benjamin went up i don't baptize you he says well i'll go to another church to get baptized amen i thought well that's what i that's what i want to hear amen in other words i want to be baptized if you don't do it i'll go someplace else amen so we know benjamin wants to be baptized so we're going to read in the book of acts and it says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostle men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for this promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off as many as our lord our god shall call and with many other words he did testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this upwards generation then they that gladly received his words were baptized the same day and they were added unto them about three 000 souls amen brother branham they asked brother branham and he said you know suffer the little children that come unto me and he said when you feel it on your hat your heart you act upon it when you when it moves upon you and so benjamin's felt moved upon to be baptized he wanted to be baptized and so he's asked to do the right thing and we never deny our children the opportunity to do the right thing and that's which is right so i'm going to baptize benjamin in the name of the lord jesus christ because he has asked in his heart to do it and we believe it so benjamin if you'll step over here and we're gonna pray our gracious heavenly father benjamin in his heart has to be baptized in your name he wants to take the first step into serving you and doing what's right so father we're happy to do that now so according to the scriptures to go into all the world and baptize them in the name of the father son and holy ghost we know that that name is the name of the lord jesus christ so at this time i baptize benjamin in the name of the lord jesus christ amen i'm happy to have done
