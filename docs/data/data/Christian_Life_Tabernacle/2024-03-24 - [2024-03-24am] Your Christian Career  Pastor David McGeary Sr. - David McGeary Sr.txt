believe there's going to be a uh a choir practice for those who are going to Camp just remember um uh remember Louisiana camp and those campers and who are going and looking forward to the testimonies coming back amen God bless you good morning you know today is uh what traditional Christianity calls Palm Sunday it's uh the beginning of Jesus final week leading up into his death on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter you know it's the beginning of a space of time that uh is referred to as the passion week or The Passion of Christ as you you know look out at the churches in the land you know there's certainly a lot of attention um this time of year in the church World you'll see lots of religious events lots of church activities you'll see signs advertising come celebrate Easter with us this Sunday perhaps confusing witnessing with advertising you all this attention and all this Zeal religious activities centered on this this week of the year all with all that celebration and all of those religious activities that we'll see throughout the next week or so it remains nothing more than another religious day to celebrate you know they may celebrate Resurrection but there's no newness of Life the Easter comes and Easter goes and the day after Easter is just like any other day in their lives but you know there is something being accomplished there that should have a permanent effect on a life you know during that final week the very night that Jesus was taken by the Jews he had all his disciples gathered there in in a room to celebrate the Passover and he he made this statement he said in John 14 in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and I and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also you notice notice what he says one house but many mansions I go to prepare to make ready a place for you so how does he prepare that place he comes again and he receives you unto himself that you and him May dwell together in the same place then begins to make statements like this in verse 13 and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son verse 16 I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever Verse 18 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you verse 20 at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also you and him dwelling together in the same place one of the mansions in the house he says things like John 15:5 he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing verse 7 if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you statement after statement describing the effect of Easter but instead for most it's just an annual religious event and all these things that Jesus said is for some future Heavenly event but never coming into newness of Life today we're going to read about that in Psalm 84 this morning you want to turn to that it's just a beautiful Psalm but it's a Psalm of someone who desires to be and dwells in this place this place that he's prepared for you it begins in verse one how amiable are thy Tabernacles oh lord of hosts my soul longth y even fainteth for the courts of the Lord you know just like John 14 he's not talking about some future Heavenly Dwelling Place he's talking about a place we can dwell now this is talking about those who dwell in that house behold I go to prepare a place for you see the effect of Easter is cohabitation newness of life that results in him and me dwelling in the same place I in him and him in me it says in verse four notice one one house but many t Tabernacles blessed are they that dwell present tense in thy house they will be still praising thee they will praise him while standing still goes on blessed is the man whose strength is in thee and whose heart are the ways of them blessed is he this Mansion this Tabernacle who has his strength who has has the ways of the Lord written in his heart just like David was a man after God's Own Heart those who have his strength those who have his desires his thoughts his word written in their hearts living Epistles read of all men goes on in verse six describing the same one I like this who passing through the valley of vaka make it a well the rain also filth the pools they go from strength to strength every one of them in Zion appear before God see the effect of one of these Mansions of one of these Tabernacles one of these cohabitants with the Lord there is an effect of their passing it's talking about someone who dwells in this his house that no matter how dry the situation is when he passes by he leaves behind life he leaves behind refreshing he leaves behind sources of water that they may drink this isn't just the effect of the presence of the Lord this is the effect of those who dwell in the presence of the Lord who passing through the valley of baka no matter how dry it is leaves something behind that others may have life being able to step into any circumstance any situation any Walk of Life and to bring refreshing to bring life to bring his presence his word written in our heart see Easter isn't just a celebration of a resurrection from a grave somewhere Easter is him cohabitating with me Easter is there being a lifegiving effect of his passing just as there's virtue in him there's virtue in me if he dwelleth in me and I in him let's stand this morning you know verse 10 of this Psalm says this for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness how many can say that is so you know as uh I was just reading that this morning the Easter should have an effect and it shouldn't matter whether it's the 40th day of Lent or the 280th day of the year or Tuesday or Easter Sunday there should be an effect of his passing there should be an effect of his resurrection let's go ahead and read Psalm 84 this morning how amiable are thy Tabernacles oh lord of hosts my soul longth y even ftth for the courts of the Lord my heart and my flesh crith out for the Living God yay the sparrow hath found an house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars oh lord of hosts my king and my God blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee CA blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them who passing through the valley of baka make it a well the rain also filth the pools they go from strength to strength every one of them in Zion appear before God oh Lord God of hosts hear my prayer give ear oh god of Jacob CA hold oh God our shield and look upon the face of thine anointed for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness for the Lord God is a son and shield the Lord will give Grace and Glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly oh lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee amen amen praise the Lord you may be seated if if you're missing something there's a possibility it's in the lost and found so if we're going to be taking everything to Goodwill so go back there and see if there's something you want

to be lifted up corrected if need be yes to learn more of you father and what it is that you're looking upon us and what it is that you desire to see within us we ask that you'd help us this morning do these great things in jesus' name we pray amen and amen God bless you this morning welcome all our visitors and um everyone that that's here with us this morning let's open our Bibles to the gospel of uh John and um um we want to just read a a a couple verses here starting in the 10th verse through the 12th verse this morning and um so we read just a few verses here let's start with verse n he says that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world for he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believed on his name which were born not of blood nor of of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God Heavenly Father we ask you to bless us this morning in your precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated this morning it's always good to be in the house of the Lord you know uh uh many times I I feel uh uh you know challenged in life I've always been a little challenged in life but uh uh the good part about it is I'm a fighter which isn't always the best thing you know but uh I I I'll I'll walk and I'll I you know and it just seems like things are bad and everything and then I'll walk into the church building and there just seems to be a piece and there just seems to be good you know or you just take your Bible and read it and all all of a sudden it this seems like the world goes away and all those to me are little glimpses that one day this world as we know it is going away not our Eternal existence I thought of uh a lot of uh people you know they they talk about the Fountain of Youth you know and they go find this Fountain and they drink and they live forever who and want to live forever here please tell me I mean uh it just uh I just I'm so glad that I have a hope of a land beyond the river right but while I'm here I want to be faithful and uh we just want to talk a little bit about that this morning maybe not something as deep uh as teaching or as as uh you might say uh Revelation but uh just something that uh uh I think it would be uh what the Lord is concerned about so how many believe the Lord looks down upon us a amen I mean you know God watches our lives uh you know uh the messenger told us in the church age book he says too many Christians or the the the main attitude of Christians is they think that God uh came down he gave us his word now he sits back with his arms folded and just watches you uh but that's not true uh God wants to be involved in our lives and he's involved in our uh our Affairs and I think we're all getting to be surprised at all the things that God did for us along the way that kept us you know just things that we thought were so discouraging and why it didn't happen and everything and yet we'll find out someday it was all for the good you know everything was perfectly on time everything was working out just right and uh it it it's a perfect thing that God always done but we sang a song here the other day and I I I kept trying to find it that song in my mind I I don't have much musical ability but I there was some uh verse in the song that said I want to be all that he wants me to be you know and and that really struck me and so I'm just going to preach a little maybe Evangelistic a little uh um teaching but uh but my thought is your spiritual career or your Christian career and uh you know we have a lot of uh people in school and lot of us uh have jobs and things and and we refer to those things a lot of times is a career or what we do for a living and the definition of a career is a profession and uh you know uh all these little words have significance you know you you profess to be in other words if I I I if I'm an attorney then we call it in the business world you hang your shingle up you you put a sign up that says I'm am a attorney or you might be an electrician and and you say I am electrician or I am a carpenter that's your profession you're professing what that you are you know I'm an entrepreneur you know or or or whatever that you are we have nurses and doctors and and and different professions uh you can label them any way that you want technicians whatever you have to say but it's something that you Pro proess that you do so you know that that that your profession you say I do this I do this this is what I do and it doesn't matter you know everybody uh relies on one another you you know somebody might be a grocer but the grocer is relying on the farmer and the farmer is relying on the truck driver and and and then the stores there and they're relying on people coming to buy and so it takes all of the pieces together to make it work to make a society to work to make an economy to work and uh and so everybody is uh makes a uh uh some sort of uh um profession of what that they do I know people that are a full-time student I have a cousin that's been in school for 50 years you know he writes grants and he takes classes and he goes to University and that's what he does you know and and the uh others are teachers so you understand that it's something that you say that you're doing I remember uh you know Billy Paul told me and I think it's on tape also but he said daddy told me if I was going to be a bum not to work one day in my life so if you're going to be a bum that's I'm I'm a bum then that's what you do you you know what I mean that that's what you do and then the other part of the definition it's an occupation and you know to occupy something uh in after the war uh we we would have what we called an occupational Force it was somebody there that that occupied they they stayed in the country so that the the enemy that they had overcome wouldn't rise back up again so it means to occupy means well when you occupy a home you are living in that home you're you're there that's what you do you're taking up that space and so a career is an occupation so that's what you do you occupy that that's what you do you're doing it every day you're preparing for it all the time it's an ongoing thing it's in occupation it's not a sometime you you you know what I mean you just don't you don't do it uh uh sometimes you know now I I I have to say nowadays That I Used to Be electrician because every time I get around around the young electricians they call me old school you know I let's do it this way we don't do that no more and they'll come up with some Gadget you you know what I mean that does something for you and I think I don't even trust it but oh it's the way to do it you know what I mean and and I so I just sit back and uh you know I used to um do Knockouts with a a a whole saw and a crescent wrench and so I got the knockout set yet and those guys looked at me like I'm crazy they got this little thing that they just put on there it's a it's run by a drill motor I go that's not even making that ain't electricians no more I said that's sissies you know you know I used to go home my hands were all cut up from being in the Box you know and and my twisting joints and and that's where you take the wires and you twist them you don't do that no more they got this little plastic thing you stick the wires in you know because it it Advanced you know what I mean but so you know an occupation means that's what you occupy see I don't occupy that anymore I don't occupy that space I don't occupy that thinking in other words I'm not in there I'm not doing that I'm not occup in that that my my presence isn't in that realm in that Dimension because my presence isn't in that realm and dimension and I'm not occupying it I haven't moved up with it right you understand and they passed me by and uh and so you you you understand that that's part of what a career is it's an occupation it's something that you OCC occupy how many have heard of continuing education I I I I guess I see heads naughty right you got to if you don't if you're going to be in a career it's mandatory you keep up with it you you know what I mean uh uh what would you do if you walked in and a doctor came in and you were sick and he says well I'm going to take two pints of blood out of you you say wait a minute they quit bleeding people two centuries ago but if you don't stay with it if you're not in it if you're not occupying it that's why it's called a what an occupation a profession it's something you keep up with it's something you're you're you're doing you're go you're you're in continuing education uh so so many things like we have some photographers here you you you want to know if if if I showed up with you know uh one of those Kodak insta cameras you know and was putting out pictures you know and I went to Sister Rebecca I said let's go let's go take some pictures you know what I mean and I pulled out my little thing and said isn't that a good picture you know and she'll she'll have four or five bags on her you know and one camera in front of her and one camera in her and you know what I mean and oh I got to wait a minute I got to get this lens out and set five or six seven lenses out here and then she you know you oh you got to get the lights just right you know what I mean they bought a sep a whole bunch of separate lights just so my face won't have any shadows in it you know what I mean so when I get over there in this building by the of God I've been promised that I'm going to look good they even have a special button that if I need a little more on the right and a little more on the left you know I mean because they they're they're photographers you know that's what they do they read books on it you know I I I remember I sat in the plane one day and I looked over that guy said you know someday they're going to make shoes for walking and they're going to write books about how to walk I made that in just and now they got it yeah you know everything everything but these are people who they're so involved and what they doing it's their career because by it they make a living so it it's a trade a vocation a vocation is is you know it so anyway it's it's what it's what they do for a living now with that definition in mind uh think about a Christian career or a Christian vocation a vocation is a is a strong uh substance and desire to participate in a certain field of endeavor another another words if I could use another word for it calling my vocations my calling this is It's a I have a desire to uh to participate in this field and so uh we're talking today just for a few moments this morning and I think it's probably the thing that's most neglected I will say in my life is my spiritual and Christian career okay now remember a career is something that you do to live by it doesn't matter what it is you you you know uh uh I I I asked a guy one time a friend of mine he used to collect uh trash we'd call him a garbage man and he informed me right away that he wasn't a garbage man he was a sanitary engineer so I thought that's pretty good isn't it so you paint it any way you want to paint it right okay you've given yourself to something that's going to help you survive and make a living and too many times our other career gets left behind so that's what we just want to visit with you this morning and I I feel this way for reason okay is I believe that God doesn't look at us Through The Eyes of man you understand he looks at us through the eyes of what he saw in us before we got here you understand so God sees something different in you than you even see in yourself right and and that's one of the great things that we have to battle is our self-esteem or our our self analysis or what that we feel about ourselves but so I just wanted to go through a few points this morning with you at to establish with you in each of you have a Christian career right you understand you have a spiritual career whether or not uh you're active in it is a different thing but we just want to ask ourselves is there something that's within us is there something that we have that is pursuable and obtainable and it to obtain uh a career uh that it or a trade it's something that takes uh some sort of training and effort and accumulation of knowledge and understanding uh before you make a profession that you are something you better know how to do it you you uh uh um I ran a a a painting business for several years and I would have people that would come in to me and they say that they were a painter uh you know and you know 10 gallons of paint remover and 500 sheets of sandpaper later I fixed what they thought that they were doing when they were painting you know they weren't painters you know what I mean they they they had no training they had no background they had no understanding you know they probably watched one of those YouTube videos where a girl all dressed in a helmet and goggles and little tool belt that never looks like it's been used before and and you know she and she goes and fixes something and 10 minutes you know it took them two weeks to make the show and but that's not reality you know in other words if you've accomplished something to to say that you're a teacher or or or or you profess a trade you put some time into it you learned something you made some mistakes you you you you worked your way to that point you had to have somebody Mentor you teach you pass knowledge on to you uh uh brother J could you imagine somebody learning electricity the hard way you know oh the black wire makes you wiggle and so you go around then you grab the red wire oh the the red wire makes you wiggle well don't touch the yellow or the orange or the brown cuz that's designed for higher voltage that'll really make you shake you know what I mean we don't learn things we learn you understand that our mothers and our fathers were our first teachers they helped us take our first step they they taught us what to eat they taught us how to do things you know what I mean mean so we've always been trained all our life you even had to be trained to live so we we so let's just uh take a few moments this morning because I want you as we preach this morning or Minister talk with you God's looking at you and he gave you a career in Christ he gave you he placed Within you he he he he he made you and so we understand that and so uh so we in preaching the gospel over the last few weeks and everything we we we talked you about the law of the seed we've been talking about the law of the seed and last week I know I made some statements and I I thought that I might get a little um uh uh feed uh feedback on it but you know I and I hope that you take it the way that I meant it but I said that you know you can't be Jesus right you you you understand you can't be him you've got to be what you are and you were in God's thinking in the beginning how many we know that we've established that we we've went through that and so that's what we said that when that which is perfect is come when when all the gifts and things are done away with in part because prophecies will fail right tongues will cease but there's one thing that won't cease and that's what God had in his mind right and what is a word a word is a thought expressed amen and uh and that word was with God and that word was made flesh and the scripture said he made the world and the world knew him not and so the very creator of Heaven and Earth the thoughts of God were were came down and they were manifested and so we've established that there are there are uh that there that that there's a spiritual man and a carnal man so how we're looking at yourself right you're an outside man a spirit man and you're a spiritual man you have your personality if I could say that which is spiritual which is uh a a nature and then your nature is in the form of the outside person that you are and and I'm a firm believer that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder you you understand you you might look upon a person and and you might not think that they're very handsome or very attractive but you know there's somebody else out there that's just oh you know I I I mean I'm glad lesie felt that way else I wouldn't had I wouldn't have had a chance yeah yeah you know what I mean uh uh of course a guy asked me one time what spell I put on her he heard that I was The Wizard so he thought I Put a Spell on her you know no I just think that was the grace of God but you know so you you can't compare yourselves one with another this the scripture says that it you're a fool when you compare yourselves one with another and and we're we're we're warned and we're trained that don't don't choose somebody according to their looks alone you know what I mean because they will fade you you know what I mean could you imagine when I walked up to lesie and I met her when I was uh 20 years old or whenever it was and this is she looked down the road and saw this and and you know as as this went away this became bigger and and she would have looked at that she she said oh my goodness you know what I mean no you don't you better find something that endures character grows character gets more beautiful as time goes on character gets stronger virtues get more have more strength you know what I mean so we don't measure but but we have a we have a carnal man the outside that the sensus the things that we've we've established all that stuff those things but I don't think that we're taking the training and the establishing and the teaching and using it for our career oh my God isn't teaching you these things for you to sit there and for me to sit here and be be what we would call spiritual no that is not spiritual that is theology right you know know that that's that's theology right if you just to gain knowledge doesn't uh doesn't do anything what does knowledge do how many know what the scripture says knowledge does knowledge puffeth up it may you you know what something that's puffed up is somebody that thinks they're more than they really are they're all puffed up right yeah you know what I mean you know insects and lizards and stuff they could they they'll Puffs out they're trying to appear to be something that they're not it's like a protective mechanism yeah you know what I mean uh uh uh it's like a a guy told me you know a guy applied for a a a a job as a carpenter and he walked in there and he he he he he said uh uh he says oh you're a carpenter he says let me see your Hammer you know and the guy pulled out his hammer and he threw his hammer up and twirled it around and caught it and everything he says Ah he says I got a bunch of a hammer twirlers I need a carpenter you know and so that's just theology believe me as as as your friend and and fellow laborer our knowledge does not impress God what we know doesn't impress him to know what he knows you would have to be him and he's trying to get us there that's right so we have the outside man and we have uh uh the uh we have the spiritual mind and we have the carnal mind we have this we have the spiritual man or the Inner Man and the outer man so we we have these these these things that we are now our our nature is to attend to the flesh to the outside guide keep them warm keep them comfortable keep them fed try to keep them healthy uh to take care of them we labor in taking care of our flesh the our flesh has the preeminence in our lives uh that's our survival Instinct you you understand but the spiritual uh inner man he seems to go uh more neglected than anything but did you know a a strong in inner man has more capability of taking care of the outer man than somebody with a weak Inner Man and we won't go into all all that this morning but it it's things that you find out over time if you have a good moral substance and you have good moral character it it keeps you out of places that do harm to the outer man but a weak in inner man will cause the fleshly man or the outer man to get into places that do him harm because we have these two beings that we are we're the outer man we have the spiritual mind the carnal mind and the carnal mind is what it's a enity with God and know it doesn't fit into what God has in mind right yeah so the carnal pursues carnal right right the carnal things are after the carnal things of the world but the spiritual mind seeketh after the things of God now if God has a career for you this morning a spiritual career or a Christian career my my my whole theme this morning is is what are we doing to pursue that your vocation your calling your gift you know that that's a question because God has been actually sent a messenger to try to make us aware of the fact amen okay that we have life in us and we we have a a a calling in us and we have a seed in us and that he had something in mind when he put us here in fact he predestinated the believer to every age to prove his word now we're not here I don't want you to be here I don't want the young people to be here because mama and daddy makes you and you're you're trying to keep the peace at home now that's smart I commend that but and I would do the same I mean that was one rule me and lesli had that the kids had to be in church on Sunday well we couldn't control every aspect of their life so they'd sit in church on Sunday you know just dreading it you understand so I but I Knew by the promise of God's word that if they if I made them sit on the back one day they'd make it to the front [Music] Hallelujah right so so so we we know know those things but you know don't get so carnal minded that you can't get some value on right out of being forced to be here you know I've went places that you know they wanted me to go well we're all going to go do this and go down and I drag myself along and force myself to go in there and act and feel bad all the time sit there you know and after a while you know it got to be pretty good and I was enjoying myself you know and uh uh and after a while you know I of course I walk I said well it's all right you know maybe I'm you know but I enjoyed myself because I sat through it so just don't don't come and shut off the opportunity to gain a lot of knowledge and a lot of wisdom and a lot of things that can help you down life's Road you know I trust this morning even though I'm a man in flesh with all my shortcomings but as long as we stay within this word this word is what will bless you it'll do something positive for you so we we have the inner man we have the outer man now we we want to remember this this morning cuz we're talking about your Christian career another words God has given you a career in Christianity right he's giving you a a career in Christianity a spiritual career in other words it's an Endeavor and occupation something that you do spiritually a vocation a gift a calling something that you do for the kingdom of God some people they we talk they they have a musical gift or they they have a gift I could I didn't want to take the time this morning to go into it and said that the spirit of God's the part of gifts some have helps so some have different gifts some different callings different things that you do for the kingdom I I I I would say behooves us to ask ourselves what does God want me to do for his kingdom the body right the scripture tells us we've been going through all this Christian education for what come on come on a hope that we get up there and we hope that we did enough good things to make it that we hope we get in that we hope we don't go to hell I I just think that God didn't go through all the trouble of bringing each of you to the revelation of Mal 45 something that is absolutely a reproach to the Christian world to make you oddballs as far as your religious belief is as far as the way our sisters dress our brothers act he didn't do all that to have you sit down here on this Earth with the hopes of so right amen this isn't The Wizard of Oz someday Over the Rainbow you know with a someday or a hope you understand I hope I want to go beyond that I know for a fact that God's Got something planned for each and every single one of us and nobody can take your place something that you uniquely possess some place for you to occupy a profession that you can make something that that is is a vocation a calling a a desire in Your Heart Right it might be to feed the poor it might be to visit the the the father fatherless and the widows in their Affliction where have that where's so those things gone to they're still in the word they're absolutely the pattern of the early church Paul telling Timothy lay for yourself a pattern of good works let no man despise your youth stir up the gift that was in you you know from your grandmother but we've quit pursuing that it hasn't our our our carnal career and our carnal Minds have totally Gras everything that it takes to pursue a Earthly career if you want to be good at something what do you have to do got to practice that's right a lot of guys have natural ability but they don't make it to the top of their game so to speak because they don't work on the fundamentals they don't work on the cabin they don't lay for themsel the pattern they don't participate they don't do continual education they have no desire or nor no fortitude ude to reach a higher height so we we've got to sit back this morning and and and take a good look at ourselves so like I said we're not trying to just imitate the Lord Jesus that's an imitation right but we want in US what God placed in us from the beginning we want that to come to full maturity so we can be working and established in the spiritual career that he had intended us to do now religion came along and said I'll just wrap you in a covering some religious outward uh thing that lets everybody think that you're going to heaven that's right well you know I I want more than that I want to be all that I can be I don't want no pretense I want to be all that I can be so I know that certain things that we establish is we we we we establish that God determined to do everything by seed yes yes sir you understand that it's the law of the seed God chose the method of the seed to bring forth creation the first seed was the word seed Let There Be he said let there be and there was and then he separated the land and and and then he said let every seed bring forth of its kind so God chose seed we're all here because of seed the method that God chose for animals to procreate for humans to procreate all all those things it was done for Plant World they all have their law but it all comes down to seed right so there's a law in the seed so even your spiritual career is in you in seed form amen now because you're in the world and you're you go to the world and your parents are working there you see they have a career you go to school and the teachers are teaching you and you'll go to a counselor and everything you you know what I mean and uh you know I go into my counselor you know what I'm saying and and uh they they talk me well you know you're pretty good maybe you could become an airplane pilot you know of course they didn't know I was called to be an astronaut you know what I mean I'm going beyond the stars hallelujah hallelujah Heen and you know you could be this or you could be that they try to direct you take these classes take those classes in fact even a lot of times economics determine I can only afford so much college so I I will get this much education that's what I can afford you were trained for that right you were brought up in that so carnally carnally minded naturally the flesh man was already designed because of the fall in the garden to pursue a carnal career okay so you we didn't even realize that there was something else in us another man another career So within every single one of you here this morning there is another career a Christian career a spiritual career a spiritual calling a spiritual vocation something that God saw in the beginning and he placed within you but Satan's whole program is to get you to neglect that career that's the career that he doesn't want you to become good at he don't want you to become good at being a Christian he wants you to be good at repentance good I'm sorry I'm sorry oh I'm so sorry I did this I'm so sorry I did that you know some of that's always saying they're sorry what are they they're sorry people say to me oh I'm sorry and I like think are you really then bring forth some meat to repentance you know I I I I like the word excuse me more than I'm sorry oh oh I'm sorry okay well then buy me an ice cream if you're sorry bring forth meat for repentance you know do something don't be sorry we need to quit being sorry come on we've we've learned to accept being sorry we've learned to accept oh we just got we're just carnal beings and we just got a carnal mind and we're going to struggle is that what God planted I can't believe that you know what he planted he planted Sons and Daughters he planted careers H callings vocations right works that's what he planted so it's in it's in you it's in you let me hurry along if you get sore get up walk around so we just go so the seed the seed is in you so let's just read these couple this is paragraph 64 of God's power to transform he says and every things under control to bring forth of its kind right now remember to bring so it's in you you are the Earth that the seed of God is planted in when he put the seed seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it right all right it can only come forth with the power of life in it every career that man has pursued he's had the ability to do it because the power was in his flesh to do it is that simple enough I I I I just want it to be simple and to and he said within it to transform from seed to a plant or whatever it was so the career that's in you spiritually has got to transform from seed to what that it is amen now we've established over and over and over again we're seed we're the seed of God we're the word of God we're in the mind of God how we've got that do we have that yet does everybody know your name's written on the Lamb's Book of Life is that settled you're the seat of God you're the children of God for what for what career for what calling for what purpose the powers within you but it's not pursued it's not sought after right he said to whatever is his transforming power now God put the seed in there with potential that it would be what he said it would be so you've got the potential m in you to fulfill your Christian career do do you all understand you've got a career you got a calling you got gifts you've got things that you are that he made you and as long as it stays in its right category it would be just exactly what God said it would be it had to be that way cuz he made it that way so the program's already there he made it that way the only reason men pursue carnal careers is because that's the law of God right he made it that way right all satan did is took what God did in the spiritual realm perverted it in the fleshly realm and's got everybody working for his kingdom instead of the kingdom of God I want to stop and say okay I have to work I'm in this world but I'm not of this world my career is not to have a statue down at McGary square and everybody go down there and say oh there's McGary you're just as dead as that statue is it's history right so I can go see the George Washington Monument great big pencil sitting up in the air I never me George right no I believe all the lies they tell about him you know he never told a lie and or was that a blinkin I can't even keep all the lies straight and he chopped down a cherry tree and he threw a dollar across the Delaware and all these things you know and and then when they really gave after him he was a slave owner and he's all this stuff and they want to tear his Monument down and you can't fix the past right forget about the past yes sir how about pursuing your Christian career how about pursuing Christianity how about pursuing what it means to be a Christian to lay for yourself a pattern of good work to go the extra mile to go Twain to give Nobody Does that in anymore because they're under the deception that the message gets you to heaven the message does not get you to heaven the spirit of Jesus Christ is what gets you to heaven the message was a word from God to get you in contact with your career let's finish reading real quick we'll close he said he made it that way and made a channel he made a channel he made a channel Satan made a channel for you to pursue your carnal career school education training inter internship practice on the job training whatever he made a channel are we aware this morning of the channel of our spiritual career have we pursued that channel have we found that channel now I know I'm being honest with you this morning because God's looking down and seeing all this potential that's hung up in the world come on and has now become afraid of the world we have a promise the righteous will not beg bread that settles it you want to live a long life what do you do you honor your father and mother you don't honor your father and mother long life is not your gift he made it that way be made a channel a a Pursuit a way a way to get there am a way to accomplish it okay so your spiritual career has got to grow in you first of all you're never going to pursue it if you don't want it if you're content in being an intellectual Christian if you're content in just believing the doctrine having the hope that you've believed the right thing you're part of the right group you're hanging around in the right spot therefore you're going to make it and that's good but I'm hoping that there's somebody here that says I want to be all that I can be I want to be what he made me I want to be able to play a part in the body I want to be able to do things that are that are are for the kingdom I want to I want Christ to live in me I want to and I I can't be him but his Spirit can be in me yes J in his line of word anything that stays in his channel in the line of in the line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like the word said it would do it cannot move from there it's channeled just exactly right so God knew what he doing whatever career he put in you he's got to channel right it's got a way to come alive and it's got to be what it is that's why there's no big eyes and little use it's just people that do all that the father tells them to do so with everything in in the trust of his own son that it would be that way God said it is all good so I'll just rest and each one of those seeds has the power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desired it to be what did he desire you to be Sons and Daughters of God really don't look at the mirror sin designed that guy the c Christian career was designed by God and he says that's what it must be because I've given every seed transforming power to make out of it self in its potential now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be amen yeah I'll just read one more just to good what does the seed do look at the little little apple tree out here you people raise a lot of apples look at the little apple tree when it's no more than what we call in the East a sprig a little tree about about that did you know that every Apple will ever be on that tree is in it right then if it isn't where did it come from where did it come from what that apple tree that's going to produce hundreds of bushels of apples where do they come from they come from the life of the apple tree from that one little seed that carried that life and when you set that little plan out about like that about like that just out of a single apple seed and set it out there and every Apple that'll ever be on there has got in it then potential every hund bushels of apples that you will collect off of it it ain't a half an inch high amen there you are where does it come from it's in the Apple then what do you what is it I'm trying to tell you your career your spiritual career is in you amen it was in you when you were born right you came up all through the carnality you came up all through education but now now it's time amen and I'll say it like this and I I don't mean to be offensive but not to pursue gifts but to pursue careers amen good very good amen gifts may be there to help you along your career amen but individually as I tried to say last week it's not pursuing what he was it's pursuing the fact that he opened up for you by taking sin and by sending his Spirit he opened up to you the ability now for you to pursue your Christian career being a genuine living Son of God whose name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life he says and when you are planted in his death burial and Resurrection planted in Christ and receive his holy spirit life in you everything that you got need of all the way through the Journey is in you in you right then it's got to be what harvested and so in closing let's just take a quick look it said so Jesus had a purpose and he had a Cause right Jesus had a reason for being right do you believe that God came down and by seed created in Mary brother Ram said both German egg he created in Mary and Jesus was born into the world with a cause for this reason I have come into the world he had a purpose right Satan offered him a different career he knew that he had a reason he knew he was a Kinsman and he knew in order for every son and daughter of God to find their spiritual career to find their spiritual purpose to find the gifts and the callings that were within their lives he had to go to Calvary and pay the price for sin and he did that that's done now Satan's going to tell you that every day of your life you can't be a Christian guess what he don't want you to be a Christian Satan loves you so much he wants you to burn in hell with him now that's a love story I just want to be a part of that oh Satan take me to Hell burn I want to burn until I'm burn up really come on and will neglect so great a Salvation your career is your salvation yes so what did he come for he had a reason for living one to show The Father's Love right to show man and God could be in Fellowship they could have a union you can Fellowship God you can have a career with God Jesus's career was what I only do that which the father shows me it's not I that does the work it's the father in me that does the work that's what his Pursuit was that's what his profession was that's what his occupation was that's what his training was you think he had training he learned obedience by what the things he suffered amen it's beautiful love story he says and then when also did he want to show us that you could do the same works that he did right John John 1 and2 he gave him power to be the Sons and Daughters of God so what did he do a channel he gave us a channel God gave us his spirit and word so that the seed man has something to bring him to maturity he didn't give you the holy spirit for sensation I got a powerful quote on that he said God didn't make you so you could be like bugs that's right do you know he said that oh if I had my phone I'd pull it up for you right now but I'll get off track I'm not interested in what's wrong I'm interested in what's right amen so it gave us this he gave us the spirit right so that we could do the works that the spirit would what lead us and guide us in all truth and righteousness well what is the real truth it's not facts that's out here right because you can't even see love right right you if I was to ask you to describe love all you could do is describe all the characteristics that we know that go with it loyalty uh longing to be with somebody the ability to spend much time with the person and not have them get on your nerves you know time is the greatest test of a marriage I had a friend one time he said he dated a girl for a year uh and uh they went out together and everything which I'm not totally against if it's done right and and uh let that one get out there for a while I can defend my place it's why nobody gets married no more nobody wants to spend time with anybody nobody wants to talk to anybody nobody wants to to be together together they can't do it everything's got a sin tank to it you know well we just need his more Spirit-filled people all you get a spiritful boy and a spirit filled girl together they can do something together and it would be as clean you can go read the testimony of the of the lady that dated brother Brandon what a gentleman he was how kind he was never did anything you know un seemingly and everything he's just you know just perfect so if we the truth you're going to lead us and guide us in all truth and righteousness the truth about you the truth about you the truth about me is what God put me here for my spiritual career a pattern of good works you know something you do for the kingdom something that burns with inside of you I remember when I came off of that roof and the Lord had taken that suicide Spirit off of man the desire to no more more live you know why people take their lives they don't have they can't find a reason to live that's right Satan has separated them from their spiritual and Christian career they have no Christian Pursuit they have no work God don't need Believers Satan believes and fears and trembles right God needs men and women who will who seek what it is that God called them to do what Their heart's desire is to their fellow man whether they're a Believer or not it's easy to be good to someone that sees the way you see it's easy to take from somebody who will lend again but someone that's a real genuine Christian that that does good that that visits the poor that feeds the hungry that has a pattern of Good Works they're they're being a Christian they're pursuing being a Christian Christian isn't something that you believe Christian is something you are Christianity is a career it's a possession it's a Pursuit it's a trade a trade means it's something that's got works that produces a result yeah it's genuine oh if we give half as much time oh just give 10% of your time to the kingdom God only ask for 10% of what you're blessed with how about just giv them 10% of your time you'll be so blessed you'll turn it to 20 and righteousness I'm going to send you the spirit so he can lead you and guide you that you might find your career that you might do the works that I did every one of you is different every one of you touches people that we can't touch but please don't get to the place that you think because you believe this message that gets you in that's why you've got to be borned again you've got to have a nature and that new nature seeks after that which is spiritual it seeks after the works that the father would have me to do and my question to you this morning is and I ask this to myself can I go much higher than I am you know people that play golf their whole goal is to limit the number of shots they take and you find out what a pursue it is they hit two to 3,000 balls a week they play four and five rounds they take lessons I tell anybody anybody that played golf said you want to be better take lessons otherwise be happy being a hack be happy you hit the ball in the woods be happy that you dig it out of the sand be happy hitting 120 Strokes around you know be happy you're outside but you'll never be good you'll never be good without learning it baseball you can go play baseball and get a hit every now and then you know what a guy that's good at baseball does hours it's a career it's a Pursuit and those things pass away the things we're talking about are Eternal every man's going to be judged according to his works and if his Works aren't right they'll be burned by fire right but nevertheless you'll be saved by fire right the Bible is not theology the Bible's life and the Bible is the Life of Christ manifested in you in the career that he called you in so this morning I want you to ask yourself can I go higher can I be a better Christian can I do more Christian things can I Step Beyond the limitations of my mind and body and be able to say I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me can I go the extra mile can I give my clo will I even recognize do I even have the spiritual eyes say sa that I'm required in this day give me ey Sav that I might see give me gold tried in fire which is Christlike character give me right reain it to be clothed in the work of the saints that my nakedness doesn't appear show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my career by my calling by my trade by my vocation can I go higher can I do more for the kingdom of God have I really sought after and worked on and practiced Christianity Christianity is a practice you practice Christianity you do it you do it amen I afraid too many times the musicians will come this morning I usually call them magicians but cuz to me it's magic how they can play so long but if I mean can we you know can we ask ourselves am I really pursuing or trying to find my Christian career and there a question I just wanted to leave with you this morning have I even given it consideration I even asked myself is there something I can do for my fellow man Lord what would you have me to do Lord you know all things you know that I love you you know what he gave Peter then he gave him a career right feed my Lambs feed my sheep and I'm just asking asking you this morning have you sat down not with your buddy not with nobody but just yourself said what more can I do for the kingdom of God lord what what what is it I see what other people do and but I want something for me I want it to be real for me and that's what I'd like to challenge you with this morning because honestly I think that that's what God's looking more from out of his church though I understand all the Mysteries though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity it profit me nothing I become a sounding timble and a tinkling brass my life gives an uncertain sound and I hope the Lord's stirring you up this morning and you're asking what can I do to be a better Christian many of us need to start by applying the [Music] token get your house ready for him to come in yes get your house ready for others to come in and I think if we just press the mark and have a greater understanding all the seals were opened and all the Mysteries because the scripture says great is the mystery of godliness to be like God Amen I hope that you take it to heart this morning let's Stand [Music] Together Ben would you help start this song for me do you know it you alone are all I need alone are all and you just look to him in your own heart this morning what is my destiny [Music] Lord you I am oh that's the channel Hallelujah draw me draw me Lord oh I'll come running after you draw me draw me I'll come running let's sing it again you alone are all for you my you alone are all I need you alone I am and compl dra

be anybody know what I know I [Music] what yeah I want all that you have for me yes think of that this morning do you want all that he has for you I thank God you know he he he he didn't put guile in my heart and I'm grateful for that you know I've never coveted anything anybody else has had I've never looked at a man's boat and said oh I I want that boat you know what I mean I I would say I want my own boat yeah and by the grace of God it'll be better than his but I always wanted what's mine yes I don't want what's somebody else's I want what's mine yes I don't want to copy another man's Ministry I want to do what he wants me to do I want all that he has yes for me this morning and this morning what you're singing that remember Sister Sandy's sister that bad in leukemia the man that Drew our church plans is battling [Music] leukemia let's don't forget Enrique in the hospital recovering from a car accident and if you have a need this [Music] morning maybe you could say to the Lord Lord I have a lot of needs but you know I really haven't been pursuing you and maybe if I sought after my Christian career and my spiritual career maybe some of these things would start coming around
