It's a It's a good thing to be gathered with the saints this evening. Uh you know how I feel about Sunday nights. If you don't, then I can tell you this is not leftovers. It's just a second helping, right? Man, I think in tribute to brother Paul's message on Wednesday night, let's sing the little chorus. I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. No idea of the key. We'll just put it wherever. You know, you find out I don't follow them. They have to find where I'm at and follow me. So, we just all work together here. So, amen. And oh, I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. I've been washed in the bath, cleansed by his joy with Jesus as we travel on the cross of the family, the Let's try it again. Oh, I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. I've been washed in the valley, cleansed by his blood. Join with Jesus as we travel. I'm a part of the family. The family of God. Amen. Brother John, would you mind coming and open our service? Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, as we just come to you this evening, Lord, we pray that you just speak to our hearts, Lord. That Lord God would just come into your presence, Lord. That we could just be reverent, Lord, and that we can just be still, Lord. That in our lives as you just deal with each one of us, Lord, we could just learn to heed your voice, Lord. that Lord God as we have just been hearing from the preaching Lord we pray that we can surrender our vessel Lord that we can be of help to others Lord that Lord we don't just want to live for ourselves Lord but to just live for others Lord Lord I pray we could just come tonight and just hear the word you would speak to us Lord that we could just accept it Lord that Lord it can just be something we can live out Lord Father God we pray you just bless the remainder of this service Lord and Even for those that just have needs, Lord, we pray you speak to them tonight. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. I must say, Brother Paul did a better job in his second language than I did on that song in my first language. Amen. Amen. We really appreciate the ministry that uh God has given to us and uh the expression. It's been a blessing to all of us. Amen. And it's nice when it coincides and it's right in line with the word. That's the best part. Amen. Amen. Let's sing an old time one. Uh, glory to his name. It starts out like down at the cross where my savior G or so. I guess the good old gospel G. Down at the cross where my Savior died. Down where for cleansing from sin I cry. There to my heart was the Lord. Glory to his name. Glory to his name. Glory to his name. [Music] There to my heart was the blood of lamb. Glory to his name. I am so onely safe from sin. Jesus so sweetly abides with me there at the cross where he took me. [Music] Glory to his name. I'm singing glory to his name. Glory to his name. [Music] There to my heart was the blood of life. Glory to his name. [Music] Oh precious fountain that saves from all sin. There I am so glad I have entered there. Jesus save me and keep me. [Music] Glory to his name. Glory to his name. Glory to his name. There to my heart was the blood of life. Glory to his name. [Music] Come to this mountain so rich and sweet. cast thy soul and the savior's king and be made. Glory to his name. [Music] Glory to his name. Glory to his name. There to my heart was the blood of [Music] glory to his name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can tell from up here we're not getting full participation. There's some folks not singing their heart out. But maybe we'll sing one you like. We'll see. But amen. You know, brother, sister, we uh we think about the coming of the Lord and the rapture. And uh it kind of struck me last week that we we kind of place that as the highest miracle that could happen to us. A changing of our body from a mortal to immortal. To be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. Even if you're afraid of heights, you're going to take a a high-flying ride one of these days, right? But in a sense, that's really not the greatest miracle. The greatest miracle for most of us has already occurred. That change from death into life in our mortal bodies here. We've made the decision. Brother Ram said, "The hardest thing for a man to do is to believe another man." You know, that's the way the gospel is spread from lip to ear. It's it's witnessed by a life lived. But there has to be a gospel behind it, a message behind it. And we've received a message. We've seen the life lived. &gt;&gt; That's evidence. But the word behind it, it points to the living word. And that makes manifest. And that's the that's the greatest miracle that's already happened. So let me assure you that what's to come is just a a quickening. It's just a making alive and manifestation of what's already happened. And I I thinking too, and I don't want to take too much time. We've got ministers to minister to you, but in my uh in my growing up days, I'd say it's back in the 80s when you're influenced a lot. MTV came out. It was music television. And I thought we've got our MTV. It's manifestation through vindication. You know, this message has been so thoroughly vindicated. We don't need to to prove Brother Brandon was a prophet anymore. Within our midst, we know everything he said was right in line with the word. Now, it's time for us to manifest what he said, what he brought us. So, amen. So, amen. Let's let's sing I'm going through. I'm going through. It's the old number 91. Amen. [Music] Let's see. There's more to it than that, brothers. There should be about four or five verses of that. [Music] They put up the chorus and [Music] We'll give them a minute. [Music] How many have started out and they're going to end up the same way. Man, that's this song. It takes us back, but it says, you know, I've started in with Jesus and I'm going through. That's my determination. David said to this is the day the Lord hath made. And Timothy says, I am determined to rejoice and be glad in it. Not that I'm trying to add to the word, but that's my take on it is someone has to be here to believe it. Amen. Oh, they're that's quick. They're able to copy and paste from some other and put in amazing technology and and youth, I will say. [Music] Everybody remember this song? A few of us do. Not very many expect to go through. Amen. Lord, I have started to walk in the light shining upon from heaven so bright. I made the world and it's all easy. I've started in Jesus and I'm going. I'm going through. Yes, I'm going. I'll pay the price. Whatever others do, I'll take the way with the Lord despise me. I've started in with Jesus and I'm going through many they are who started the rain but with the light refuse to keep others accept it because it is a nonf Very many expect to go. I'm going through. Yes, I'm going through. I'll pay the price. Whatever others do, I'll take the way with the Lord is mine. I'm going through Jesus. I'm going through [Music] and I' rather walk with Jesus alone. Have for a pillow like Jing [Music] each moment with his face. That's straight from my pathway and where to go. I'm going through. Yes, I'm going through. I'll pay the price. Whatever others need, I'll make the way with the Lord is mine. I'm going through Jesus. I now the gospel call. Oh brother, now will take us cross. Give up the world and count it as long. Sell all thou and give to and go through with Jesus and go to him. I'm going. Yes, I'm going to. I'll pay the price. Whatever other I'll take the way with the Lord despise. I'm going through Jesus. I'm going through. Amen. Amen. Amen. I hope we really mean that. Brother Jose, you ready to come with your special brother? Amen. He share this burden up here with me. Bless you all. Like to say special. I had this in my heart. We can have struggles. We can have a lot of problems and things, right? But we know that up in heaven there is a home waiting for us. And we know that some glad morning when this life is over, we all fly away, right? You know, just a little testimony before we came back to church. We were having lunch and um the exact same thing that brother Tim start uh saying about you know the life that we we have already been quickened you know brother Brandham said you know now we have been quickened now we have been healed right so the exact same thing that he was saying that's the exact same thing that we were commenting you know and saying that we're just waiting for the transformations of our bodies, right? And uh go like to sing this song. Some glad morning when this life is over, I'll fly away to a home on God's celestial shore. I fly away. [Music] Fly away. Oh glory. Fly away. I won't die. Halleluah. By and by, I'll fly away. When the shadows of this light have grown out, fly away like a drone. I have no fly away. I fly away. Oh, glory. I'll fly away. I wonder. Halleluah. By and by, I'll fly away [Music] and just stop a few more happy days and day now. Fly awayward [Music] your sh never end. I'll fly away. I'll fly away. Oh, glory. I fly away. I won't die. Hallelujah.

I don't think the angels can compare with that kind of singing. Amen. Uh let's sing one more before we change the order of the service and take up our offering and prayer request. But it throw the brothers another curve. See if they have the meeting in the air. Do we have that one? Amen. There's going to be a meeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Oh, you have heard of little Moses in the morning. You have heard of fearless David and his sleep. You have heard the story told of three angel and of Jonah and the whale we all see.

Amen. Amen. We certainly want to rejoice over the things we're going to see, but we can also rejoice in the things that we won't see. Amen. Amen. Um, we want to remember Sister Rachel Bennett this evening. She's not feeling well. Uh, and Sister Peace is asking prayer for her husband who's sick and he's been uh placed in a nursing home. So, we want to remember them. And then uh also from this morning uh sister Zil Ma uh pray for her dad who will be undergoing surgery this coming Tuesday. His name is Juan Pablo. So we want to remember him. All right, let's just uh if we could stand in reverence and we go to the Lord in prayer. We get ready to change the order of the service. Dear Lord Jesus, once again, Lord, we approach you. And Lord, we're taught that there's three kinds of prayer. There's a prayer of asking, a prayer of forgiveness, and a prayer of thanksgiving. And Lord, we've sung our songs tonight as thanksgiving and worship and honor to you. And Lord, now our hearts cry out in the asking part. Lord, truly we say thank you for Calvary and thank you for the blood that's been provided. But Lord, we ask you just come on the scene. Lord, just answer these requests as you see fit and what we have need of. Lord, we come as your children. You wouldn't turn us away, Lord. We are begotten of you, Lord. As in the book of Jeremiah, it says that you formed me in a womb. You gave me the words to speak. Lord, you set before me a race to run. Lord, let me finish this course. Be triumphant in victory, not from my effort, but from a Christ that lives in me. So granted, Lord, tonight as we we lift our hearts and our needs, our request to you, Lord, that you'd come and fill our cups, Lord, to overflowing. And as a minister comes forth and preaches your word, we can say amen and rejoice and know that Lord, we have to line up with your word or it's by the written word and the spoken word, Lord, that changes us into eternal beings. Grant it to us now we pray. And we ask this now in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Brothers, if you take the offering, appreciate it. Thank you, honey. Amen. Let's sing the little course. Peace. Peace. Wonderful peace. as we get ready to have brother Billy come. Oh peace and G probably is Oh, peace. Peace. Wonderful.

As he passes by, you will find he's not too busy to hear your heart. He's passing by this moment. Adore. Reach out and touch the Lord as he goes by. &gt;&gt; Oh, reach out and touch the Lord as he passes. [Music] You will find this to be easy to hear your heart. He's passing by his fall. Return and trust the Lord. Let's sing Shut In with God if we could as we have him come. Oh, shut in with God in a secret [Music] place. Oh, there in the spirit beholding.

Who's going to try to translate after preaching this morning? It &gt;&gt; was a good message this morning. Did you enjoy it this morning? &gt;&gt; Let us pray before. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Wonderful heavenly father, &gt;&gt; creator of universe, &gt;&gt; giver of all good gifts and excellent gifts. &gt;&gt; I want to thank you tonight &gt;&gt; for the opportunity you've given us. Come into this house of prayer. &gt;&gt; You know that without you, we could do nothing and we are waiting on you tonight. May you get us out of the way &gt;&gt; that you may transfer unto us your thoughts &gt;&gt; that we may have that we may be sons of God manifested &gt;&gt; in this difficult time. &gt;&gt; Bless this church. &gt;&gt; Bless the pastor &gt;&gt; and all those that work with him as we're going to turn in the pages of the Bible. and context. &gt;&gt; Give us a context, Father, to help us tonight as you spoke to us this morning. &gt;&gt; Commit into your hands &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First Kings chapter 17 uh verse 8. And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, &gt;&gt; "Arise, and get to Saraptor, &gt;&gt; which belonged to Zidon, &gt;&gt; and dwell there. [Music] Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee." He arose and went to Zerapta. And when he came to the gates of the city, &gt;&gt; behold, the widow woman was there gathering stick of sticks. &gt;&gt; And he called in to her, &gt;&gt; and he said, "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel. that I may drink. And and he and and as she went to fetch he called her and said, &gt;&gt; "Bring me, I pray thee, a muscle of bread in thy hand." And he said, "As the Lord thy God liveth, [Music] &gt;&gt; I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in the barrel and and the oil in the cruise and oil in the cruise. And behold, I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and address it for me and my son. &gt;&gt; We will eat. We may eat. &gt;&gt; We may eat it and die. &gt;&gt; Elijah said unto her, "Fear not. Go and do as thou has said, &gt;&gt; but make me therefore a little cake first, &gt;&gt; and bring it unto me, and after make thee one, make thee for thy and thy son. For for thus sayeth the Lord of God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste. &gt;&gt; Neither shall the the the cru of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; We thank you for coming back to the house of the Lord. My prayer tonight is that may God meet you &gt;&gt; because if God doesn't meet with us, &gt;&gt; what a natural man can bring unto you will not be helpful. &gt;&gt; May God meet you in his word and you have to go past the veil. and to see God through manal then something of supernatural may take effect. That's why said I'm not bringing a message to attract people towards me. You know that uh uh uh scripture very well on that book. But I have an interest for the things of God, not for the things of man. We don't have any interest for any man's glory. We don't have any interest for men's acclamation. We are not looking for leadership. We don't want the approval of men or the approval of those that are listening. But what we are looking for &gt;&gt; is to see established &gt;&gt; a spiritual relation between God and man in which men becomes new creatures in Christ. That's the that's the desire or the the desire for the preaching. We want to get into this mind of the prophet &gt;&gt; and to look by all means by the help of God to see a spiritual relation established between God and man. When that when that relation is established then we have confidence in one another. We see Christ in the brother. We see Christ in the sister. So tonight, &gt;&gt; I am not a a a very uh uh uh smart preacher. I would like just to call for your attention. uh something that I've been meditating on and God placed this uh uh burden on my heart &gt;&gt; uh with some uh quote from the prophet. &gt;&gt; If I can give a a title to my subject, &gt;&gt; I will title it like the prophet be certain of God. That's our prayer &gt;&gt; from the pre preaching in this morning from brother Billy. I want I want to say this to encourage you tonight. Be certain of God. Don't be certain of your job. The the job will finish. Don't be certain of your health even when you're feeling well. the health will deteriorate. &gt;&gt; Uh don't be certain of your uh uh uh colleagues or friendships because your friends will probably leave you. &gt;&gt; Don't be certain of material things because those things will spoil away. God tells us to be certain of God. &gt;&gt; It's a sound that is clear. &gt;&gt; It's a sound that doesn't have any distortion. It's a sound that takes away the fear be &gt;&gt; because God has never been &gt;&gt; and God will never be &gt;&gt; the author of fearus &gt;&gt; or the author of confusion. &gt;&gt; But God is the author of of certainty. &gt;&gt; Be certain of God, &gt;&gt; my friends. There's so many things that are happening in this world. There's so many things that can also happen and there's those things which can bring us into a place where we question our own lives and as long as we live on earth there will be terrible things that can happen. But to the little church, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is telling you tonight, be certain of God. Even in dark darkness of night, &gt;&gt; even in h temprageous don't go back, don't leave your position. Don't go to the left or to the right. Don't try to do it by yourself. Don't think that you &gt;&gt; don't think you have lost the battle. &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't get defeated. &gt;&gt; Be sureitive. &gt;&gt; Be positive. [Music] &gt;&gt; Recognize the omnipotence in whom you have believed. be persuaded that he's able to do to continue the works that he started in you &gt;&gt; until the day of his coming. God cannot start a work and to live it in the way. If God called you to salvation, regardless of what can happen, you are called to go to the end. That's why you have to be certain of God. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; is it's a it's a lot later than we think. &gt;&gt; Jesus is coming back soon. It's the time where the true Christians, they have to uh uh uh hold on to the word and the word has to be our priority number one. But my preparation for the coming of the Lord has to be more than my life has to be more than my my marriage. &gt;&gt; It's going to be more than my more than my family. I I could lose everything so that I don't lose that goal. But says in the second coming of the Lord It is a lot later than we think. &gt;&gt; We don't come to church &gt;&gt; to to occupy a pew. &gt;&gt; We don't come to church [Music] &gt;&gt; to hear a good sermon or come to church to hear good music. They all they all got their place. But what we better come to church to do &gt;&gt; is to check up &gt;&gt; with God and our soul salvation. For the day of redemption is near. when we come to church &gt;&gt; is to check up &gt;&gt; uh with God and God is his word. &gt;&gt; The word for your season concerning the salvation of our souls because the day of our redemption is here. When we come to church to hear the word, &gt;&gt; it's a word. It's a house of correction where I come to hear the word to know what the word wants me to be. Where do I need to stand in regard to the word and to to align my life towards that word to to see God in your life, you have to move away from the wickedness. You have to come back to repentance because it's the only way is to come back where you started &gt;&gt; where you have left him off &gt;&gt; and and and start the walk with him again because God doesn't work with sin. You need to move away from sin. In the le in the the reading that we have done &gt;&gt; we see that Israel &gt;&gt; which is the type of the church &gt;&gt; Israel was chosen by God. &gt;&gt; God sent Israel many prophets great men of God. Even in that we realize God didn't tolerate the sin. &gt;&gt; He he caused Israel to to to to to basically reap everything that they sow. If he cause Israel to reap everything that they sow, &gt;&gt; he will also cause us to reap what we are sowing, he's also going to cause us to reap what we are sowing. &gt;&gt; Because God doesn't make exception for anybody. He saysam says in be certain of God says paragraph 16 &gt;&gt; and we've come to the place to think &gt;&gt; that because we are resting upon what our forefathers did or what upon our great founders of our churches. what their great sacrifices was uh uh was was uh was God which is all right &gt;&gt; and so much appreciated but we cannot draw salvation from what they did salvation is an individual affair [Music] &gt;&gt; between every person and God, &gt;&gt; not with your not with your with our nation, &gt;&gt; with our church, &gt;&gt; but with ourselves before God, &gt;&gt; we answer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of us answering before God himself. &gt;&gt; I'm not a Christian because my father is a Christian. &gt;&gt; I'm not a Christian because my mom took me to church. My mom took me to church. It's a wonderful thing. But I have to have an experience, personal experience, so that the God of my mother, the God of my father may become my God also because salvation. &gt;&gt; It's an individual affair not with n with God is dealing with individuals. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So before this uh uh uh dark uh uh paint picture that we look at as Israel was in sin, &gt;&gt; they were in immorality and all kinds of things. There were there was a need for a a woman, a a widow woman. &gt;&gt; This widow woman that we just read about But when I'm saying he must have been of the caliber of Elijah, &gt;&gt; she had to had in her the qualities that was uh answering to the need of what Elijah was talking about. And we know that the woman is a type of the church. And the Bible says in Psalm One stream call for another stream. The the uh the deep calling upon another deep &gt;&gt; before they can be uh deep. Before there's a fan in the fish's back, they had to be water so it can help the fish to swim. Otherwise, it wouldn't need a fan. God gave the fan. So because there was a water, so the fan will be used for the water. Before there was a tree that can grow on earth, there had to be an earth that it was because if there was no ground, then there wouldn't have been no trees. That's why when Bam talks about the history of the It says this boy at school, he had the habit of reading razors and the the the teacher will talk to the parents and let them know. It's as though the child is eating a razor and the mother couldn't find a problem. But then a moment ago, &gt;&gt; the the mother found her eating the the bicycle tires and then the mother was uh in in inquiry. There's something that's not going right. She took the son to the hospital. And when they did the testing, they found out that within the body of the boy, &gt;&gt; there was a need for sulfur. And to find sulfur, the child was finding it in the razors, in the razors or in the the bicycle tires. And he had that desire within him. And they had to be a deed to answer to that deed. You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; So before they could be a creation, they had to be a creator somewhere so he can bring the creation into. So if you have in you a desire &gt;&gt; or the power the need for the the the healing divine, there had to be a fountain somewhere, an open fountain somewhere that can answer to that that deep. Elijah Elijah was sent to this woman. &gt;&gt; This woman was in difficulties. So was she was a widow woman but she was a believer. &gt;&gt; She had the quality &gt;&gt; to receive &gt;&gt; the prophet of God. If she didn't have those qualities [Music] God was not going to send him to that place. And I believe to receive a prophet &gt;&gt; is to say amen to everything that the prophet said &gt;&gt; and you will receive the recompense of the prophet said. &gt;&gt; What is the recompense of a prophet? Jesus said &gt;&gt; that he that receiveth a prophet &gt;&gt; and as a prophet &gt;&gt; shall receive the recompense of a prophet &gt;&gt; and the recompense of the prophet &gt;&gt; is to be a friend of a prophet and I believe tonight &gt;&gt; I am speaking to the friends of the prophet on you don't you don't hurt your friends. This woman, she was of the caliber of Elijah. &gt;&gt; She was a friend of a prophet. And when sin came, the sin had had encompassed the whole country and there was great difficulties in the land. This woman, &gt;&gt; she was waiting upon God. You have to receive a prophet &gt;&gt; is a prophet that would stand against defy the things of the world. &gt;&gt; God only speaks through the prophet not through the pastor, not through the preacher. &gt;&gt; It speaks through the prophet. What says in uh the circle we would see Jesus? &gt;&gt; It says now We we we we we we see that the prophet of the Old Testament, God has always brought his people &gt;&gt; to believe his prophets. &gt;&gt; We know that, &gt;&gt; don't we? Because the Bible says that the word of God &gt;&gt; the word which is you which was God &gt;&gt; came to the prophets. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord &gt;&gt; came to the prophets. The word of the Lord &gt;&gt; came to Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord came to Moses. The word of the Lord [Music] &gt;&gt; came different ways through the prophet was the one who had the word of God &gt;&gt; and they by having it. &gt;&gt; They manifested it. See, &gt;&gt; they manifested it &gt;&gt; because it came to them. &gt;&gt; They had it. They spoke it told exactly what would happen and it happened and that's the way that's the way they knew that there were prophets. Now you get it. See &gt;&gt; the word come to the prophet &gt;&gt; portion not all of it just part of it &gt;&gt; will come to the prophet he would express it exactly what the word was and it happened just the way they said it just said the way they said it that's why we thank the Lord [Music] Because God sent us a prophet. If Bernham didn't come, &gt;&gt; we wouldn't be gathering here. &gt;&gt; God sent us a prophet and we are a privileged people because with a prophet, we know the mind of God for our generation. What does God wants us to do? How do we supposed to walk? How are we going to serve him? &gt;&gt; We receive all of that. Because the prophet said it. &gt;&gt; God thinks the prophet speaks. &gt;&gt; And we say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Because it's the will of God. He always speaks through the prophet in the feast of trumpet. says in paragraph uh 107, &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; 87, &gt;&gt; and now &gt;&gt; these things, &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 and all of this &gt;&gt; and Hebrews 13:8, [Music] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; He remains forever. The word manifest, &gt;&gt; the word made manifest. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he declared. The what declared the prophet a prophet doesn't only mean seer or forteller. &gt;&gt; It means a revealer of the word that's written in his own life. His own works reveal and vindicates the word of that day. &gt;&gt; For example, &gt;&gt; let Noah build an ark. &gt;&gt; Moses down there, whatever more and he promised the promised word for that hour. So the entire responsibility of the revelation of the written word the Bible the written word is not given to a religious leader. It's not given to a a a legal authority. It's not given to a priest. It's not given to a pastor. It's not given to a doctor. &gt;&gt; It's given to a prophet. You have to be certain of that. That's why when you think about leaving the prophet, we are going to stay with the prophet because we are slaves to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Because the life of the prophet &gt;&gt; by the works of the prophet the word for that hour is revealed and is confirmed vindicated. contradict the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's why you cannot contradict the prophet. &gt;&gt; You can't say made a mistake here. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, &gt;&gt; no. Says in the feast of the trumpet now. &gt;&gt; We know that he's with us. We believe that. Do you believe that Jesus is with us? He said, "Where two or three are gathered in my midst, I'm in the midst. as we are speaking, he's here with us tonight. We know that he's with us &gt;&gt; because a man cannot gather all the people that are gathered here. &gt;&gt; It takes the grace of God. &gt;&gt; It takes God himself so he can gather men and women. We know that he's with us. We know that he's walking with us. &gt;&gt; And we can speak like David. Even if I walk in the shadow of the shadow, I will not fear death because thou are with me. And he promised, I'll be with you, &gt;&gt; even in you until the end of time. We believe that he's with us. We believe that &gt;&gt; you see his word &gt;&gt; made manifest &gt;&gt; by photographs by by scriptures by declarations in heaven on earth. Everything else that he says not one time has it failed. [Music] I ask any person to show me different &gt;&gt; from the different parts of the country or all over the world. &gt;&gt; You are you are obligated to write me and tell me whether one time it ever failed it perfect word by word. &gt;&gt; Now that's a promise. That has to bring us to certainty &gt;&gt; because it's perfect. &gt;&gt; This message is perfect. We don't need to add anything to it. We don't have to take away anything from it. We don't need to interpret itself interpret his word by bringing it to pass. It's perfect. Word taught by word. As the word is perfect and we receive a perfect man, we will become perfect people because this word will bring us to the statue of the perfect man. We will not become perfect when we'll be in the grave. But we are perfect in walking in this church. I am speaking to perfect people. I'm speaking to perfect women because we have received &gt;&gt; a perfect word by word. &gt;&gt; That's why we are not going into uncertainty. Be certain &gt;&gt; regardless of what people are saying on the social media where people are trying to enticing learn trying to put doubts in people's hearts. We believe the message with everything within us. We we know what the message has done for us. &gt;&gt; We know where we were. And we know what the word has done for us. &gt;&gt; And this message will bring us &gt;&gt; until the perfection into the rapture. &gt;&gt; The message that we have received. &gt;&gt; It's this message that will rapture us. &gt;&gt; That's why we have to be certain of God. But says &gt;&gt; the the only way the the only way that I'm told in the message Luke unto Jesus that this little bird ever had a chance is to get his eyes off of the serpent. &gt;&gt; When the serpent is trying to catch a bird, You see the serpent is turning his eyes &gt;&gt; because when the bird is distracted, he's looking at the the the the what's happening, the the bird doesn't know that the serpent is coming is moving in little by little. But the only way for that bird to escape is for him to flap the wings and to fly away. But what I'm saying, &gt;&gt; it says um uh uh flap your wings by prayer until you fly plummet right out of the world. and all of off of his griefs. It was telling you, we will say that that there's no such thing uh as the healing divine divine healing. He says, "Shake your head and and and and run away from him quickly. If he should tell you that spiritual discernment is telepathy, shake your head from him and immediately move. &gt;&gt; Look up unto the unseen. &gt;&gt; That's our prayer tonight. This woman was a a widow woman. &gt;&gt; And you know what a widow woman could be enduring, what she could be going through. &gt;&gt; The husband had died. She had a little boy. &gt;&gt; The the the the survival was based upon whatever else they could they can gather together. &gt;&gt; But because of the the sin and the immorality that was in the land that there was just a dry time where everything came in the country, &gt;&gt; they were all uh hungry and dying. And today in the spiritual ramific the the the meal in the in the in the vase was kept going down was kept going down and finally &gt;&gt; it was just a a a a scoop left. &gt;&gt; It was just a little spoon of oil and the time was coming, &gt;&gt; it was the end that was coming for her. &gt;&gt; And says that when you have confessed all your sins and you have satisfied to everything that God is requiring. And he said even after that God remained silent. &gt;&gt; Remember &gt;&gt; that the faith declares that he exists and your faith has to hold on to that &gt;&gt; and the faith will bring down something into existence. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But says in the message, if God be with us, &gt;&gt; uh, where are all the miracles? &gt;&gt; Paragraph 42, &gt;&gt; it says, now we found out, we we find out that when God's people get in trouble, now I don't know what kind of trouble you are in. I don't know what challenge you are facing. &gt;&gt; I don't know your problems. said, "When God's people gets in trouble, &gt;&gt; God always sends them a prophet with a true word to bring them out." Is there anybody with trouble tonight? I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; But God has promised us that when the people of God are in trouble, God always sends them a prophet, &gt;&gt; a prophet with a true word of God &gt;&gt; to bring them out of those. &gt;&gt; It says it's never been a time that God's people ever gets in trouble unless God send them his word. &gt;&gt; And his word, as we at the end this morning, comes to the prophet. &gt;&gt; And all that we need from the new birth until the glory, &gt;&gt; it's it's found in the word of God. The the the healing of the sickness is in the word. The salvation of our soul is in the word. The transformation of our lives is in the word. Everything is in the word. It's the word that created in the beginning. That word is able &gt;&gt; to continue to create. Wherefore, whatever need you have. &gt;&gt; When the people of God are in trouble, God always sends them a prophet with a true word of God to get them out of those troubles. That's why we thank God for a prophet. &gt;&gt; Oh, if William Brham didn't come, &gt;&gt; we need a prophet. &gt;&gt; Look at Elijah. &gt;&gt; When Israel was in trouble, &gt;&gt; when they were even worshiping the God of Baal, [Music] &gt;&gt; Elijah came, &gt;&gt; he was a prophet. He had to come and get the people of God out of that trouble. &gt;&gt; He called everybody on the Mount Ko. &gt;&gt; He start he let them start the prayer. &gt;&gt; He said, "You call upon your God. The God that will answer by fire. It will be the real God." Elijah was certain of his God. He came. &gt;&gt; He was in He was in peace. He let them worship. He let them pray from from the morning all the day long until the evening time. Elijah said, &gt;&gt; it says maybe your God is traing. You cried out. &gt;&gt; He didn't respond. Now it's my time. &gt;&gt; I will also worship. &gt;&gt; When you are certain of God, &gt;&gt; something has to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even at the end, &gt;&gt; when everything looks like it's finished, &gt;&gt; is a something in your heart that tells you. &gt;&gt; I know in whom I have believed, &gt;&gt; I know that he's able even at the last second, &gt;&gt; he will come to intervene. When the three Hebrew children, &gt;&gt; they were ready to be put in the fire, &gt;&gt; they were certain of their God. He said, "We will not worship." Even if God doesn't uh save us, we will not worship. And as they were getting ready to be put in the furnace, even before the first foot can be put in the fire, God was already in the fire. &gt;&gt; Don't go backwards. Don't doubt. [Music] Even at the last second, he will come down. and he will come down and he will take the fire away from the situation and the people will be surprised. But why is he happy? &gt;&gt; The God of inh rapid innovation. &gt;&gt; He's coming into action. Elijah came. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh God of Abraham, &gt;&gt; God of Israel, he didn't call him the God of Jacob. He called him by the name of the prince of Israel that they may know today &gt;&gt; that you are God &gt;&gt; and that I am your prophet when he talked like this something the fire came down he he didn't make any effort you won't have any effort to make &gt;&gt; when you have confidence confidence in God. When you are sure that he's there, when you have confidence in him, even at the last second, &gt;&gt; he will intervene. When the people of God are in trouble, &gt;&gt; God will always send a prophet. It means that Malachi 4 came &gt;&gt; to get us out of the trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; We are in trouble. We are because we are in trouble. &gt;&gt; God sent a prophet. The prophet comes &gt;&gt; to get out out of the the trouble, &gt;&gt; whatever trouble, &gt;&gt; whatever problem, &gt;&gt; there's nothing. There's no exception that it may be hunger, &gt;&gt; that it may be uh uh barness, &gt;&gt; God is able &gt;&gt; to make sure that you can have that in my house there will not be a barrier. &gt;&gt; That he may be you without a trouble. God, &gt;&gt; he knows where the trouble is. &gt;&gt; He can I may be delivered. that it may be that I'm you can fill up the list of what a prophet comes the blessing is full &gt;&gt; and you judge a people by the strength of the prophet and Malachi 4 &gt;&gt; is a prophet above all the other prophet he came gather up everything. &gt;&gt; All that was said in the Old Testament, all that was said in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; They like the church at the end time. &gt;&gt; They have the fullness of the word of God. We have received the fullness of the word of God. All the word of God has been revealed. No secret. &gt;&gt; There is no secret say somewhere &gt;&gt; when Jesus was on earth, &gt;&gt; he was the shadow of things to come. &gt;&gt; And those things to come was us, &gt;&gt; the mal the messenger of Malachi for he comes to tie all the loose ends. And then the power, &gt;&gt; the omnipotence &gt;&gt; is found in this message. &gt;&gt; This message, &gt;&gt; it possesses the power of the dynamic of the Holy Spirit. That power is here right now to return everything that the devil has stole from you. &gt;&gt; That power is here. to restitute everything that was taken out. That power is here, &gt;&gt; to reestablish all the organs that are not working to heal you to take care of you, to take care of you today. days in the true church. &gt;&gt; There's so much power &gt;&gt; to to fix all the things that are not right in the body. &gt;&gt; That's you believe that &gt;&gt; the power is in the message. &gt;&gt; But Ram says, &gt;&gt; forgive me. speaks of this uh boy from Finland. &gt;&gt; This boy from Finland was hit by a car and he was broken into pieces. But there was so much power in William Brham prayed for this child's anesthesia &gt;&gt; without the need for anesthesia. Some without any the blood transfusion or anything [Music] the body of the boy came back all together. That power is in the church today. &gt;&gt; What God can do with us &gt;&gt; is unlimited. There is no limit to what God can do with you. As you have received the word, there is an energies that are coming forth. coming off of the spoken word and the spoken word is always there to create and like the same way it was in the beginning. It could create a new nature in you. It can create cells that are there &gt;&gt; where your problem &gt;&gt; is so little &gt;&gt; and see so insignificant omnipotence of the in in front of the omnipotence of the word of God that can heal you where you are sitting right now. You don't even need for somebody to lay hand but to by saying amen to the word. God can heal you. God can transform you. And as you go out of here, you are not the same person anymore that you were when you came in. &gt;&gt; That's my prayer. &gt;&gt; That the sickness that there's trouble, whatever the problem that took time, &gt;&gt; stay here that you go out of here freed. Because we not come to church as a picnic. &gt;&gt; We come here for the deliverance of a people. &gt;&gt; You have to be delivered &gt;&gt; because the word of deliverance &gt;&gt; is already spoken. &gt;&gt; The ma the messenger of Malachi 4. It's the totality or the entirety of the word. It's the totality of the powertality. &gt;&gt; It's the totality of deliverance. It's the spirit without measure &gt;&gt; that is in the church today said &gt;&gt; in the feast of the trumpet &gt;&gt; that the Holy Spirit was bound by the floods of denomination for 2,000 years. But at the evening time in the afternoon, &gt;&gt; he has to be free by the message of the end time, &gt;&gt; the new Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; in the church, &gt;&gt; Christ himself, revealing the human flesh in the end time. He said, &gt;&gt; he promised and we believe in the opening of the entire word. &gt;&gt; If the word &gt;&gt; was was uh uh loosed by the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; how what how much more my problem? My problem means nothing &gt;&gt; because the word has already been spoken. The totality of the word &gt;&gt; to do today Jesus has changed the form is today Jesus has your faith the the form of Jesus in the end time is the brother that's sitting here in the front. It's my sister sitting here today and I see what's happening today. It's Jesus preaching the word &gt;&gt; and translating or interpreting the word. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus saying amen to the word and something has to happen. &gt;&gt; Something has to happen. Do you believe that? [Music] &gt;&gt; There never been a time where the people of God has been in trouble. without God sending them a prophet. &gt;&gt; When we have trouble, &gt;&gt; God sends a prophet. When the prophet is there, no one can go back a slave. You have to doubt your own doubts. This message is a message of jubilee. &gt;&gt; This message brings freedom. &gt;&gt; This message will break all the bounds. and you believe it with all your heart &gt;&gt; and you are certain of God, all the bounds, all everything will break. &gt;&gt; It's not your effort. &gt;&gt; It's the work of God like what Bill was saying this morning when he took the example of the brother, &gt;&gt; the brother had nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; He stands there. But the one who had the inspiration of the original image is the one that has to do the work. So that the block of stones will become the image that was in the beginning. [Music] All the work is done by the message. Just receive the message. Just receive the message. Just accept the message. There's so much power in the message &gt;&gt; to bring us to the transformation. &gt;&gt; Eat the book. [Music] &gt;&gt; Take the book that's open. &gt;&gt; It's not a It's not a closed book. &gt;&gt; The book has been open. &gt;&gt; Take it. Eat it and swallow it &gt;&gt; and sp speak it and prophesy. You yourself say, "I am no longer a slave. &gt;&gt; I am no longer a slave of pornography. I'm no longer a slave of of drunkenness. I am no longer a slave of things of the world." &gt;&gt; Because a prophet has come to take me out of my trouble. [Music] When the people are in trouble, &gt;&gt; God sends a prophet. Thank you, Lord, for a prophet. &gt;&gt; Look at Israel &gt;&gt; in Exodus chapter 3. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go there to to to close up. &gt;&gt; Exod Exodus 3:6, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, &gt;&gt; Israel was in trouble. &gt;&gt; Israel had trouble. They were slaves to the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; God picks a man, &gt;&gt; prophet, &gt;&gt; a prophet, &gt;&gt; and he says in verse six, &gt;&gt; "I am the God of your fathers, &gt;&gt; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. And the Lord said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people." &gt;&gt; In other words, I have seen the trouble &gt;&gt; which are in in Egypt and I have heard the cry by reason of the task masters. For I know their sorrow. Brother, nothing can come to you without God knows about it. Everything by which we walk, he sees it. &gt;&gt; And he's waiting for the time and the moment. &gt;&gt; He said, "I see. &gt;&gt; I heard the cry. &gt;&gt; When you cry out, he hears. &gt;&gt; When you suffer, he sees." And then he says, &gt;&gt; "I am come down &gt;&gt; to deliver them &gt;&gt; out of the hands of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of a land unto good land, and a large land, unto the land that flowth milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanites, the Hzites, the Amorites, the parasites, the appetites, and the jebites, &gt;&gt; the prophet came to take us into that land. He says, now and and now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come unto me, and I have also seen the oppression, &gt;&gt; where with the Egyptian oppressed them. Now come therefore now go. &gt;&gt; It says I will send thee &gt;&gt; unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Moses said unto God, "Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh &gt;&gt; that I should uh bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" God said, &gt;&gt; "Certainly I will be with thee, and this will be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt, and you shall serve God upon this mountain." So mo the arrival of Moses &gt;&gt; was the presence of God in the pres in the form of a man. &gt;&gt; He was the the strong hand of God that God promised unto Abraham. God took the form of Moses to go and deliver Israel out of Egypt. The children of Israel could not get out of Egypt by themselves. But for them to get out of Egypt, &gt;&gt; God had to be a human being. So when Moses was walking, it was God that was going forth &gt;&gt; to deliver his people. &gt;&gt; Today we are the people of God. &gt;&gt; You and you and I. &gt;&gt; We are in trouble. God doesn't change his pattern. &gt;&gt; Whatever he did yesterday, he will do today. &gt;&gt; If he healed yesterday, he will heal today. &gt;&gt; If he delivered yesterday, he will heal deliver today. &gt;&gt; If he sent a prophet yesterday to deliver today, he will send a prophet to deliver the people today. &gt;&gt; And we believe that he took a a quote William, &gt;&gt; William Marian Brham, &gt;&gt; it was a coat of God. &gt;&gt; But says that the the the the the &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4, the ministry, &gt;&gt; it's the it's it's God dressear. If the the the the the Ephesians 4 are the the dressear of God, how much more the messenger himself, the prophet &gt;&gt; to whom the word comes to because the says the light, &gt;&gt; it comes to a certain region. It comes first to the prophet &gt;&gt; and from the prophet light will spread forth &gt;&gt; to the ministries that were taught uh faithfully and then from the ministry light will go unto the people if the Ephesians 4 they are the anointed dressear of God &gt;&gt; then the messenger prophet is also the anointed dress of God. &gt;&gt; He was the dress wearer of God, William Brham. And when he came with a message because the messenger and the message is one and the same is to take us from trouble. Whatever we have need of &gt;&gt; is in the message. Deliverance. &gt;&gt; Deliverance is in the message. &gt;&gt; The salvation is in the message. &gt;&gt; The change is in the message. &gt;&gt; Blessings is in the message. &gt;&gt; Everything is in the message. It's not William Brham and men that we talking about tonight. &gt;&gt; We are talking about the manifestation of the son of man. But what I'm saying, &gt;&gt; we are feeding off of the body word of the son of man, &gt;&gt; not of a son of man, &gt;&gt; but the son of man. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. &gt;&gt; Now, [Music] I want you to know that it's certain. I want you to know that this is sure. &gt;&gt; There's no doubt to that. &gt;&gt; And you that are listening to this tape, you may have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was the one that was was the one pecking this message. I have no more to do with that than nothing. I'm just a voice, &gt;&gt; nothing more. &gt;&gt; And my voice even against my own better judgment. &gt;&gt; I wanted to be a trapper. [Music] But it's the will of what &gt;&gt; what I it's what I wanted to do. &gt;&gt; I was It says, "But it's a father I declare to you and determined to do. It's the is the will of my father. I wasn't the one that appeared down there on the river. I was just standing there when he appeared. &gt;&gt; When he appeared, &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performed these things. I tell these things that happened as perfect as they are. I'm only the one &gt;&gt; that's near when he does it. I was I was only a voice that he used to say it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't what I knew. It was it was it was just that I surrendered myself to that he spoke through me. He spoke through. &gt;&gt; It isn't me. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Oh no. manifest the manifestation of the son of man. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the angel, his message. &gt;&gt; It was the mystery that God unfolded. &gt;&gt; It's not a man. It's God. The angel was not the son of man. He was the messenger from the son of man. The son of man is Christ. [Music] is the only one that you are feeding on. &gt;&gt; You are not feeding on a man, a man, his word will fail, &gt;&gt; but you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we are feeding on that, &gt;&gt; every one of our situations &gt;&gt; is already under control. &gt;&gt; Deliverance is on the way. Even if you don't see anything today, &gt;&gt; but know as you believe this message, &gt;&gt; the situation is under control. When we believe &gt;&gt; and we are certain of God, &gt;&gt; all things work together for good for them that love him. that difficult situation, &gt;&gt; God will change it &gt;&gt; because it it had to be there had to be a red sea &gt;&gt; so there could be a deliverance because maybe you lost a job. Maybe you lost a promotion. &gt;&gt; But know that God will transform that lost &gt;&gt; in gain. It's a certainty &gt;&gt; because God doesn't have a pro a a a project to hurt you. He doesn't have the need to hurt you. &gt;&gt; But God's uh uh desire for you is blessings. &gt;&gt; I want to try you just attract your attention tonight. &gt;&gt; Be certain of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be certain that this message is the truth. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. &gt;&gt; And you will know the truth &gt;&gt; and the truth will set you free. Be certain of God regardless of what you're going through. &gt;&gt; Don't go backwards. &gt;&gt; Go forward. The God who called you is just and faithful, he has decided to keep that which he has placed in you &gt;&gt; until the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; I ask you to stand at this time. &gt;&gt; We're going to pray. Amazing grace shall always be my song of praise. [Music] Oh, it was grace that brought my liberty. [Music] I do not know [Music] just why he came to love me. So he looked me out my fault and exalt my name. &gt;&gt; I shall forever lift my eyes to calary. to build the cross where Jesus died for me. marvelous. The race that comes my falling soul [Music] My [Music] name [Music] and shame to draw me Oh my [Music] forever I sing. All praise are glory to his name. If my for him I surely will die. [Music] Oh, I shall forever live my life. [Music] Oh, to [Music] the cross. Why Jesus died for me? [Music] The grace that comes. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes. Our heavenly father. We know that you know everything concerning us [Music] &gt;&gt; because nothing can escape before you. &gt;&gt; You said to us tonight &gt;&gt; to be certain of you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And you are your word that was that was manifested in this end time. We want to be certain of you Lord &gt;&gt; because you give her certain sound &gt;&gt; even as the word is giving confusion &gt;&gt; but we want to rest upon you Lord. Oh God, &gt;&gt; help each one of us Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, that we may turn our looks towards you, Father, for because all that we have need of &gt;&gt; is in the message Lord. And when the people of God are in trouble, God always sends a prophet. You send a prophet. He said, "I have given you all the the advices of that I give regardless of what happened. &gt;&gt; Stay with the message &gt;&gt; we want, Lord. &gt;&gt; Stay with the message, regardless of what can come here left and right, Father, that every one of us &gt;&gt; stays with the message &gt;&gt; because the message is certain. It's this message that is going to take us to the rapture. As we look to you, Lord, we want to think on those things, think on the rapture, think on the things of God that we may be in that dimension that we may be ready every day. You are the great teacher. &gt;&gt; May you teach these things &gt;&gt; to your children. Bless this church. &gt;&gt; Bless our pastor even over there. Bless his coming back home. Bless the butters that are work here and all over. Father that you may keep them united even as we're looking for the last lost one. Father, help us. bless our humble efforts that if there be someone who came in sick tonight, Father, that the word may give the healing tonight. If somebody was bound, may this word may loos him tonight that it may be a change. May thank you Lord be blessed, &gt;&gt; be glorified as we're going to be gone. bless each one of us in your name and we thank you for the work to come that you may go in everything Lord that the the angel of the Lord may bless us in our families.

Good job, brother. Amen. What an effort. Amen. I appreciate that. Amen. Amen. He made a distinction there. um having heard many times brother Bram talked about the angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; and how he saw him and brother Billy Paul got to see him laying in bed standing in the corner of the room how he described him being a a dark complexed man at about 200 lb hair length or to his shoulder length hair or So that was different than who he saw in the sage grass field. And he called him Jesus. And he said, "He turned and looked at me." &gt;&gt; That's who he's referring to. He is God. &gt;&gt; The working that he did, the association, brother, he said, "I come from the presence of God and I" He gave him his commission. That was an angel of the Lord there. But there was the angel of the Lord. the Lord himself. &gt;&gt; We don't pack around an angel of the Lord. We pack around the Lord Jesus Christ. And I think our brother is getting to the point is be certain of what you're standing for. This message is not based on just a man with a knowledge of scripture.
