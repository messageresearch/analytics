this morning Lord after all the trouble and turmoil that's going around the world it's grateful Lord it's a blessing to be gathered together again in the house that your name is called upon Lord we thank you for giving us this opportunity and there's nothing that we desire Lord then we desire you this morning Lord we ask you to come down and touch each and every heart this morning Lord you know the needs that we have in our hearts Lord you know us better than anybody else Lord we ask you this morning to come down and take your place of worship this morning we worship you we glorify your name this morning Lord Jesus please bless the service this morning the pastor the songs Lord we ask all these things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen so glad to see so many in the house of God and happy to see your faces when I welcome everyone this morning glad you could be with us here those that are still at home amen we can't wait to see you a man god bless you all happy Mother's Day to all the mothers welcome everyone as in fact buddy Mike for so I'm reading this morning just remember you know the rules that we're given for social distancing you know just a void don't go out after service just wait the brothers are going to walk you out and and the tithes and offerings are things put in the back for you to put it in and all of that so welcome here in the house of God amen god bless you brother Mike cos you'll bear with me a few uh thank you if you've already had a sneak peek well then you know sorry but you get a repeat version but it I was struck this week actually by the comment that my co-worker made about us actually being under house arrest he he was saying you know quarantine is when you lock down a sick person when you lock down healthy people it's tyranny were under house arrest and I thought well that's an interesting and not an accurate way to describe it but slowly but surely you know we're working ourselves out of this by God's grace and you know it's been said that if you you don't know what you have until it's gone the truth is that you know you had it you just never thought you'd lose it and as we kind of come out of this thing you know and I'm sorry but I've my eyes aren't very good so I'm gonna open up a bigger screen I'm sorry forgive me just a minute someday you'll be all two like I said this is a weird experience so you know we we were so used to taking things for granted we never gave it a thought to let's go out for let's go out for lunch after church you know the biggest decision was where where do we go what are you hungry for I don't care not that oh you've been there too and you know we we just want the Costco you get the car you drive someplace you do your thing and we don't think two things about it I'm gonna stop and get a haircut on the way home from work and the barbershops are closed or maybe you're not working and I'm very grateful to a Christian friend who cut my hair recently so I didn't look like one of the Muppets but the truth is we're all learning to adapt and in the process we're learning suddenly we don't have freedom now you know maybe it's for a good reason you know that's a debate for another day but when the news carries the story about a barber who decides she's going to open up a shop and they flirt in jail or the mayor of a New Mexico City that locks down the coming in and they're going out so nobody can leave and nobody can go in freedom is something we've suddenly begun to realize maybe we took it just a little too for granted and you know when we look at that from a spiritual standpoint we contemplate our current realities and our Christian walk several things have come to mind as I pondered this and like you I've had plenty of time to sit home and ponder first I'm so thankful that the Lord has lifted me out of a horrible pit out of the miry clay of my life and sent me upon the rock the Lord Jesus Christ that's an absolute it absolutely is a promise we can stand upon he established my goings and you know I'm certain beyond a doubt of that promise of that fact John says if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed second thing I've been humbled to remember that the blessings that we enjoy the twists and turns of our life can suddenly change everything you know it's easy to be on cruise and just accept our prosperity our employment our good health our mo vision our mobility our vision our food our bathroom necessities just take it for granted and then we have it removed by governments or a virus or natural disasters or demons and job is the scriptural evidence for that so that's the second thing we can learn out of this is just being always thankful and appreciative and not take for granted the little things of life the third thing I have been reminded daily about the goodness of our God in all situations I'm just thankful anew not for his blessings only but for his promises because he's promised that we won't see the righteous forsaken nor the seed begging bread his word says I'll not leave you nor forsake you I will never leave you never is an absolute word it's an absolute promise made by an absolute God no matter what comes our way no matter what we go through no matter what cootie surfaces next year or what the government decides to do he will never leave us nor forsake us God is in control of our lives and that's an absolute fact and you know I I quoted because I I find it so good what the Apostle Paul said in Romans 8 I am persuaded that neither death nor life and our angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature or Kuti shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord blessed be his wonderful name let's turn to Psalms 40 this morning sorry I'm too long that's what you get when I get up early and write Psalms 40 as we read it together if you're home read it along with us I waited patiently for the Lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cried he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the Lord blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust and respect of not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies many Oh Lord my God are thy wonderful works which thou has done and thy thoughts which are to us word they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears has now opened burnt offering and sin offering as thou not required they said I lo come in the volume of the book it is written of me I delight to do thy will o my god ei thy law is within my heart I have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo I have not refrained my lips o Lord thou knowest if not hid thy righteousness within my heart I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation I have not concealed by loving-kindness and thy truth from the great congregation withhold not now thy tender mercies from me O Lord let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me for innumerable evils have compass me about mine iniquities have taken hold upon me so that I am not able to look up they are more than the hairs of mine head therefore my heart faileth me be pleased O Lord to deliver me O Lord make haste to hell me let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me ah-ha-ah-ha let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let such as love die salvation say continually the Lord be magnified but I am poor and needy yet the Lord thinketh upon me thou art my help and my deliverer make no tarrying oh my god amen into the water being baptized oh I've been washed in the blood of the land whoa and I've been changed from the creature that I was what full

[Music] every pain Oh [Music] ah whoo [Music] [Music] [Music] Heavenly Father that's what we're here for today we're here to worship you with her to magnify you in all your glory old father we can't even comprehend the greatness of your might we see you in the creation around us we see you in the vastness of the Stars and the power of the Sun we see you in the rising of the Moon at the evening and the Sun rising in the day and we see the Stars and we see the storms and the wind and the rain we look at the vastness of the ocean and all the magnificent creatures therein and all the creation of animals and so many great things barding it it's our voice that can stand this morning and magnify to your name and we praise you this morning Lord Jesus we magnify you we worship you we ask you to bless us today in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen amen god bless you may be seated it's certainly thank you musicians it's certainly nice to be in the house of the Lord it's still a little different as everybody's navigating their way through but it's good to see every time we see a face or new face it just gets this excited and very good to see you this morning and each one so we're just happy to be in the house of the Lord we have certain things in our heart today that we would like to to share with you and hope that you can follow along and we can put this in a perspective that it could be understood but it's a real direction in my heart that I feel that the Lord wants me to go in and and you know if you've ever had the Lord deal your heart it's hard to get away from it you know first of all you the first reaction I don't think all of us have this is unbelief you know oh that's not God or it's not that and so you try to go away and you find yourself back there and then you try to go away and you find yourself back there and then you begin to question you know well this is too simple everybody knows this and and but it's just when it finally comes down to it you have no choice I think of the words that Paul's broke the spoke when he said I'm a prisoner you know he said I'm a prisoner not to these chains of this cell because I'm sure he heard that testimony a Peter that those doors came open and Peter walked out you know and and the many other great things that he'd seen God do but he was bound to the Word of God he was bowing to the leadership of the Holy Spirit and I really feel that's an important thing for all of us to be bound to is the Spirit of God and how that he's dealing with their heart a certain message came on my heart and it just it kind of just struck me and and you know I thought it in when I heard the tape in that tape was it said what house will you build me and when I heard that I knew that that was a tape you know what I mean so I went and I got the little tape and I listened to it and it was kind of a summing up of kind of some of the feelings that I was feeling and what I was going through and so I just felt that I'd like to play that this morning it's 27 minutes long and I think that you will notice in brother Ren's voice that there seems to be an urgency there seems to be something pressing on his heart you can tell there's a realization that he has come too and the message is he's preaching at saying a few words at the brother of Perry greens church in Tucson whether Brenham had moved there brother Perry decided to move there and so brother brems blessing praying for him and blessing his church but it's the context of the things that are being said that I think that we should take heed to I believe we should take key to everything that the messenger says but I think certain things are are wonderful least spoken and this tape was preached in 1121 just a month before brother Branham left the scene and and he talks about a church and the title again is what house will you build me and so I'd like to listen to this and then I'd like to pose that question back to us what house are we building and and so without delay we'll go ahead and start listening I I know sometimes it's a little hard to get the tape to play on the internet so it might take them a second to do that but this the scriptures that we are going to read are found in the book I believe it's the book of Acts so let me give you the scriptures exactly so we're going to read from the the book of Acts the seventh chapter beginning with the 44th verse so when it comes time for brother Branham to read those scriptures let us just stand for the reading of the word and then when he's finished reading the scriptures we can sit down so let's just say a prayer if you just pay attention to the small details and the content of what's being said just 27 minutes let us pray father we ask you to bless this time to us father we are people that have gathered here because we have one thing in common and that's the grace of your salvation and the blood that you shed on Calvary for us and father it's been quickened to our hearts by your spirit that you had sent a message in this day to the church that you raised up and vindicated a scriptural prophesied profit that was manifested according to the word that was spoken of him and the works that he performed father were truly works of vindication to prove that you are with him but father it was the message that he brought the things that he was wanting to reveal to this church what he was trying to prepare us for and Lord we want to listen to a portion of that this morning we believe it's truth we asked you to open our eyes to it this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you I believe you'll enjoy it you seems strange maybe but he as far as I know anything I know of God I was sent by a vision to Tucson amen I wonder how I ever was sent to this desert place and then here where there is spiritually speaking over the city I don't know of any place that's any more spiritual dead in the City of Tucson there is war between the churches there is fusses between the congregations there's no unity and everyone grabbing and holding and squeezing and trying to get this one and cross body it is a desert spiritually speaking also but then I read in the Bible now where God Paul Moses away from his loved ones and all that was dear to him and sinning into the wilderness to write the laws of the Bible that was the Old Testament the first four books Genesis Leviticus Deuteronomy Exodus he understood their mission routine but for books that really is the Old Testament because the rest of it was what the prophets said in the Psalms of David and so forth but the Chronicles of the kings but this was the fundamental of the Old Testament was Moses wrote them after he was called from his homeland or he had been born and brought up amongst people and was sent into the desert to write this book of the Old Testament then I find that in the book of the New Testament or Paul which is the author or not the author but the writer of the New Testament he also was drove out from among his people and by the spirit into the Arabia where he was three-and-a-half years to find the inspiration and Paul is the chief writer New Testament now there is Matthew Mark Luke and John but they were scribes that this wrote what Jesus said if they followed him along and but you take the book to Timothy and to the Romans and to the Hebrews and so forth Paul received inspiration to write the New Testament taking all the Old Testament as the shadow and setting in an order and God honored it and made it the New Testament now if the Old Testament had to be a drove from the rider had to be drove from his people into the wilderness to get inspiration to write the Old Testament and in the New Testament the rider was drove by the author into a desert place to get the inspiration to write the New Testament and the books are sealed with seven seals it would also require the same I believe in these days to open those seven commands believe what you hold dear now watch you cherish a little home that was given me by the people and amongst all my people and friends in a church that was flourishing and had nothing lacking and to lead that pull right away from it and move away out into a desert where you knew no body and everything against you but there's something about God that he drives a man to do things it's beyond any thinking of his own so it can be through the glory and honor of God and I feel that not self honor but I feel the privilege it was to leave everything that was called dear to me to get here into this wilderness and suffer like I have never suffered in my life here in this wilderness for this desert but I believe it in doing that and obeying what God commanded to be done God is open to us the mysteries of sliced days and we are here with this message now there was many people who follow me and that's not unusual usually a person we people love one another and love of Drive you to do things you don't think you would do many of you let your home's you left all just to come out here in the desert many has called me many as asked me shall we come to Arizona it would it be a good place for us well as it was said about Moses and them it was no place of fruit no place of pomegranate and here there's not much work to do and living and tie the cost of living is high it's a really a rough place to live is Tucson Arizona wages are poor and and food is high and rent it's it's a horrible place to live and whatever but it's healthy it's dry and we sometimes we must get our minds fashioned on things of this earth we must look to the leading of the Holy Spirit but one thing that trouble me and coming here to telling people well you should not come or you should come then I'll leave up to each individual the way God leads that individual to do I think every one of us should do that be led by the spirit and what to do and many of you here from around Jefferson Building of the congregation there and you have come out here now the thing that bothered me was a place of worship now realizes are read in the scripture here of Stevens and is the dress just before his death or they stoned him immediately Edwards for his message as he was speaking he said our fathers talking of the Hebrews in the early days how that they tried to find favor before God to build a place for or he said that Solomon building a house or a building we're acquainted with the story but I like his next words how did the Most High dwelleth not in houses that's made with hands and another place over in Isaiah he said a body has prepared me sacrifice and offerings and buildings and so forth but a body has now prepared me well we realized that he was speaking then of the body or gob tabernacle in Christ well I believe today that the inspiration that's come - to brother greenies to move here him and sister green giving up their place back in the east also - back in Texas to come here with the start with nothing just simply by an inspiration feeling that they should do I appreciate man that will follow the leading of Christ regardless of the cost it's awesome though the whole world may be your very best friends think that you're wrong but it isn't wrong to you as long as you feel there's something behind it as blob moving it's never wrong they'll always pan out right this young couple of talented young man and standest because he's sitting here this young lady with her baby's family - raised pretty job and everything to move here I realized it years ago I was called ministry I've never made a successful pastor because Rome and rambling spirit I can't be satisfied anywhere just wherever the spirit moves I just got to move with it because I had a message Jesus said I miss preaching this other counter also but the are those who are Shepherds that watch the flock so grateful that brother Perry all of the leading of the Holy Spirit and today we have a tabernacle it's a smile and that's just good enough to start with let's see what the Holy Spirit not knowing that's just move step by step now I believe if God has spoke to brother and sister greenie to come here and it's opened up a place where our children instead of a Sunday morning ride their bicycles and all the streets in River area they have a place to come to worship instead of us sitting around listen to something that we were on radio which is alright but we as this group of people we had a message for this day we we believe that God is giving us of message and brother green is I don't know cutting - no shape because we are a relative also my associate we are together in this message brother green preaches the same thing a message that I believe it he's restless wrong is that his people is that these churches as a levy the district super generators something of one of the organizations and give the whole bring up when he heard this let everything that was during him also he come to the desert justice occur what what is giving to us I say believe it's that not only should be in our house this should be our duty to back him up everything that we came between the services to come here to worship and to make this a place where God can reveal to us the things that he has forced to reveal and it's his words that the message doesn't come to me through the reading of the inspiration as it does the maybe to some of us but he said I'm here to back up what God has given what else things and I believe if we will all cooperate together we will put our hearts to it oh no really each one of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry the see the Spirit of God moving I just can't harvest and some experiences have extended up in the mountain just to feel that once again that's something that when I was first Saved the seborrhea to my heart and we can come into a place we can set and we've seen an illness that we're driving as we study with desert dirty mind my brother they talked with me I talked with them all these in a little way I'm watching dealing out there in the spirit as it was to see just the condition that brother and see that's wrong I begin to feel this all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must worship in the spirit or the Spirit of God not only our message should be the flame of the hour this should be the flame in our hearts it's got to be in our hearts or we can't we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself now I'm trusting and believing and ever wanted me to be a real Christian now they need Sunday School teachers they're going to need a stand and I want to say this so that you thoroughly understand this is my church I've been here three years and I've had one door open to me that was brother Nicky a sneak um preach god bless me I haven't been invited by any other people not nothing against them they're all right brother Broc a good friend of mine brother Gilmore may these Pentecostal brethren here are very very deep good friends of mine I love them nothing against them I understand their position they can't invite me in there and then remain in their organization see they can't do it because if they do they're kicked out so you see their position I had the same thing to face the mob would always be seeking first the kingdom of God and now that brother green God has sent him in here an openness of the Church of like precious faith that we believe we ought to be very grateful to God you can never service take every place that we can and if we're asked to calm to pray to seek to do let's be soldiers like them it's anxious to do it keep the message honorable liver I kind of like my little come up on it we're living too late now we're too late in the hour let's live it clean all my life your life all of our eyes needs to be picked up before God our young people just ride around and place the place to show to show and drifting further and further away from God like now that's the truth I sent my children now see myself getting to a place where not you you got to cymbal ourselves together to worship the Bible said so when we see this day approaching that looks more come together if there's only two people here you be one of them now that's if we come together and worship together then we just something another about it Jesus there were two or three are gathered in my name there I am in their mid as I've said before brother green told me and he said if my wife come told me what he said when I was away that he said this morning the pulpit was open at any time not usually that's open for me to speak I usually I had to drive all the way to Jeffersonville Indiana to give a message of God game to bring it to the people go all the way to Jeffersonville Indiana and each one of you streaming across the country and hooking up the wires and thing to get the message because that's what we're living on that's what we're here for well we don't have to do that anymore God gives me a message I can walk right here to a pulpit and preach it feel free today and I believe by that that God Almighty will bless you if you will just stand by this church this group of people not only then but let's go out and see if we can't get others to come in see let's speak to others everywhere speak to about our church what it means for our church we're here if we want you to come bring in strangers and I'm sure it'll be good for all of us see we have a building which we're thankful for we're thankful for this place together together but high beer the most hype dwelleth not in people's made with hang for heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool and where is the place of my wrist but a body has out prepared me and we are a body of Christ so as we move from one building to another building I believe in bringing our messages and we'll come down and have healing services and anything the Lord reveals to us to do had it right during the church until it swells out to I've taken somewhere else in somewhere else until Jesus comes god bless you dear God as we stand here on this platform which represents God over the altar here we realize that we are a dying race of people as far as this earth is concerned we look out upon the streets in C sin wrote everywhere and if the glory of the Lord is swiftly departed we know when the glory of the Lord goes up so will the church go with it godly want to be there just a few days ago is standing here on the streetcar just across the street watching that parade go down the street and seeing those old first war tanks leading the way then come the big heavy Sherman tank behind that followed on and on and on then the gold star up mother's the little broke up family with a crying wine from the little ragged boy lost his daddy no mother had lost a son oh how sad the stand on a street corner and watch something like that passed then notice in just as they passed this building the music's changed to already Christian soldiers playing their marches behind but when they passed this spot dear God I'm thinking of another great time coming and that would be the resurrection when the old timers will come forward the first saints of patriarchs or we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound in the daddy Christ shall rise first name will be stood a Greek sister people going marching up to the skies and we be standing waiting for our change knowing it will fall in line also God make us faithful soldiers only those who really associated and been in the war but know what that really meant to see those tanks rolling by God we think that those who've been in the battle of life will know what it means when we're waiting our turn to fall in position and place in the resurrection to go up this my young brother standing here well trained ready dressed waiting for an old man to lay hands upon him one who's an old F&P from up there in the front line knowing that he must join the battle - dear God but these unworthy hands I'll lay upon my brother and representation of yours blessed brother green dear God who I blessed in Jesus name may he carry this message Lord into this city and wherever you occult may be loyal Hill with the spirit living a life above reproach God that he may have the hearts of the people that he might teach them and lead them and direct them in the path that we all desire to walk granite guard left his faithful life with little children bless our efforts here together as Christian Brothers here on earth that we may carry this gospel to the send your spirit upon in God we pray in Jesus Christ's name as we've given to you amen unless you'd better carry [Music] you we know that brother Perry has gone on to be with the Lord and to me this morning it wasn't so much a history lesson or to look back at a church dedication but it was what I felt the burden that was on brother branham's heart as he began to say I see the church is drying I don't see the fellowship I don't see the love of the Spirit though wait it used to be I don't see the worship and and during this whole time I begin to realize and you know I'm not a very technical person but I begin to see and I begin to realize and I begin to understand that brain events like this seem to have a spiritual effect and the effect it has on a lot of times is attitude and and and the forgetting of what the prophet of God talked about in here the things that were dedicated to you know what house will you build me what was the question and I asked the question back to myself what are we building you know we're not interested in building a building you take a time like today this morning with and I guess we use YouTube to broadcast to those that can't be with us this morning and in so that's a media I don't much in media I don't really care for the fact that we're there but it's a way that it's given to communicate but I begin to realize when I went to it even to watch our service not my necessarily but the brothers to see how the process was going I begin to see how many different things there are along decide in choices to be made and I I began to realize that you know it's like this morning there's some that may be a part of our congregation are watching others will want something else somewhere and then come back and pick it up later you know and and stream it later or they'll watch their church and then they'll go watch another church or they'll watch this and they'll watch that and what a great time it's become for people not to be a part of anything you know it's a time of people's rights it's a time of people can just go about doing their their own thing and I felt the burden on brother Bam's heart it just like broke my heart when he said I've been here three years and nobody's even asked me to preach I mean someone that could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart can lay their hands on you and pray for you to discern I thought you know a good Shepherd would have wanted him to be there just to pray for his people you know and then he just he said I understand I don't hold it against him you know they lose their job yet in the same breath he said I appreciate a man that's willing to give up everything to follow the Word of God and that that's that's something to us you know are we willing to give up everything to follow the Word of God you know I I felt the pain and he said I lift all my friends I left everything that I had back there I left the people that loved me a place I had and I came out to this dry and I'd say he didn't give too son too good of a recommendation except for it was dry and not only did he say dry and healthy but he said dry spiritually now we just listened to that but you understand those things to me are warnings to me they cry out to my heart are we getting dry are we missing the point are we being caught up in a time where there's no more sacrifice there's no more giving there's no more leadership of the Holy Spirit there's no more there's no more hungry since I'm so hungry for the move of God he said that I can hardly stand it and you know the move of God God moving in the people God moving in amidst God really working on the behalf of one another people having burdens and set them before the Lord and staying there praying day and night till they see the hand of God move have we have we moved over to a realization and a failure to see what are we building and that's kind of the question that struck me is what are we building what is it what am i building is a pastor you know what are we building as a body what do you know do you can't build without a blueprint oh you can I've seen some real structures without a blueprint you know and without a plumb or without a level and they do for a while they do for a season but pretty soon it's not built to endure it's not built to last and we want to build something that lasts because you know the prophet of God said whatever we are here is what will be there many people said all if I lived in the day of the Lord I would believe it nope you would you would take the same approach then as you would it take now whether you have an absolute you know the hardest part any real believer in this message every real challenge to every called elector s'en in this day was the acceptance of that message as being an absolute everybody wants to claim their Bible and say well this is my absolute that Jesus is my absolute I only follow the Word of God you're following yourself and it's hard to die to yourself it's hard to lay down your ideas it's hard to it's hard to when you when your culture and your nature is something that's been taught to you remember culture is not something that you inherit the views I have on working the views I have on labor the views I have on construction those things were taught to me by my father because he was in construction they influenced me they became my viewpoints they became the ways that I looked in the ways that I felt and in the flesh I follow in those ways because I have no other I don't know anything else I don't know anything else but to work I don't know why I can't sit in a desk and go through pages hours after hours and read and study in sin in front of a computer the only thing I remember about my computer is my dad sitting there yelling at it this is 20 years ago when they first come out you know he would say things like I know you're in there somewhere and it would be lost and it would go away and then those things have an effect and you approach things that way and then we ask ourselves what's influencing what we're building and I know that those things those nature's and those things that that we have that those are the things we have to deal with we've got a deal with our flesh we've got a deal with our upbringing we have to deal with our education we have to deal with the atmospheres we have to deal with the complexes that we received the the influence and the effect that circumstances had on us those are all things that we've got to deal with and I thought as a as we read in in that statement that the our great messenger may be said in Jesus in his personal life had to contend with himself in other words he learned obedience by the things he suffered I would like to have a greater understanding of that the riches of what if it suffered the image I had of Jesus he just waved his hand you know he didn't like something it went away no he did nothing until the father revealed it to him when the pressures came on to him for an answer he spoke not even when he was being a scourge dand persecuted and crucified he held this tongue and you know we we don't even understand that in comprehend the physical pain that he was went through you know never cursed them he said the pilot he said if my kingdom be of this world he said wouldn't my army come to fight for me o pilots good that army didn't show up because all the armies of Rome wouldn't have stopped that army when those chariots came out of heaven those flaming fiery horses and those angels with swords of flame and power and might and piercing eyes they could have nothing good has stood in his way but yet he held his peace for us he laid down his life for us that we might have life more abundantly and it's not this life he wants us to have an abundance it wasn't this life he wanted to have the buzzer it was eternal life that he wanted us to have an abundance another words he knew there was a life to come he knew there was a kingdom to come he knew there was a place that is electric return to and that's what he was interested in and that's why the question is is what are we building because we're not building a house of brick and mortar no what we're building he don't dwell in those we're not we're not building a something that can be touched and seen by hands where we're building something else we're building a body a spiritual body that that's what we're building and and and you know so God's plan was to send the Word of God he sent his son he didn't send a son to prepare us for life here he's sending his son to prepare us for life there he's not preparing us to live here he's not building us to live here if you're a Christian a real God ordained spirit-filled Christian that lives by the Word of God without compromise you do not fit in this world and you'll never be successful in this world you'll never reach the attainment that this world's reach you will never reach the potential that even they see in your flesh there's always a hand of restraint on you hold him back always put in the battle in your mind oh what'd I do better if I stayed here should I take that job there you know I might lose my job here okay and you you you've got to have something that anchors you and holds you so that's what we're talking about we're talking about this morning what are you building and you're all building something you know the that the definition of building first of all building means to construct or work you can't build without work I don't care if you're building a business I don't care if you're building something that's not made of hands but no matter what it takes building or construction the very term in itself means to work you got to work at it as you notice he said oh it just seems like everybody's just drifting along they're just they're just uh just seem to be tossed to and fro going here going there they don't got a vision and and that's when you build something you can't even build till you have a vision that was the beauty of the masterpiece what is that that Michelangelo had a vision he had something that he was building something that he was working on something that he was trying to achieve he has something that was set before him he wasn't tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine blowing to and fro by every move of the Spirit he was steadfast in his heart with a purpose and a goal that he had in the mind and a vision that he was trying to obtain and he labored and it came to pass when we hear the message that God's got a masterpiece he has a family that he was trying to build a family that he was trying to restore a people that he was working on building and building means to construct by putting parts together we were going to put a fence gate together the other day him the brothers whom he we put it there so we asked the question are we going to read the instructions or are we going to do it like a man does it and then the brother says well we'll just look at the finished picture and go at it from there and when you end up with parts left over things that don't fit you find out there's a order that you have to do things in I bought a bed at IKEA for my mom's house and it was in the store it looked really nice but when they give me the bed it was in a box this big ain't never gonna put together an IKEA bed again because if you do one thing out of order if you put the wrong part or the wrong peg in the peg it's not clinical you got to do that thing exactly the way they say to do it and I'll guarantee you the devil designed those blueprints what are we building what house are you building me how was race he don't dwell in an Tabernacle himself in buildings like this he Tabernacles himself in people let's just read a few scriptures this morning that that we can build on so I can maybe come to and I think you'll see it so beautifully in the point that I feel led that if I say this the direction we ought to go as a local body a spiritual body believers that are fitted and joined together what should be the thing that's on our heart what are we laboring for what are we constructing what are we putting together what parts are we putting together because the build means to to to construct by by putting parts together what parts are we putting in our lives and let's read this scripture found I believe it's in 1st Corinthians I am and it's in the 3rd chapter and I'll just start with the fifth verse I think it'll begin to draw the picture that these principles were the principles of of the Word of God these were the principles we just talked about Paul by inspiration bringing the message through the church these are the messages that he brought he says who then is Paul who is Apollo's but ministers by whom he believed even as the Lord gave to every man I have planted Apollo's watered but God gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase oh that is still so beautiful today if we can look past the the the planner and we could look past the water which you can't do without who are they but ministers who minister to you but if you can see God giving you the increase that's the fellowship the fellowships when you hear something that's spoken or you listen to a tape or you read a scripture and you read the scripture and you see the scripture but then that presence of the Lord shows up and he opens your eyes to it whether it's in correction whether it's in instruction whether it's in reproof and you have that fellowship with God because it's his presence and he moves on you and it's like he said anytime you come into the presence of God you feel very little they said it just come to natural to us it's bad when religion and church becomes an ordinary routine and there's no increase in it you read your Bible month after month after month and there's no increase in it you listen to tapes after one after another maybe you stick it in your ear and you start in the morning and you quit and then there's no increase in it there's nothing being built there's nothing being put together there's nothing being constructed you end up the same person a year from now that you were then then it brings us to the question what are we building what are we putting together can you imagine a man being on the job and you hire a contractor and and he's there and you walk out there and you got a slab you know how that is don't you brother and you come back and you still got a slab where's the increase who's putting this thing together why isn't this showed up and that showed up and that's fine for that but what about us so he says there's got to be an increase now he that planteth and he that watereth are one but every man shall receive of his own reward according to his own labor according to what he's constructing your reward is going to be based not on the planner not on the water but what you've constructed with your own labor you're not going to get in I'm brother branham's message because he was the messenger you're not gonna get in on all these great preachers around the line in the end and the things that they've said in the great wisdoms they bring out in the great revelations that are brought forth and the things that you've never seen before and the all that they put you in great orders but you will be rewarded according to what you have built according to your Labor's or in other words what part did you put into your building we always want to go as a group but we have to go forth as individuals for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry ye are God's building what is statement God's husband tree in other words your what God's working on your what God's cultivating beef why you are his workmanship in Christ Jesus for gained unto good works that you should walk in them he's building something he's growing something he's husband dreamed something not for here he's building us here for there and he says he says you are you are God's building now according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder I have laid the foundation another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth there upon good question see we we leave the take heed the take heed goes out of our lives and you know get it it striking you know I've been you know I'm 70 now you know that so this idea of retirement it floats by me and it's tough I don't know you know I've got to take heed you think oh now you can just lay it down oh you can't lay this down you can't lay this we can't quit running this race we can't take the take heat out of our life we can't take the watch what how they're on how you be we can't take we're going to be rewarded according to how we build there's one thing you're going to take with you and that's your character and it's an individual affair it's a consciousness I want to say this is money it's a building it's assembling the parts in us just like the statue of a perfect man he talked about how God was building the church how God was building the church up how it was coming to the capstone he says he also builds the individual the same way maybe you notice even in the statute of the perfect man he's always putting you in the process he says don't go to the next step until you have this don't have it till this is perfected it's the understanding that I want us to understand this morning we can't sit back and and rest in the completion of the message don't misunderstand me it's like having the blueprint the wise master builder gives you the blueprint and you say I've got the blueprint therefore I have the building it's like a seed you say I have the corn seed therefore I have the corn potentially yes you have the building if you assemble the parts if you put the parts together you have the building if you plant the seed and you water the seed and you read it and you dung it and you the theta produces what the seed was predestinated to do so it doesn't it doesn't lie in the blueprint it lies in the manifestation of the blueprint in every stage that's the place you've got to add the extra that's the place you've got to work on it sometimes you've got to do it more than one time it's work it's labor let's look at Corinthians five I'm sorry it's 2nd Corinthians 5 forgive me it says for we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens now we know that if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have a building of God so when this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved what you have left is what God has built that is what goes to that other tabernacle that's what he wants to build that's what he's building Ephesians just to lay a little scriptural Ephesians 2:19 through 22 I believe I always like to go up and read a verse or two before and that verse says but through him we both have access by one spirit unto the Father so let's read in Ephesians will give our interpreters a chance to find it in their Bibles it says now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and in the household of God and are built upon the foundations of the Parcells prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone in other words ye are built you are put together with certain parts those parts are like the fruits of the spirit you are put together with patience and temperance and meekness and long-suffering and gentleness and kindness you are put together with the fruits of the spirit you are put together with the that will the attributes of God that he's built you and and and put you together and that's why he said take heed what's you're building what are you building me are you building with the things and the material that God supplies there's a story in the construction world that is told and it was about a builder a great builder in California who built houses for the movie stars and and the politicians and the wealthy people and he built some fabulous homes and he would purchase fabulous properties and build these homes but the work was done really by his superintendent he was the person that got the contractors out there he was the person that actually is in charge of the physical building the Builder people I say too sometimes the people I'm a builder and they look at me like well did you frame it did you put the windows did you paint it no I'm into a thing I talked the bank into giving me the money that's a builder so this man did the labor he did all the work he did everything and in his heart he began to get bitter you know felt unappreciative and and those things yet he was paid well well one day the boss handed him a set of blueprints and said go build this house on that lot there you know that really good lot we have overlooking the ocean I said here you go build this so he took that set of blueprints and he went out there and you know his heart wasn't right anymore he lost the motive and objective he lost the purpose of what he was doing so he caught out there and he ordered the cheapest concrete he could instead of putting rebar be put wire in this lab and instead of digging the piers three and four feet deep he dug them two feet deep he cheaped out the foundation instead of putting the best plumbing in and putting vents for every bathroom and every device over the house he just put one or two vents here and there and when it came to framing it instead of building it on 16 inch centers you know which means there would be a 2 by 4 here and a 2 by 4 here and a 2 by 4 here so instead of having five two four by fours don't do the math for every four feet he put him on two foot centers instead of putting two by twelves he put two by tens instead of putting the inch and 1/4 plywood on the upstairs like they normally did he put happy and he just built this house just cheap then he put facade instead of putting real brick he put face Bracken on and on it went instead of putting a thirty-year lifetime roof he put a 25-year find it one day he walked into the office and he laid the boot prints down and and he looked at the boss he said the house is done he says is it just the way you wanted it did you build it the way that you know how to build is it everything that you wanted it to be said yes boss deal and I reach it in this drawer and he pulled out the keys and he said Bob you've been faithful to me all these years this is your house and he threw him the keys now he knew it he built he just got a cheap shoddy half-wit put together job what are you building what are you gonna live in what are when are you laying for a foundation are you taking heed to what you're going to take with you could you imagine if he would have painstakingly went about that the way he went about business you know what but he got tired he got tired of working without reward he got tired with working without recognition he got tired of the same routine day in and day out he got tired of what he was building are we getting tired of what we're building what we're working for what we're laboring to there's there's so many beautiful scriptures that are spoken of about the body we are one body we're baptized by one spirit Corinthians 12 and 12 and 13 what we're building so the question even comes back to us is what we're building not only what we're building as a as individuals and I would gone into deeper lengthen in Corinthians 12 explaining to you that we're a body fitted and joined together a member member body but yet one body each meant member of that body supplying the need to the other which brings it back to the individual so if we're a body of believers and every individual isn't supplying a hundred percent then that body becomes weak if that individual is weak then the body is weak but that's also a part of the body when one's weak you which are strong oh we don't want to be connected anymore we don't want to be a part of anything anymore we all want to live our own lives as lady osya the lady osseous spirit has taken hold all this great big virus thing did to me was it manifested to me the attitude of lady osya that leaves deep into the hearts of the people you know when I heard that a lot of people on Easter morning went and listened to other people and and and you know picked me up later you know at first I was a little jealous and then I thought oh god I'm nothing anyway boo but why does bother me it shouldn't bother me it's the word that's not the part that ended up by me the part is are we a body or are we not a body are we here one for another or are we not here one for another do we pray for one another do we bear one another's burdens are we fitted and joined together supplied the need what is it that we are building I certainly don't want to manifest the the spirit of the pastor I want us to manifest the fruits of the Living God for we are the building of God the habitation the scripture says of the Spirit we are the building that he's building and every building it has got to have a foundation and we know what the foundation is it's faith it's revelation it's faith is the increase of God in a man's life does faith and revelation are the same thing when you were a child you did as a child but when you've grown you come to greater abilities and greater strength and greater burdens I love seeing the grandchildren just playing in the yard and they running up and they swing and they do this and they do back and and we sit back and we think oh they don't have a care in the world but then you start to see them grow up I'm watching our young people they begin to grow up and they start to get married and you know the burdens and life and raising children and providing it for them in how you live your life but you know all through that life God's building something for their and we have got to take heed of how we built our circumstances our jobs our financial status our likes and dislikes have not the bearing nor should it have an effect on the spiritual man that we're building well you've got to remain conscious of that you've got to contend with yourself I'd like to just close maybe in reading to you out of a message things that are to be blurb and says as you begin to see the days of your life drawing close then it begins you begin to packed up closer getting ready for that great event are we seeing the days of the resurrection coming closer I don't know how many more signs God's got to give us but man can wipe themselves off the face of the earth whether they do it out of a lavatory by a disease by a poison by a bomb whatever they do you it's obvious to us that man has the ability to kill themselves all you have to do is go back to the annihilation of the Jews to Cambodia to do the killing fields in the South America and all those places where man has absolutely committed genocide on generations you ought to go back to the breakup of Yugoslavia and Macedonia and Albania ok and what what took place over there but we don't look we're not looking at the blueprint I'm just preaching I'm not preaching at you we don't look at the blueprint we don't can recognize the day in its message we don't look at the clock we don't realize that that things are transpiring all around us we can become so locked up in our world that we're not preparing for the great event ask yourself is the great event coming or is it not because if it's not we have all men are most miserable we might as well become Epicureans eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we shall die I don't want to take my chances at the river that's a quote I don't want to get to the river and wonder what's in my luggage I was talking to my friend that owns a restaurant he said I went over to my country and they stopped me at the border and they they said you've got meth off feta means in your suitcase that's going to cost you cuz I ain't give me a penny he said you go search it he had glasses I'm not glass glasses drinking glasses he said search it tear it apart I know what I brought I don't want to be packing contraband at the river I don't want to be packing malice or envy or strife the prophet of God said I don't want to be packing smut don't get smut it up I don't want to be packed in jealousy I want to have nothing in my building that isn't him because listen to this very carefully getting ready for that great event it's it's a continuing of this same life in another world another place oh we got such an idea that that was from things that are to be we ought to read that book I'm going to quote again in closing but we have such an idea we live this life we do the best we can and then when it's over we go to the judgment and our lives are put on the scale of good and evil and if we've done more good than evil we make it when I went to school I had one goal that was get Addie that's not a very good goal barely get by I grew up in my life of what of facing the consequences when you got there no pre-planning no understanding whatever happened happened tonight I want to party fine tomorrow will take care of itself you understand that we're called to take care of tomorrow the you worry about the evil of the day when I say take no thought of tomorrow that was to the carnal things not to the spiritual thing because we have no tomorrow on the spiritual we've already passed from life from death unto life we're already sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus we're possessors of resurrection he says it's just he says it's just a continuation of the same life in another place now that's what we're we want to realize is that we're we're building not for this world but for a world to come that's why we sacrifice in this world for that world where a man's heart is there are as treasures also we can read the parables there's 46 parables and I believe there's a principle in every parable some something that Jesus was trying to get across to us that we would build the right thing that we would possess the right thing we're not talking about salvation we're talking about obtaining a position in the gospel that's for ordained to us by the Lord we are his workmanship for ordained unto good works that we should walk in them what I'm saying that egg wouldn't be taken by you might say a nominal believer it wouldn't be taken to heart by somebody that feels that well and I know these are lines that are going to be misinterpreted but that the Lord just going to take care of everything I'm telling you that's God always working from the outside but God works from the inside out like that Lily that Lily had that beautiful flower in it but it had to worked its way through the mud and through the crime it had to push up it had to keep striving for the light if it had to keep following the courts until it broke on top of the water and it radiated all the glory that God put in it in seed form it can't stop along the way it's got to finish his journey and it's got to it's got to work hard it's got to build it's got to put the things in place to construct the question is what are we building faith is our foundation faith one for another faith for the things of God faith for the word of God good we ought to be a Church of faith that believes all things are possible that God can do exceedingly abundantly in our midst above that which we can ask for thing faith this has the ability to recognize the hand of God when it moves of faith that when the singer sings a song and the solemn is read and then you begin to see how they all fit together how they all had the same theme how the Spirit of God is moving you see well this is God God's in our midst is there two people here that came this morning in his name he's here he's here by promise he's here because he cannot lie are are we here and believe that all things are possible Satan's building to you realize that he's building an Eden he's building the kingdom he's offering jobs he needs staff what he said I didn't say he said it said he needs staff he needs men and women Sunday School teachers people to step up people to make it work people to make it happen well Satan does too God's got a plan you believe that your faith is that you've been elected and chosen by God to be that bride we call ourselves the bride God's given me a good bride more than I deserve and and in those of you that know her no that's true I've received a lot of criticism I very very very rarely in fact have ever received much criticism about Leslie the only thing I say is that I would have told you that I picked or but God or even arranged that were the bride so what we're building is a bride what we're building is something that he's going to take home to father something that he's going to meet at the river and recognize as his something that he's going to see the attributes in that represent what he loves and what he walks with and what he talks with and what he has union with that's what we're building we're building the character and the representation of what we are going to be there I don't want to live on the side of the mountain those who have no future home I don't want to go in and out of the gates holding the leaf of the tree representing peace for those who are from studied future home I want to live in the city where the lamb is the light my call wasn't salvation which God gives every man as he so chooses he maketh one vessel unto honor and other to a dishonor but I don't believe that's our call I don't believe that's what we're building I believe we're trying to build an elective a Christian character a manifestation of himself in flesh I believe that's what we're building but let me tell you again it's building it's work it's putting together all the parts and have we quit putting the parts together in our life and we quit adding have we quit growing the fruits of the spirit have we quit meeting the challenge you know we say we live by the word when you live by the word you're living by a person you're not living by a book you're living by a person and when you meet a challenge you meet that challenge with your flesh your upbringing your knowledge your personality and you have an opera you meet that challenge in the flesh or to die and meet that challenge with his personality his attributes in his word that's how it's built that's what it means to live by the Word of God means to live by him to live by his nature to live by his spirit to live by his character his attributes the things that he is patience meekness temperance to face every event with that manifestation in our hearts in our lives and I'll read this and I hope that you can understand then that take heed and once again understand that we're preparing for something we're not building something here we're putting together a spiritual body for their individual body the hand can't say to the foot I have no need of thee or the I to the other I have no need of thee we can't say that we don't need each other we can't say that we're I've got I've got my tapes I've got my books I've got my Bible I don't need anything that's not in the books it's not in the Bible it's not in God's plan that's not the way he made it he made us members in particular fitted and joined together you'll never change that you will never never never change that you are meant to serve one another you are called you weren't made perfect you weren't saved perfect when he caught a fish it wasn't already skinned and cleaned ready to fry I don't go to the lake and sit there with my frying pan and my oil hot waiting to roll up a breaded fillet and throw it into thing oh that's what what that's what Christianity's become no you work at it go back and when I was a little child when I was a child let's just read now close I hope that somehow this can be expressed see you are all pleep pre-planned by God nothing happens by chance with God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned plan for many generations back so that you could be here tonight did you know that just think that you at one time and I'll repeat this again you at one time was in your father in the gene of your father now he didn't know you at at that time neither did you know him at that time but you see then you were put in the bedding ground in the mother's womb through the holy wedlock and then you become a person expressed in the image of your father then there's fellowship now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of God because you have to be they have to have eternal light and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life and only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there even was a molecule now just think what you're building see and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God and daughters of God do you place yourself there also now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you are the expressing God's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of God therefore you get what I mean you you are now made your sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you are associated that's your duty the question is what are you building what you're building is your expression that's what you're building he has the plan he gives the material but you build it you add it you put it in your life when you see you're lacking you go to the material and you get it where you had a two-by-four and you need a 2x6 you go get it you take that 2x4 out of your life and you replace it when you find out you've got a beam in your eye and you're trying to remove a sling you go get the beam out of your own eye God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if if you've got eternal life then you always had eternal life and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here so you have eternal life that life is his gene but the job is to express that gene is to build that gene it's to work and build with the Word of God building the plan that God has pre-planned in you don't quit keep building it may not look that much but when he's done it'll be his image you be he said you've got eternal life you always always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you you was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your earthly father see you are citizens of the kingdom not citizens but you are children sons and daughters of the Living God if it be that eternal life dwells in you now then if it was Jesus was the fullness of God manifested he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily therefore when he came to the earth he was the manifestation in the flesh you are here in him then because he was the word in the beginning was the word in the Word was with God in the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us you see the same principle that God used in Christ he has to use that same principle in you if he was in the word in the word was made flesh you were the word and you were made flesh if he learned obedience by the things that he suffered and he only didn't do anything till the father revealed it to him and he knew what cause he came into this world was to redeem us that he could take us and then he sent his spirit back that that spirit would lead us and guide us into all truth and righteousness that it would bring us into the image of his son that we could be conformed to the image of his son that if the same spirit dwelt in Jesus Christ dwell in us it will quicken our mortal bodies also another he knew and he learned obedience because what he was created now you are sons and daughters of God also you were pre-planned you were in the beginning and he put that seed in flesh now he sent his spirit to transform that flesh through the building of the Holy Spirit and the building of a perfect man watching you resurrect out of the human flesh into the image of the Living God the attributes of God displayed the nature of God display the way that God thinks the prophet of God said be like God but you work on that you build that by being in fellowship just like a father and adoption raises his children until they can take over the job how many wants to take over the job of being Christ to the world the word was made flesh therefore you walked with him you were in him when he was on earth you suffered with him and you died with him you are buried with him and now you're risen with him and manifested attributes of God setting in heavenly places already raised resurrected the new life and setting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh that means so much nowadays Church that means so much to us to see our positioning we placed in Christ Jesus now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creed's our own Creed's we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride want you to listen to the next statement we must be that word bride what is that word bride the manifestation of this our the bride not a creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God and living attributes of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living what are we building we are building that bride what are we building we are building that manifestation some are young just our children they need your help they can't walk on their own they need you to raise them in the admonition of Christ to in spit in their lives the principles of honesty the principles of integrity the principles of righteousness they need to see you as a burning example of fervency for God reading your Bibles praying family devotion they've got to be raised we have Sunday School where our Sunday School teachers help them to learn their scriptures and their Bibles along with you at home we gathered together for instruction in the correction and righteousness some are young teenagers some are going through the challenges of being tempted growing through the the times of life and where their their desires and their nature changes where boys begin to look at girls and girls begin to look at boys they need guidance in those time they need faith in that time they need prayer in that time they need a body they need people that there are goal in their heart is to have this Lord manifested we're not going to get by on history you're not going to present anybody else you're not going to present Paul you're not going to present Wesley Luther you're not going to present the seventh Age messenger what you're going to present it that day is your self and what you have built and whether or not you are the inhabitation of God you think that's easy being in the flesh no you've got to build it you've got to work on it you've got to add to it every day because that's what the bride is she's the manifestation of a people that have growed in the maturity and I believe with all my heart that we understand that God sent a prophet we understand that the seals have been opened we understand the position as he said in that book that people don't believe in me when I preach the eternal security of the believer but faith is expressed it's works expressed it's what he put in you coming to maturity and flowering out that the world can see that he planted a bride and he has a bride and she lives by him she looks like him she acts like him and when he sees her they see him because these two are one flesh father I pray that they may be one as we are lying let's not forget what we're building I know we got building plans but that's not the church we want to build we want to build this body this faith these virtues we want to get rid of the malice the envy the backbiting the lust that those they ruin a clean house we want to apply the token we want to be fitted enjoying together like real godly loving people that love one another that the very personality of the Lord Jesus shines through us Jesus was the personality of God he who has seen me has seen the father he who has seen you have seen the message of the hour have seen the true Spirit of God the revelation of the word yes it'll be so close in the last days to deceive the very elect if possible that's my favorite part of that scripture I used to pride myself and not being deceived boy was i deceived work labor build look at your life what are you building where are your treasures what virtues are putting forth don't be swayed god bless you we're gonna be dismissed but anybody who would like to stay you're welcome to stay adrianna Magua is going to be baptized this morning and let me tell you you don't think these young people see something's changed the fear of the Lord

Mother's Day meant a lot to her and we'll go straight to the scriptures the water is cold if you have not experienced the cold water we sure invite you to do so because we want everyone to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because it's the scriptural thing to do we know the story the Spirit of God fell it today at Pentecost men came out of the Upper Room new creatures filled with the power of God what they didn't have before they now had because Jesus Christ had returned to the church in spirit form and took his abode in the believer and when they saw this power manifested they were moved and the Peter spoke he said therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made the same Jesus whom he have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins that ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this promise is unto you and your children and to all that are afar off even as many as our Lord our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this up courts generation I've seen this promise come to pass sometimes it took years but I've seen those that have been baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ one day come to being filled with the Holy Spirit and I'm glad she has this mild stone in her life so when she goes forth there's a part of her has the Word of God fulfilled I believe it'll keep her she's got wonderful parents she's being raced what she's going to make a lovely Christian I think it's going to be what's beautiful to watch her grow in the eyes of the Lord amen jesus said I suffered the little ones to come unto me and father for such as the kingdom of God made were also father admonished to become like little children father she desires to be baptized your word says go into all the world baptizing in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and with the keys to the kingdom Peter having that revelation what that name was it was the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to the scriptures we baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's your smile hey man praise God richly bless you go in peace come back
