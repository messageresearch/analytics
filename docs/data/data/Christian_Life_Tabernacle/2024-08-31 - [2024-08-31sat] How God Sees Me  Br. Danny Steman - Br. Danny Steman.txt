worthy hallelujah hallelujah Worthy is the Lamb God bless you you may be seated you love the Lord tonight well I can tell you assuredly one thing even if you don't he loves you and he loves you so much that he gave his life for you that a sacrifice that's so strong that you had no sin greater than his forgiveness foress no mistake Beyond his ability he's everything and we call these young people meetings uh uh but the the trouble is is that you're growing older and I'm getting younger amen I have an appointment with a new body and you're going to see a miracle you're going to see hair come on his head am amen amen the these wrinkles are going to go away and I'm going to get the nose I always wanted to have amen isn't he good he's he's so good and and uh you know there's nothing that pleases the Lord more than the Saints gathering together in unity and there's only one thing that really brings us in unity and it's not our thing thinking it it's not our ideas but it's the word of [Applause] God that's the thing that we have in common you know uh we are driving down the road and you see all kinds of different cars you know they they tricked all the people you know they took a Camry and put a l on the front of it and charg $20,000 more for the same car you know and people buy status you know what I mean and everything and and all that but just think tonight we've all been purchased for the same price there's nobody here worth any more than anybody else you know what I mean we all got purchased from the same pawn shop of sin and we all got paid for for the same price so we're certainly all equal here tonight and and uh you know we we're here we have these meetings we call them young people meetings or youth meetings or get together whatever it it's it all it is is a chance for us old people to try to pretend that we're young again so thank you for inviting us to your your meeting and all those things I I was reading a a scripture and it it struck me uh tremendously and it's it's out of a a ecclesiastics you know and ecclesiastic is not a book that we often read but the books of you know Proverbs and ecclesiastics they're great books of wisdom and and the great author wrote this he says when I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the Earth for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes I thought could you that's quite the same is it none of you have seen sleep with your eyes you know it's just the the way man can block himself out of the thinking of God he says then I beheld all the work of God that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun because though a man labor to seek it out yet he shall not find it yay further though A wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it for all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God no man knoweth either love Or Hate by all that is before them amen I thought you can seek after everything you can wear yourself out but when it comes down to it you can't even know love Or Hate by the things that are before you for all things are in the hands of God and I believe that's our heart's desire that why we have meetings why we have these things is we want you that are starting your lives and uh going to make decisions about jobs and careers and and and who you're going to spend your days with and and trying to get all the battle of your mind together all we want you to have come to the understanding is is that your life is in the hand of God Amen and no matter how hard things get he promised he'd be with you even in you till the end so I trust tonight through worship and through the preaching of the word that you will feel his Spirit come close to you and draw you closer to him and that if there's conviction that comes with it praise God for conviction amen if there's embarrassment that comes with it praise God for embarrassment I've sat in many a service and sat under the preaching of the word and thought every eye in the building was on me everybody knew he was talking about me it felt like all the angels and all the peoples of the earth were staring at me and I was exposed and no chastisement is Peaceable at the time but afterwards hallelujah hallelujah the freedom that you have is wonderful so Lord bless you tonight as we prepare after service we have food in the other uh room over there we have some old old food we have some new food and uh you just come and eat it up amen old and new over there we eat both sides of the book don't we Hallelujah so so you after service just go over there and clean up all our leftovers please we got donuts and cupcakes you can take them with you and everything and and I grew up with just a few Christian sayings one is where there's any there's plenty that's right and and if buts and wise are all Satan's lies so I live by those things in my heart God's word is true let's stand together we're privileged tonight there is a blood privilege to have brother Danny with us I don't know where brother Jeremy is brother Jeremy back there we appreciate the word of God other ministers that are with us tonight but it doesn't matter because we're all here because of one thing God saw a Lost Generation and he sent his only begotten son that whoever believeth on him he gave him power to become the Sons and Daughters of God amen amen it's precious it's a precious blood help me sing it amen there is a blood that [Music] the is when itow down from the my S were gone i s for God there is [Music] hallelujah this precious BL that gave me for in three days he breathed and Rose Hallelujah in Mighty so I come to tell you he's a lie to tell you that [Music] he hallelujah oh so I to tell you that is SA Cheng to Proclaim that is coming back for you there is a th sight the BL it us s the GL it has the power to free the as Chang fall the so [Music] oh I let it live glor because he live to make me whole I ow my life I ow my all so I [Music] come that [Music] [Applause] for [Music] you how many believe that are we thankful for his blood amen is meant for you amen amen and now that we have it we can come boldly to the throne of grace and ask him what we have need of I trust amen tonight that you've done so and you're looking forward to what God will speak to your heart if you have a need he promised amen he'd know all about it even before you'd ask about it he already would know and if you would just let him speak to your heart he would do so amen praise the name of the Lord so it's wonderful to be here we certainly appreciate amen the uh invitation appreciate you Brother David and we thank you for your hospitality and brother Matthew and just all the the ministers here here in in this church we appreciate you amen we're also looking forward to that day that Brother David is talking about we we look a little younger amen I don't know if the nose will change but the hair will amen amen and so there's some things about us that God just doesn't change amen amen I know brother brandom said that um you know we're he makes he's made us all different amen he made some that they like mountains some they like the the the sea some they like flat land everybody's different but he made it that way because of you amen and God is a god of variety I'm glad he is if we was all the same it would be really hard but we're all different and and and brother Bram said you know Peter was a Brash man somebody was just real on fire but then Andrew was real quiet and a prayer Warrior he said try to judge try to judge Peter by Andrew and you know we can fall into that too judge one another by someone else we're not supposed to do that we just let the Lord be the Lord amen and I believe he's revealing himself self in the formation of his bride amen and how many believe you're his bride amen then God will use you to show himself to someone else and I I'm glad that he does so God bless you if we just bow our heads for a word of prayer amen father it's a privilege to be here this evening Lord we know that in our own self we can do nothing father and we know that if we just bring our own words it's not enough father but if we can come Lord in your spirit Lord and bring your words it be life Lord to our hearts and to to those that have come to this meeting Lord It's a youth meeting father but Lord we know that you're not uh Bound by age father you can speak to every heart I pray you'd have your way in this service Lord and speak to the needs and minister to those Lord and anoint my lips anoint the ears of the hearer May most of all you have the preeminence father heal the sick among us Lord the needy Lord You're the same yesterday today and forever we thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy and we ask your blessings upon this service now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you if you're turning your Bibles to the Book of Numbers the 22nd chapter amen and we know this is a youth meeting and we want to encourage you amen we want to um uh we want the word to be established in your heart and we want you to know how to fighten CU we must know how to fight must not be carried about by every wind or every doctrine that would move around and things that would blow but we want to be established because the when the winds come in and the waves come in they come in real hard but if you're built upon the rock amen the waves can beat against it but it'll never tear it down amen and so we thank the Lord amen for his word this evening amen Numbers 22 I want to start at verse 9 and we'll just read down to the 12th chap uh 12th verse and I also will skip over to the 31st and just read one verse that that verse and God came unto Baum and said what men are these with thee and balum said unto God bik the son of zapor King of Moab has sent to me saying behold there is a people come up out of Egypt which cover the face of the Earth come now curse me them per ADV Venture I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out and God said unto balum Thou shalt not go with them Thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed praise the Lord the 31st verse then the Lord opened the eyes of balum and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and he fell flat on his face you can be seated may God bless his word this is a remarkable setting that I've just read to you and it holds a truth that uh the prophet of God said needs to be taught and he would take this setting and he would preach the message does God change his mind about his word and I I think that's uh something that God wants to seek into your hearts does God change his mind because if he changes his thought we we can't base uh who we are amen um and know who we are if he's a changeable God if he was a God that it would move at the whim of of of our failures and if we fail and he would change his mind and amen and if he had thought about you and then you're here and it's not like he would think that you should have been amen you have nothing to base base it upon and but yet this is a scripture where as the prophet of God would teach it it looks like God changed his mind and uh I want to title this tonight and and I want to put it in the first person make it personal to you as well how God sees me how God sees me I find that we get in such a rush many times that we don't stop and take the time to to consider what is happening or why things are are going the way they're going and and many times you may not uh correctly discern situations that are happening in the body of Christ and then then then you can be taken by surprise you know Satan he loves to speed us up he loves to get us in a rush when the as we said before when the enemy comes in like a flood and he he's trying to get you in a panic he's trying to get you in a fear then he wants you to make decisions while you're feeling that way this is how he works amen but God want you to stand still realize he is God so when we look at this setting uh uh it shows the power of of a heart desire in a man and it also gives us certain uh understandings of of actions and manifestations especially in this day and age and and it also is detailing a trap that has been set for for God's people it's coming this is the scripture that I've read to you is coming at the time that Israel is on the Move amen and and the Israel at this time is facing many changes miam and Aaron have have died Israel has been discontented with Moses and their souls become discouraged because of the way Moses himself is under pressure from the congregation I mean you know there's times a congregation can become dissatisfied with their leaders amen and the Bible says they ched with Moses which means they disputed with him in other words they didn't see the way he was doing things to be the right way amen so the Bible says they strove with him which means they they begin to accuse Moses listen if they will accuse a prophet of God they're accuse a pastor they're accuse a deacon they're ACC use the leaders amen if a prophet is not going to be good enough neither is a pastor going to be good enough amen but God allows these strains to come amongst us because he wants you to learn how to stay with the word isise the name of the Lord we're we're not to be tossed around and and just because something gets hard we begin to give up and say well I wish I was back there or it's better over here but God wants you to stay with the vision because he has a vision Hallelujah he's made a promise he's not going to change it praise the Lord amen the the Bible says that the the people wish amen that they would have died just like their brothers they pretend that their brothers Dayan and cor would come to them in a moment had had died a natural death but they forgot their brothers died under judgment because of unbelief by their wrong view of the what was happening amongst them they they forgot to be thankful that they themselves had been spared amen amen and so as Moses was leading the children of Israel another thing they forgot that Moses was not making his decisions based on what he thought was right but the prophet of God said that Moses is getting his information from the logos am mean they were led by the pillar of fire the church is being led by the pillar of fire and it led them into a place they amen that they begin to get angry and they begin to be dissatisfied and and they begin to be thirsty and they begin to look at everything around them and complain have you ever found yourself like that and I think if you're honest everybody has amen but remember it's the pillar of fire that is leading God's people this message is not amen Moses's message I don't care how how any man would come and try to redefine it and take leadership or ownership over it it is not their message and you do not have a right to change it it wasn't even Moses's message it was God's message if it had been up to Moses Moses would have quit a long time ago he had forgot the vision he had forgot he was to be the leader but God said I have remembered I've got some young people down here in down wherever you're from I've remembered and I have come down I'm sending you now don't get uncomfortable on me older folks don't get uncomfortable if anybody should be established it ought to be you amen don't get uncomfortable but as our brother said if if conviction comes upon you that's the time right there to grab a hold of and say God I'm sorry was me now [Applause] we move so quick when circumstances dry up and we get we get afraid and and because we can't feel him we wonder if he's with us but God was leading them that way and then it begins to reveal to us there's conversations going on around us that we don't even know about but God is all aware what I've read to you amen Moses might not even known it was happening until God showed him so Moses is getting his information through the pillar of fire amen which is the Angel of the Covenant which is Christ the anointed one and he's getting his message through that and he's giving it to the people on on the road to a Promised Land but amen but this man was all settled down Moab and he had his kingdom and he had his church churches and he had everything in order and he looks and he sees this people coming among him and he said they're going to take over and I need somebody to curse the people and I notice you imagine that one Prophet one man of God seen the works of God with another man and try to challenge that work he ought to have know better right Amen brother bam said in the revelations book of symbols says he said follow the instructions not the emotions follow the instructions now when he's talking about the instructions what does he talking about he said follow the word if Moses would had followed the emotions of the people they' have been running all over the mountains and screaming amen when they was at the Red Sea amen why have you brought us here we're going to die they'd all go screaming everywhere and he just run after him come back come back I'm sorry I didn't mean to bring you here God let him there right and God will bring you into real uncomfortable situations because if you're going to be a Son of God and if you're going to act like a Son of God and if you're going to talk like a Son of God it's not when when you feel like one and it's not going to be when you think you're one am I yelling too loud for you amen but God said stand still and see the glory of God for this day God will fight for you and you'll stand still and so they just walked across the sea so before the people enter into Canaan God shows in this dialogue between BAC and balum that we read to you something of which Israel is unaware at the moment and it's an attack on God's people in a form that we had not seen before and we are made partakers of this Con conversation just like we're made partakers of the conversation between Satan and God when they begin to discuss job and as it is the case of job Satan's attack on God's people is actually used by God to bless his people Moab who who's making this request of this Prophet balum Moab is one of Israel's habitual enemies and the Hallmark of Moab according to the scripture is it is a very proud people Isaiah 16:6 says we have heard of the pride of Moab he's very proud even of his haughtiness and his pride and his wrath but his lies shall not be so Jeremiah 48:29 we have heard of the pride of Moab he is exceeding proud his loftiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the haughtiness of his heart you see the spirit of Pride always try to dominate God's people you understand we're not talking against now in this realm we're not talking about a people against a people we're talking about a spiritual warfare PR that is trying to anoint you against the leadership of the word and it is pride to think amen I can stop this from happening we're familiar amen with this nation this nation of Israel is a great danger to the people or excuse me this nation of Moab is a a danger to the people of God and Converse ly Bayo seesing God's people in enormous danger to his own existence he feels threatened by their approach amen because amen they're they're are Supernatural people there are people who God has LED and there are a he he feels threatened by by by their stand amen but yet in reality there's no reason fear because God had forbidden them don't don't mess with them just pass on through don't go to war with them pass on through if you use anything in the land pay them for it but go on through oh if the devil would only know we're just passing through we don't want nothing of his I said we don't want nothing of his we're just passing on through amen but we're familiar with the story and I know you are at the king of Moab and the princes and The Messengers of Moab are Desiring the services of balum because of the advance of of Israel so you just want to be aware in this lesson young people anytime you begin to move with God and move in step with what he's doing Satan is going to try to block you he's going to do something Monday you can be sure he's going to do something Monday amen when we when we try to have services or ministers trying to prepare Satan is going to do something to try to disrupt your mind and and get in your emotions because he knows if he can get you amen distracted the word will not have the effect like if you sit here tonight and you begin to fall asleep or you think about this or you think about that the word can just pass you right by man and so Moab has seen what Israel has done to the amorites in destroying them and they're afraid in fact the exact phrase that the scripture uses is they are sore afraid which it means they were in a panic when Israel is approaching and so they go into talk with the talks with the Elders of Midian and they they come up with a plan to overcome and and and drive out the Israelites and I and I want to dwell on on that because we know that Israel in the natural is a type of the church spiritual amen so now amen because the enemy has seen how Israel has defeated some great warriors like Sion and OG these two great Kings he realizes a military confrontation is not going to work so he has to come up with another way to defeat God's people amen because a full-on battle amen where we draw our swords and we draw our battle lines he knows he's going to lose but I got to do another thing so what he wants to try to do is his tactic is he wants to try to drive a wedge between God and his people and he's doing it at a very extreme tactical moment it's at the end of the of the Wilderness journey and all the unfaithfulness of the people he has 40 years to work with 40 Years of failures 40 Years of unbelief and uprisings imagine if in my church if I took all the years of the negative things that have happened in my church church and and said now I'm going to make a story about that or maybe even put it on the internet and make a book you're like you go to what church do you know what they do there you see because he wants to drive a wedge amen and so Bic shows I hope you're listening hope you're not too tired Bao shows in this conversation he knows nothing about the God of Israel he only sees him as a holy God a God who destroys his enemies God who judges in [Applause] Anger a God who opens up the Earth and swallows up those unbelieving Israelites and those rebellious people a god God he knows nothing about the [Applause] grace he knows nothing about a hand he know he doesn't even know that this very message started in Grace it was a message that said Moses no one can take your place I don't care if they're a better speaker they'll never take your place you see what happens is when God starts a work and he uses a certain man and then as the church begins to grow other men perhaps more talented perhaps better speakers perhaps they have they seem to ooze confidence you're like I'll follow that man but then the man that God uses he's just makes mistakes and he seems to stumble around and he can't even speak things right and you're like oh why would I follow a man like that give me the man that can stand out there and use a sword and boldness and knows I'm the the one Moses was such a man Moses was a man who stuttered would you have followed him I want to tell you you're like this service is going to take all night you would have got impatient with him you'd have looked at his weaknesses You' have judged him for his wrong decision oh if you'd have been there when he in anger I ain't going to follow an angry prophet and he struck the rock twice get me the man that does everything right and you'll never find him you see our problem is we judge one another by one another and I want you to know the prophet said there's no big eyes or little use this message is a message of power this word is a word of power and if it was a man's word it would die but this word this message is not a dying word this message is Christ I want you to know this message cannot die this message is the power come on you old us folks you ought to be behind me showing your life the power of Resurrection you should have died you should have quit but God the grace of God all right you're not good amen that's it's okay I'll take it God help us forget how it started and God is the starter and he's the finisher there's a reason he took a prophet off the scene and there's a reason he took Moses off the scene cuz if you can't following Moses you're certainly not follow the Holy Ghost amen so this plan I want you to understand young people it's all about you there's a plan taking place on a mountain somewhere we have to stop them stop this generation I've got the majority of this generation confused of what they even are they don't know they get up in the morning and a man man looks in the in the mirror and he goes you know what I'm a girl and what I just said is considered bigotry in hate speech you understand it's a reality where a girl would like go you know I I I want to be a man and they were never meant to be that way they were meant you know it's not hard to understand who you are it's what God made you at the beginning amen if you try to change that you're not you're changing what God had already started and he has come in like a flood and he's tried to confuse the identity of the people confuse the identity of churches churches are confused people are confused nobody knows hardly where to stand anymore but there is a sure word of Prophecy that already says who I am where I came from you know there was a man one time was confused about where he came from I'm tell you the kind of God we serve he he don't have a pity party when you're having one you understand he wants to help you get out of it when you are laying there crying and nobody loves me and and nobody cares for me nobody knows how hard I got it amen here's a man who lost all his children amen he lost his health he lost his wealth he lost everything he had he said on a on an as sheep his wife said why don't you give up and leave the message and curse God and die amen amen amen and God didn't say now listen listen let's let's go down and just get a bunch of friends around him and let's all cry no here come some friends in and said we know you're sinning we know you're doing wrong his life went from bad to worse because not only now is his Natural Life attacked his spiritual life is in doubt everything is being attacked and God is silent God isn't saying a word only connection he has with God he doesn't have a Bible he doesn't have 1,200 Services of a prophet to listen to he doesn't have a wealth of commentaries from the past ages he doesn't have a church age book he only has what God speaks to him and God takes it away and he shuts it off yeah he said God where are you where are you will you speak to me his wife says why don't you leave the church why don't you quit why don't you stop why don't you just curse God and die it's all that's left for curse God and die he had enough sense to say he didn't say she's a foolish woman enough sense about that learn young people the older folks back in the back don't even have strength to say come on he looked at her and says you know you talk like like like a foolish one though God slay me yet I trust him end of the book when God is getting ready to re reveal to him God didn't come in say now listen now listen uh uh um job I'm sorry that this has happened to you I'm I'm sorry you're going through this I didn't realize that Satan would attack you this hard and and you know I I I kind of got to let you know that I I did give him permission but I I did tell him you know don't take your life I I didn't realize you lose everything no you know what God told him to do it's always amazed me I love this I love this he had every right to be depressed and maybe miss a Wednesday night you had every right to pout you know what God told him stand up and be a man what do you mean I've lost everything be a man I'm going to tell you something you never knew I want to ask you a question all you've done is ask me questions why is this happened why has that happened I want to ask you a question where were you because you may not have the answer but I have the answer to where you were I want you to know this message has the answer Amen to your life to who you was before the foundation of the world when a prophet would stand behind the pulpit and said I'm going to talk to you about what he had in his mind before the world was ever formed we have a message that tells us where we came from tells us our purpose in life and tells us where we're going how can you not think God for that Satan says if I can drive a wedge between them these people's understanding of their God so you know what they did they went out and got another true Prophet somebody who could be another voice amen other than brother brandham other than Moses this was not a false prophet he was a real Prophet but the difference was amen he could sell his gift he was not a hit and mprofit say something true and then say something wrong he was a true Prophet but the Bible calls him a hiring because Satan knows the way I can get between you and God is with another word another word and I know what cursing means and I know what blessing in means and I know what things said over you mean now I don't want to depress you but I'm going to take as long as I can tonight because we want the we want the enemy amen that speaks to your mind and tries to put these things in you and keep you in a place of loneliness and depression he wants you to think God doesn't know you or God doesn't care for you or it's not for you he wants you to think that but I want you to be able at the end of the service stand up and say I know how God sees me I know how God sees me and nobody can change it nobody so when The Messengers come to Bam they said we know we know that what you curse is cursed and we know that what you bless is blessed and 22:6 it says come now therefore I pray thee curse me this people for they're too Mighty for me I cannot meet them in face to-face battle hi brother David amen hey fella you with the glasses right there you see me come here if you can't see him you can see his shoes I want you understand the power of this message that if this young fellow here begins to believe God has touched his heart Satan knows he cannot stop him right you understand that you believe that I'm like you put your hand up yeah Satan Satan knows the power let me just say something just a minute amen he's taking your picture you smile at him I'll preach amen I want to say something a minute when the maniac of gadera was bound with over 2,000 demons and Jesus walked down there to him those demons recognized what was in that little body of Jesus Christ and brother brandham said they cried out what are you doing in that little bitty body cuz they know the spirit that was in him the spirit that was in him is the one who swept his hand out and there go the Stars he's the one that spoke the world into existence they know why is it contained in a little body hallelujah hallelujah they know in face to-face Warfare they're defeated and the only thing they can do is ask do I have permission to go over here all right and here you think you cannot overcome a demon of lust or you cannot overcome the God of this age and if you amen take inside of you that spirit amen that created the heavens and the Earth they will ask [Applause] permission brother bam said a man can live so close to God that the devil don't know what to do with him I believe you know what is your name W huh Weston yeah I got a nephew by the name of Weston and you know them demons will say well here comes that kid with him wearing shoes again and you may not think much of it and you may judge it by how small he is but I'm tell you God knows how to get in real small places he knows how to get in real tight Corners he knows know how Amen to get into a fiery furnace that's my God I said that's my God he is not hindered by how small you are he can be in a big body he can be in a small body that doesn't stop God so so let's find us Prophet let's find us a prophet whose word has power and they found one I want to say this no matter how gifted you are your gift is subject to the word of the age true Paul said it himself s if I or even an angel from heaven come and say something different than what I've already preached to you then let him be a curse and I'll say it again and when we have left off standing for the word amen then Satan knows he is being successful and driving a wedge between you and the Vindicated word of the hour if you got to wait on me to say a word over you or or to tell you you're going to make it you're going to wait a long time cuz it isn't up to me to tell you I cannot save you I cannot amen do any of those things I did not die for you the only salvation I can give you is one that's already been presented more of you should be saying Amen to that come on I want you say it like this when a person is more precious to you than the word you're not worthy Jesus said unless you forsake your father and mother that's right amen and follow me come on oh don't get offended on me stand with me somebody help me don't let it just be the young men let it be those that have all these miles on your body and you've come through all kinds of ups and downs and failures and don't let that Devil stay on top of you and say you can't make it or say you're not a child of God because you failed before you might have fallen you might have done wrong amen but Satan is only trying to present to you the Holiness of God but he doesn't want you to know the grace [Applause] Grace does not excuse Grace does not excuse Grace says neither do I condemn Thee thank you Lord that's all the world wants to stop at they would say see he wouldn't condemn so how can you condemn but that's not what the Bible says neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more if he can have power to forgive he can have power to cllean power to walk a holy life so Moab is unusual Moab is trying to weaken Israel by another word amen and that word will war against the revealed word of Moses at least that's what Bic hopes as a case if I can get them to listen to me instead of Moses if I can get to listen to my Prophet instead of Moses I want you people to do me a favor get out of your mind I'm speaking against people talk about the spirit so balam is a prophet he's a true Prophet but he's not a true word Prophet because if he was he would have submitted himself to the revealed word in fact balum is available to the highest bidder y you need a word I can say it I'll say whatever it needs you know if it's to make you feel bad I can say it if I can make you feel good I'll say it just make the pay good now balum balam when he's presented with this here's these people coming up it came at a crucial time because Israel would have fresh in their mind that their Prophet had just made a huge mistake he'd struck the rock twice in Anger isn't that the right time to leave him is that the right time you know how a man say one time he said you know if a man's a true Prophet he'll never make a mistake he said because Moses said I'm like well I don't know what Bible you read but the Bible I read it said Moses made such a mistake that amen the last day Prophet would come along and said he broke every commandment there was by striking the rock twice amen he used a pre a gift that had worked before now he was afraid to speak it anger made him do that you see if Satan can get you stirred up in your passions against one another you'll say things that will carry a mark you see we live in the days of labels if I can label you I don't have to really know [Music] you hey hey I I I got a pantry just like you got a pantry I go in there and I have a can and I like tomato soup and it says tomato soup on the label I don't open up to see if it is tomato soup I know it's tomato soup I do not have to investigate and if somebody will label you and say ah you don't believe in God or you don't you're a liar or you're this or you have this problem there's a label on you well I don't have to look at who you really are come on now on now because words carry cursing and blessing and we can fall into that trap so easy even in the message even preacher against preacher amen run somebody down and you won't listen to them come on church you've been guilty of it you know you've been guilty of speaking against maybe even your wife or your husband you know what it's a good thing to do is you ought to know how to repent you may not be able to get those words back but you can say you're sorry I know that's not popular I'm [Music] sorry come on Church the very event young people the very event of the nation of Moab being afraid of the children of Israel is fulfilling prophecy the very Act of you coming and the Enemy being afraid begins to fulfill what a prophet already said Moses had set it at the Red Sea you and your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed you've guided them in thy strength into thy holy habitation the people shall here be afraid sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestine then the Dukes of Edom shall be amazed the Mighty Men of Moab trembling shall take hold of them is already said already happened and now here they are stepping into that amen you shall bring them and you shall plant them in the mountain so the Bible speaks about balum you can read about it in the New Testament it C says three things about him it says the way of balam in second Peter 2 in judges one it talks about the error of balum Amen in Revelations 2 it talks about the teaching of balum somehow after thousands of years balum is still [Music] alive will Satan after his failures to kill people in battle will he succeed in his efforts to destroy the people for the attempts of the enemy make it clear God will always maintain his relationship with his people no matter what so we have a situation I try to hurry a little bit we have a situation that bam did talk to God and he asked permission to go and God says no you don't go and the reason you don't go I have blessed these people so bam goes back he's determined he says listen I'm not going God told me not to go and I believe his first word they're like Hey listen you don't know these people I don't care what they've done I don't care God told me not to go so they went back and reconvened and they talked about it again they said let's offer him more money let's see if we can persuade him a second time you know Satan can try something on you the first time and it won't work but that don't mean he's going to stop that's right come on young people he's going to try again give you a better opportunity you know better opportunity is not always the will of the lord well you got to follow the money brother Danny well ask Bam how that worked hey you follow the money right out of church follow the money right out of Wednesday night amen you know lot follow the money oh I don't even know why I'm here but I'm there you know lot follow the money where did he follow it right down to Sodom because it looked like Eden to him oh brother Danny I got such an opportunity here I I I'm going to tell you something tell you I had a I had a young man come to me one time he's married he has children he come to me he says you know what he said I have always dreamed and I've always wanted to be a fireman he said I have an opportunity to be a fireman he said but the only thing he said and I prayed about it and I prayed about it and now the opportunity for me to get in there and I and I'm going to take the schooling I I have an opportunity now and he said I've prayed about it I have prayed about it he said now the only thing I'm G to have to miss Wednesday night you know I said well I I just tell you this I just said I said brother I said uh I said well I'm glad You' had this opportunity you've always dreamed about since you was a little boy I said but I want you to know the will of God will never take you out of his will [Applause] amen one young people won't you to listen to me he was yeah yeah yeah yeah but it's such a big the opportunity loomed larger than the word because you know the word gets old and kind of gets boring same people getting up here singing the same songs I mean we know we know brother Billy's going to get up there amen let's all sing together Hallelujah in the amen then you're going to have Matthew get up there hey are you happy to be here hallelujah [Music] amen and then you got Brother David brother David's going to get up there and he's like you know my nose is going to be different right don't we wish we'd all be different I thought about myself that way too but how we going to recognize one another you see we try to change things and so this boy he went into that and he be to miss Wednesday night and pretty soon begin to miss Sunday and he went through all the schooling months and months and months and then he reject they rejected him but when they rejected him he didn't start coming again on Wednesday night I know you're going to get quiet I know this is old I don't know what it is what is the word hallelujah I know what the prophet taught if you listened more of it you'd know too I've had people accuse me you're mad when you preach I said no I just you know I I never practiced right amen I don't know I don't look in the mirror and see what a scout looks like brother you know if I amen so then he switched he goes well since I can't be that my daddy was in the he was a policeman so I'll be a polican so he went over and became a policeman and tell you where he's at today he divorced his wife both of them left the message married other people children are scattered why why because the will of God gave him an opportunity a new offer I want you to know something the God I serve yes sir knows how to give you opportunity and I found out my God knows how to pay a bill when I don't have money and I found out if I would be faithful to the word said I have never seen the righteous somebody here help me I have never seen the righteous forsaken I've never seen his seed Bing bread don't you give up on a God that when things begin to dry up our dreams Loom large my God can take care of you you remain faithful to his word oh help me Lord I got a long ways to go you sung a a long time so we have this situation he's offered more so he comes back and he says okay I'll do it but I only say what God puts in my mouth and here here's a prophet of our age would look at that and he says now look like God changed his mind he said but really what it was it was the heart desire God knows how to expose what's in your heart and he said that God will give you his original word which is his perfect will and if you don't want it he allow you to go your own way but it'll be his permissive will you go on but I will still get the glory bam you go doing the permissive will you may lose your life but I can still save those children amen who suffered under your permissive will because you wanted that more than his perfect will there's a heart bride there's a bride after God's Own Heart that want his word oh my so we see that what I'm speaking of here is is something that and I want to remind you of this that we're taught in the church age period that these same Spirits are working against the true church brother bam said working mysteriously against the true church and God will expose those spirits in the Book of Revelation by their old testament names and brother brandom in the seals he will call them the actors in the ages because it's the same Spirit just changing his mask that's right so when you have the Deeds or the doctrine of the nickan and then you have amen the teaching of balam and the amen and then that Prophet prophetess Jezebel seducing the people with her Doctrine he said it's not different people it's the same Spirit moving from Death to death to death and God pulls the picture back and he shows this is Satan trying to get you to believe a hybrid word against the original word so at the same time that these enemies are being exposed Christ is also revealing himself and this is the war because when Christ is revealing himself it's the Revelation and Satan is against the revelation of the word because the revelation of the word is the reality of the word speaking from Revelations 5 brother bam is showing the work of the lamb and his intercessory work work which is his present office brother bandam would say in the first seal that lamb in the time of his intercessory back here he knew there were names that were in there that was put in there from the foundation of the world you think about it I'm speaking to names that was in that Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world you cannot contain it here and as long as those names have never been manifested on Earth yet he had to stay there as an intercessor do you get it it's predestination all right he had to stay there because he had to stay there because he came to die for those that God has ordained to eternal life by his for knowledge he saw them not by his own will his will that none should perish but by his forn knowledge he knew who he knew who would and who would not therefore as long as there was one name one name that had not been declared in Earth Christ had to stay there as an intercessor to take care I wonder maybe tonight there's one name who hasn't been manifested yet that's maybe even said in here in this room and he said I take care of that we sung the song Amen as we come to the pulpit there is a blood I have to take care of that name oh praise the Lord Brother bandham said here's a woman laying here stretched on a stretcher and this morning she's in a serious condition well if God doesn't touch her she'll die she's aged she's an old mother gray hair wearing glasses very Godly looking person amen now she's laying her perhaps her doctor has done all he knows to do but he can't do no more she's Fallen her ankles or ribs and the complication of things she told me what is wrong with her and things that she didn't know also but There She lays in that kind of state well being in that kind of condition and tore up like that now what can we do for her it is to bring her in the Blessed presence of the all-sufficient refreshening Holy Ghost that can take away the staleness from herl as the doctor though good as he could be trying to tell her that maybe there is nothing more I can do but we lift her into that place oh how God Amen is Desiring to lift you into that place where you realize he's the alls sufficient one you don't have to walk by your own power you can walk in his power praise the name of the Lord and so God God ask asked balam this question who are these men with you now God knows all things he knows who those men are but he's saying I want to I want to I want to get a explanation from you so he begins to tell them these men are coming and they're want me to do something about these people and God says where are you getting your information yeah now I got to be honest I'm getting it from these men's perspective that's where I'm getting it so when God told him not to go then he gets a better offer and he comes back and he goes again and God says go but I'm going to tell you what to say so bam went you know so here God can be really strange and you may not understand the ways of God but as he goes his his his his donkey begins to malfunction amen and and he falls down so balum he he gets all animated you know he begins to try to get him up and he's not getting up and he tries to get him up again and he and and and he fell he fell on him in such a place that he he pinned balum against the wall Bam's there and he's and he's and he's striking his donkey trying to get him up because he's never done this before and what he doesn't realize is is the Beast he's riding has eyes to see an angel that the animal is seeing what amen a Prophet cannot see the prophet cannot see this Angel of the Lord standing there with a drawn sword why is that angel standing there for you he has to take care of you God was so careful I'm going to remind you I'm going to remind you by your vehicle Breaking Down Bam and you're going to get so mad you're going to find yourself amen cursing your vehicle I hope none of you did that I hope none of you have a temper like that where you beat the wheel of your car and talk to it I don't know why none of you stand up when I say that Hallelujah brother you know that guy in front of you or what you know how it is okay anyway he can you imagine if balum lived in Dallas he he'd have been committed a long time ago amen and so amen so here he finds himself a prophet having a conversation with a beast yeah haven't I been a good donkey yes you've been a good donkey you'd have thought somewhere along the line he' stopped and say what am I doing right right but he held a a a he held a reasonable conversation with an animal and then God opened his eyes you know your animal has been more spiritual than you and he saved your life now so this is a strange part of the scripture he saved your life I stopped you cuz you're going against the people that I had blessed but now go ahead and go it's so strange he stopped him he's going to remind him these are my young people I know they're getting a little tired and I know the service is getting long but you know what they're going to learn to like church if your phones could tell you how long you've looked at it on average every day I wonder what it say about how long well anyway [Music] anyway your phone said you have prayed for 20 hours this week you have listened to five messages wow you're quiet wow wow we are right on target drop the bomb amen but on average your phone amen has told you amen you have read me today 8 hours and 36 minutes and 20 seconds I know none of you do that so he goes up Amen to to find amen because of the new offer he's going to go up and do what the bidding of this nation is and that is to curse of people who God has blessed now folks all in the room I want you to look around and I want you to see who set in here even those you got ought against if God has said he's blessed them and the first blessing is he brought you under the sound of the Gospel no man can come except my father draws him you better be very careful how you speak about one another whom God has blessed because I read in my Bible he is the same yesterday today and forever and he doesn't change and if he under the blood of bulls and goats would stand up for a people and say I know what they have done but I'm going to choose oh you forgot the god that is alive this message is not just quotes and a powerful preacher the God I know yes now you're going to go up there and I'm going to put in your mouth what you're going to say they had a big ceremony church I'm trying to H I'm trying to go fast now they had a big ceremony up there they were fundamental on everything they were doing amen and then Bayo says all right let me lead you over to this website and I'm going to show you exactly what you can find out about this church that you can curse them so he read it and he read he said oh my oh my oh my oh my oh my oh my oh my my wow they did that in that church what they still allow that guy in there they did what the pastor made what decision he did what well that's what it says right here you know you can curse them man I mean they let people in there Who Fallen did some bad things and that Pastor he didn't do nothing about it he just swept it under the rug well I'm on something right now come on come on oh you big shot why don't you stand up and tell what you've done you want to accuse a pastor for sweeping something under the rug you don't even know what an office of a pastor is I'm G to tell you about a God come on I'm going to tell you about a God I said I'm going to tell you about a God maybe some of you aren't acquainted with but you need to start learning to know him he looked at that said all right I'm going to curse him I'm going to curse him I see enough in this Dallas church right now glory to God yeah I I can curse them I see it I see it right now and I'll do it listen here I go on I just got to find it you see you see the strategy of Satan is to take a person into a place to look upon a people and that Spirit isn't dead it's not dead right now that spirit's in this church his spirits in every message church it's against the people of God it wants to find the weak place and then begin to talk about the weak place as if the word has no power and these people will not change it and they don't do nothing from the pulpit about it and they allow them to sit there and that kind of come on people looking at me like that so bam get b balum gets up there and you know fresh in his mind is his his his donkey accident and everything that's happened and he's and he's thinking about that and it's you know God knows how to keep things alive you know on your phone you have this reminders God's reminder for for bam was you know what your foot is probably swelled up a little bit and and he remembers the wreck it's fresh have any of you ever wrecked with a donkey if we have let's talk he gets up there and he looks at all that b shows him yeah I see that person there I've seen what they done I saw that one back said didn't come to church for 10 months I seen that over there you know he did something on the job was crooked and you know what here he is back in church I saw him raise his hand and then here's this person over there he fell that one over there fell in adultery and this one over here he he did this and and this one over here he said something against the pastor and this one over here left the church and tried to pull others out of the church and this one over here ah I got a lot of ammunition you look just like the children of Israel you're in the same body subject to senses he you're quiet and he looked and the ERS were prepared and the Bible says the Lord put a word in balam's mouth and said return unto Bao and thus shall you speak and he returned and he stood by the the burnt sacrifice and there stood all the princes of Egypt beside him get ready get ready and he looked and he said Bao said come curse me Jacob and defy Israel and here bam says Bao has told me to curse you but how shall I curse from God has not cursed now I've seen some cursed sings but God put that word in my mouth and I don't understand it I looked right at you and I had a reel I looked on your phone and I saw all them places you have been and all those websites you deleted and then God said stand up there and tell them how can I curse whom God hath blessed hallelu it don't make no sense to me brother Danny cuz I see a people who should be destroyed and God says I'm going to bless him how can I defy whom the Lord has not defied trying to help you young people God has seen everywhere you have been that's right but if he shall speak to you again yes Hallelujah yes you stand up and you answer that voice he knows you've tried to quit God knows your heart how shall I curse whom God has blessed for from the top of the Rocks I see them and from the hills I Behold Him Lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the Nations you know bic is starting to have a panic attack he says that's not what I want you to tell that church I want you to get up and tell them well you know this Minister has left and that Minister has left and this congregation these friends are leaving and you know this message is not true I want you to tell them that and you're not doing it you're not bringing out all the faults of the message instead you're saying God has blessed this people and I don't understand it go back and say another word surely you message you're you got a deeper Ministry than that so he comes back he said I know more about them and he takes them to another place if if if if your life was unruled before everybody in here and every thought that you've ever had and every failing that you ever had you would hang your head and you would walk on out amen but here God says he a man that he should not lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good behold I have received commandment to bless and he has blessed and I cannot that's even if I wanted to amen I cannot reverse it hallah amen he has not beheld iniquity heyy I'm want to tell you something about the king I serve I'm going to tell you about something about the shadow of the king that's in this Camp I'm going to tell you something about there's a prophet in the camp there is a king in the camp the shout of the king is in the camp amen the shout of the king is in the camp the brass serpent amen Divine Healing it's all here this evening it's already in the camp and I want to tell you about the king I serve I seen all that you have told me but I choose not to look at them that way I want to say it again it's not because you didn't do it I just don't see it you're not getting it I'm going to tell you again John would say amen he that says he has no sin he's a lion but he writes in the same book he that says he sins he's a liar no he didn't say it that way I quoted it wrong he that hath the seed of God in him cannot sin and the same John Roose said you don't sin you lie so what kind of God is that it's a God that chose to look at you one specific way and that was through the blood of Jesus Christ brother Jackson if I look at you through the blood I can't even see you amen if if I look at you through the blood I can't even see you I just want to tell you something more even more great God said here's what a God said through a prophet God said through a prophet he says you can't even fall before God he said but before men you can fall and so here's stands balum and he's looking before men and men are showing him you've done this and you have done this and you have done this and you have done this and you have done this amen and God says now look at it through my eyes oh the challenge young people tonight is to look at it God's way I want to show you how God sees me I speak unto you young men I speak unto you young men because your sins are forgiven you I speak to you young man because you're strong and you have overcome the world I speak unto you fathers for your sins are forgiven how can I serve a god like that how can I follow a god like that it's a God said he won't even let me fall amen come here hallelujah use preachers amen fall down stay down here's bam do you see Billy has he ever done this before ah then you knew he was that all the time and then what is he going to do when a greater power walks in the room and he just looks at that old Ling spirit and he goes like this amen hallelujah hallelujah come on I want to tell you one more thing I want to tell you one more thing my God doesn't even have to say anything to the devil hallu once my soul was astray from the Heavenly way I started too high amen and then what did he do when he reached yes down his he didn't have to say a word he came down and did it so I want to tell the devil tonight how can you curse whom God has blessed how can you say these young people won't make it when God said I've already seen you come on young man come on young lady I've already seen you over there I sent you a prophet I sent you a prophet who went beyond the curtain of time and he came back and he said I saw you there oh let me say one thing else I know we get so loud sometimes we don't hear what's being preached I want to say one thing else if God before us yes hey if God is for you what's going to stop you huh Here Comes The Devil not you me hey buddy you'd make a good running back for the Dallas Cowboys and God says you'd make a better witness for me than you could do with a contract of $200 million and break every record in the NFL book I won't remember them come on but if you stand for me amen I'll stand for you I got a God I got a God said you stand for me I'll stand for you here's the devil looking at you Eli and he said I see things in your life I can curse you over and then God says but I chose to bless him how did he bless me he put a deep calling to the deep in my heart how did he bless me he sent a word that answered that deep the only word that could not a Baptist word not a Lutheran word not a Pentecostal word amen but the word of God then he sent his spirit in there to confirm it he chose to bless me when I could have easily been cursed he chose to bless me so if God be for me who can be against me I want to speak about one more condition and I'll close there was a little woman who fell into spiritual Amnesia she got to a place in her life she didn't even think she had the Holy Ghost and if she looked in her life she didn't know that she even had an experience so she wanted to have a private interview with brother Brown and that interview is not long she began to talk to brother brand said there's no place in my life I can put a foot on to say that I've got it will you bear with me just a minute I begin to look at that so it just seemed like I was impressed to my heart just go look that woman up go look her up because all we know is pretty much is the private interview of sister Bruce sister Georgia Bruce so I went Brother David and I looked it up you know five years before that and then then many times the name the time that her name is mentioned God had healed her of cancer years before but the times her name is mentioned it's always she's given a prayer request for someone else has a need and she's standing for him and five years before this interview in the message images of Christ brother Brandon begins to speak he said here's a woman sitting here praying she's a warrior and I know her but I can't help because that light is hanging over her that's Mrs Bruce five years later Sister Georgia Bruce says brother brandom most of all I want the experience that I've been sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it to your heart what has happened to Sister Bruce you see the spirit of balum still trying to drive a wedge between God's people and the Vindicated word and trying to cause you to doubt that he'll stand for you and that he'll carry out what he said he would do Weston don't you ever forget God will never fail you I want to tell you something I tell you something we sing a song wrong never fail me yet what do you mean yet when you say yet it means he can I just want to sing another song Jesus never fails never when he says no to me it's as good as my yes as his yeses Jesus knows best you know I've had people say I just want to I just want to be comfortable in life I just want to be comfortable I just want to be comfortable and God says I don't want you to be comfortable why do you want to be comfortable what's wrong with uncomfortable nobody saying amen you know if you asked God and God answered your prayer right away and you asked him again he answered your prayer right away and you asked him again he answered your prayer right you go around oh boy I got faith then you pray and then you pray then you pray and then maybe a preacher come along and say well the reason it's not happen because you don't have any faith well I'm just sorry I disagree with that cuz his nose is just as good as his yeses but real faith is not having every prayer answered real faith is standing when everything is gone wrong real Faith sister stat Cliff asked brother brandom after holding up her dead baby for days over there in that hospital in Germany brother Brandon the reason you didn't raise it from the dead raise it from the dead because wasn't my lack of faith brother bam says no you had real Faith anybody can have faith when everything's going the one way but when everything's going wrong and you still believe when you still stand upon the word and you you go back down that's my [Applause] God I just want to know that I've been sealed with the Holy Ghost here saying such a Vindicated Prophet I believe sister Bruce that Bruce with all my heart I believe with all my heart that you're a real Born Again believer sister Bruce how could that Spirit just leave now she feels she doesn't have it and I'm not trying to tell people who don't have it you have it but I'm talking about a woman a real Warrior yeah who now is fallen in battle she's got these mind battles and Satan is pointing out her failures I can't find a place I'm sealed and he says how could the spirit just leave when you get sick you get weary and you're nervous type person sister Bruce says yes and you get things on your mind little bitty things how about you little bitty things and it just keeps building up and both ways you got somebody in your heart you want to pray for them and you you get up and pray for it you can't rest till you get that person prayed for that's you then take the other side Satan might present something another out this way see and then God you have your your nature and God works and Satan works and then when Satan tries to make you believe that you are not see that war there's many a find people that look the part but set in bondage because Satan has done this to them I got to ask you a question why are you here why didn't you just give up why didn't you just throw in the towel well I don't feel him that don't mean he's not there Satan's trying to make you believe that you're not and you keep building this up and maybe and don't look at yourself sister Bruce oh Satan does everything he can to make you look at yourself when you look at yourself you say I can't overcome uhhuh and you're just like your phone I fell eight hours today maybe some of you fell on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday that was a tabulation of it my wife why are you here is there hope you see there's a phone going off I'm fixing to pray for you and I'm not worthy of that and I think what would I do if Jesus Christ was sitting here right now what would he do if he was here he'd lay his hands upon you with his great faith you'd get well and I'd think and I think well I'm a sinner and I'm not him but I come to represent him and I'm just doing the same thing tonight amen I come to represent him but remember me being a sinner and before God me being a sinner and before God I'm not a sinner neither are you cause we have a blood sacrifice laying there and God doesn't even see [Applause] us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not Sinners no more we are [Applause] Christian sister Bruce says but I've made so many mistakes and I fail so many times you know what we get wrong is when we try to present a super duper Christianity brother Braham said if you see super duper and everybody somebody has all the answers and is always right he says you get away from that person that's right amen she said I make so many mistakes I fail so many times that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be allotted to you so he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him sister Bruce says yes that's why he died so you could serve him your mistakes are not allotted to you see he is your perpetuation he is your sin offering your sins are not known Hallelujah hey this is a youth meeting but you other Elder ones should amen you should reply to that as well your sins are not known then why in the world would I bring yours up that's as if they could not be forgiven Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him sister Bruce says' but I've never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being Sister Bruce says yes that was your nature it changed once what changed it she goes Christ you see how God's leading her he's leading her to say what he he he has done I don't I don't have an experience I I can put my foot upon all right you was a nature once and now you're nature changed who did that she says Christ well wait a minute you just said isn't it amazing that God is getting her to look at herself the way he sees her and if I can accomplish one thing tonight one thing and that is for you to see yourself in the light of God's eye amenah oh my Satan is so good you know we live in an age of this everybody's recording everybody I got to ask you a question what do you do with those thousands and millions of videos on your phone have you made a library what do you do I mean what we're just fascinated please don't record me brother bam said he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and shall not come to judgment but hath passed hense pass from Death un Life John 5:24 see you're a Christian sister Bruce I've watched your life I've watched you under vision and I know you're a Christian I am your Shepherd as as it was Sister Bruce says yes I'm somebody to help see if there was any doubt in my mind and if I thought you was something wrong I'd tell you sister Bruce I believe that but if there's anything wrong in your experience anything wrong between you and God as far as I know anything about it sister Bruce there's not a thing there's not one thing oh you know the devil would speak to mind says you know he's telling he's not telling the truth he's lying he's lying it's what he does to you sister Bruce says of course I'm going to die unless God undertakes for the heart and she he says you're not going to die I don't think sister Bruce if it is it's hit from me he says she says thank you brother and he begins to pray dear God this little woman has constantly done good she has tried like Dorcas of old and she's getting this time of her heart is very bad but did not your word amen that we put our whole soul and mind and say that all things work together for good to them that loves you then it must be that you're working something we know nothing about it's all for the good for She Loves You you now to the great Shepherd over Saul the Lord Jesus Christ and in his name I lay my hands upon my sister may The God Who made her and brought her to this earth may his spirit that sealed her away from the things of the world notice

that there was no way out you're looking at somebody that was ready to take his life cuz he was so dark you look at someone was involved in spiritualism talking to the dead and everything that you could imagine that Wicked age of being a Hipp and so blind I didn't know where the light could be raised a Catholic never read the Bible had no hope no righteous know nothing but there was one little secret in my life my name was written yes a [Applause] book before the foundation of the world and I was so desperate I was in a great party alcohol and drugs and every foul Spirit you can think of men with men and women with women and and everything going on and they were ready to invite me in and pledge me and asked me if I would want to start the process of joining the Hell's Angel motorcycle gang and I remember that night I sat there and all of a sudden I just began to shake and I I I I got cold and and full of such fear I I got so cold that I went and turned the oven on I had this range and I opened the range and I turned the oven on and I sat on top of the stove trying to get warm you talk about desperate you talk about lost you talk about far away from God I remember I I walked out and I walked in the room and I fell down and I said God help me God help me I don't know what I am but I'm not this it's all I knew then I did the greatest thing that I've ever done in my life and this is the reason that so many of you you young people don't keep the Victory and I'm going to tell you this from years of experience whether you feel I'm wise or not it don't matter but I'll tell you the reason you lose your experiences you don't read your Bibles you get told Who You Are you believe it you're glad that it's away from you your past gets washed from you and you jump up and you have a great joy but you don't know how to keep going on and you have to feed to go on you're old enough to learn algebra you're old enough to learn geography they start teaching you foreign languages when you're in third grade you're old enough to read your Bible and you're old enough to listen to tapes it'll change you you know what changed me someone told me why don't you just read the Bible if you're so miserable I went and I open my bible to Romans chapter 1 and I started reading my life story right in front of my eyes I I begin to read what it said here it said and it says for this cause God gave them up to vile affections for even their women did change the natural use unto the use against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one towards another man with man working that which is unseemingly and received into thems a recompense of their Heir which was man and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient and being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness malice full of Envy murder debate deceit malignity and whisperings backbiters haters of God despisers proud boasters invention of evil things disobedient to Parents Without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affections in inflexible unmerciful who knowing that the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only doing the same but having pleasure in them that do them there I was that's who I was sitting with that's what I was surrounded with and then I went and ra read another verse and it was such a beautiful verse as I just kept reading down and it says it says oh despises thou The Riches of his goodness and his forebearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God leadth thee to repentance hallelujah it's the goodness of God that leads you to repentance you can't get around it as was a sinner I didn't want to be a sinner I was born in sin faap and iniquity come into the world speaking lies I didn't want to be the way I am but it was the forbearance and longsuffering of God that led me to repentance it was him and I'm thankful and that's what it is tonight I had to accept and Danny he'll tell you before he came out here I turned to him I said Danny the greatest thing that I believe exist and he'll say Amen to it is the seed of God's forgetfulness are you ready to throw your life in the sea of God's forgetfulness are you ready tonight to leave those things which are behind behind and not rejoice for a season but live for a life not to shout for a moment but to take the word of God and bury it in your heart yes not to have a religious experience but have a born again experience some of you hav't some of you don't but if you've never been giving your life to the Lord Jesus Christ and you'd like to come up here and you're not ashamed I wasn't ashamed I was there I was lost but when I saw that he offered me forgiveness I wasn't ashamed I wasn't ashamed to walk in front of them [Music] all I brought him Bibles I did everything I could I was so happy to be saved and if you haven't had that [Music] experience and God spoke to your heart tonight and you say I'd like to settle this forever I want to come up tonight and stand here
