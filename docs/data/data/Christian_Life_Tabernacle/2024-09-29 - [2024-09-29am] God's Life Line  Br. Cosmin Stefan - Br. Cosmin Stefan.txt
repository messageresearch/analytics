========================================

[Music] amen let's just bow our heads precious father Jesus and me savior Lord that name above all names the name that you chose to put life in so we can have the beauty to experience it in this world Lord what a privilege it is to be able to stand here this morning Lord I pray that your Holy Ghost would come and speak to our hearts this morning Lord not only to speak it Lord but may you be The Interpreter of the word Lord to the hearer Lord because you're no respector of persons your word will remain your word yesterday today and forever and it'll never change and so Lord we invite your presence this morning that you would come and dine with us Lord may you come and Lord just share the word that we've already have inside of us it's just a matter of discovering it Lord Jesus it's just a matter of knowing that it's there knowing that we can pull upon that word of God and it just brings life out of us Lord because you are life you are truth you are the way you are love and so Lord this morning we ask that you just put a special blessing Lord upon this church Lord upon the pastor upon everyone that's in this building that you would just fill us Lord with the love of God which is the very message of the hour we love you this morning Lord so many things that we can go and look back in our Liv life and see how you love us how you chose us how you elected us how you let us walk together Lord we just ask this in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seats for a few moments I promise the Lord this morning I'll speak my heart not that I haven't spoken my heart before but that I'll speak my heart so just bear with me and I I really want to take some time before I get started and thank every one of you you've been a family to me you've been u a body that I'd love to be in and um you know when you when you when you meet the same nature of Believers there's something together that clings you there's something together that man cannot describe man cannot explain but you know it's there you know it's the life of Jesus Christ and so I want to thank everyone of you that invited us over for dinners and lunches and all that you've done for us you you are truly the light and so just continue to feed on that that's the life of Jesus Christ is when we can serve one another when we can just love one another and so it was a privilege to be here I know we'll come and visit and uh I want to thank Brother David for being a mentor to me for being a pastor to me for being a really close friend of mine I know that we've we've went through times together and 12 years now since we've been in this church but I want to thank him I want to thank him for being there for me I love him very much amen and we know that it's the love of God that unites the Bride of Jesus Christ amen not man not man because God is not a respector of man but he's a respector of his word and his word has to be spoken and once your word is spoken that it has to be manifest if it's not manifested then it becomes impersonated if you impersonate it doesn't bring the life out of it it has to be lived for it to be able to speak what it is amen it is what it is so we just thank the Lord I I know that I have a lot of special friends so may God bless you I thank you once again from the bottom of my heart and uh pray for us we'll pray for you the battle's the same there just as it is here and so we just greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's just stand as we just open our word now amen let's just turn to Matthew 24:35 and then we'll go to 1 Corinthians chapter three Matthew 24:35 the scripture would say this way he says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words so remember it's words meaning more subjects meaning more but my words shall not pass away so Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words his promises all that he has ever spoken shall not pass away 1 Corinthians chap 3: 11 actually we can start from verse 9 and just read all the way through 11 we love the word this morning amen says for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry ye are God's Building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master master builder I have laid the foundation and another build it thereon but let every man take heed how he built it there upon verse 11 for other Foundation can no man lay that is that than that that is laid which is Jesus Christ Lord we ask your blessing upon this word may you feed us this morning in Jesus Christ's name amen just excuse me I I feel I feel like home so I'm just going to I'm just going to trust the Lord amen amen I'd like to speak this morning for a few for a few moments God's Lifeline God's lifeline and Luke 6 verse 43 to 49 I'm just going to build a little Foundation this was I pray that the Lord would interpret it to your ears as the Lord revealed it to me I I had a supernatural moment as the Lord was just showing this to me so I pray that God would reveal it to you the same way Luke 6:43 says this it says for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit for every tree is known by his own fruit for a thorn men do not gather figs this is a paradox nor a nor a Bramble Bush gather they grapes a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh verse 46 and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say and brother Bram says when he's Lord over something he has Dominion it means that he has he's your ownership he is your lord lord lord he owns you there's something that he did for you so you are no longer nobody else's but the Lord amen and it says and why do you call me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say who whosoever come cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them I will show you to whom he is like he is like a man which built that built a house and dig deep dig deep meaning we get all the roots out meaning we get all the trash out meaning we level the ground meaning that all of that it says and laid the foundation on the Rock and when the flood arose the stream be womenly upon the house upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock because it was founded upon a revelation and no man could build thereon because God has already built that Foundation but he that heareth and do it not is like a man that is without a foundation built a house upon the Earth now you can still build a house and it's on it's upon this Earth it's not upon the Revelation it's not upon the rock it's not upon the foundation that he's already built for you and you can build it upon the Earth against which the Sham did beat womenly and immediately it fell Heavens or n shall pass away and the ruin of the house was great Isaiah 59 verse 19- 21 I just like to read a few scripture and then and then we'll get into God's Lifeline think about this God's LIF line so shall they fear verse 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a blood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob sayeth the Lord verse 21 and as for me this is my Covenant to them with them saith the Lord now this is the word of God to you this is the word of God directly to to you my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not dep part out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seeds saith the Lord from henceforth and forever so now he has placed something inside of you that is already in you his spirit is inside of you his word is inside of you and it's in your mouth it's what you speak it's what you are and so from the beginning ever since mankind has fallen God has always provided a life line in the beginning when Abel and Cain were asked to worship one of them built a house upon the earth and the other one built a house upon a revelation and he grabbed a hold of the lifeline he grabbed a hold of knowing what the Revelation was because he knew that he took a blood an innocent life for him to continue to live he knew that the Revelation might have been messy he knew that the way that it was done it was such a mess but they took an innocent life to redeem that back for him to be able to have Grace for him to be able to know what it's like to die no animal has been killed and had that could you imagine have has anybody killed the chicken I when we when we were in Romania you know back in the day my dad and mom would go to the grocery store which was the farmers's market and so you you picked up your life chicken you know it wasn't it wasn't Frozen and put in the fridge you you said I want that one and so you would bring it home it would be stringed around its feet and you know that way it wouldn't be able to run and and they would just sitting in the front yard and my mom's like hey we need we need that chicken cut said okay it's you know to to kill a to kill a life it doesn't bring it doesn't bring a a a good feeling you you it something happens there's Mercy there for that individual there's Mercy there for even for that little a chicken even though you know that it's the actual thing feeding you when you when you commit that act when that happens there's something that out of a man just starts feeling that nature of of of of mercy and so Abel was able to catch that Revelation But realize this there's always time that people regardless of the condition they were always able to overcome because there was a Lifeline that was given for them to hold on to too and here comes the generation through Abraham and here comes the generation through Isaac and here comes the generation through Jacob and here comes the generation going through Joseph and now God has created a people and now God has created a bride I can say but every time that God had gave him something to hold on to as soon as that went off the scene as a prophet or as a judge you guys remember they would all always go back the other way they will always go back to building false gods they would always be going back to a tradition instead of holding on to the very line to the very life that was given in that day here comes Moses and he brings him the word and they're traveling and after a while they go off off and here comes judges and again God gives them a judge and as soon as the judge gets off the scene here they are to travel again and here they are back into the tradition but God always gave them a word in the day that they were living in because they knew how to recognize him and brother Braham says to receive the Holy Ghost to know you have the Holy Ghost is to receive the word for your day the word for your day identifies the Holy Ghost Inside of You the word for your day identifies the character of God Amen it identifies the character of God in the age that you're living in I can't go back and live in the days of Moses that's there as a testimony that's there as a living word that I can grab a hold of and put that word today to take me out of an exodus and bring me over into a Promised Land brother Brandon would say this so keep that in mind God's Lifeline there's always a Lifeline there's always something that you can grab a hold of there's always a word that God had left for you to grab a hold of and regardless of the condition during the time that you're living and God will bring it to pass right and this word is not a word that's been given to you today this word is a word that has been predestinated before the foundation of the world because he had placed you in this place to be able to believe the very word that was for this age and the word of the hour produces a Rapture the word of the hour produces a change the word of the hour produces salvation the word of the hour produces healing the word of the hour produces a resurrection there's no other word because it has to come through the mouth of a prophet brother Bram says and things that are to be it says I believe that God in the beginning that Noah was the word for that day for his message now Along come after that come Moses now Moses could not have taken Noah's word he could not build a ship and Flo them out of Egypt now think about that Moses couldn't build a ship amen because the ship has already been built the flood has already happened he could did not build a ship and Flo them out of Egypt down the Nile River or to the promised land and so forth his message didn't work in Noah's day that was the part of God's word that was Vindicated to be the truth by Moses neither could Jesus have had Moses's word neither could Luther could have not maintained the word of the C Catholic church now think about that because Luther was given a word Wesley was given a word p Pentecost was given a word Wesley could not maintain Luther's word and the Pentecostal listen they could not take the Methodist word the church is growing each age it's LED in the scripture here so God through the Holy Spirit reveals his word by manifesting it and vindicating it himself himself showing that it's his word being brought to pass in the day that it's promised Jesus said he says if you can't believe me believe the works that I do for they testify who he was if anyone could have known the scripture now think about that if the Pharisees and the Sadducees would have known the scripture and it wouldn't have been a tradition they would have recognized the Son of God but for them thinking that by obeying the law by traditionalized their life they put a period to the word of God instead of a comma like the like the prophet would say all of a sudden it became legalism and because of legalism they missed the very word being manifested it says now he comes so oddly so strange that the people didn't want to believe him because he being a man was making himself God so he was God in form and God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself so think about that as he was living on this Earth Earth God that was in Jesus Christ he was reconciling the word the world into himself because it was that life now that was able to carry you through whatever age that you were predestinated to be in so you can be an overcomer because it's not you that does the work I I uh we were Fellowship in in the morning study and brother Matthew was just sharing something that another preacher was saying he says God don't need workers he doesn't need workers he needs vessels so he can work through them he doesn't need tradition you can do things out of tradition but when the word of God speaks to your heart you obey it and to do it because that is the life of Jesus Christ when a father speaks to a son son a son obeys the father and he becomes faithful he becomes pleasing unto his Lord he says and no man can do these Works without God be with him and as we know Nicodemus said that and the hrin uh hrin believed that it says now we know that he says if they would have known the word he said you would have known Moses you would have known me because Moses wrote Of Me So what had happened now is is even though there was law it was now magnified it was still the same word but now it was magnified because Moses wrote of me and we look if they had looked back in the scripture when see say see what the Messiah was supposed to do then they would have known him by Vindication that God through Christ was reconciling the world to himself and bring to pass all the promises that was to be that was of the Messiah he was to do Jesus bore record of that word hallelujah how could you bear record of God's word a record has to be known a record has to be seen it says making the word live for that day and I believe it's the same thing that we live in today God bearing record of his word by vindicating what he has said he would do now we know that in this last day now listen to this and we know that this is the day of salvation where God is calling men from the world from a life of sin unto a life of service God is calling our life from a life of sin from a life of tradition from a life that we can create with our own atmosphere into a life of service a life of service for him and in the that God has poured out his Spirit from on high it says great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day it says the when the former and latter rain are falling together and we know that there's supposed to be great signs and wonders which is many it says which in many great denominations this is turned down now think about this because God is is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so God had always left the part of himself Jesus Christ was the fullness of the Gospel but he had always left a part of himself for his bride to grab a hold of and be changed to the promise of that age in the days of Moses the promise was is they're going to come out of an age of slavery out of Egypt into a promised land and the pro the prophet would the prophet would take this and he would say he says Egypt represents a church the promised land represents the bride and here comes a bride out of a church because it's the promised land it's the life of Jesus Christ how many remember the the story of the shunamite woman it really impressed me that was reading it just the way that the Lord just describes it in there Here Comes Elisha the prophet and he's traveling towards I believe isuna shuna the name of the town and he's coming through he was he was traveling through and this woman she notices that he keeps coming through and he's a man of God and she stops him one day and she's offering him a meal he sat down and he ate bread and I believe he had a servant his name was GES gesi gazi uh and she was older in age she was married now think about this this is powerful because God is a respector of his word she was able to grab a hold of something that not only not only did it bless her but it actually brought a resurrection it actually brought life because she recognized the word of God that's because she knew what was inside the man of God she knew that the word that was inside of that Prophet was her very Hope was her very life so here she comes and she's serving the prophet and all of a sudden because the scripture says that because he's been traveling so much actually as a matter of fact she actually built him room and now he would always come and he would sit inside the room and he would sleep there she put a bed she put a bed and she put she put bread and she put food in there and he would come through and he would stay there and when the prophet had noticed the love of this woman there was something inside the prophet that would say GES go get her and i' would like to find out what she has a need of and she said she said she said GES I tell her well you know she she's she's older an age she can't bear children and you know she has a husband and all of a sudden he tells her around this time next year you shall conceive and have a son now her directly response is like oh Lord he says don't don't lie to me she was she was almost too shocked to believe the promise that was given to her she was was too shock how can this happen to me you're telling me that after so much time you're going to be able to give me a son around this time next year you will have a son because the word had been spoken amen and she was able to pull she was able to hold down to this lifeline and because she believed the very promise had come to pass now think about this later down as she's as she's going through life I believe he's a young teenager now 11 12 years old the Bible says and and and he plays outside and he knocks his head and the mother pull she holds him on his lap the I believe the scripture says up until about the the hour of noon noon hour and he passes away now this whole time she's been serving the Prophet this whole time she knew that there was a man of God that was able to to come through her home that was able she was able to recognize the life of Jesus Christ the life of a prophet the life that was given to that Elisha amen and she was able to see that something was different and you know um she has a design on her heart she says I want to go see that Prophet I'd like to go see that Prophet I'd like to have that prophet do something for me I I the very blessing the very promise that he has given me I know that that same Prophet that was able to give me that promise of Life the same Prophet could do something for me where could bring me out of this condition and give me a restoration of Life there had to be a faith inside of her to know that when she was going to reach that word that something would be able to do something would be able to do for her that man couldn't do and so the prophet sends gesi and says oh get well get get my staff and put my staff upon his face she said no she wanted him to come and so here comes Elisha the prophet the scripture says that he he would go in the room and he shut the door he left them out actually the the kid the the the the young boy was sitting directly on the prophet's bed she placed them in that room and the prophet started praying he wanted to find out the will of God he wanted to find out of this he says the Lord hasn't shown me but I believe I'm going to pray so he's inside that room and he's praying and and and as he's praying he not only does he pray for him but he puts his he puts his whole body on top of his body he says the mouth was upon his mouth the nose was upon his nose his eyes were upon his eyes his hands he was covering the whole body the whole word was upon that that child every bit of that word was upon that child upon his mouth upon his nose upon his eyes upon his arms and he was covered with all of this and before you knew it God had restored life God had restored life in this dead boy why because he's a respector of the word amen amen could you imagine could you [Music] imagine how the shite was was rejoicing in that moment when she knew that the very same word I gave her the promise was the very same word that took her out of the condition she was in in that moment all she had to do is trust in the word all she had to do is trust in what God Said not try to figure it out not try to put one and one together not try to place this here I love how even Brother David has talked about the puzzle sometimes we'd like to take the puzzle from here and jam it in here because we think it creates a picture and before you know it it may create a picture but it's something that you can't see because it puts a veil over your face that you're able to just you're you're confused you're looking at a picture you're like oh what is that the foot shouldn't be there the uh why is the foot where the nose is and and why why is the tail where the eyes are it do make sense but when you trust the Holy Spirit and you have him put the ples in your life the right way by Revelation now you're able to see the foundation that Jesus Christ was built on the prophet would say this in trying to do God's a service with with it being without being at God's will I believe it's paragraph 60 it says now but God has his word set and has in all ages he for knowledge has caused him to set in the church and in the people it says certain things that he did from the beginning and then the gospel that's being preached to that age is only revealed to that certain people the rest of them don't see it it says thank thee father thou Hast hid these things from the eyes of the wise and The Prudent and had revealed it to babes such as would learn it says that's predestination not that he did it by you say I'll choose you and I'll and I don't choose you it says by his forn knowledge he knowed what you would do and by him being infinite do you believe his infinite it says if he isn't he can't be God then you think being infinite he knew every flea that would ever be on the earth oh my a god of detail how many times them fleas will be their eyes how much tal was in each flea every blade of grass that he would be set on it says that's infinite we are finite we stumble in darkness God likened us unto sheep and we must have a leader and that leader is not man that leader is the Holy Ghost the spirit of Christ Among Us praise God it says a little while and the world seeth me no more his physical being was raised up through it says he his physical being was raised up to the throne of God where the spirit was on the throne now Christ is on the throne Jesus it says a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall it says yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you to the end of the world even in you it says the Throne of God of Christ is erected in your heart the Throne of God of Christ is erected in your heart and the prophet would say that the nature of a soul is the nature of a man because that's where the seed grows that's where you know the character of God is in that soul and that nature of a soul and it says it says and he's sitting on God's throne but in the Millennium he sits on his own Throne which he swore that he'd raised up it says this man his son David's son to sit on his throne how it says now verse paragraph 6 next paragraph it says now he reveals these things by his forn knowledge to those who he who he has ordained to these things otherwise they don't see it standing right here looking right at it he can't see it how many has ever seen that picture of a cow in the bush that you just have to look and look did you ever see that or seen the picture of Christ in the bush or in the sky or clouds Hallelujah seen the picture of Christ in the bush in the sky or in the clouds I believe we've seen that this day that painter has got that so fixed up till you have till you have to look at it a certain way it says well then when you once see it you can't see nothing else but that Hallelujah once you see the picture of Jesus Christ you no longer look in confusion and all of a sudden you see the image that was there from the beginning because God wanted to have sons and daughters of God but sin had entered in and perverted the Flesh and God now brought restoration and every time you look there it is it says well that's the way Christ is himself the gospel the message is when you once see the message of the hour there's nothing else you can see but that Hallelujah the message of the hour Saints is Jesus Christ the message of the Y is the restoration of that God had now coming down uniting the bride and himself do doing the same thing doing the same Works expressing the same nature it says that's all everything else is gone and the rest of it just a filter once you see the message Hallelujah so this message is not a Doctrine this message is not just a law this message is not just something that you can think you can just you can just float with something that you can just stag along whenever you want no this message is life and I want to tell you this morning that this message is the lifeline of Jesus Christ today because Jesus Christ had opened the seals and restored you back to the beginning don't sell yourself short Saints because this word came to identify you unto you I send the spirit of Elijah not to somebody else amen unto you because you are the elect of bride you are the predestinated for this hour and this message takes the veil of tradition off our face to see the foundation of Jesus Christ Hallelujah otherwise we might as well go back to being Pentecostals I'm sorry cuz at least they shout and they jump and they run around and they have fun but let me tell you something when this life is resurrected when this life now that Jesus Christ has restored Us in you it brings a pure worship and it creates the presence that we live under hallelujah it's not you it's the anointed word upon you so you got to water it so it grows you got to water it so it grows Let the Rain Fall upon you but know that it's not what we can do it's not what I can prove it's not what I can show but that the life of the word would now be lived in a vessel in a bride that was meant to express it genuinely yes sir because it's part of you you just got to have a discovery you got to figure out what this Foundation is you got to figure out what this what all of this talk is all about what are we talking about it is what it is it is what it is you just got to believe it it may be a paradox but you got to believe it and the prophet would say you know a lot of people in the days when the angel of the Lord came in the people in the time where the Death Angel The the death angel was passing by he said everybody had heard that the danger was passing and everybody everybody might have known the law but the the the issue was for some was the application they knew that the blood needed to be applied but not all of them applied it and so the prophet would say you can believe upon the word of God all you want you can say you believe the word you can tell me you believe the word and I believe you that you believe the word because you convinced me that you believe the word but unless you apply the word unless you apply the blood of Jesus Christ then when that Death Angel what's going to happen when you have the blood when you have the token when you have the revelation of Jesus Christ he'll pass over you and it doesn't matter about the condition it doesn't matter about the condition I want to tell you there's I mean could you imagine could you imagine uh you know the Bride of Jesus Christ being able to stand in the midst of God of of the of of the devil's Eden now think about this because she's white she's pure she's an adulterated she's the pure word of God and everything else around her is so dark and so and and so perverted that she's the very light that exposes the darkness unless you have light in the darkness you don't know there's Darkness walk into a dark room and try try to watch see something without light you be you you walk you I'll be walking in this piano or I'll be falling down the stairs but when there's light it identifies what the darkness is and that light is the life of men 1 John chapter 4 it says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye this is something that's given to you that you already know all right think about this you already know it it's just a matter of discovering it or finding it inside of you so you can you can receive it it says hereby ye he says hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confessed that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God now I want to bring you present tense because because a prophet had come on the scene because a pillar of fire has been identified because a cloud has been shown now we know that whosoever every spirit that confessed that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God so the Bride of Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ in the flesh of God Jesus Christ in the flesh of God the Bride of Jesus Christ is the Flesh of Jesus Christ and the God Amen it says and every spirit that God every spirit that confess that not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is the spirit of antich Christ whereof you know ye have heard that it should come and even now is already into the world ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so don't sell yourself short because all you have to do is grab a hold of that lifeline and once you grab a hold of that Lifeline Everything Changes your nature changes your desire changes your thinking changes your own selfishness changes you stop lying you don't have to worry about doing it on your own all you got to do is just grab a hold of it and you see it working because it's the very message of the hour that changes your condition from something perverted to something righteous it's to come and restore it's to come and restore faith in what faith in what just to say we're Christians just to say everybody in the world says they're Christians I've met people that that genuinely believe that they're Christians and they are Christians with the ability that they're able to serve God but I tell you this there's nothing else other than this message to provide such a sweet and holy life I love this message with all my heart I want to live it I want to eat it I want to breathe it I want to listen to it every hour that I can because in the spa in the time that we go through it's the very voice of Rescue It rescues you out of the condition you're in my condition may be different than your condition because life is life but just know that there's a storehouse that has been stored up for you so in whatever condition you're in God can bring it to pass in your life life praise God we should be thankful to have that Lifeline a Lifeline that creates or I can say that performs or proves Resurrection amen I've seen it and I believe it the prophet would say this and I have heard but now I see when the true genuine Vindication of the scripture of this last day message and you see the presence of Jesus Christ that you had heard what he done in his life and here the scripture say he's the same yesterday today and forever and just before the Sodom condition is fired over with the wrath of God see Jesus returned amongst his people formed in human flesh and do the same things he done it ought to strike our souls to Glory Hallelujah that's right it ought to do something for us why listen it's dropping on that it's dropping on the seed it's dropping on on the soul it says you heard in the Bible what he did when the woman touched His Garment he turned around and told her what her trouble was and her faith was made whole and he promised to do the same thing again just before the world would be burnt and the world would be in a Sodom condition now let me tell you this you know where Jesus Christ was walking when the woman with the blood issue was touching His Garment he was going on his way to Jar's daughter to perform a resurrection and because he was on a road walking to perform a resurrection that's right and and this I I this was amazing how I caught this but he the Bible says that Jar's daughter was 12 years old and the woman had an issue in her body for 12 years and because she heard a message of the hour was true because she heard something was different behind behind this man because she she because she heard she had to hear something something had to attract her to that word of God a word can be a word unless it's being unless it's being interpreted God and God interprets his word word how by bringing it to pass so he interprets his word by bringing it to to pass into who into you so Jesus Christ is walking walking on his way to her Resurrection because a servant had asked him to go pray for his daughter and this woman having a blood issue she wasn't cleansed imagine she spent all her wealth everything she had she spent it on this condition she probably went to the doctor she probably went to you know I'm sure back then they might have had you know other type of hospitals not the hospitals we have today but whatever Medics that they were able to to to do for her with plants and and you know oil natural stuff whatever if could she spent all her money to get away from this condition that she was in and nothing helped but she heard that there was a man that was walking through the streets of Galilee that was walking through the streets of Samaria that was he was hearing the testimony he says man there's this man around the block that all of a sudden just saved the woman there's this man that went to a wedding supper and all of a sudden he was asked to take the water and turn it into wine and all of a sudden this happened oh Hallelujah I got to get I got to I got to find out what I can do so I can go touch the lifeline it was her only hope it was all that she needed to do it's all this is the last resource I done everything that I can I've tried to live a Christian Life this many years as much as I can and something's still not working somehow I'm still battling somehow I still struggle sometimes I still make mistakes sometimes I get stubborn sometimes I catch myself lying when I shouldn't be lying because actually my lie sounds worse than my truth but I want to tell you this morning when you grab a hold of the lifeline Everything Changes because that voice that word changes a a person from immort from mortality to immortality and now you no longer live the way you want to live but now there's this life that's able to live through you inside of you and for others around you how how can a light be shown unless it's exposed in front of Darkness praise God it says the New Testament the prophet so before the world could be burnt and the world would be it says and the world would be in a Sodom condition the New Testament the prophet I love this the god Prophet the prophet of prophets Hallelujah the God of all the prophets the fullness of the godhead bodily God manifested In the Flesh the creator of Genesis hallelujah it's his word and he said it would happen and we see Sodom condition we see the world it says we see the world in that condition now we see him come down and do exactly what he he said he will do so I'm here to preach to you this morning that regardless of of the condition that's around you regardless of hard the how how dark the conditions in outside of you and in in your atmosphere around you I want to tell you that there's a light There's A Life That's able to carry you through that Darkness because he was predestinated for you to overcome in that time not my not not by tradition but by the token yes by applying the very word of God it says now we've heard of him now we see him I've heard of you with my ears now I he I see you Hallelujah it says I've heard of you with my ears now I see you with my eyes amen I see him with my own eyes what an hour it should be what a time it should be the confirm of his word when the word is confirmed that's God speaking in his word making himself visible that you can see vindicating it so that way he's visible so you can see unless you know what it's like to be blind you you have no idea what it's like to see you got to recognize your blind condition first before you can recognize and say you can see if I keep saying I see and I'm blind I'm fooling myself you you think you you think that there something that we can hide away from the Lord do you think that you can hide anything away from the Lord you might hide it from you know the people around you but over time time it'll show itself it won't carry you through I love brother Tommy's testimony this morning he touched the the word line Hallelujah he touched the lifeline and he changed his condition from a sick man to a healed man amen because he was able to Touch the Hem of His word amen praise God listen to what the prophet says here and Christ is the mystery of God revealed we'll we'll we'll try to wind down shortly I amen it says well you say now wait a minute brother brandham you're talking about the Old Testament he's the same this is I believe paragraph 191 Christ is the mystery of God revealed he's the same yesterday today and forever listen I love this it's the full revelation of God if that strike you it's the full revelation of God if God ever says anything he can never change it he always magnifies it not change it the law was magnified not changed whosoever commits adultery shall be guilty of death but whosoever now now magnified look it upon the woman to lust after her after her it says he never changed the Commandment he magnified it amen remember the Sabbath day keep it holy one day in a week now he magnified it the rest comes from keeping the spirit of God precept upon precept line upon online here a little there a little hold fast to that what's good for with stammer and lips and with other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the rest that's the refreshing from the presence of the Lord hallelujah if you want to be refreshed in a presence be refreshed in the presence of the Lord because you know that's the lifegiver he's the only source of life and yet they would not hear it and waged their heads and walked away with their denominations this is the refreshening it says magnify the Sabbath day to you sabbatarians and so forth Oh my he don't change it he magnifies it it says paragraph 192 now you can see now the end time message why it's rejected do you see why the end time message is now rejected can you it says now no denomination but the revelation of his mystery no denomination the Revelation so it's not it's not something that I could come up with and and build around me from these works of man right like all of these things I could get myself busy and all of a sudden I've created a tradition around me I go to work I come home I do this I come back I do my grocery shopping here and here's my world and this is my world this is my world there's nothing else that goes outside my world the world that I live in is a world of appointments I'm I got to be here I got to be here and all of a sudden here's God speaking to us here's God revealing his word to us and we're built we're we're controlled by this world around me and I cannot hear or catch the revelation of this mystery as he's walking with me because remember God is an evolutionist he always he always unfolds himself as time passes his word becomes he's always Eternal so as the condition grows the Revelation grows as life unfolds Revelation lives because it's always the it's always the present tense word of God it says it says now you see the end time message why it's rejected can you it says no no denom no denomination but the revelation of his mystery it says God's not known by denomination he's known by revelation God in his body Christ and Christ in his body the bride it says God manifest in Christ Christ was it says Christ made man manest in the bride and as God took from the body of Adam the woman and she fell then God has took from the body of Christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bride out that won't fall by the denominational Creed it says no sir but she's coming back with the pure unadulterated word God being manifested so I want to tell you this what went into the ground at the day of Pentecost when Jesus Christ went to the burial he went to the Grave he he he overcome hell death and the grave and when he resurrected remember there was a time that he spent with his disciples upon the Earth and he was bones and flesh he ate with them and he was teaching them about the kingdom of God there was 40 days and 40 nights that Jesus Christ lived in his resurrected form in that time and it was in that time that he gave them the promise to go stand in the upper room and receive that very same spirit that was the promise just like Abraham had noticed the angel melkisedek and you knew exactly what that image would be like he seen himself in that theophany he knew that over time by belie beling upon the word of God that he would come to the same image the pure unadulterated word being being manifested I hope every man that hears this tape and every woman will understand that see she's the second Eve but she's not breaking and spoiling her skirts of Purity and Hol Holiness to her husband amen I'm going to read that again but she's not breaking and spoiling her skirt and Purity and Holiness to her husband she'll stay with the word regardless of what anybody else says hallelujah it says you can have all your e ecumenical moves you want and all the affiliations and they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon to shut up all the churches you see that and churches like this who's not denomination though use them for storehouses then and if any man goes and offer a prayer or for anybody else that don't belong to this ecumenical movement will be shot on the spot it says it's already the Lutheran the the Lutheran Minister the head of it said so it's right here you can read right in your magazines don't make any difference what they say the church will stand true in this light Hallelujah because she's been given a life Lifeline she's already proved it back Yonder and she'll do it again in the face of everything Hallelujah people are going to come to a day where they're not going to have faith and I'm not talking about people in your in our circle of of believing children but people around you could you imagine could you imagine how the minority now that's influencing all of the these other movements that goes around this world how they're controlling how things are coming to pass pass this law pass this law pass this law and really if you think about it it's only maybe like 1% of them but because they're influenced the people around them start walking into that and before you know it but I want to tell you this regardless of what anybody says regardless of what comes around she will stand true in this light she's already proved it back Yonder she's going to be there without spot or wrinkle at the end of that paragraph it says right she'll stand there it says notice God manifested himself in his body Christ do you see that three-fold beautiful thing it says Christ and his body the church vindicating his promised word like God did through Christ who can condemn me of sin if I do not the works of the father then then where have I failed now you Fells that say you are doing it you denominations you show me show me where I failed to be the Messiah show where I failed not one sign that God said the Messiah would do and I haven't fulfilled it he said see God and his body now that that that struck me could you imagine the testimony that we have to carry around of how our life should be such an example that people would be able to look upon you like man you don't you you're just different something's different about you you're no longer the same person I've known all of a sudden all of a sudden there's something inside of you that longs for that and you recognize that it was the hand of God that you you once used to get mad and all of a sudden God just changed that nature and brought the nature you're like oh well any everybody can say anything they want some it's like have you ever have you ever known somebody that's numb you can inject them with all that you want because he's numb and brother Ram says that once you get inoculated with the Holy Ghost nothing else can change you because now you've been sealed until the day of your Redemption what we have to do is try to grieve and not try to keep the seal so that way we can it could take us all the way to the destination it says now Christ The Works that I do you should do also see the works that I do you should do also Al more than this for I go unto the Father the church will be a little longer in life see vindicating his promised word as God did in his promises in Christ's body so is Christ doing the same Works in Christ body the church making his mystery known to his bride tree in the last day bringing forth the fruit that was in the tree at the beginning restoring us right back to the tree that was right back into the beginning because that was the tree of life that was the lifeline that God had placed so we could always be there and touch it as long as we moved away from that tree of life and went to the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it created Darkness it brought you in deception it told you something that you shouldn't have been but all of a sudden here becomes the tree of life and identifies you it tells you your name it tells you your address it tells you who you are it tells you where you come from it tells you where you're going it tells you you've been elected it tells you you've never done that in the first place it tells you to do good it gives you life it gives you healing it gives you everything you have need of all you have to go is go eat all you have to do is go eat of the fruits and when you eat of the fruit you become the fruit because how can a good tree bring forth corrupt fruit when the seed goes into the ground it brings the same life right back out of the ground we're we're we're we're closing I I just like to read this paragraph in Fellowship 1956 listen to what the prophet says it says the greatest Miracle ever performed when God can take anything and convert it and bring it back to itself again just the same as you can take an animal by science and drop a little drop of water on top of a hog and make it a lamb now that's the miracle of it change his whole nature his appetites his attitudes everything that's what God does when he saves a man from sin he changes his entire makeup so greater Miracle than any part of Divine Healing that I've ever seen and I by the grace of God I've seen pretty near everything that could ever think of or hear of done by our Lord Jesus Christ even raising the dead after they're gone and still I think that salvation is the greatest miracle Hallelujah if you're looking for a miracle you're the miracle if you're looking for a miracle you can testify today to the devil that you are the miracle of God that has brought you in this place to manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you can get healed today and tomorrow you catch another sickness but when you know your salvation when you know who you are when you know that you're the greatest Miracle when you grab a hold of this Lifeline everything else dies and this lives the greatest Miracle oh Lord I can only imagine what the prophet had seen can you imagine what the prophet had seen and he has done and the greatest Miracle ever that has ever hit the planet Earth is how God Saves man people can't figure it out I want you to go type me a science project on how you become a Christian cuz I'm going to tell you right now it's just educational there's no way you can describe it it's a paradox it's a paradox how can you take a hog and put a drop of water upon him and in a moment of twinkling of an eye he becomes a lamb Hallelujah because it changes your nature a pig used to go eat all the nasty stuff in the world and all of a sudden here comes the water the rain it hits you and the Miracle of is that now you're a lamb and the prophecies just like it was in the beginning where the lamb and the dove can have Fellowship listen to what the prophet says I'm I'm closing soon I just have one more it says the invisible Union of the bride of Christ 1965 it says brother let's get all things ready for one of these days the fire is going to fall we're going up now let's get ready for the fire falling time we're in the last days we all know that we're ready for the coming of the Lord the thing is listen this is this this this is amazing the thing to do is to separate yourself from all sin separate yourself don't when you think about Sin don't think about the attributes of sin it's brother Braham clearly teaches that sin is unbelief so when you're an unbelief that means you're not in the word of God but when you're in the word of God and God blesses you with Revelation now you're walking into something else now you're out of sin separate yourself from anything that pertains to the world don't love the world or the things of the world it says let no man by his Creed deceive you you stay right straight in the promise of God the word of God and that word if it's a word for this day God vindicates his soul if he doesn't it's not the word for this day the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride the going home time of the Bride it says we got something different Saints we got something different this is something different this is not not just something that man teaches this is the life of Jesus Christ restored back to into into the bright form it says the Pentecostal represented that again we're in the bride age no more than the word of Noah would have worked in the days of Moses no more than Moses's law would have worked in the time of Paul here where he tried to tell them you are dead to that you you cannot have that church you who I'm speaking to it says tonight Across the Nation if you've separated yourself from denomination and all the filth and things of this world and all those things that keep you in a man-made Creed and orders and things like that you separated yourself look up get ready the fire is going to fall one of these days God is going to let him come God is going to let him come and a sight to behold would you be ready when he comes would you be ready to go up with him when the when he comes it says the secret Rapture of the supernatural bride man can't figure this out it's a secret Rapture of the supernatural bride and she's the only one that knows it she'll be made from Mortal to immortality should be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and it says we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or the prophet would take that and say or hinder them which are asleep but a real this is modern EV modern events made clear by prophecy but the real ordain of God paragraph 63 it says the real ordain of God if the musicians can come the real Gene it says but the real ordain of God the real Gene you know I was looking at I was looking at this word as Gene what's Gene you know the word regeneration has Gene inside of it so when you're regenerated you regenerated back to a gene that was already in the beginning you the real Gene that real germ a soul of God a soul listen a soul of God that was in God before the found of the world remember you that's really got the spirit of God in you tonight you were with Christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself do you believe that look he was in Christ then if you were in God a gene a word an attribute from the beginning then you walked with him here on the earth you talked with him on the earth you suffered with him on the earth could you imagine he suffered so you know what it's like to suffer with him that's the promised word don't be sad that he's going to leave but he'll come again and he'll be your comforter he'll be your leader he'll carry you through those times and says you died with him at Calvary and you Rose with him again hallelujah it's already a done work that's right Hallelujah because there was a word that identified you and you Rose with him again and now you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus communing with him the word as he feeds into your soul it says that man shall live by every wor that proceedeth now that's the only way that a man can live is if he feeds on the very Mana of the message of the hour of the actual word of the hour revealed inside of you so you can receive the life of Jesus Christ I'm closing if they can play something softly I was shocked by I've heard this story before but when I heard it this time it did something to me if you remember Hurricane Mountain the prophet if you remember the story he's on his honeymoon he went up to take Ma and his son I believe Billy were up there and he had a friend he he gave him the cabin for a few days so he can spend a few days there before his friend was going to come up and they were going to try to hunt together and and just have some time and the prophet wanted to go hunt and he left his wife and he left his his um his son up there he came to huntting and you know he he was I believe close to Canada I don't remember the exact location and he went to go hunting and he catches a deer he HS the deer on the tree now you know the prophet's been in the woods a long time he lived in the woods he knew all the he knew he that was his life that's exactly where he was finding his peace is it was it was a way of rescue for him it was a way where he would go out and spend could you I mean I could only imagine the life the prophet's life and all of the things that he was pulled towards and all of the serving that this Prophet had ever done I don't know I I I you know I I love this message and I know the life that was given for this message was a hard life that the prophet had went through but he did it because he loved the bride he live he did it because there was some somebody here this morning that would touch the hymn that would touch that word line and the prophet he he knew he knew the woods he was confident and he he notices that there's there's a storm coming he notices that there's uh there's some clouds coming this is midday I believe 2 3 o' in the afternoon and it says I'm going to start getting back I I've seen these storms before I've I've went through these things before he says I I I could I can stay it out I can I can camp it out you know I I can I can put my tent and I can try to Camp it out for a few days but it says I can't do that because I know that there's somebody else waitting I mean M has never been in the woods she doesn't even know what it's like to make a fire she doesn't even know what you know this is probably I I believe maybe her first time I um and uh within timing the prophet starts moving towards home or what he would call home at that time he was wanting to go up to the upper cabin and so he goes through and all of a sudden he's walking now his time piece was you know where he hung the deer because he he would be able to sell he would be able to smell the blood he would be able to see the scene and so he goes through he comes around he's like man I I made a wrong turn here it is again and uh he says okay maybe if it's not this way now could you imagine not being able to know where you're going he was looking for something specific he knew where he was at he was trying to get to something that was there that he can grab a hold of because he knew that one day he worked with his buddy and he had brought some sort of telephone line he knew where he was wanting to go the problem is is trying to get there and so he was walking and he was walking and he comes right back to the same spot and he does it again again and it's getting darker [Music] now I could only imagine could you imagine thinking that you might know the way and here you are traveling and you're coming right back to the same spot actually the prophet would say that a a an Indian would call that the the the death walk you know an Indian would call because you're you're thinking you're going the right way but it's bringing you right back to where you came from it's bringing you right back to where you came from it's bringing you right back it's like man you you never find your way and so the prophet breaks down and he says Lord I'm lost I'm lost I might have thought I've known the way even though I know the woods even though I've experienced the woods and I've been through the woods and I've seen hunting and I've and I've I've done all these things Lord I'm lost I need your help in this moment I can't wait I can't cannot make my way back to where that was I couldn't I've tried I've tried I've went around I've went around and I'm coming right back I'm lost he says Lord help me he gets up and he says there was it says just along there I heard something say I am the Lord a very present help in a time of [Music] trouble he said I am the Lord a very present help in the time of trouble and it said that three or four times how important it is to move the world around me out and to be able to hear his voice and cling to that word that would be able to take me out of that trouble and after a while I stopped and I thought either I'm beside myself or almighty God has got mercy upon me and I knelled down and set my gun and I said God I confessed I'm lost it says I I he says I said I'm completely turned around that's no way said I've done got excited you see there's no way for me at all to ever find my way out I don't deserve to live but my wife and baby does so help me to get to them so that they won't die in the woods I said I don't deserve to live but they do oh Hallelujah could you imagine that same action in Jesus Christ I don't desire to live but they do Lord let let me be perfect so they can be perfect like me I sacrificed my life I sold my life away so they can have a life more abundantly and I said if you'll just help me I'll be very thankful to you oh what an attitude he gets up and I started like this and at once I felt something go a hand I thought who is that and I looked up and just in time I looked back and enough fog cleared away till I seen the top of Hurricane Mountain and they were camped just below Hurricane Mountain so the prophet was able to receive Grace where now he was able to see the direction that he was supposed to go [Music] the sun had moved the clouds away the sun had moved the storm away and all it took is One Moment In the son in the presence of the son so she or he can see the direction where he needs to go because he was going the wrong way the whole time and he thought he was going the right way but all of a sudden God shined his very light upon the situation and his very word gave him access to know where he's [Music] going and it says brother along and done pitch black here here he is now he's seen where he's going and it says along and done pitch black dark you know and I've been walking about an hour in the darkness in my hand and my hand to hit that wire I felt it and I bowed my head and started crying and you know I thought Lord right at the end of this line wa my wife and everything see I thought that's right and I stood there and held my head on down and thank him for it I thought yes Lord I got my hand in yours it is it it's a current line right there right at the end of this line I'm holding now in my heart hold it says right at the end of the line that I'm holding now in my heart holds everything that is dear to me see all my loved ones it says my Lord my savior all that's dear to me lays at the end of this line so the prophet's walking if we can just stand the prophet's walking and all of a sudden he hits this line This is the line that he knows that would take him to the top of the cabin where his wife and his child was and the prophet would say he says as soon as I got a hold of that line I was not going to let go I was holding my gun in one arm and I was holding this power line or this telephone line in my other hand and as soon as this hand would get so tired and weary I would change and I would grab it with this hand and hold my gun with this other one but I was not going to let go of this line because I knew at the end of it I would know that that's my destination where I got to go if a tree was to come around that would go right around the tree if a fence was to come around I would go right around the fence but I would not let go of that line that's right I want to tell you this morning the message of the hour the revelation of Jesus Christ is God's Lifeline all you have to do is grab a hold of it and once you grab a hold of it don't let ever go because it'll be the very life that will keep you it'll be the very life that will mold you it'll be the very life that will transform you it'll be the very life that was given for this hour to manifest who you are hallelujah amen I want to tell you this morning that this message is not a Creed it's not a Doctrine don't let it just be comfortable to you let it be the very life that feeds your soul because it's the character of Jesus Christ and sometimes humankind is stubborn human humankind always sting and knows its way just like Cain did in the beginning but there's a separation between the wheat and the Shu the very life that was in the beginning is the very life that has to be in now amen and sometimes the stubbornness of man could could stop a son or a daughter of God to grab a hold of that line to be able to just hold on to it know that once you touch it you will never be the same and and the same word that gave you that revelation of who you are is the same word that would change your body into this from this Mortal body to Immortal body all you have to do is hold on to it because it is what it is if you hold on to it when you get there you'll find out and I want to tell you this I want to be there the prophet says if if any man would be able to stand and say I'm the only one that would get into the kingdom of God I want to be the only man that would get into the kingdom of God because I want to be pleasing to him I want to be the very character that he's built in this age that we should reflect the life of Jesus Christ let's bow our heads precious Lord we truly know from your word just like we've heard it today all day you are not a respector of a person but you're a respector of your word and before the foundation of the world you have sent a word that knew our condition that knew our need that knew who we are that knew the very troubles and the headaches that we would be going through and so Lord what a privilege it this to get a hold of this line and Lord I pray this morning that if there's a soul that maybe has not got to hold this lifeline and maybe they've been traveling into the Trap of what the prophet would call the death walk I pray this morning in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ that they would get a hold of that Lifeline because that Lifeline is the very image of what you were in the beginning Lord you change a sinner from a sinner to a saint you change a lame man to a man that's healed Lord you change a man that once was dead now where he can have life Lord I pray this morning Lord that you would be able to dwell inside of us Lord that I would be able to Die daily Lord that I wouldn't be living for myself but that Christ would be the very life that would live inside of me Lord providing light in this Darkness being able to know Lord that just a moment in the presence of the son Hallelujah could make all things work together for good for those that love the [Music] Lord Lord I I pray from the bottom of my heart this morning Lord that you would bless every single one of the Believers in this place Lord that the love of God would be upon them that you would carry in them Lord to through all their troubles through all their needs that they would know that they have you there lord always as a rescue regardless if life is good regardless if we're on the top of the mountain or maybe in the low valley or maybe we're climbing or we're descending whatever it may be Lord may we always know that you've plac that predestinated word that would we could always hold on to and it'll be the very present time for very present help in the time that we have need of Lord that you can lead us and give us what we have need of Lord It's not what man can do but it's what you can do for your bride lord it's how you dress her it's how you mold her it's how you perfect her Lord Lord and we want to be that bride that you've seen in that Vision Lord we want to be spotless without spot without wrinkle marching Lord into that presence of the king marching Lord and obeying your Commandments knowing Lord that we can be disciplined to the word of God and let the life of Jesus Christ could dwell inside of us Lord if I'm lacking anything I pray that you would give me Lord Lord Lord even for myself may you take away my stubbornness may you take away all that I'm dealing with Lord maybe my attitude and my actions and Lord my thoughts and my thinking maybe I'm treating people wrong or whatever I'm doing Lord Jesus may you change my character may you mold me Lord and may I be able to turn the other cheek more Lord and Lord and if anybody's asking for my shirt that I'll be able to give them my quote also Lord because God is love and you've always showed your token as part of Grace and you've always give us Lord your blood that would be able to keep us clean it' be it was always the precious way that you chose for us to go by is by that blood is by that token to be sealed into the into that promise to be circumcised around our hearts and to serve you with all that we have within us to move away from unbelief to move away away from the things of this world to move away from anything that would Lord disturb us or deceive us into the things of this world we've even noticed how the devil could be so subtle he would want us to get us into a tradition not to think that you don't exist but that we would just fall into a comfort and that we would just be carried away but Lord you've left a Lifeline for us to grab a hold of that would carry us all the way home that would be able to give us a changing in our body because you are the same yesterday today and forever so we just thank you this morning for your word we thank you Lord for your life we thank you for your truth we thank you for being inside of our life we just ask now that you bless the remaining of our day that you bless even this evening service Lord that you would give us

Jesus shining through me amen God bless you this morning you may be seated this morning brings uh back lots of memories for me um I don't know if many of you understand Cosman story but of course cosman's background he's from Romania he's a Romanian he speaks the language and he was going there my my brother spent years in Romania uh writing the gospel there and Kum was there uh preaching and going throughout the country and he got in the southern part of Romania and came across a group of people and and uh that were doing all they could to serve the Lord and so you know a lot of voices in the land and things and the Lord spoke to cosman's heart and concerning that group of people that he should go there and Pastor that group and become the pastor of of that church and and I know that feeling and I know that heart when your heart attaches to a people or and to a place and it happened to me 46 years ago and I look at little Gideon and I think about Matthew Matthew was just a few months old and uh we came here and when you come to a place and your heart's there your life's there you don't know what it is it's an unseen connection that has got you and you think you have a in your mind what it's going to be you think that you have an understanding but really you're walking into the unknown you don't know what's there you don't know what it's going to become you don't know what you have from day to day because there's no certainty there's you you'll have somebody with you today and they'll be gone tomorrow you know you have somebody you think loves you and the next day they're stabbing you in the bag I would think I was 27 years old or when I came here and um you know I can honestly say I came to be a pastor but I wasn't in fact I don't even know what I was doing but one knew and and you mold and you your people mold you and you become a part of them you become part of the land you become part of the area and God molds your spirit for where you are and he puts the words in your heart for what the need is there and so when the Lord speaks to you you know it's not a passing thing it's a lifelong commitment who believe I'd be here 40 six years and uh I I tried to leave I tried to retire I tried to go away I had plans to move to another place but your heart becomes there and and a lot of people you can't understand it you know what I mean but uh Cosman feels this way towards these people and that and I that's how I felt and and God makes it work you don't make it work you got it all figured out but it's never the way you figure it out and uh so you know it's a life Journey he's making a life commitment and that's what a Shepherd does he's not a hirling you know he doesn't go while things are good he doesn't go there uh lesie and I can remember we started with a group and finally one service we came to service and uh there was my family and and sister Lenny Greenley and that's all that was there and it looked like oh my I came here and it was a failure but you know what if it's of God it'll last and it'll produce fruit as long as you stay with our brother said it'll it'll produce fruit and so he's going because he feels something in his life to go and people around didn't understand it they all looked at me and you know everybody sees you better than you see yourself you know what I mean they knew I was rough and you know and sharp and kind of rough around the edges real opinionated real judgmental and uh they would just look at me and say there ain't no way anybody's ever going to stick around this guy well you know God's got sandpaper and God's got a hammer and God knows how to mold you but the thing that I think was down inside the most is that I love God's people and you want the best for them so you have to understand this morning that's how cosmon feels he wants to serve God he wants to serve of people and whether it it remains 20 or 30 or it grows to 500 that's not the point of it that's not what proves it right or what proves it wrong what proves it right and wrong is what's in your heart and when you have that you know it's like a vow it's for better for worse for rich or for poor you know tell death does far and if you walk this right you have the richers and you have the poorest and you have the good times and you have the sickness and you have the hell so as cosmus decided and felt that he said God thus sayeth the Lord to go to this place let's don't try to figure it out you know let's don't try to say oh I don't think it's of the Lord I don't think it's this or I don't think I think it's that just remember here's a guy that's fixing to give his life leave everything he knows and take his children because when I came here I took my children with me you know what I mean they they left what they knew and his children are doing the same but the sacrifice isn't for this life it's for the life after and and this message isn't staying message it's a leaving message so if he can go there and help one person it's worth 10,000 worlds and and so uh we we we want to be for him and he'll learn a lot he'll change a lot and I could sit right here and tell him the many things that's going to happen and the many things he's going to go through but he's got to go through it himself because he's done something in his heart and he wants to live true to that heart and if you can't live true to your heart you can't live true to God am and so uh every people got different callings so you might sit here this this morning say I don't think P that Cosman got the gift of Pastor I don't think cosman's smart enough to Pastor well let me tell you he's a lot better shaped spiritually and mentally than when I came you know he has a whole lot more of the word of God that's been revealed them when I came here so it's not about the man it's about what God wants to do that's right with the man and if God wants to do something with somebody God will do it and if if you let God do it he'll make it successful and it'll be beneficial and if that last soul is there and Southern Romania to get me out of here even so come quickly Lord Jesus so we like at this time if uh brother Cosmo if you bring your family and if any of the brothers or preachers and ministers and Elders of the church would like to come and we're just going to pray for his family and you can all come up around us and we'll lay hands on our brother and and ask them and the kids you know it's it's it's it's going to be hard for them to adjust you know and no doubt if the Lord carries they'll find their their their husbands and and raise their families in that part of the world world so this is a great morning I think of my little kids and I think of sister lesie holding little Matthew now look at Matthew you know and that's he was not this was how big he was but we're here to serve him we're here to go on the journey that he takes us on he we're here to follow his leadership no matter where it brings us and that's the commitment that we made when he saved me I'll say Lord I'll go where you want to go I'll serve you with all my heart and I'll do what you would have me to do and so our brothers made this commitment so we want to stand with him in his commitment in prayer and confidence and in support we want to keep them on our hearts so as we're going to ask God to bless his family and and to bless them as they move to Romania and for cosin to us start pastoring a church we just trust that the real pastor of that church will be none other than the Lord Jesus Christ and the word of God Amen and uh the good part about him going there is you have a nice vacation place to go to when you want to visit and uh uh but like I said he's walking into the unknown but he's got one that knows where he's walking and that's what our great blessing is and we believe that he'll do God's bidding and he'll be led of the spirit and that'll be fruitful so let us just pray for him together if you'd all enter into prayer together as we go to pray for our brother our gracious Heavenly Father Lord you are sending one out to follow his desire Lord he believes that you have spoken to him father and this is your will in his life and father we know that we ask that he would be a great servant father that you give the heart of a pastor father that he be ever mindful that help the time of TR father [Music] words have children in theel that you would ra up the part of that world a burning life [Music] [Music] we into your as we for the might nameus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and then tonight as we uh can you play that tonight we'll have a little more inment time if you'd like to come back tonight but his his father preach for us tonight and I wanted his father to preach but cosin's got to interpret so you know I someone told me he says well he said brother do brother stepan doesn't get a chance to preach that much he says but every time he's preached he's have something good to say that really helped me and and so I I guess brother Stephanie every time cosmin comes back home to visit uh you better be ready to preach so uh and soon you'll have that confidence to preach in English but I know the frustration but we're so that's why I've asked C but after service tonight we're all going to get together and just have a time of Fellowship you can say your personal goodbyes your personal prayers you can get his address from them so if you case you feel in your heart to help support them and whatever you feel led in your heart we just trust that the Lord will bless you so let's Stand Together I will'll close our service this morning I thought he did a lovely job this morning I hope the word of God said well in your heart and let's sing that little song until we meet again as we'll sing it for brother Cosman and it's kind of our dismissal song this morning so as you sing it just make sure you shake his hand and greet him and we just trust the Lord is
