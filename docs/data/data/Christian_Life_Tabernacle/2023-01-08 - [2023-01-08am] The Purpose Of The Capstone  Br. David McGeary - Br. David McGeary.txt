morning that he may just come by and have his way through Isaac by his word amen will invite by the team Siler to come and open and avoid a prayer in that Psalm reading this morning foreign good morning good morning welcome to the house of the Lord it's a beautiful day that the Lord has made I was thinking on the way to church this morning what a beautiful spring day we had but it's not springtime and I got to thinking of the spiritual application of that and you think the devil was gonna try to twist uh God's timeline too and we think all everything is all good and and pleasant and I want to stay here a while you know because it's more comfortable but uh it's still winter and man we're still in Satan's Eden and we're preparing to get out of here so uh let's not get comfortable we're gonna read from uh Psalm 32 this morning just get our Bibles ready and you know I have a friend uh maybe a friend all a lot of you uh brother Lindo yountz he wrote many uh very inspired songs and he he wrote a song one time it said uh it starts out said there's not a country in this world Kingdom or domain where the people can bow their head and talk to their King but we have that opportunity today the very creator of Heaven and Earth he said his eyes are over the righteous and his ears open under their prayer let's go before him today gracious and kind Heavenly Father Lord we come to you and you melody Lord the Lord will come as your children Lord we have the blood applied and knowing Lord that if it's under the blood then it's hidden from you Lord you've thrown it into the sea of your forgetfulness all of our wrongdoings our shortcomings Lord may we just leave those at the door of this place today Lord we come into this place has been Sanctified and set aside for your service for your praising for your worship and for the word of the Lord to come forth from this place Lord may it cleanse us from every unrighteousness granted this morning Lord as we enter into this we'll have a peace that goes beyond even our own mental understanding and our conceptions Lord that you can have your sweet Holy Spirit Sue this Lord and prepare us for the word that's to come forth Lord it'll it'll cut but Lord it cuts and separates us from the convictions and the wrongdoings and the things that would hinder Lord that's what we desire for Lord we understand by your word that this chastening is done by love Lord we appreciate the love of God we want it applied to our lives today Lord Lord as we come we know that there's many sick needy Lord there's some that may not even be able to be here this morning because of that condition but Lord we know that you're the all-sufficient Healer in every good and perfect gift your word says come down from the father of light in whom there's no variableness neither Shadow attorney Lord you forever remain the same your word is powerful and it's sharp Lord help us today Lord as we go forth we have such a lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you know I was speaking of that reverence and uh I've still got the book there where uh at the brothers breakfast we fellowshipped over uh the message desperations and brother Brown spoke on the token that morning and uh once you get into a message like that it's kind of hard to put it down there's so much in it but just one little verse here or paragraph because he was reflecting on his message which he said was he felt like the highlight of his ministry um in that evening service but he says the token Jesus Christ the holy spirit is Among Us we should reverence that we can't humble ourselves enough taking off your shoes or getting on your knees wouldn't satisfy wouldn't suffice us but a life that brings forth the fruit of the spirit amen granted this morning that we can have that life um Psalm 32 there's quite a lot in this little Passage Psalm of David it's a blessing to read the blessings of the Lord that's for sure but he says blessed is huge transgression Is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is a man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and whose Spirit there is no guile Paul picks that up over in Romans 4. and he quotes David he said even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man to whom God imputed righteousness without work saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is a man to whom the Lord will not impute sin and he continues on to talk about Abraham how it was imputed under him for righteousness sake and not through works and not through even circumcision or uncircumcision and I looked that up and that imputed in the in the Greek and the Hebrew is it wasn't laid to their charge so in the log of Heaven it's not imputed so you how can you be punished for something that's not imputed unto you so thankfully this morning as I said we put it under the blood and who's his duty bound to forgive us to be remembered no more amen so that's how we can boldly come before the throne of grace amen amen let's uh let's read that together and there's a there's a little instruction there toward the end um well he he actually says I will instruct thee and teach you in the way which thou shall go I will guide thee with my and I've been guilty of this it said be not as the horse of the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held in with bitten Bridal this to come near unto thee now it doesn't take a mature Christian to understand that headstrong and and uh stubbornness and everything else has to come under subjection to the word but and I'm not talking about just our attitudes even but some of the habits and everything else you know there's not a holiness that we can bring outside of his Holiness as he's already prepared for us amen let's read it together psalm 32. blessed is he whose transgression is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and whose Spirit there is no God when I kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long for day and night thy hand was Heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of Summer Selah I acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin Selah for this shall every one for that is Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him Thou Art my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me about what songs of Deliverance Selah I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which Thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine I be not is the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held in with bitten Bridle thus they come near unto thee many Sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the Lord Mercy shall Compass him about be glad in the Lord and rejoice you righteous and Shout for Joy all ye that are upright and hard Deeds amen let's sing one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them oh there are people almost everywhere whose hearts

ask these things this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen I bless you this morning we may be seated we have a baby dedication this morning and uh brother John Kelly in in Gouda and his wife I

strength father did and a heart that would know your ways and feel the leadership of your spirit father may be a shining light in this dark time nor that you would give him special strength and wisdom and Leadership and guidance kept your angels about him Lord may he always be strong like his father have a sweet Spirit like his mother Lord and may he come to know you personally as his Lord and Savior we ask these things this morning in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen God bless you foreign time ago one of my friends told me I believe it was brother Mike Patterson he he told me one day he said you know he says you can tell when you preach A good sermon if all the kids are asleep so amen so I hope he stays asleep and amen we're happy to be here this morning and be back and and uh as as many of you know that I haven't been uh feeling uh with a lot of strength in my uh body but uh I just want to share this with you I think that maybe you you have a right to know as a congregation I don't know if we can turn down the sound uh for what's going out on understand that and pray for me at this time if you would thank you very much I would like to um thank all the brothers that helped yesterday um and getting our property prepared we're in uh We've turned a corner and we're in the final stage of this next week you notice this big hole out here that's the preparation of the foundation and uh um when we took up the old parking lot we found out that all the dirt that was in the old parking lot um wasn't good enough to build a building on and we know as Christians right you've got to have the right foundation if you don't lay a good foundation then the building doesn't make it as long so we we had to take a bunch of dirt out of there and then put some dirty in and pack it down and then we have to bring in some special quality dirt to fill it in so we'll be ready to build it so we hope by the end of next week we'll be able to have our foundation boards laid out and that way you can look at it and see what the outside of the building would look this little Bridge here that you see where the concrete is tore up some of you walked across it's better if you use the parking lot to get to your cars and not use this walkway here that's mostly for the deacons to get back to my office but um uh that's where the building connects the two building connects so uh we just trust that next week we can have that done have all the grading done all the dirt hauled off and we're sitting right there ready um to start the foundation and where our goal is by the end of this month to have the foundation put in but we need a plumber so if any of you uh have a good plumber certainly let us know and we're looking for a plumber to do our plumbing but we're just ready on the verge to build so I went and talked to the city uh last year about this time last year I turned in our building plans and with a check for uh um you know seven thousand eight hundred dollars to review the plans so um you know nothing's free but so and uh the building inspector told me everything was okay and everything was done that the public works department that's the people that are in charge of the water the street and the drainage sign off on it well we finally are in our very final stages of the public works so I went to the city and said okay they're going to sign off next week I want to make my building permit application and then they informed me well we just sent your blueprints off to a third party uh and uh of course I don't know you know it puts it back out in limbo so I don't know how long it's going to take to get a third party review if they'll find something you know nobody likes third party you don't want to have a third party relationship with God because that third party will always find something wrong and uh so Eck and it is not so anyway every all the arrangements we have with the city I don't know they seem to got away somewhere but anyway I know that with prayer we can overcome everything so we're getting real close so Lord we bless you I know we're crowded here but when we get into the new building it'll be Deja Vu of about 20 years ago I went about 55 of us or 80 of us walked into this building and we ask ourselves what have we done what have we done and it wasn't close and intimate like it was but we had to grow into it so we trust that you'll all be with us this morning so let's stand this morning and open our Bibles and and you bear with me this morning uh and you fill in the blanks okay so you take your spirit and your knowledge of the word and you fill in the blank so we like to uh turn this morning to the book of Revelations the third chapter in the 14th verse and this is the description of our age and or I could say this to us this way this is the biblical description of the time and hour that you are living or the conditions of the time that you're living now man might describe this time different a time of great advancement a great technology great accomplished great scientific and social achievements okay they would have a completely different View of what is going on in the world and what that what the condition is but we don't care what man thinks amen man's been changing their give him a week they'll come up with something else you know what I mean they they feel they get a vaccine for one problem and something else comes up but so this is God's view of where that you are and what you are surrounded by let me say that again this is God's view of the time that you're living and what you are surrounded by and unto the angel of the Church of lady osia right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that work cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou saith I am rich and increase with Goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked amen and don't know it Don't Know It This Is What God Says doubt saith I'm rich and increase with Goods and have need of nothing and no it's not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in fire that thou mayest be rich and white random in that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness does not appear and anoint thine eyes with I saith that thou mayest see amen that's what you're here this morning for that's what we're here that's why we listen to a messenger the message of the hour is the isab for the believer uh and then this is the where we're getting our sermon from this morning as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him I will come into him with the emphasis being upon him doing the work I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will like Grant to sit with me on my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that Kathy and ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and then if you would turn over with me to uh first Peter the fourth chapter and let's start with the 16th verse yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let Him Glory by God on this behalf for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begins at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God for if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful creator the commitment of their souls to him our heavenly father we ask you to bless your word this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you maybe seated this morning if I was to a title uh the sermon uh this morning and uh I would I wanted to call this sermon this morning the purpose of the Capstone the purpose of the Capstone and many of the uh quotations and thoughts and things come from the church age book and also the message a statue of a perfect man and we've been uh we've been studying and this is Blended into our study out of spoken word is the Original Seed now we understand that all things that were done and everything that was made that was made was made by the spoken word that God that within the father was uh thought or a decision I guess you could make or a plan that he had and that plan existed within him and that was the word and what is a word it's a thought expressed you don't know what somebody's thinking until that they speak that intention to you somebody might walk up to you and you might not know how they're thinking they might say oh I'm glad to see you or or they might say uh wow I never thought I'd see you here you don't know what they're thinking till that is expressed well God wanted to express to us what he was thinking what that he did what that he had he had a plan he he had an objective he had a motive he had a reason for doing the things that he was doing and now he is going to express those and in order to bring them to pass because there was nothing he was just the great all-sufficient one you know I don't know how man could ever bring themselves to think that two molecules bumped together out here in space somewhere and produced all this well if that was the case I wish it was different molecules because what It produced it isn't doing too good but when you understand that God produced it he was the creator the one that we're committing our spirits to and our souls do that he he had something in mind something that he wanted to do it's hard for us to find a vocabulary and words to express the Eternal but he who is without beginning and Without End he he he's he had something in his heart and that he wanted to do so he said let there be let there be in the beginning was the word in the beginning was God and God created the heavens and the Earth he spoke it into existence he said let this be let that be and there was he said let there be light and there was and we can understand that that now becomes the principle behind which everything that's ever accomplished is accomplished by the only thing that remains Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away what God's original intention was what is original thinking was what his original plan was what his original creation was that he spoke that's the only thing that'll be in the end because it came from him it's eternal aren't you glad you were there in those thoughts because if you have eternal life you'll always have eternal life you always had it amen he knew you before the foundations of the world he knew the color of your hair the color of your eyes the statue that you would be in I know many times we don't feel like that could possibly be possible but he knew the beginning from the end he knew all of our mistakes he knew all of our failures he knows our regrets the things that we can look back upon and say I wish I'd never done that I wish I'd have never said that I I can't believe I got myself in this condition we could have a whole Litany of redo's that we would have in our life why'd we do this and I'd redo that and I would redo that but you want to know something you can do all the redos you wanted to do change where you were born change where you live change what you drive change the color of your skin the color of your eyes the color of your hair you can give yourself more hair or less hair it isn't going to change what God had in his mind of you from the beginning we don't need to get hung up on the in between amen we go until we come to that day of real realization that God's got a plan for our life and the scripture teaches us that we leave those things which are behind behind and we press for the higher calling in Christ Jesus that calling existed before you got here he knew exactly what he wanted to do with your life he knew exactly the trouble that you would have and he made a provision for it he's Jehovah Jireh God will provide and take care of us if so we received from the great creation of God and the great uh work that God's doing that God has something that he had in mind and God being an evolutionist that he he he likes to unfold itself and unveil itself so he just didn't create the world in one uh session maybe we could say it like that or just one thing and say Let There Be the world boom it was there and all the palm trees are there and the trees were there and the world was there and Wham there it was no Pete he did it in stages I I don't know uh why I know it my nature is not to have stages you know if the if the on the bottle or the can or whatever the product is if it says wait 30 minutes to mix well two is good enough for me you know if it says lay a thin coat well that's uh thin coat well you know what's thin you know let's get it done but God's got a reason that he does things that he's got a reason why he created this he's got a reason why he's done that and I want that to settle in your heart because he has a reason for the things that he allows when I just went through my little uh incident I shared with you you know I thought my questions was you know how could this happen to me you know why would God allow that to come in my life but he knows why you know if I could say well was I in the permissive will of God it wouldn't matter because he promised he would take the permissive will and work it for the perfect will so he's got a perfect will for our lives we struggle through that and we fight it and we cause ourselves a lot of trouble and like Paul Paul goes out and he's persecuting the very church that he's a messenger to or that he's going to come out of he's taking Christians and turning them over to the priest and binding them up and taking him to prison he's witnessing the stoning in other words consenting do the taking of us a Saint's life you know holding the coats and standing there all Pious and self-righteous like he's doing God a service and he's taken one of the first Martyrs of the church and he's he's part of that uh uh event that's taking place thinking he's doing God of service you wonder why it Paul had to go out on the backside of the desert until he got everything straightened out in his heart in his mind with God because he had a lot of going on in his mind and we go through those battles maybe not as severe because we might not have had to carry the load that he carried but nevertheless that's what the Lord told me says Paul you're going to have to find out it's hard to fight against my will for your life it's hard to kick against the prayer it's hard to go against what I've already thought and called you to do you're going to be my Messenger to the Gentiles and you're talking to a guy who believes that Christians are Heretics oh don't be afraid of where your life was he can take you and do it seemingly wonderful things with you he just praised God puts it under the blood aren't you happy for the blood this morning aren't you happy for the love of God so if we find out that he's got a will and even when the Lord they said father teach us to pray he says Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy will be done amen isn't that the Cry of each of our hearts we don't want God to be part-time in our lives amen if we if we and I can stand here this morning speaking from my own position that we have things that we have to overcome I believe brother Tim's admonishment this morning and and exhortation led us to understand that we have a God that's going to take us through so we realized then that in this great purpose of God in this great plan of God he had a way that he was going to perform it he had a way he was going to do it he had a way that he was going to deal with the hearts and lives of men and he's been a state true to the way that he's doing things and in this morning as we talk about uh the purpose of the Capstone and uh I'd like to kind of on unfold this up I could say it this way is that God has a requirement when God put this plan of Salvation and and uh he put forth uh his creation this creation was governed by his word so the way the plants came out the way that the seeds uh grew up in the tree and created a fruit and then that fruit would fall under the ground and that seed would go in and that seed would go back into the ground and it would take light and water and and the nutrients from the earth that the very fruit of it provided back into the Earth and the life would again come forth and and the life of animals in the life of men and the life of of creation would would had a law that governed it and allowed it to live and go forward but man broke that law and therefore death came in the wages of sin is death the gift of God is eternal life now ignoring God does not stop God's plan you can't get out of God's plan you can't say okay I don't believe it God doesn't exist that's like an ostrich sticking his head in the sand and saying the sun's not shining or someone going into a dark Cellar and living in darkness and saying there's no really such thing as the sun and the star and the moon no okay you're self-created idea does not change the reality of God's word God's word is going on the same regardless of what men says is going on and we saw that in lady Joseph saying you're rich they'll say you're prospering Hallelujah I got a new uh you know people phone model 579. whoopee I'm rich everybody trying to show how rich they are you know Dress for Success you think you can dress your way into heaven there's only one person that can trusts you for heaven that's why we're preaching the purpose of the Capstone man's view of things and what man thinks is going on I heard on the news that the uh they they had a athlete a professional athlete young man I guess 23 years old this Prime of Life uh just a uh what we would think is a virtue of Health you know uh the Richard Simmons of football the that was some old people laughing there you guys don't know who Richard Simmons is don't even pretend you do but he has a heart attack just like that you don't know what health is he has your health I love when our messenger told us if God wants to take you home there's not enough doctors and hospitals and medicines to keep you here that's right and if God wants you to stay there's not enough sicknesses or Devils or things to take you amen if we're going through a hard time we committed into the hands of our creator who knows all things that's right so the things aren't the way that people say there are they're the way that the word says they are and that's why we pray for revelation we pray for the view point of Life Through The Eyes of the word of God you look at something Through The Eyes of the word it's totally different than what you think many times I've got so upset over circumstances so frustrated at what I perceived as being fair or unfair or just an unjust and went through stress and anger and act frustration and and all the emotions and everything all over something that was in his hands all the time with a promise that nothing could pluck me out of the palm of his hand you might try to jump out but good luck Paul was trying to kill the very hands that were holding him so God's got something that's going on and I'll move quickly now because I don't think I I'd like to preach longer than I can but so we understand that God has a requirement that God's requiring something that he desires and something that that when he put his uh aspect in there one of the things he said that the wages of sin or unbelief is death but the gift of God is eternal life now the requirement never went away you're a sinner that requires death but what what happened for us we had a Kinsmen we had someone that came from the father because the father so loved the world he gave his only begotten son he so loved us to that because of the nature that we inherited from our unbelieving parents that that automatically our lives were contrary to the word of God because we were born in sin she shaped into iniquity and came into the world speaking lies I don't care what religion you are you can be a Hindu you can be a Buddhist you can be whatever that witch doctory that you want to be in or or or denominationals or it doesn't matter every man that's born is born in sin shaped in iniquity and is a liar but something had to pay the price because that was the requirement but aren't you glad that that there was someone that came in meant the requirement for you don't ever forget that we don't just believe in the Lord Jesus because he's a historical fact or because he was the one that done so many good works and and lived such a example of a life and we still sit back and we honor him for what that he was well we do that for George Washington Abraham Lincoln This Love is scarce he laid down his life for you for you personally he personally came and took the consequences of all that was laid to your charge and he redeemed those and paid the price for those and took that chastisement of your sins the punishment the requirement of death for your sins that was upon you personally not the church not the world Me Mine and paid them for me perfect as undeserving and as ungrateful and is unmindful of him that I was he did it because he loved me there was a requirement that had to be meant and it had to be built and paid for and he he took care of that so when we come up and I'm just going to maybe read or go through some of this quickly with us but there's a requirement for this age because God knew that he would have a people here and God never created without purpose everything that was created manifested a part of God the invisible things of God are clearly seen in the things that are created around us we saw God in nature the first Bible was written in the Zodiac in the Stars after we can see God in nature we can see God their death burial and Resurrection through the seasons all around us God has put himself in Creation in in the great complexity and beauty of creation that was a part of his attributes on display that glorified him it's only man that's been messed this place up God had it beautiful in order and man took it apart slowly but surely but it never changed the plan of God that quick I want to base this starting this morning because it never changed the plan of God God had something he wanted to accomplish in this time with this people he chose you to be here in this time he wrote your name on The Book of Life and he put your birth date you're starting and you're in and what that he in his heart and mind had spoken for you to become now don't forget what we're talking about this morning is the purpose of the Capstone so God didn't put you on life like a rat in a maze and just say if you can get through the Maze and get down through the corners and and all the wrong turns and come out on the other side good for you little rat you made it no no he's there at every turn he's there at every corner you understand he's leading you somewhere because one if you to to get somewhere there's something that he's trying to accomplish he has a purpose for this age he has a requirement that every person that he's placed here he has a requirement that they must fulfill and as if he spoken of you then that's a requirement that you have to meet in order for you to confess that you're the word of God if not you've just built a religion and an altar and you're saying Here's My Sacrifice God here's my altar here's my life judge it whether it's worthy well your righteousness is as filthy Ray Hallelujah what is somebody that's born in sin shaped in iniquity comes into the world speaking lies doesn't even know the mind of God gonna produce anything that's acceptable to him ah I don't think I want to offer what I've done to them I want to become a part of what he's doing so let me move on if you would help and bear with me this morning you know I love this statement he says if God gave me a natural life he can give me a spiritual life did that sink in he gave you a natural life right you get up in the morning you breathe you eat Hallelujah you get hungry he gave you life he gave you breath you live you cold places you see you meet people you feel if he gave you Natural Life he can give me a spiritual life if God could give me the first birth he could give me the second birth amen if God can heal this by Divine Healing he can raise it up again to his glory in the last day isn't that right so we can see by the very things that we have what he's capable of doing but our nature is to sell him short we put limitations on them we we only let him go as far as our imagination will let him go or as far as the circumstances and situations that that we we can comprehend that none of that affects him because he's the Creator and actually Peter said we commit ourselves into the god the Creator that's what our life's in it's the hands of a person and a God that loves us that can change things the great creator and so we realize as we go he says and so God's got a requirement and the scripture says this in Matthew 5 48 he says be therefore perfect wow what's that perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how do you like that requirement any takers no I shrink back because the first thing that I want to say is I can't be perfect but he said be therefore perfect now we are so carnal we think he put that burden on us be ye perfect that's just like him looking at a sick person and say be ye home he's not talking to the man and saying make yourself whole he's not looking at you and saying make yourself perfect but he's saying be perfect let there be light Let There Be air let there be let there be let there dare be ye perfect Hallelujah what a prophecy what a blessing what an anointing what a gift be perfect oh am I going to carry that cross be perfect be perfect oh mirror mirror on the wall is there anybody perfect there at all what do you have staring back at you your memory your emotions your senses ah be he perfect what a requirement what a great requirement that that's being spoken he he says so he's talking in the Statue of the perfect man and he's saying you start out as we can see on our board we know that we start out with faith and and and we begin to build upon those things and he's he he's building up so he says when you get down here a genuine born dove then you don't add nothing it's added to you see comes on up all right coming into Perfection now so he spoke to the church be perfect and now he's going to build this church and make this church perfect but he's got a plan in a way that he's doing it just like he built the Earth he builds the church and just the way he builds the church he builds the individual and and so so all along this journey were uh were adding and we're building coming up through seven Church ages to add the Capstone many of you know that we have it over here on the board we've got a Teddy kid I believe Drew this for me about 40 years ago someone's come and says Oh Brother McGarry I'd really like to take that down and redo it make it look good you ain't gonna have the love in it that that boy had in it so that's special to me so anybody that needs an explanation that we can't do better in this computerized age that's why I like people I don't care if they sing good at all but if they seem from their heart it's music to my ears but anyway we know we have faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and uh here it is out of the church eight books a week we can see those things there and all the time God's working right he's building and we're not going to go into what each of those virtues are we're not going to go on how they type with the ages and everything but we just want to lay this quick principle down he says now in building The Virtue building this Monument building this statue foreign you see it it starts off with a foundation stone Faith virtual knowledge Temperance patances goodliness brotherly kindness now what does it do they were waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love so now we're talking this morning about the purpose of the Capstone and I'll wait and finish this and try to make something clearer before I go on he says Melody kindness now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love he controls and he is the strength of every one of these that's right yes sir so he's the leave that back up there I like that where'd they go they disappeared so all those he's the strength you understand he's the one that's putting them together he's the one that's building this and letting it out Through the Ages bringing it out bringing it Forward nobody mustered it all you weren't born the day that you were born a Christian you didn't walked out a a a Super Saiyan I was so happy when I got saved amen I even got a musical amen I'll tell you I was like a I was going to say a butterfly but I was like an eagle out of the bullbrush I didn't think that I thought I was there until I got my first correction that was a rude awakening so we're going to go down so he says right here right here you see I got in between all these works here and these little waves coming what is that the holy ghost coming down through Christ see the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding This Together building a perfect church for the Capstone to cap it off now we're talking about what is the purpose of the Capstone read down here farther he says here you are seven Church ages seven steps God building his church is like one person into an individual into himself the glory the power of God coming down through this welding it together therefore the Pentecostal people that let out the that led out the lutherans then let out the West wesleyans and things doesn't know what they're talking about you see they lived in this part of the Temple that's the way some people come up that high and drop off but there's a genuine part of that keeps making that building come on I will restore saith the Lord so it's coming on there's something that made where'd my thing go just leave it up there don't put the quotes up there great okay so we see that each one of those came out of the other one it's coming out there's a spirit building it together coming out coming out bringing it up working it towards perfection that so he's got the seven Church ages he's got the seven Messengers he's got the whole church coming up he's got the individual coming up everything's coming up and it just it just keeps on coming all right okay so you got to understand we're coming we're coming up he said now someone in here they if they could only go so far they dropped off and they didn't know anything else about any of the other stuff the church that was under Martin and and Colombo in them they were almost Catholic they knew nothing of justification they lived as best as they could to the teachings that were made available to them by the church no don't be like dumb driven cattle this morning it's been given to you to know the Mysteries you're a very privileged people this morning you're very blessed this morning you're elected you're chosen for something he says he says and then he talks about the bright tree he says now the way God is expecting us as an individual to grow God is expecting us as an individual to grow the way he has brought his church in to grow every Church age it must become one big church see these fellas wasn't required what these fellows are so each of those age had a requirement they weren't required what the next age is required they weren't required what the next age was required some of them only went so far and they dropped out but that's not where you are you have a different requirement s he said you see he brought his church up this he said now these times wasn't required what these fellows are this wasn't required what this was see he brought his church up the same way he brought his church up the same way he's bringing his his people up then Peter said here First Seven Things Faith virtue knowledge Temperance godliness Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and then love of God the holy ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Spirit comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you've got all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in the Tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place now you can go back and put that up I can't see him back there I think they're probably doing it from some they're they're they're somebody okay that was paragraph 341. 342. when a man possesses these kinds of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon you no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God's Got you might do that but until these virtues here goes into you you're still off the real true foundation of faith now this is scary to me because if you start judging yourself you're going to raise a great big question Market confusion because he just said when you come into a perfect man then the Holy Ghost comes wait a minute I already thought I got the Holy Ghost you did but this this is a different has a different purpose okay that spirit that you got when you got saved was welding these things in you was growing these things in you he was bringing you to these things getting you to the place that this Capstone could come you understand that so when a man he says the Holy Spirit comes upon him then we go down here he says well he says and when we got in imaginary way he says he says let me read 3 43. but you know the Heathen they prostrate themselves before an idol imaginary God and in an imaginary way they believed that that idle imaginary God in an imaginary way they believed that that imaginary God speaks back to them well that's hedonism that's romanism they bow to all kinds of saints and everything else they have Saint Cecilia a house of God so many different things like that they bow to that and actually believe in the imaginary way what a type it is of the true Living God but when we not in an imaginary way but prostrate ourselves before a living God a living virtue a living knowledge a living patience a living loving kindness a living power to come from a living God makes a living man that's living image of the stature of God what what's he doing so we're not talking we're talking about a living virtue the living knowledge some in that living all these things are living they're all things he's putting forth and so I'm just with that Foundation laid I want to just move on and and just say these things and I'll I'll read this statement here he says he says in I'm just going to just take it from there and just close up this morning because I want to talk to you about the purpose of the Capstone we're set forth with this great requirement you're going to stay with me for 20 minutes maybe more the requirement's been spoken he can't change that we have to be perfect we're not going to enter in into that perfect place that perfect rest with all kinds of carnal algae in US it doesn't fit God's not a mixer is that right so we're we're faced with a requirement and we're faced with a challenge and we're we're faced with coming up into this Perfection you can put the drawing back up on on there if you would just keep the visual he said we're faced with this and so we come up to all these ages and all these Church ages and now there comes a Capstone and we read in Revelations it says as many as I love I rebuke and I chasten so I want you to understand man's come up through these Seven Ages they're living in the worst age of all time the most deceptive age of all time more things to attack your senses more things to attack your imaginations to attack you from every angle that there is to attack you and and you've come up to this place and we build up and now we need something to make us perfect because he said be perfect now I want you to take a second with me if you would to look at the Capstone now what love is love is the enforcer of the word of God 's word is carried out by love that's the power by which God does everything it was the power by which he heals did you know that the messenger told us that love obligates God to heal it's his love for you that obligates him to heal you he heals you because he loves you God's love is what makes the word God loved us in the beginning he wanted to share his attributes with us God is love he's the fountain everything that God is is done because of what that he was now the pyramid the Capstone there's one thing we know about a pyramid right it has three sides and so we find out that if I could say this that love has three sides God's made perfect in threes so let me Express this to you and I the way that is sort of on my heart there's one side of love is compassion Mercy long-suffering forgiveness comfort all those virtues that he has that's one side of love that's what he has he has compassion for you as a sinner he's long-suffering with you through your trials in your mistakes he's he's uh he's merciful to you and he sheds his grace upon you he's forgiving all those parts of him are one side of the Capstone this side of him that he expresses most everybody just likes to view him from that one side but there's another side of the pyramid and that's the side if I could say and the scripture says that's the side that he instructs you he teaches you he gives you leadership and revelation that's the other side of it so if he loves you he's going to show compassion and mercy and forgiveness but if he loves you he's going to instruct you that's what he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I'll come again and I'll lead you and guide you and instruct you into all righteous and there's another side of of love that's instructing that that's teaching that's mentoring that uh is the word that I like to use is tutor right isn't that what we're taught before we're we're tutored or turned over to the father's business and then there's another side of it and that site is correction chastisement rebuke conviction admonishment so that's the other side of this Capstone that that's going to come down now the conditions and requirements of God hasn't changed you understand so here we are in the seven Church ages meeting a tremendous requirement that we've got to meet because he can't change his requirement we're in an age that's God's the worst conditions that is even possibly to imagine for a person to be a Christian in you see where we're at we have these requirements that remain we have something that God has spoken that we would do that we would be perfect and and now uh let me read this statement and I'll conclude with this if I can find it he says he makes this statement he says this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it and then he makes this statement also he says I'm convinced more than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place perfect love to enter that place so our idea of things is that oh boy I better get perfect love I can't make it there with perfect love I better have all these virtues in me to Elsa I'm not going to make it I better have the Holy Ghost else I'm not going to make it all of a sudden we put all these requirements on us all these things that we're supposed to be all these things we're supposed to have we're sitting there saying oh my I better get virtue Faith knowledge I got to be built up he's been growing this church all the time because he plans on capping it now the object of Love Is Not Your Love it's his love you can do it so he says without perfect love you will not be there if I don't come down if I don't come down with my three-sided Ministry to make you perfect and take control you will fail look he's not leaving us there trying to accomplish something that we can accomplish he says I'll come down I'll enforce the word I will bring it to pass I will cap you off I will make you complete I will take control and that's right we've got to understand that when we're coming to this our time's running out we've got to have divine intervention else we will not make the finish line the Capstone is the divine intervention of God into your life to bring you to that perfection in other words he's looking at you saying son I got to get involved in your life because if time Runs Out in the condition you're in you're in trouble but I won't leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you even to the end now the purpose of the Capstone is to come and take control of the believer it's the head the quality is in the statue of the perfect man he comes and takes control of the individual's life you may not be perfect but if he takes control of your life you'll get perfect because he'll instruct you he'll correct you he'll still be long-suffering he'll still be merciful he'll still be kind he'll still be all those things but his plan work to make you a living Temple of the Living God you are living idols the terminology he used living vessels of the Living God now I look at myself and I say my I'm so far away how am I going to get there how am I going to do it how am I going to make it how I'm gonna how am I going to overcome that's the purpose of the Capstone he begins to he comes and he enforces the word in your life as many as I love I rebuke and I chasten be zealth therefore and repent as many as I love in this age the age of the Capstone as many as I love I'm going to bring the Capstone down upon their life and I'm going to rebuke him I'm going to correct them I'm going to chastise them I'm going to instruct them all at the same time with loving merciful hands but the hour so late that if we don't have divine intervention to bring the word of God to pass we are going to come up short what are we going to do I've been in this message 50 years and still struggle you'll overcome something in five years later it's back in your life seems like we're up and down in and out we have great professions of faith we have moments that were on the hilltop and when we truly look at it we say well we talk a lot if we play the right kind of music we feel spiritual but he says this is beyond imagination so he said be perfect now without perfect love we will not be there now you can go say I'm going to love it's not even in your nature to love it something else has got to intervene to protect to protect the church something else has got to intervene to bring this church into completion end of perfection somebody else has to come to make the word live and make it alive we know it we've been instructed we understand it but now we're come up to all these places and in reality we looked at it can we say I I want to be a greater Christian than I am I want to be better I want to overcome it's given to the Overcomer when we understand it the Capstone isn't a requirement that were to possess it's him coming to complete his word which you are that Capstone is your completion not but done by your works but done by his love that's the perfect love that we won't be there without not that I've meant the requirement of perfect love I've got perfect love now I can go in no I can't make it if he doesn't cap my life I can't make it if he doesn't come and enforce the word in my life I can't make it the the the purpose of the calf zone is to take control and enforce the word of God and bring the word of pass without the Capstone we can't do it the purpose of the Capstone is to make everything that God prophesied said we would be come to pass it's him taking control now you say why do you say that it's not you giving control it's him taking control this is done by force it isn't oh I'm going to let God take control of my life how's that been working out uh the purpose of the Capstone isn't an anointing it isn't a jolly good feeling it isn't I've arrived it's him looking at the church knowing the requirement just like when he looked at the church at Calvary and saw that they needed a sacrifice for their sins because they were lost he looked at the church world with all their effort all their religion all their prayer they'll come up short because they can't make it without perfect love not their possession of Love is his love the Capstone is his life coming down on your life and molding you and making you and lining you up it's not a crowning achievement of your work it's him making sure not one of his prophecies fail he'll take that three the edge of stone of instruction and mercy and Grace of of of of correction so I say you better be aware don't think it's strange to be corrected rejoice as many as I love I chastise and rebuke we've always been trying to achieve the Capstone you can achieve the Capstone the check stone is the what's going to cause the achievement to take place in your life it's his work that's the purpose of it we've been striving for something that's we can't get without perfect love we won't be there and I'd like to say this you we've heard this and read this many a Time but he's talking about the Capstone now he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and chasten to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with the view of Correction I don't like to be exposed to you I don't like to find out there's bitterness in my heart or Envy or strife but if it's there it's going to be exposed expose the view to correct chasten does not mean to punish it means to discipline because the subjects amendment is in mind what's the purpose of the Capstone to rebuke to chasten to amend with your outcome in mind that's right he's got an outcome for your life man's ignored it for seven Church ages put them on the outside of the church now he must come down in perfect love and enforce his word into his elect's life Hallelujah because without that perfect love we will not be there not you coming up with some artificial imaginary love no without him with the love in his heart rebuking and chastising you to bring you into Perfection you will not be there why did he wait Seven Ages he's built this up now he's got to come and take control he's going to take control don't kick against the prick get ready for it understand it it's coming he's going to do his work he is not going to unfail he's going to enforce his word no matter what he has to do he is going to make you what he said you were going to be and that is the love of God that does it it's the Capstone that does it everything that the church was unable to accomplish within themselves he accomplishes it for them in Divine love chest Eisman does not mean to punish it means the discipline because the subject amendment is in mind that's exactly what we find in Hebrews 12 5-11 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despised not doubt the chastening of the Lord nor feign when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chastiseth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastisement god dwelleth with you as with sons and what son is he whom the father chastidesth not but if ye be without Christ chastisement wherefore all are partakers then he are bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh with correcteth us and we give them reverence what shall we not much rather be in subjection to the father of spirits and live for for they vary for a few days chastise us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet amen that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastisement for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous never though less afterwards it yield this the Peaceable fruits of righteousness unto them which are exercised there by the Capstone foreign judgment begins at the house of the Lord and if it begins with us where were the sinner in ungodly stand the judgment's coming he can't let you go into the judgment but he can't change his requirements that's what the world does everything things change they change the requirements they keep changing Society we had a marijuana drug problem in our country which make it legal our streets are full of harlots make it legal I got to be careful I don't use that word that banned you from the internet Billy's sermon got banned from the internet tells you something don't it he can't change you're going to come up and and judgment begins here so what's he going to do he's going to send the Capstone he's going to send the Capstone down on the church he's going to send the enforcer he's going to take control of the body to bring it into perfection Paul said I become a prisoner the purpose of the Capstone isn't reward it's a work of love that's going to come into the hearts and lives of men and take control for his good pleasure go back and read that scripture in Hebrews Here and Now is set before the love of God here now is set forth the love of God here now is set forth the Capstone let me describe the Capstone here here's set forth the love of God he desires in love a family of his own a family of sons like himself and therefore before him lies mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will make some vessels unto honor yeah and under dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit that will be trained to conform to the image of their walk he reproves with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scart hands and sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love let me insert that is love that is the Capstone I said the Capstone but we know what the Capstone is it's love that is love that is his love and another way of his love there is not there cannot be O Little Flock do not fear this age is fast closing as it does those tares will be bound together in a three-fold cord that is not easily broken they will have a tremendous threefold strength of political physical and spiritually satanic power and they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ she will suffer but she will endure fear not those things that are coming upon the Earth for he who loved his own loveth them unto thee end it's Capstone time it's time for divine intervention behold I stand at the door and knock if you'll open up I'll come in and sup with you it's a three-sided Capstone nail scarred hands love and mercy chastisement and rebuke instruction it's time for us to enter in individually into the ministry of the Capstone in our lives he's Desiring to cap your life or if I could say it this way the purpose of him sending the Capstone is to force and enforce and make the word live in you and he will make it if you fight it therefore be zealous therefore and repent it's a great thing that's taking place Church because he's not going to lose a one of us he will do whatever it takes that is the love of God and the love of God there is not there may be a lot wrong with me there may be things wrong with you we may look at people that have got themselves in a very difficult tight spot but thank God there's a Capstone thank God there's a Capstone that's finally coming down after we've been instructed after we've been honed there's a power that's coming to make this word come alive if you want to study out further go read a little more in the message the statue of a perfect man you will see him taking control of the church anybody want to be taking control of amen welcome the Capstone I believe it's time for the church to be capped to be loved for divine love to transform this church into Perfection God bless you this morning keep me in prayer communion tonight in foot washing whatever you do try to make it back God bless you brother billion
