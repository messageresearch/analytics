has called in the end time such that he is sought after that would worship him in spirit and in truth amen my maybe we'll just approach the lord as they continue to pray lord jesus we are thankful that we can approach you tonight lord and not only approach you lord but to know that it's not in vain to know that you have received our worship and to know that by divine promise that you have inhabited the songs that we have sung because you told us lord that you would do that we love you we thank you lord we could never thank you enough for your grace and your mercy that sought us out many others are more qualified many others were looking for you when we weren't even looking for you lord you came looking for us it produces such a love such a sincerity lord to be standing in a place in the presence of the creator of heavens and earth lord and we just ask that you'd come now lord we've we've come to sing songs and to worship you lord but it's all led up to this point lord where you would speak to your bride lord i know in myself i i don't have anything i could give to your bride but by divine promise and a gift i ask that you come and break the bread of life now think of those words lord you asked peter do you love me feed my sheep you ask them again peter do you love me [Music] feed my sheep feed my lambs lord for i know that that is your heart's desire and we're here lord to receive from you now we ask it in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen if you'll just grab your bibles we'll be reading out of two familiar places in the scriptures we read out of isaiah 40 in revelations 3. we do want to bring you greetings from brother ted pacettely and the saints there in the prescott area we had an opportunity to minister for them as we are away on vacation to see aaron and elizabeth and the kids so it's just nice to be able to see family and it's very nice to be back with our family here and see each one of you and to stand before you so we just are thankful for the opportunity it's reading out of isaiah chapter 40 verse 31. and verse 31 reads but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint and also if you'll turn with me to revelations chapter 3 we'll read verse 18. i've really been enjoying uh the message of the rising of the sun you know it's the very the heart of the message if i could say it like that and uh my we i felt like i had to dodge uh from from going moving ahead in the book you know in the quotes there's but you know it's uh it's just such a wonderful thing to feed on the word of god amen revelations chapter 3 verse 18 it would read i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried and fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that thy shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou mayest see amen you may have your seats i just want to read a portion here of isaiah 40 verse 31 out of the amplified it would read like this it would say but those who wait for the lord who expect look for and hope in him i pray that's what you're doing tonight that you're that you're hoping or you're you're expecting or your hope is in him amen that who expect look for and hope in him it says will gain strength and renew their power they will lift up their wings and rise up close to god i like that they will lift up their wings and rise up close to god like eagles rising toward the sun in that a beautiful illustration that that is painting for the believer that they will lift up their wings and rise up close to god like eagles rising uh toward the sun they will run and not uh become weary they will walk and not grow tired and just from pulling from that portion in scripture i want to speak to you a little bit tonight on soaring in heavenly places and maybe we have uh visited this subject before and and spoke about being seated in heavenly places but i just want to use this word soaring in heavenly places to bring forth an illustration and maybe as a subject eagle vision and as we maybe just lay a foundation it might seem we're approaching this subject uh uh maybe from from off to the side if you will but we just want to cover a few things as we work towards the way god would have us to go but brother branham would say this and be certain of god he would say wait now he just read this scripture out of isaiah 40 verse 31 it says wait when you have met his requirements that brings your faith to a showdown and so just just right off the bat everybody needs to know everything that's happening right now everything that you're going through all the signs of the times everything that you're seeing it's bringing your faith to a showdown he says that brings your faith to a showdown if you have met god's requirements i have met and you have fully considered it and you have done everything that god required you to do then your faith rests right there that he is be certain of god you know he loves to test us oh my he loves to test us he loves to see the reaction of your faith now keep that in in your minds as we move forward he loves to see the reaction of your faith did you know that god likes to see how you react when you say oh lord i believe you that thou art my savior i believe that you are the healer i believe that you are the one who gives the holy spirit and the things that i am requiring you are the god who gives it and then when you confess all your sins and promise god that you'll you'll do it if if if you'll he'll let you get well and then because it don't happen you run off like a coward somewhere god can't use that there's no way for him to use you there's no way for him to answer you because he only answers by faith then all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer but real true faith stands there being sure that god is be certain that he is now notice he said he loves to see the reaction of your faith not your flesh he loves to see the reaction of your faith paul would say in romans 8 13 for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but as we read out of there out of revelations uh chapter 3 you know there's a spirit of lady osea that wants to to get on you that wants to anoint you with that way of thinking where you're oh riched and increased with goods and i have need of nothing you know a lot of us get to that place where if we're not careful the the cares of this life and lady you'll see is designed in such a way where you get complacent where you you might not feel like you've adapted that way of thinking but if you've come to a place where you're not really hungering and thirsting after the things of god and you're not praying for revelation and looking and and what hoping and expecting in him look up your rejection and draweth nigh you know any day i could be the catching away of the bride we realize that we just allow the the ways of ladies see and and and our jobs and our work and school just to lull us to sleep and we're not careful all of a sudden we're living by the flesh but but god is saying here god loves to see the reaction of your faith not your five senses and your efforts and and how academic you can be in those things and and whatever you do in word or deed do it unto the lord it's good to do all those things in the lord but but we don't want to allow the cares of the world to get us to a place where we've been lulled to sleep and the spirit of ladies has come unto us and that we're no longer esteeming the things of god it's easy to get complacent and comfortable in our condition i like what our pastor said sunday he said we have to rise above the flesh he said you can't think carnally and get anywhere with god i like that because a lot of us approach god carnally a lot of us approach him with with our ideas and our wants and our desires and whenever we pray but but we never we never come under a a holy unction and and come into that spirit of prayer and and come un under that word and into anointing and approach the lord jesus christ and and get into his presence to where all the carnal mind has has been moved to the side and now you're brought into his presence and you can pray like jesus prayed and saying uh uh you're not my real lord but thy will be done but many times we're just praying for our will we're just praying for our wants and our desires but we don't want to do that as paul would continue in romans 8 13 he said but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live so the test is to put your faith in action to bring it to a showdown look everything that's uh uh shaping up right now is for a purpose everything that you see uh uh uh the current events and everything uh it it has an effect and god is is requiring something of the bride that his word would be manifested and i just want to say what's impressed upon my heart is is is how that the the the cares of life and and the demands of life and and working a job and and maybe uh the family life and everything and and paying the bills and and maybe you feel like church becomes you know it becomes a almost a tradition or a burden to where well i've got to make time to go here and i i go i got to go here and i just want to say that the daily grind can disillusion us to where all of a sudden we've totally lost a focus and we we've actually become carnal and not even realize it but i just but the inspiration of what i want to preach to you comes from this quote out of the rising of the sun in paragraph uh 261 he says we got to be full and prayed up with quickening power until the quickening power of the holy ghost we got to be caught away someday in the rapture yonder yes sir amen he goes on to say in 263 he goes your eagles back to the word of god be burly nothing can hurt your feelings therefore you're free from all the scandal of man whatever what any whatever anybody says against you that just brings more love amen and quickening power cut away into heavenly places and eagle that's done flew above the chickens way up yonder in heavenly places in christ jesus oh my isn't that beautiful be burly nothing can hurt your feelings you're free from the scandal of man because you're you're seated in heavenly places he says that scripture we read they that wade upon the lord now look at this they will lift up their wings and rise up close to god like eagles rising towards the sun oh oh what a what a beautiful picture that paints for the believer of the word that has come in our day to catch us and to raise us up into the presence of god you know i had an experience and maybe i've shared it here before that happened maybe some 20 years ago when i was in arizona and i was out there on at work and i was working in sedona and i was in what they call oak creek canyon it's just this this little creek comes down through these huge red rock cliffsides and the the pines and spruces kind of lace it going up it's just a beautiful beautiful sight to be holding i was doing some tree work at this resort and and you know in my heart i was discouraged i had made decisions as the young christian i was and and certainly done it as as as i've gotten through the years a little bit more with the lord you still make mistakes even after 20 30 40 years but in my heart you know i'd made some decisions and i thought i was really discouraged and and lunch time came and i remember walking down there by the creek side and there's a big old boulder and i i i kind of hopped across the couple found a good spot there and and i was just sitting on that boulder there looking at the river coming down you know the sun was shining upon it and the water was sparkling and there was some little rapids there it was going down it just it was just a beautiful sight as i i kind of then it kind of struck me you know as and i just thought but you know how well i'm disappointed that that i could make a decision or i could allow these things to happen you know i i thought you know i would i was better than that and and all of a sudden as i was i was looking at the water i noticed this this little bobber uh close to the bank side it had it gotten pulled into a little whirlpool and i was just watching that little bobber and and it just seemed as it kind of swirled around there it would start getting kind of out to the outside and looked like it was just about to break away back into the stream but then it would get pulled back in and i just watched that a few times and every single time it it got there close to seeming like it was gonna break free it'd get pulled back in and something to my heart said oh god that's that's me i feel like that little bobber there i'm just kind of stuck here in this discouragement and and wondering how i can make a decision like that and i just thought upon that i just a heavy-hearted i just laid back there on the rock and then i i i opened up my eyes and all of a sudden this big huge bird flew right over my head and i sat up real quick to watch it and and as i watched it was an eagle and and it just started to fly straight for the sun and it just kept going higher and higher and it kept flying right into the sunlight before i i couldn't even i couldn't even see it anymore and something spoke to my heart and said that's hit my son that's it see if you get your eyes off the message these things will happen but oh the message is the eagle the great jehovah eagle that has come and if you'll just keep your eyes on him it's going to lead you right into the presence of the son oh jesus christ has come in this day he has revealed himself to take you into the presence of god but when you look to the left and you look to the right yes you'll get pulled off into a little whirlpool and if you find yourself there this morning if you feel like satan has sunk his teeth into you he's pulled you off to the side somewhere you're stuck there in a little whirlpool i want to tell you that god has come here tonight to pull you out of that whirlpool quit looking at your past quit looking at your failures just look straight right into the word the lord jesus is just and faithful to give forgive you if you'll just keep your eyes on calvary oh this message is taking us somewhere the trouble is so many times we get our eyes off the message we start looking to the left we start looking to the right and then yes when we make decisions bad decisions satan wants to hold you in that pattern you know condemnation has a strange thing it'll do to you it'll hold you in a place of vulnerability to where if if you have fallen and you've made a bad decision he'll heap that condemnation on you and what it ends up doing is it holds you in a pattern to where you're vulnerable to make the same decision again but see he's just and faithful to forgive you plead the blood of jesus christ let's get the show on the road look it it already was all finished in his mind before this world was ever created so you might as well quit my quit uh being downtrodden and cash down and saying woe is me i can't believe yeah you know i can't believe you did it either but you know what that's not really who you are you were called to something higher you were called to something greater and yes in our faults and failures that's just opportunity for us to experience the attributes of god that's how we give the satan a black eye when he pushes you down and you make a bad decision you know you say my god's bigger than that bad decision my god's bigger than my faults and failures oh you plead the blood of jesus christ and you get back up and you start marching onward christian soldiers going on to battle oh like the prophet standing back is the bride coming into preview he says oh get back in step get back in step there's some of us saints oh we need to get back in step we need to get back in line we need to do a checkup in our lives and think of what it was like when the holy ghost came upon us and we first started serving the lord and there was such a fervency there was such a zeal to kick the things out of the house but then we become intolerant we start to allow things to come in we start to make let things be acceptable we come to be complacent we start to just tolerate the condition i i spoke about this a while back about how you know if something needs to be repaired in the home or something like that well if you don't do it for a while you just start to tolerate it it's like why don't you fix that you know take somebody else sometimes to come come come to the hospital like it really stinks in here but you've been living in it you know the pet dander so long you don't realize you smell like a dog i mean i know it's man's best friend and some people like that that's great praise god there'll be dogs in heaven but the stench won't be there but sometimes we we tolerate a con and we go long enough where we just accept like that's who we are friends no no that you are called to something more and as we've been going through the message our pastor have been leading us through this message the rising of son we've had a sheaf wave in our day the word made flesh in a bride member coming into that adoption of maturity of the spoken word and the bride will not stop short of it oh he was a first one to maturity so what does that mean there's more in the wheat field coming it is the rising of the sun what was the rising of the sun to do was to quicken the seed the same sun hallelujah that rose in the east it's the same sun that has risen in the west the same life the same quickening power taking on the flesh of a bride member and proving that he's the same yesterday today and forever not for a history lesson but to show you that you are that weak seed that god has called in the end time to come up after into that same maturity oh hallelujah that should be the hunger that should be the thirst of the believer as ephesians would say blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ jesus oh soaring in heavenly places prophet of god would would pick this up in christ the mystery and would say what are heavenly places it's your position it's the believer's position in christ where the believer stands in christ that's where you're sitted that's your position now are you living there tonight well glory to god we got work to do that's the purpose of the message that's the purpose of the prophecies that god has fulfilled in the end time was to bring you into your position the bride everything god has done it it was for this purpose i mean think about it now it might sound it might not seem but brother matthew what are you talking yes the very purpose of god everything all the acts of all the believers and everything that god has been doing through the whole bible has been all in types of what god wanted to reveal and show in the end time and on a wednesday evening gathered in bedford texas there is the bride that he had in his mind sit before he even created the world oh that might get somebody to start shouting and to start rejoicing that might say that ain't my words that's the words of a vindicated prophet you are the very reason that he's done all these things and it's because of what he's done is to lift you up out of the muck and mire and bring you into your position as a son and daughter of god and he showed us what that would look like oh verse 4 says according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us everybody's familiar with these scriptures ephesians 1 5 having predestinated us unto adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will i like this quote here brother branham says in christ the mystery says predestinated there's the mystery before christ or anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing eve would fall now put yourself here when you hear chose the bride he chose me he chose me so many times we don't make the message personal could you i have a black bag in there can you grab my handkerchief out of it every time he says that he chose the bride you need to put your name there you just say you know what he chose me knowing eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall oh you realize that's you he chose you and predestinated you that you would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world has to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand now who's he talking about when you hear that there should be something in your heart stirring when he says that he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there now that right there liberates you of thinking that you have any ability in it he is not counting on your strength he is not counting on your ability he's not accounting on how many quotes you can quote he's not about counting on how many bible studies you can you know what he's counting on he's counting on his own word heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass a word pass away he spoke the word and predestinated a bride to be here in the end time and you are that bride he doesn't need your ability he doesn't need your faults he doesn't need your failures he's just asking you to take him at his word just believe what he said they are predestinated to stand there that's why you're still standing you think you're the one that has kept yourself all this time you think you're here because of your ability oh come on are you so foolish having begun in the spirit that we're going to make per be made perfect in the flesh god brought you to this point god is the one that's been keeping you god's the one that's predestinating you god's the one that said i'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle she is predestinated to stand there in that glorious stand in the end time and will manifest every single word that i spoke of her and what do we do we're like mary be it unto me according to the how are these things going to be how is this really going to happen well the holy ghost is going to overshadow you come on god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same we may get some pie way off in the sky yonder when god is wanting to reveal himself to you every single day of your life predestinated that church to that great glorious stand where are you standing church you're standing upon the rock of revelation you're standing upon something that could never fail and that is your position in the word of god you're predestinated to it look everybody's playing out their part i was thinking about this and i i got pretty excited about it you know but every everyone is is playing their part in god's great drama and everything's right on time amen that's right russia and everything that's going on on over there politics and carnovich you know it's all just prophecy being fulfilled it's all just working right on time and something just came on my heart and you know in zechariah 9 9 it says rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon the cult the full of an ass now i was just thinking about that and something came to my heart this great prophecy you see here rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee isn't that marvelous but notice what's part of that prophecy there's a cult an ass a donkey that's part of this prophecy you know what i i got to just thinking about that how you know in mark uh jesus would tell the disciples hey i want you to go over here to this house and and there's going to be a cult that has never been ridden upon before no man's ever ridden upon it and go under the go over to these people and tell them that that i have need of it and i got to thinking about that little that little donkey over there you know i was just thinking that maybe their their owners had that donkey and they you know they tried to saddle that donkey up they tried to work that donkey up but you know i was imagining that god put something in that donkey that just couldn't stand it every time somebody tried to come and and put a put a saddle on that donkey say you know what we're going to break you in we're going to put you to work there was something in that donkey that just couldn't stand it that just wouldn't wouldn't uh allow them to do it because there was a predestinated moment for that donkey to fulfill and i imagine they tried to saddle it up and he's like oh i i don't want to do it i reckon that donkey started to think something's wrong with me why ain't i like the rest of the donkeys out there i see them all working and they're all going out in the field and everything why can't i be like the rest of them but there was just something in that donkey that was unsettled oh they tried to saddle that donkey with drugs and alcohol and there was something in that donkey it just wasn't satisfied with drugs and alcohol they tried to saddle that donkey with creeds and dogmas and religion but it just wouldn't hold them all the world kept trying to offer that little donkey a bunch of stuff to saddle it up and put it to work but there was just something in that old donkey he said i don't know what it is but there's just something more for my life and i was kind of thinking about it by the time those disciples showed up to that person jarred and said hey i need that donkey right there so you can have him he ain't no good for nothing he didn't fit into my church he didn't fit into my programs he never did anything for me i he would never accept my doctrine he could never see the trinity you can have them oh loose them and let them go the master has need of them and this great prophecy on palm sunday here come the messiah riding forth and there was a little donkey packing the messiah oh i get religious i feel a little bit like that donkey there's been some great prophecies for the end time but god needed a donkey well call me a donkey call me whatever you want to call me but i don't fit into your religions i don't fit into your school i don't fit into your theology i don't fit into your drugs i don't fit into your ladies here why because i've been called out of it because i am part of prophecy being fulfilled oh hallelujah oh glory to god there was something about that little donkey that just didn't understand why it was all happening oh but it was prophecy being fulfilled loose him and let him go oh that reminds me a little bit like lazarus he was dead for days and didn't have a thought coming i got to thinking about that one day about some people being down at a restaurant sitting around you know talking about current events and politics say what do you think about all but all this nonsense about this jesus so-called of nazareth that's a messiah say what do you what do you think about all this stuff that he's doing you know some people are saying he's a messiah and he's supposed to re restore the kingdom and some of them are being skeptics and being critical but you know what you know i heard i heard my my brother was sick you know and he got healed but i really never thought he was that bad off anyways and all of a sudden they start talking and say yeah you know what we we've had them them them witch doctors come around before and there's other men that have rose up and told the messiah and they looked over at this one man said well what do you think about it what do you think about it you're being quiet and i was just envisioning this hey he looked at him said well you know what my name's lazarus let me tell you a little story oh i feel like lazarus i was dead i didn't have a thought coming but it was the rising of the sun and that eagle screamed out to me and said oh though you're dead in sin and trespasses i have called you out of dark denominations i have called you out of creeds and dogmas i have called you into a resurrection into quickening power why because i've been predestinated you have been predestinated to stand that's why you're here lazarus didn't have nothing to do with that now he was dead you can't get more dead than four days dead and i want to tell you all of us were dead and you couldn't get more dead but god reaching mercy how to predestinate a seed on the inside of that body oh what what did the prophet say he said your temple your body is the temple of the dynamics although lazarus was laying in a grave for four days dead he was going to curl that body out of the grave i don't care how bad you got i don't care how much sin you're stooped in i don't care how many bad decisions you've done iran often made i don't care how bad it's gotten your vessel your body your life is the predestinated temple for the quickening power of god to resurrect you out of that situation oh hallelujah praise his wonderful name oh my yeah i might be that little old donkey but you know what i kind of i kind of got a picture in my mind of that little donkey coming down the hill with a big old smile on his face this is what i was made for all my life i've been wondering what was wrong with me you imagine as they saw that is that your donkey i thought you said no one could ride that thing yeah i mean surely that can't be oh my i feel people looked at me mcgeary don't he's serving god no he's packing the gospel he's packing them that guy that read yeah you yeah you're packing the messiah god has cleansed you he's redeemed you he sanctified you he's filled you with all he goes that you could pack this message everything working out to play its part what about your part church i want to read this out of the church age a son of god can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son in fact a lot of true christians are like the story of the baby eagle that was hatched out under a hen you know that the eagle is a type of the true believer well the farmer took an egg from its eagle's nest and he placed it under a hen and in due time all the eggs under the hen hatched out the baby chicks got alone along fine with the mother hen but that little eagle could not figure out that clucking and scratching for the food in the manure pile he managed to make a living but he was pretty confused about it all well does anybody know what i'm talking about has anybody ever been confused about at all and you've just wondered that there has to be more to life than this but one day from way up in the air the mother eagle that had laid the egg spied that little eagle on the ground she swooped down with tremendous speed and screamed at the top of her voice for him to fly up to meet her he had never heard an eagle cry but when he had heard the scream something in him stirred and he longed to launch out toward it but he was afraid to try i think that's where a lot of us sit right now i think a lot of us are afraid to try i think a lot of us are afraid to manifest this message because it takes sacrifice it takes you to let everybody know around you all the other chickens that i identify with that you know we have young people today that have all of their social media they go to school and they have a lot of friends and their friends don't even know what they believe it's okay it's okay to be afraid let god speak to you for a moment and just because some of us have crossed over we don't know what they're going through they have it way harder than we ever had it but god wants to use your young people amen and i know you might be afraid but the prophet goes on and says again that mother screamed for him to arise in the wind and follow her he screamed back that he was afraid once more she called out screaming that he tried beating his wings he hurled himself into the air answering the cry of his mother he soared off into the blue sky you see he was always was an eagle he acted like a chicken for a little while but he could not be satisfied but when he heard the call of the great eagle he came to his own place and once a true son of god hears the cry of the spirit by the word he too will realize who he is and run to the great prophet eagle and be with him forever seated in heavenly places in christ jesus that's what's happening to your heart when you wonder why you're having all that turmoil and it feels like there's a war going inside of you and you want to do what's right and you know you should separate from this all the great jehovah eagle is calling to you he's calling to take you into higher heights and to deeper depths that you might soar in heavenly places in christ jesus where you're free from the scandal of man you know your feelings it doesn't matter if your feelings got hurt but oh you're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus that's what the message is doing it's calling you to come up higher oh that's my desire i want to soar in heavenly places in an atmosphere where all things are possible above the doubt above the unbelief above being afraid above well they said this and they said that above hurt feelings above the scandal of man above well they should have done it that way above what i think is the best but you're now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus and i want to say it like this and from that position from that position that's where we want to make our decisions we want to make our decisions in an atmosphere of faith what he he loves to test us and he loves to see the reaction of your faith but if lady will see you in the cares of his life can pull you out of your position pull you out of those heavenly realms where you're where you're prayed up and you're in the spirit of god well yeah yeah a lot of times we do things and say things and we react in the flesh but god is calling us to a higher place where that if we're seated in those heavenly places that we could soar up there look an eagle can soar higher than any other bird he can go where no other bird can go and you know you know god likens his prophets to eagle he's the great jehovah prophet eagle and you heard the quote god god likens the true believer to eagles and so just maybe as we move in a certain direction the reason we've titled this soren in heavenly places because you are eagles the prophet would say this he said but an eagle is a special bird now what good would it do him to go way up there in the air unless he could see way off see what good does it do us to say oh i'm seated in heavenly places in christ jesus i'm the bride i'm predestinated and and we we say we're all these things but if we're lacking the vision of the word for our lives what do we really have so that's why we're dealing with a subject here about eagle vision because i want to just dig into this for a moment here the prophet would say this in communion the 65 12 12 communion if you walk into anything blindly oh i'm getting stirred up right now thank god he didn't leave his bride to walk into this end time blindly we are not wondering we are not probing oh god took the prophet off the scene years ago and still we're watching that prophetic word come to pass we're not here wondering watch when oil goes watch when russia goes for that oil watch russia it wasn't even called russia yet it was the soviet i mean all of these things oh he didn't leave the bride blind wondering what is this all what's all going on oh my you could preach a little while just right off that if you go into anything blind oh thank god for this message thank god for i said that we can see thank god he didn't just leave us in the darkest age the world has ever known just bumping around wondering where we're going no but in the darkest hour we have the greatest light that has ever shown on the face of the earth if you walk into anything blindly you don't know where you don't know where or what you're doing you can't even have confidence if you don't know what you're doing but you must understand what you are doing and why you're doing it now we're dealing with eagle vision listen listen to this eagle vision right here maybe pull you grab your bibles here paul writing to uh the philippians here you read this verse one it says paul and timotheus the servant servant of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and deacons so just you can gather from this right here this church had been established at philippi and and so paul would say in verse six he would say he which begun a good work in you he will perform it unto the day of jesus christ now as we go on to verse nine he say in this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that ye may approve things that are excellent that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god but i would ye should understand brethren that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather under the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places and many of the brethren in the lord waxing confident in my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of goodwill the one preached christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds all right you you had me up to that point paul that's it i'm ready to fight let me have him who is it paul who's the one that's afflicting you who's the one that's causing this you're telling me that there's there's people that are preaching christ of contention they're not sincere and they're adding more afflictions you paul out of all people let me adam i'll go settle this you ain't gonna talk about my brother like that uh-uh you know i i was thinking about that for a little bit you know they have in combat sports and boxing and all those things they have what they call fight promoters and their job is to sponsor a fighter and find another fighter and make a fight and they have all this incentive they'll set the venue they'll get everything together and and that's their whole job is is to create a spectacle for people to watch and i was thinking about that he's like you know the devil is the biggest message fight promoter there is he's like well i'll get this brother over here he said and preach this and i'll get this brother over here and i'm going to set this venue over here and this will be his reward he'll get more popularity and i'll pay this are you kidding me because we get because we get carnal we start fighting other battles but not but i'm using this as an opportunity to show you eagle vision as we move through this scripture it's so easy maya you know it's like peter before his you know conversion you know they're coming to take jesus away they're fulfilling prophets he's like ah cut off your ear he's trying to go for his head no more you know but jesus you know hey these things have to happen you know you'll never wash my feet lord well if you don't don't watch your feet you don't know part way watch me all right you know sometimes we can be so carnal but see god has not left the bride blind in wandering around and groping in darkness but he has given her a vision and that vision is in a heavenly place in christ jesus now watch this he goes on to say but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defense of the gospel so after he said all this my if somebody was telling me you know hey this guy over here is preaching christ for contention and this one for envy and he's really making hard on this brother down here he's giving him a hard time like you know what we need to do something about this i mean would you would you be happy about that how many of you would be happy about that uh we should take up arms right we should do something to stop the madness but but but this is an ego right here that's writing in his position because you know when when you're in your position in heavenly places with that eagle vision you can see the end from the beginning and so when you're making decisions from that place some of the small little insignificant things that happen to us on a daily basis we're not looking at the moment but we're looking at the rapture we're looking at the transformation of our body we're looking all the way back to where we came from and where we're going so when that person cuts you off on your way to work oh my goodness i can't believe that person did that to me come on are you blind no wait maybe you are the test god loves to see the reaction of your temper no reaction of your faith no but if you're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus and you're having ego vision and there's that love and you're in the atmosphere and you're making decisions from that sphere from that place something he says lord maybe they're having a bad day may you bless them you know you're you're in the car and somebody starts uh going past you and what is it your foot just also gets a weight on it not gonna pass me the flesh you know if you're you know if your eye offends you well cut off your foot then if you've been i'd be standing on two stubs god's interested in those things that might sound funny but if if we're going to do the greater works i believe we're seeing them in manifestation i believe we've seen things temporary but even the prophet said you'll see things a manifest attempt temp temporarily there there's things that are happening we have testimony we've seen things god has been doing but by god's grace we'll get to a quote here a little later uh that'll just tie this all together but god's interested in those things in your daily life and in those decisions and from that heavenly place that's where we're making our decision i'm reading this portion of scripture to show you what paul would continue to say in verse 17 he'd say but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defense of the gospel what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretense or in truth christ is preached and i there and do rejoice yea and will rejoice that's eagle vision that is somebody speaking from a place in heavenly places that is seeing the end from the beginning and that could see this temporarily affliction and see these little things that are happening and seeing how maybe this one's doing it for the wrong reason and this one's doing it over there and this one's more fanatical than that one and this one's preaching it for contention and one for filthy looker and all these things but that that from that place way up there in heavenly places with that type of vision he can say you know what i rejoice that the gospel's being preached because he's free from the scandal of men free from those hurt feelings free from being pulled down into a fight or into something that you're not called to fight remember the devil's a good fight promoter and he's trying to make a lot of us fight a battle with our brothers and sisters and other things that we ain't got no business fighting the battle is the lord let's just move a little uh quickly here paul would uh be writing in second timothy 2 4 would say no man that worth entangled himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who we have chosen him to be a soldier we entangle ourselves with so many things that we have no business getting involved in let's just keep moving i just say lord help me not to entangle myself with the affairs of the life and and get involved with all these other things that that don't have that out that you're not requiring me to be a part of i want to stay in those heavenly places in christ jesus because what does the scripture say where there's no vision that people perish the prophet said we must have a vision a vision comes to the prophets that's the word of the lord spoken to him the church we have a we have a vision we're not blind just bumping around wondering what's going on in lady osea just blind leaders of the blind know god by that revelation what this great mystery that god had in his mind from the very beginning of the world what did he say these are all things we're familiar with at the sounding of the seventh angel messenger when he begins to sound the mysteries of god should be finished i just want to read this because this is just exciting here and they would get on the home stretch we'll just uh be about another 10 15 minutes he says god had all this to himself it's a secret and that's the reason this is out of christ the mystery of god revealed he says and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half an hour and seven thunders uttered their voices john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's the one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't know keep reading the quote now a lot of people like to stop right there he says he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible all the acts of all the believers in the bible has been in type expressing what god's great goal is and now look at this and now in the last day he has revealed it and shows it and god's help we'll see right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it you know you're part of that expression everything has been in type everything all prophecy being fulfilled everything working up to this hour that you're living in right now you might feel like you're just trying to make it does anybody feel like they're just trying to survive you're just trying to make it you might feel that way but look the testing time is to show what you're made of it's to prove what's on the inside of you just like job you know god said have you considered my servant joe we know that the condition of the end time it's gotten to such undescribable condition because just like job just like god said to job have you considered my servant job and he let the condition get so bad around job but god knew what was on the inside of him there was a revelation in there there was a part of god inside of job that wouldn't quit that wouldn't back down that that revelation would spring forth god loves to test his children he loves to see the reaction of faith that is in the bride and god is allowing all the calamity russia the politics gas prices everything why because there's a great a precious word of life that has been planted in the believer and all of the pressure and all of the onslaught and everything that the believer is facing that something's inside of the believer that is springing forth into life he loves to test his children maybe if the musicians would come we'll find a place to wind down oh we love that quote as we've been going through the rising of the sun there has to come a real bride there gots to come one that has not only the mechanics but the dynamics and i just wanna maybe as we start to work towards a close here that starts with you that starts with you there's going to be a bride who not only has the mechanics and the dynamics that is you young people that is you we're we're not looking off for something in the way of yonder to come are y'all waiting for an eighth messenger are we waiting for some great ministry to come are we waiting for somebody else to get in their position no god is looking to you we're all looking off in the blue yonder for something to happen and you're the very one that god's counting on he's like no i want to manifest my word in you you're the bride you're the one that not only gets the mechanics but the dynamics also your your family your job your your life your atmosphere where you're living that's where god is wanting to manifest these things we got to get into position and i want to i'll read this quote here because it just struck me as i was thinking about all of us getting into our position you know it's like you ever get the family in the car and it's like you're waiting on somebody and it's like what is taking this along and they start running out to the car and then the next one runs in you're like wait a second here you know then they go in and then you're like well man i that's i might as well run in real quick so then everybody's back in the car and no one's ever in their position it's like everybody's loading the car there's no driver the driver's in the car and the car is not loaded you know what does it do to get everybody in there and their position and there's no dynamics listen to this brother branham says this and humble thyself this might sound like a group thing but it's very individual we look at this watch to find out what time it is unless that every instrument in that watch is coordinating one with the other we'll never know the correct time is that right and that takes all of us all together if we want to see the third pool really do something for god it's coordination with every one of us together to humble ourselves before god and confess our wrongs and pray and believe god for these things now that's a serious call to the church maybe you can lightly place something or set your wings to the woods of faith friends we're all longing for it we all want to see it but but but i wonder when you when we see needs in the church and we've been praying for things for a long time do any of you ever start to turn over leaves in your own life [Music] or do we just let our brothers and our sisters continue in sickness and keep living our life your attitude towards the work can knock somebody out of their healing friends if we're going to do this we're going to do it together [Music] ain't none of us going to be left behind this rapture isn't going to go without you i don't care if you're living in sin right now and you got some worldly boyfriend or some worldly girlfriend and you don't ever know how you're going to be delivered maybe you're bound to pornography or maybe you're doing drugs or alcohol but there's something in your heart that knows that's not who you are as a servant of god i declare to you you don't have to stay like that any longer i don't know how much longer this show is going to go on [Music] but we're doing it together and there's needs in our body there's people that we're believing to be healed i want to see the supernatural i want to see the third pool i want to see the spoken word i see the sheep wave i see the rising of the sun i say oh god bring me into my position i want to soar in heavenly places i want that eagle vision i don't want the things of this world to pull me down and pull me out of my position where where i'm just left to my carnal mind and my carnal thinking but i want to soar in heavenly places [Music] maybe while you're all seated all i know it's a wednesday night but with every head bowed [Music] jesus said in john chapter 12 verse 27 he said now here's my soul troubled what shall i say [Music] father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour i know you're been having a hard time i know you've been believing for things and i know you've been trying and you don't know how you're going to make it [Music] your soul's troubled but i want to tell you for this cause you've come to this very hour for this cause all the condition the calamity politics the world ladies and everything has worked down to this very point because there's something inside of you god loves to test his children that's because he puts something in you that he wants to come on the outside if there's somebody here that wants to stand and say lord i want to stand into my position [Music] i want to soar in heavenly places i've been living under my privileges lord i've got all these problems and all this heartache and i i don't know what to do but for this cause my bride for this cause you have come to this hour [Music] you're the very bride that i've called to not only have the mechanics but the dynamics you got to be prayed up with quickening power your eagles back to the word of god be burly nothing can hurt your feelings therefore you're free from all the scandal of men oh whom the lord has made free is free indeed i want to tell you you're free tonight

wonderful words have been encouragement tonight you know sometimes you have a fire and there's a little spark that starts a fire and what do you do you just slowly add little bits of fire a little bit of kindling a little bit of wood and you feed that fire grows and grows but no matter how big that fire gets if you don't keep feeding it it'll die down and that's what we could do and we and and matthew made a statement that and he read the quote where he says you know i think that we're just afraid well you know if you stay in that fire that's what gives you your boldness you know start feeding on that word start coming in that spirit spend time in his presence just letting that holy spirit just fill you and and and just worship and love them and and it'll build such a strength in
