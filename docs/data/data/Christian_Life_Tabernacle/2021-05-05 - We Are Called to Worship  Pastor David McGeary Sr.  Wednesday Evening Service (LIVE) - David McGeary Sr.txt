needy of you beyond our own recognition father the perilous times are certainly surrounding us father from so many places and without you father there's no way that we can even have a chance of succeeding in fact you said if the days and the hours weren't shortened that no flesh would be saved lord we don't know how that's going to transpire but our hearts call for it lord we just ask that you would work with each of us individually to mold us into the image of your son that the attributes father that you had in your heart and mind would reflect in us we just ask you to be with us this evening grant each person here father the secret need of their heart make a way and bless us we ask it in jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles um and you would turn with me over to the gospel of saint john and so we're going to this sunday morning we're going to start into the message who is this melchizedek and we trust that it'll be a blessing and we're going to try to go through it slow and try to share some things from it that we trust will be a blessing to you then then the following weekends our meeting weekend and brother john andes will be here and and uh so we'll have uh um meetings then uh brother bunga is gonna get married i believe this saturday and he's invited the church but the reception is just kind of a private reception with their family because so but if anybody would like to come out to the wedding i believe it was on the back so you're certainly welcome to come to that and then after the weekend after our meetings we will continue on and who is this melchizedek and then the following weekend we'll be at brother bill ivey's so uh probably a good time to get out who is this melchizedek and read into it i'm excited about it amen so we're going to start tonight in it but from a completely different background of what we're trying to say so let's turn to this great scripture we all know this well the woman at the well and let's start at the 17th verse of the fourth chapter of the gospel of saint john and the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said unto her thou hath well said i have no husband for thou hath had five husbands and he whom thou now hath is not thy husband in that saith doubt truly the woman said unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet in jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen god bless you we won't be long to see evening but i i wanted to approach as you know this weekend we went last week and we went to missouri and and brother harold brown had passed away after a brief illness and of course nobody was expecting that at all and the church there of course they weren't expecting it and then sunday we had uh service uh for the first time there without their pastor and uh it kind of left uh just a kind of a hole in your heart you know what i mean i i always thought that i would see him again and that's how it is anytime that you lose a loved one you have all the images of them in your mind and you go back over those images in your mind and you think about the things he said and the way that he was and you start to worship those things and you have deep respect but going through all those feelings i we talked a lot about the promises that we have uh of to meet again and the life after this life and those are great uh comforting words but you still you still feel uh that you would like to one more time have a moment with him in this realm and uh but uh so going through that it really kind of made me reflect a lot on the feelings that i had towards brother brown and tried to bring them back to sometimes the feelings that we have for the lord and it brought me to the subject tonight i would just like to spend just a very brief time on is about worship we know that god wasn't even god until he had somebody to worship him because that's what god is he's an object of worship so in the beginning he was just the self-existing one the i am he just there was nothing to worship him there was nobody to understand uh what that he was and he wanted to share himself i think that's marvelous isn't it that such a great person would want to share himself with someone so insignificant as we are but that was his plan god wanted to be worshiped so he created the angels and in creating the angels to worship him that made him god so now he was worshiped so the very intentions of god and the very desire of god in the first place is to be worshiped we so many times in our carnal state we we don't really understand worship we accumulate knowledge of something i know even young men i mean teenagers young boys 11 9 and 10 you'll mention a an athlete and they'll tell you how many rebounds he grabbed in 74 and if he was on the all-star team and and you know this year and that year and he what school he graduated from and and he has all the statistics about this athlete and has an ad admiration for him and and some sort of identity but he never meant him amen he doesn't really know this person he might find out that if he was to approach this person that he idolized or he kept in his mind in such high esteem that this person might not have the time of day for him he might say get away from me kid get out of my face uh you know don't bug me you know go back to your mommy or or whatever and there and so it wouldn't matter all the adoration and everything that he had for this great star or this movie star or or whatever it was all made up in his mind and therefore it wasn't true you understand now we just read the scripture that god is seeking those to worship him and in truth so we know that we've been created to worship so worship is something that we need to do in order to be fulfilled and in order to have a fulfillment in our life and the satisfaction in our life to really ever come in contact with the real purpose that why that you're born and why that you're put here why the events have taken place in your life everything really comes back is that we were created to worship god and that's why that god created the heavens and earth he created the heavens and earth so that the invisible things of god could clearly be seen in the visible things around us and by seeing those things and seeing his majesty and seeing the glory and the beauty and the order of of the universe and the uh marvelous depths of his creation as as i mentioned to you before as a boy i i would go to the library and get these the big book up out it was about this book and you would open up and the whole book was beetles not them long-haired things that weren't even in god's thinking to begin with but these are these are the little beetles and i would just marvel at the colors and and then maybe sometimes you've seen uh some of these placards that they put out where they have the butterflies and every butterfly has a letter on its back and you can just go and see right on the butterfly the whole alphabet and and all those things are the majesty of god it's god wanting to express himself and wanting to be seen and and wanting to uh for man to understand that he is and men should have first understood that there was a god in creation they should have known that god was by looking at the stars looking at the sun and the moon and it shows you how ignorant man is to think that all that just happened because there was some big bang theory or or some something somewhere started all this uh you know it's sad that people are in such condition but nevertheless the scripture says it's hidden from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes so this this evening just before we start into our series of this of who is this mount mel keys adapt i want justin that everything that god was doing was so that he could be worshipped and that that is the most important thing and i know that we think that singing songs is worship but when we sing songs a lot of times we're enjoying the melody we're enjoying the word and and that's good i'm not i'm not putting that uh anywhere making fun of that or putting it down i enjoy it but sometimes we call that worship and and and and we have what we call a praise and and worship matthew and i visited a building today that i always admired i i would drive by it and say i think i'd like to have that church i think i'd like to have that church you know that was my cardinal mind so matthew said you know i'm kind of tired of hearing that why don't we just drive over there so we drove there and contacted the gentleman and the pastor and we went into the church and uh and it's a big church you know we walked around and i thought you know what i don't want this church i have no desire it took everything out of me but you know they have a praise and worship leader and they have a youth leader and they have in every room has got a ministry the minister of this and the minister of that and all uh all these great programs and and uh so he asked us about our church you know and and uh i didn't drop the whole bomb on him i tried to make arrangements to take him out to lunch you know because he has service this evening and i know if i would have visited with him and told him everything i believed he'd be preaching about me like i'm preaching about him uh so uh you know and and so uh uh you know we visited with them and it it it was really nice but it struck me so much this scripture as i visited with this fine young man that just took over the church it was the scripture that said ye worship ye know not what and it brought me to this subject matter tonight that we need to worship god and not as a group but as an individual we we really need to know what it really means to worship him and i saw the more i thought about it and the more i i prayed about it i came to this thought is that you cannot worship god without revelation you cannot worship god without revelation in order to worship god you've got to know he says you worship what you know not and i thought of this man is he there and i knew from his affiliation that he was a a trinitarian he believed in the three persons of god and and that's not a good argument because their bottom line is that you can't explain it but i knew that there was no way for him to worship god the way that god desires to be worshipped because god desires to be worshipped in spirit and in truth and there's only one way that we can receive truth and that's by revelation and so i'd like to read this statement if you don't mind uh and this is this talking it i'll pick this up uh here on page eight of who is mel keys is that a baptist minister a few weeks ago come up to my house and said i'd like to straighten you out on the godhead sometime when you got time called me up rather and i said i got time right now because i want to be straight and and we lay aside everything else to do it and he come and said brother branham you teach there is just one god i said yes sir he said well he said i believe there's one god but one god in three persons i said sir repeat that again he said one god in three persons i said where did you go to school at see he told me the bible college and i said i could believe that you cannot be a person without being a personality and if you're a personality you are one personality to yourself your separate individual being and he said well the theologians can't even explain that and i said it's by revelation now look at how important as we read this next few statements that revelation is to worship he said i said then there's no way for god to ever get to you because it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed to babes revealed revelation revealed to babes such as will accept it learn that's what learn is is to accept you don't learn something if you don't accept it you might know about it but when you learn something you learn how to do it if you were to learn uh fly fishing for example well you would learn how to pull the line out and how to take your pole back and and how to lay the fly out there and how to stream it as you you would accept the method of fly fishing okay you would practice that method you you don't uh learn about fellowshipping with brother james we were fellowshipping on this subject and i said it was like me to go into a simulator and sit in the cockpit of a simulator and say i learned to fly i would have never learned to fly till i flew you understand until i actually did it until i actually performed it and accepted everything that i learned except it and put it into practice because then i learned you know you don't have knowledge of something is not exactly the accepting of it or or the learning of it to really learn something i've really learned my lesson you know when you learn your lesson you learn not to do it again you understand you learned your lesson i know what this causes i know what this does i know what the result is i accept the result of these actions and what they've caused i've learned that to be true so i'm going to accept this result and i'm not going to do it anymore because i know what the result's going to be and the definition of insanity with is always the one that you hear it's common uh per insanity is to do the same thing over and over again expecting a different result if you stick your finger in the fire you're going to get burned you know when do you accept that fact can you know what i mean you accept that fact when you if you keep putting your finger in the fire thinking you're not going to get burned or that you're going to through some sort of mind over matter you know it's not going to burn you it's going to burn you and when you accept that you've learned that back and now you accept the practice of not putting your finger in the fire what would you call somebody if they kept sticking their finger in the fire you'd say man you're insane you're going to get burned and it's going to happen every time when are you going to learn when are you going to accept so if you have understand now that so worship you can't worship without accepting revelation let's read on he said accept it learn and i said there be no way for god to get to you you closed yourself off from him the whole bible is the revelation of god the whole church is built upon the revelation of god there's no other way to know god only by revelation so there's no way to know god except by revelation so if you don't accept the revelation then you are worshiping an idol in other words you're worshiping your own concept you're worshiping your own idea of what god is so many people today still in their mind worship a man two thousand years ago walking on the the the shores of galilee and they picture and they're worshiping jesus and you say worship jesus when you go back and you're worshiping for expert where that he was a good example for example if if i took sister janet and i walked up to her and i said oh jenny here's five dollars uh you graduated from eighth grade you know well she deserves a hundred times that you know what i mean because that's not what we're giving her credit for we're not what we're recognizing her for you understand work so it you can't if if you don't accept revelation and you're worshiping him for something that he's done in the past he's not really receiving the worship that is present tense you understand and you have to worship god in the present tense okay the the word worship means to respect or hold an admiration or devotion so if you're going to hold something in in in admiration you've got you're admiring what that is transpiring now what god is doing now we're not worshiping a historical god because our bible tells us that he's the same yesterday today and forever so he can be worshiped now right now where he is now and he can be worshiped in spirit and in truth but you can't have truth without revelation so you can't worship god for something that he's not you can't worship god for what he's not and i thought of this man he's got this great big church and of course his church has struggled through covent and eck and he's worshipped and he he he believes there's three persons and i thought there's no way my friend that you can really worship god because you're not worshiping him because he's not three people he's one god we know and we understand in three offices you know just like me i'm a i'm a father and i'm a grandfather and i'm a husband three distinct offices my my wife has no claim to me is grandpa she better never call me grandpa see she's pushing it then right but it i'm still who i am i'm one person but i have an office of grandpa because that i show grandpa attributes you know one of the great grandpa attributes we're sitting at a restaurant the waitress comes up and she says can can they have dr pepper i said sure they can have whatever they want i'm the grandpa it's a different relationship it's a different office it's something totally totally different and then you know i'm a father so i i you know i i have my children and and my wife doesn't have a claim to that neither does my grandchildren have a claim to that but yet i'm one person manifesting myself and the attributes that i have in three different offices so if you if you don't understand that and you think that your worship if you can't worship what you don't know and so when you recognize that that god can't be worshiped for something that he's not and he can't be worshipped in past tense [Music] you might work try to worship him in future tense but there's a measure of presumption with that because god interprets his word by bringing it the past and that's what god wants to be worshipped for is the bringing to pass of his word that that's what he wants that's where the praise should be that's what the worship should be that's what the recognition should be it's not there's a god and i'm going to put god off somewhere and i'm going to say there's a god when the very god that created the heavens earth is alive in our midst bringing forth his word the same yesterday today and forever to proving and manifesting himself to be the creator of heaven and earth that's what he needs to be worshipped for you a church is we we call it a place of worship but but it worship is not a a time or a set-aside time or a set-aside place we don't go to church to worship you don't go to church to worship we say that you understand but worship is in revelation you can't worship without revelation there's no way to worship without revelation he says he says he says there's no other way to know god only by revelation to whom the son will reveal him revelation everything is revelation so not to expect except the revelation then you're just a cold theologian and there's no hope for you not you understand not to accept revelation automatically takes you out of the ability to really worship god for what he's doing revelation is such a part of worship and so when we begin to understand that that's what god elected you for and gave you revelation because he was seeking such to worship him so when he talked to this girl this young girl said sir i perceive you to be a prophet our father's worship he says the time's coming that you won't worship in this place this mountain or in jerusalem but that you'll worship the father in spirit and in truth in other words you will worship god in revelation you can i know where so many people are going to churches they're in cold formal denominations because they have no contact with god god's not showing them anything he's not revealing himself they've accepted a cold catechism and when you accept a cold catechism of creeds and dogmas and what people have derived for and and what they've taught for generations and generations there's no way that you're in contact with a real living present person fail to understand that without god speaking to you and revealing to you and making himself known to you you can't worship him in truth you can't worship him in spirit unless he reveals his spirit to you all true worship is built on revelation if you would say i want to worship him you really want to worship the lord pray for revelation pray that he could show you because you're going to worship him for what he reveals to you that's why he reveals it that's why he chose talk sheep he said when the messiah comes he'll do these things and he began to fellowship with her and she so moved him that he said to her i am he every place else he he lays it out there in such a way but she had accepted the revelation she accepted his discernment she accepted his doctrine she accepted that she wanted to drink of this living water when she accepted the revelation and she accepted what he he taught her when he accept what he revealed to her after she accepted the revelation came and therefore he said that i am he then she ran into the city and said come see a man in other words come worship a man that revealed to me the secrets of my heart the importance of revelation and as i said you can't worship somebody for past accomplishments i hope jenna didn't mind me but she did graduate from eighth grade and that's a great accomplishment you know i never graduated from high school so i certainly know what a great accomplishment is for those that go on and i've never ever felt that persons shouldn't get all the education that they're capable of getting you just don't trust in it you know if someone would feel led to go on to be a doctor we have doctors in here this evening and great accomplishments and we have professors and we have uh you know physical scientists nuclear scientist guys that are so smart i can't even talk to him which is good but you don't trust in it so we never try to hold anybody up but when we can understand that revelation is what you're worshiping you're actually worshiping the unfolding of god because the whole book is a revelation it's a revelation of jesus christ well when god gives you a revelation he's revealing himself to you so you can worship him not worship your own idea not worship what you've been taught not associate yourself with the system and then think it's worship i'd like to read a statement if i could he says oh that people might come unto him and find that rest there is a cry in all hearts for that rest but the majority don't know the answer so they try to steal the cry by a religious process of keeping certain days or accepting denominational creeds and dogmas there's a cry in us for rest there's a crying us for truth there's a cry in us to worship now if you're if you want your lives to be void of worship and and that's what i even say for those that are streaming and those of us here this is the hour that the world wants to rob us from our dedication to god they'll do whatever they can to move him from spot number one where he's got the total preeminence of our lives where we're praying for revelation as he reveals himself to us and we see him in truth see him there unfolding his word actually see the living lord god manifested in the fulfillment of his word and then you can actually worship him and praise him and know that you're dealing and worshiping the very person himself but this is the hour he's trying to rob that too busy to pray for revelation we accept the substitute and this is what he said they have this cry and so they try to steal the cry by religious process of keeping certain days or accepting denominational creeds you don't worship god by going to church on easter or by going to church on christmas or by going to mass for whatever process you worship god by seeing him until he becomes personal through divine revelation you're only worshiping an idea and that's not spirit and truth he says but failing in that in other words people fail to find that rest they fail to find the rest in religious process or accepting creeds and dogmas by failing in that many try drinking carousing can air every physical excess thinking that by worldly pleasures they can be there can be some satisfaction but in such there is no rest they smoke and take pills to quiet their nerves but there is no rest in earthly potions they need jesus they need the heavenly redeemer the rest of the spirit then most of them go to church on sunday that is good but even they have no idea of how to approach god and how to worship him they go to church but they have no idea how to approach god or how to worship them but because you can't worship something that he's not and so when you begin to understand that worship you're created to worship he called you to worship he elected you to worship he chose you and gave you revelation so you can be a true worshiper for the true worshiper is going to worship him in spirit and in truth and the only way to get the spirit and the truth is by divine revelation he has got to show it to you so you've got to ask yourself am i going to accept what man tells me am i going to accept just what everybody calls religion am i going to accept america as christian america is not christian america is lost they condone homosexual marriages they can dome the changing of the creation of god they now think that the choice that where god said he made them male and female maybe him no they say that's not true we will make ourselves male or female we'll decide we'll let you decide it's an abomination and there's one thing that comes when you reject god and that's judgment and there's nothing left for this country but judgment because they can't worship him because they don't know who he is no you want to talk it's important because god's looking for true worshipers he's going through your lives he's looking over this congregation he says who's worshipping me who knows who i am sees me unveiling myself sees me fulfilling my word sees me carrying out my promises and says lord i worship you i see you i know who you are i praise you for for fulfilling your word i i saw what you've done in this generation i praise you for it they don't know how to worship him jesus said the true worshiper was in spirit and truth but what kind of worship can you get in a church that knows so little of god and puts up with santa claus at christmas and bunnies at easter you see another it's kind of a reverse if you eliminate all the things that aren't worship you will eventually come down to there's only one thing that brings true worship and that's divine revelation where did they get that they got it from the pagans and made it part of the church doctrine but when one turns to the lord and is filled with the holy ghost he ceases from all such things he has a rest in his soul he really begins to live and love god and worship him amen he says this he says now notice in the second verse the second verse here in deuteronomy 16 worship in the place that i have chosen you must worship god you must worship god ask yourself just this evening just to challenge you are you really worshiping the lord do you have a time set aside in your life that you recognize him you recognize him for what he's doing not just what he did not what he's going to do but worship him for what he's doing right now to really praise him and and recognize his presence with you and recognizes grace in your life recognize how he's keeping you and defending you that's what he's looking for that's who he's seeking he says you must worship him worship in the place i have chosen now you must worship god he said in the place that i have chosen not what someone else chose but what i have chosen now if god chose a place it behooves us then to find out what he said about it and where is it i want to find it because truly i want to worship him we all are here tonight to worship him we're sitting here tonight as methodists baptists catholics jehovah witness christian science and all but we're all seeking something we want to know truth the bible said ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free you can't know what you're doing you don't know how to do it until you know how to do it you don't know what to do until you know how to do it rather you don't know what to do until you know how to do it you must know what you're going and how to do it you must know what you're doing and how you're doing it how do you know that there's only one way to know it by revelation god didn't give us this message to make us smarter and more theologically prepared than somebody else he revealed himself how many believes the word of god is the revelation of jesus christ how many believe that that's what the opening of the seals was it was the revelation of the persian of jesus christ man through seven ages was guessing at what they were worshiping they didn't know what they had they thought he was three gods they thought he was a saint they thought they could make intercession they didn't know about this they didn't know about that he he was hid but now in this last day he revealed himself so that we could know that he's present tense and he chose you and gave you revelation so you could see him see you see that he's alive he's he's a spirit and that's what revelation is revelation is spiritual i sav that you can see spirit you only see spirit by revelation when you have a revelation it's so clear to you it's so real to you what's happened it's happening in the spiritual realm but you see it you see it as if it had actually taken on form hallelujah who is this melchizedek taken on form is so real and so you can really worship him we're called to worship this evening church amen i don't want to i don't want to worship him in any other way but through divine revelation i want to worship the hymn he shows me did that make sense i don't want nobody else's i want to worship him i want him to show himself to me so i can worship him in spirit and in truth amen god bless you it's going to be wonderful to get into this message i i went ahead and preached tonight because i'll only preach once on sunday and then we'll have our meetings and then we'll come back and spend a couple of services getting deeper into this who is this now casey that but it's wonderful you love them tonight let's stand together we'll ask brother billy to come has god's grace been in your life he's worthy to be worshiped isn't he but don't don't you even want to go beyond worship worshipping him for what he's done but don't you just want to worship him in present tense don't you just want to worship his very person himself well his person is in revelation am i making i hope i'm making myself i'm struggling just to find the words that when he when he makes himself known in divine revelation and he's standing there in the fulfillment and the person of his word you can really praise him for what he is amen let's pray our gracious heavenly father if you'd like to raise your hand tonight maybe you'd say in your heart you know i'm not really as close to god as i should be i've just accepted that the american standard of church living i've just accepted the the norm and what everybody else calls worship and what everybody calls church as i visited with this young man today he looked at me i said well we're a holiness church he says yeah he says people got all kinds of ideas of holiness some people think it's in their dress and something people thinks it's in their hair and some people think it's like doing this and by doing that and i just got to thinking yeah you know me more than you think you do lord i thought oh my it's devotion adoration caused by revelation lord our sisters let their hair grow because they've had a revelation that pleases you lord they dress modesty because they've had a revelation that the scripture says they're obedient and loving mothers because they have a revelation they're faithful wives because they've had a revelation father we can only worship you with revelation revelation is you revealing yourself to us father i pray tonight for revelation i want to see you more clearly in your word i want to see you more clearly in your present tense lord you counseled us by eye sap that we might see lord i pray for i sav that i can see you standing present in the midst of your church the same yesterday today and forever doing exceedingly and abundantly above what we could ask or think lord don't let me go blind any longer don't let me just accept all the words that i'm hearing and all the things that are preaching and the excitement of the amens lord i want to see you and i want to see you because i want to worship you and praise you that's true worship is you revealing yourself so we can fall before you and give you the praise that you deserve father i pray tonight that it would tug on somebody's heart people can't worship you because they don't know you they've accepted somebody else's thing and oh god you're here to make yourself known to who'll ever ask who would ever ask lord show yourself to me in no wise will he cast you out but he'll make himself so real that you would just worship him in spirit and in truth god bless you
