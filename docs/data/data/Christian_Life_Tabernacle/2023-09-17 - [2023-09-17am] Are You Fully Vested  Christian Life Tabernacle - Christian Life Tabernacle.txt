to invite brother Mike for some reading I certainly want to welcome everyone in the house of God you may turn around and welcome someone this morning amen okay God bless you and have your seeds good morning we're going to read Psalm 47 this morning and uh you know just a little thought from the song you know this is a Psalm of Praise there's a lot of wonderful statements that are made in here and we could probably camp out on any one of them but you know there was a particular statement that kind of caught my attention this week as I was reading it and that's in verse 7. it says this it says for God is the king of all the Earth sing ye praises with understanding not just sing praises but sing praises with understanding see these are two very different things you know David said in Psalm 22 3 he said but Thou Art holy o thou that inhabit us the Praises of Israel he inhabits dwells in the Praises of his people but you know not all praise is something he can inhabit this doesn't necessarily refer to a church or a worship service praise without understanding is honestly just noise you know just because a group of people Gather in a worship service or a church service and offer up praise and worship to the Lord it doesn't necessarily mean that he is there you know we know the scripture in Matthew 18 20 very well Jesus said it he said for where two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst of them and we believe that but that doesn't necessarily give us license to assume that scripture is being fulfilled simply because two or three of us decide to get together and have church the key to the scripture is that phrase in my name he chooses where he puts his name he chooses where he dwells not us you know in order for us to fulfill that scripture we need to have an understanding he was teaching his chosen people about this when he was teaching them how to Worship in Deuteronomy 12 he said this then there shall be a place where the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there shall ye bring all that I command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which he vow unto the Lord a little later on in the chapter take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burn offerings in every place that thou seeest you know and you see that was a constant struggle of the children of Israel throughout their history was rather than worshiping in the place that God choose chose in the place where he put his name in the manner that he had instructed they wanted to worship the way they wanted they set up little worship centers the way that they wanted where they wanted to worship and praise how they wanted to worship high places the scripture refers to them as verse 14 of Deuteronomy 12 but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes there Thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings and there Thou shalt do all that I command thee you see we don't decide where his name is and we don't decide where he dwells you know his Dwelling Place his name are reflections of him it's important that we have an understanding of where he dwells where he places his name prays with understanding you know Paul deals with this quite a bit in First Corinthians 14. when he's dealing with that Church's fixation on spiritual gifts I suppose like many of the churches of today the Corinthian Believers had started to get carried away with gifts and the moving of the spirit and Paul needed to adjust their course a little bit bring them back into balance according to the word and you can read the chapter for yourself but you know he refers several times to when the spirit moves among the Believers and there's a result of that that others should be edified you know the purpose of these gifts he says several times is that others might receive the benefit from that gift otherwise it's just noise Paul describes it as speaking to the air there's a purpose something that he once made known in the ministering of that gift or that work he sums it up in verse 15 which I thought lined up with us very well he says this what is it then I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding also I will sing in the spirit and I will sing with understanding also just because there are gifts doesn't mean he's being made known it's just chaos if he's not being made known just because there's praise and worship doesn't necessarily mean that he's made known if he and his works and his attributes aren't being reflected in that praise you know when Moses and Joshua were on Mount Sinai remember and the Lord was giving them the word there came a sound it was praise and worship the child the chosen people God's people giving praise and worship but the sound that came from that was the sound that sounded like battle it didn't sound like something that reflected him right it wasn't something that he inhabited or that identified him in fact he wanted to destroy them as a result of that praise if it had not been for the intercession of Moses see it didn't reflect or match the experience that they had with him and it didn't reflect his identity and his works you know Psalm 47 is a Psalm of praise but as we read it notice that he the Lord is being made known in the praise there are attributes and works of God that are being known in that praise that cause others to know more of him you know real praise reflects who he is to you to me the experience that we've personally had with him you know it's not just my response to a song leader or to a volume or to an atmosphere but it's me declaring the work he did for me it's not what I heard of or I've been taught or they said but it's what he did for me what I heard from him the work he did for me he's being made known in the praise you know when you give someone recognition or praise at work or at school or in the family you don't just randomly say you know Dylan's awesome he's awesome he's great after a while people are going to walk around and go why why is he awesome why is he great give me a what what made you start doing this you see you need to have an answer for why you say that why Dylan is awesome to you it's no different when you are praising the Lord you need to be able to speak to what he's done for you because there's an identity of him that's been known in his work in your life by your praise Psalm 9 11 says sing praises to the Lord which dwelleth in Zion declare among the people his doings get specific what have you seen him do what have you heard from him that characteristic of him that he made known to you is your opportunity to declare that attribute of him that others may know him praise with understanding praise isn't for us it's not about how we feel or feeling good it's not about the atmosphere we like what excites us it's not about entertainment or production it's not about us worshiping the way we want or how we prefer there's a purpose it's about making him known there's a declaration to be made it's us declaring that he's been to my door it's me identifying him that he passed by my way that I heard from him our praise is a people declaring his presence and his work and his identity let's go ahead and stand this morning you know as we read Psalm 47 this is from the for the sons of Korah this is a redeemed people notice in verse 1 it says the voice that comes forth from them is a voice of Triumph see they've been through a battle and they're now speaking about the experience they had and they're declaring the attributes of the Lord you know so whether it's in a church service whether it's and the job or in the school classroom that we're at he inhabits the praise of his people when we make him known singing praises with understanding May our Praises wherever we are make him known so That Others May recognize him let's just read Psalm 47 this morning starting in verse 1. oh clap your hands all ye people shout unto God with the voice of Triumph for the Lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all the Earth he shall subdue the people under us and the Nations under our feet he shall choose our inheritance for us the Excellency of Jacob whom he loved Selah God has gone up with a shout the Lord with the sound of a trumpet sing praises to God sing praises sing praises unto our king sing praises for God is the king of all the Earth sing ye Praises with understanding God reigneth over the Heathen God sitteth upon the throne of his Holiness the princes of the people are gathered together even the people of the god of Abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto God he is greatly exalted amen amen God bless you may have your seeds amen let's sing meeting in

you ever done anything wrong and he examined his life and realized not everything was just perfect but he said when uh judgment was about to be pronounced they heard a voice say that because they

amen God bless you this morning we just want to uh just gonna we're just going to take a quick moment to uh read a portion of the scripture this morning but I I wanted to to do it in a way that that the prophet of God reads it for us so what we're going to do is we're just going to remain standing and they'll start playing we're going to play about five minutes of a message delay the foundation for where we'd like to travel in the word of God this morning and so the prophet of God will pray and and and then we'll sit down after the reading of the scripture so Brothers if you could go ahead this morning and uh we'll we'll start right here this morning thank you now I usually have the people to stand when we read the word but tonight I'll try to Omit that because it's so so hard for you to stand but just before we read the word let's just bow our heads for a few moments as we speak to the author of the word as we've been kind of adjusting with each other and kind of letting down are as we call it letting down our hair so let's get on the sacred side now in the sincerity and turn our hearts towards heaven as we open the word now any man that's able to move his hands can open the Bible but there's no one really can open the understanding but the great holy spirit so let us speak to him our heavenly father we are certainly a lady tonight to be assembled here with this group of people this side of Eternity and to have this fine fellowship and as we sit around these tables tonight looking across at each other and business colleagues and and Christians we are aware that there's coming another time that we'll meet we trust that we'll all be there everybody present that great wedding supper in the air when the king will come out wipe all tears from our eyes and say is well done my good and Faithful Servants enter into the joys of the Lord that's been prepared for you since the foundation of the world there should be some Lord it doesn't know you and that way and I pray tonight that something will be done or said that will cause them to change their way of thinking turn to thee whether it's your present or by the the medium of television or by the tapes that will be going out from this bless us together now and bless the reading of Thy Word turn our hearts and thoughts towards the ending of this life and what will be our state at that time or we are sure father that all of us have to leave this world we're Immortals and let us look to the Eternal one the only one that can give us life beyond this through the name of his son Jesus Christ we ask that amen I would like to call your attention for a few moments now to the reading of God's word I'd like to begin reading from Saint Mark's gospel I think the 10th chapter and begin with the 17th verse and when he was gone forth into the way there came unto him one running and kneeling down and asking him saying good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life Jesus said unto him walk call us thou me good there is none good but one and that is God knows the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness the fraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these things I have observed since my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou like us go thy way sell whatsoever thou has and give to the poor Thou shalt have Treasures in Heaven and come and take up thy cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and one away grief for he had great possessions may the Lord add His blessings to the word as we Endeavor to pull from this a text in context now you may be seated yet it's the investment being with business people and always I think that business people is always interested in in good Investments so that I call a text now for the next few moments the Investments a good businessman is always looking for a good Sound Investment if he isn't then he isn't a good businessman he must look for something that's real and I'd like to talk to you on the invitation that I give to you a few moments ago on this eternal life policy as I introduce myself as a a businessman and I have a business and I'd like to talk to you a few moments about it in a few scriptures I have written down here in text I'd like to use these for a few moments these notes it's not a a good business to gamble any man knows that that gambling is not a good business because it's taken a chance you never or sell them see a gambler one day he's a rich man the next day he's begging so you take too much of a chance to to gamble I think a a gambler is just simply living on the spare of the moment and not looking forward to the future or you wouldn't be gambling I do not believe in some of these get rich overnight Investments either by some unidentified business any good businessman wouldn't take a chance like that maybe on your your life's savings your earnings and you would uh invested in some uh getting I get rich right quick it's unidentified someone running with some kind of an idea here we uh we got a certain firm here there's no background to it I think a good sound thinking man would be foolish to try to make an investment in such a a company as that because I had a friend one time that that tried such a thing and when he did he lost everything he had and he lost all of his life's earnings about ready to retire and he thought well I'll I'll take this chance because the man seemed to be knew what he was talking about but come to find out the the company was just a make-belief company and no stocks or nothing so the poor fella lost everything he had so I think if a man wants to make a good investment he should first check his company or whatever he's making an investment in to find out what he's going to do I think any sensible thinking person would do that and then again before go on I like to say it's not a good idea to keep your money in your pocket many people say I'll just put it in my pocket and I I got it but you know you're a businessman and women you don't think in those terms and it's not a good thing because it can be stolen it's best to have it in circulation like the Lord said one time he gives so many talents to so many and such and then they made an investment with it and those who made a good Sound Investment he uh give them the dividends but when one man said I just kept it I I didn't want to take any chances on it I I put it in my pocket or I buried it somewhere Danny taking that what he had gave to him and give it to the one that had drawn more dividends and put it to a good investment and that's our large way of doing things now but uh if you were going to invest in something that you wanted to be sure in you'd find some good reliable firm that has been proven that it'll pay off right now that's a good sound in investment if you've tested the firm you know it's backgrounds talk with somebody who's done business with this firm hear the testimony of everyone it's a hundred percent they're always right on the dot with their dividends and there's a great uh resource Capital behind it the company's not going broke and that's a good Sound Investment and now all through life people's been uh taught them now we're speaking tonight on the scripture of a young Hebrew boy that was a wealthy type of a land he might have come from a real good home no doubt his testimony showed that he come from a good home he was called in the Bible the Rich Young Ruler I'm going to change it tonight just a little bit say a rich young businessman because he had a business and he was interested in in business no doubt his father had been a great successful businessman or he probably wouldn't have had what he had but he was uh brought up to to be a businessman and he seen something in this young fella of Galilee this young Prophet by the name of Jesus of Nazareth no doubt he'd heard his priests speak about him and maybe against him but when he got his first glimpse at the Lord Jesus there was something about him that was different from any other man and I say this as a Christian it is truly hasn't changed we have great theologians in the land throughout the world we've had them for thousands of years that can introduce to us a Creed and they're schooled in those creeds and a church that's that's a well-established Church but uh that still isn't my my policy tonight I'm speaking of I'm talking about eternal life now certainly I'm not worthy to take over where brother Branham left off in any way but um just what's on my heart this morning to to share with you is um that the prophet of God used kind of the background if I could say that as of of investing and uh we've been talking about faith because our whole heart's desire as a body of Believers is not to have a faith but to possess faith and we we're not calling it a faith as uh what we believe a a doctrinal faith or we believe this we believe that or leave we believe that but we're striving for every member in the body to have a working faith a faith that's capable of accomplishment and uh uh uh faith that has the ability to withstand and uh go forward and to uh if I could say it this way of faith that would change things and uh so uh we want to uh invest in uh uh something and uh and I think our Prophet laid that out a very uh clear uh he he makes this statement he said uh when the uh this Rich Young Ruler meant the Lord Jesus he saw something different about him he he knew there was something different but he knew that he possessed something to give so he that's why he asked him he said Master what must I do to inherit in eternal life and uh so when he meant this uh man that possessed something and what Jesus possessed was eternal life that's what he had that's what he had to offer you know he that was his gift to mankind I am the way the truth the life you know come unto me all ye there heavy laden and I'll I'll give you rest these are the kind of things that that uh this Rich Young Ruler heard and it caught his eye and it caught his attention and it it drew to him to realize that Jesus had something that he didn't have and so he was seeking it and then what he really realized that Jesus had because Jesus was talking about a kingdom another kingdom another land beyond the river uh in my father's house are many mansions I wouldn't tell you so now when we read our Bible we go through Matthew Mark Luke and John and we just see the statements once recorded but I I forgive me if this offends anybody but I just believe the prophet of God's Ministry paralleled the Lord's Ministry so much the same you read at one time in the Bible but Jesus is out preaching meeting after meeting after meeting he's making these statements hundreds of times uh the different people you know I am the way the truth the life he said that all over the country if that may be in one sermon he might have mentioned what we would call all the Beatitudes all the statements all the great things he was telling them about a kingdom he was he was telling them about a lamb beyond the river in fact Jesus was preaching on Exodus amen he was a preaching a coming out and to a going into he was bringing something that they didn't have they were buckled by the law and he was going to give of them spirit in life John truly baptized with water but I come to baptize with the spirit and so you you've got to understand he just it wasn't he went here and preached this one time he preached it over and over and over again everywhere that he went everywhere then he went he was telling the pair of same Parables he told them all over the country he he pointed to the truth of it I haven't come to destroy the law I've come to fulfill it he may have started every sermon that way so you you've got to you've got to get our minds you understand understanding that this is a living life it's a faith and and it's it's not a uh just the way that we think in a straight line Jesus is preaching out what he was preaching just like our messenger he would go place after Place telling the same things bringing the same thing what was he telling me he says what what's what you're seeing in front of you this man standing here with this prophetic gift the ability to discern the thoughts and intents of a heart this is what was promised in the scriptures you are seeing the scriptures fulfilled this is what he said this is he that come to to uh free the Brokenhearted to lose to bring judgment you know this is the one that's come to open the seals and and to give us the truth of the life what you're looking at is the word of God manifested in flesh it's God veiled in flesh the unveiling of God this is the voice that must have exposed the Son of Perdition and to expose to you the Trap of the enemy and expose the wicked one this is the one that was to call you out of the bondage of the church world and come unto life more and abundantly this was the one that you see here that's Discerning the thoughts of intents of the heart this is the one that was promised to come back to restore your faith yeah that's right so they were seeing this Young Rich ruler was seeing with his eyes the scriptures being fulfilled he was watching it unfold and he was astute enough to to comprehend it and deceit that there was a message that he was saying something how many of us this morning understand the prophet of God is saying something and it changed his attitude do you understand this young man ritual when he saw in Jesus he had an attitude change prophet of God says alike I think today this is a paragraph 38 I think today it hasn't changed too much Bible readers and Bible lovers when we really get a glimpse in our intellects intellects of what Jesus was and what he is it changes our entire attitude so that's what the preaching of the word of God's for is to change your attitude your attitudes the way you feel to things the way you respond to things the atmosphere that that you create around you and if I could say this the gospel is really trying hard to take us out of the negative attitude into a positive attitude your well-being is the purpose of the Gospel it isn't to judge you it isn't to condemn you he could do that with just the move of his little finger he's not interested in that he's interested in fellowshipping with you restoring you back to where you come from letting you know who you are he's got such a a positive uh desire and love in his heart for you in fact he so loved you he sacrifices only begotten son for you it must you know it must have killed him to see his son nailed to the cross looked at one of your children how would you like to stand by and and I couldn't do it if you try to take one of my boys and it could now I I would I I would do everything I could but yet he stood back you know why because he knew the results of that cross would be you with him back eternally oh that's the first thing that that this business that Jesus did it exchanged this man's attitude and and that's what I'm wanting to base this on this morning and to uh make mention of that to you this morning that maybe our attitudes would we would take into consideration as our Prophet mentioned and that this morning are thinking might change are thinking about what we're investing in the investment and this is what struck me that brought me to the importance of this he said this you don't need to show this but he says this he says our Bible tells us in Revelations the third chapter that the church in this age is going to be identified just like this Rich Young Hebrew boy Rich have need of nothing this lady you'll see a age if there happens to be a minister here or a Bible reader this is this is the need nothing no it's not thou because without our wretched blind poor naked and don't know it it's a sad thing of this scriptural quotation is so the reason that he brings this to us he says look at this rich Young Ruler and what what his thought process is what he's going through and if you do that you will get a real picture of the age that we live in the attitudes that we're in because correction is only correction when it exposes the air and gives to you the solution otherwise it's pure criticism you know if somebody came up to me says Ah that's terrible well I'd want an old cake what can I do about it what do I have to do to make it right well if someone would come up and say you know brother McGarry you're doing it all wrong if you would do it this way you would have better results you see the then that that's that's not criticism right so that could that's the the beauty of it see and so he he it's it's something that's for our well-being and so it gets to to make us more aware so you you've got to uh we've got to understand that it's our our uh he's trying to get to our attitude now he told us he said nobody just sits around and doesn't invest so what what does investment mean and that's what it means that you put something into it you you understand you put something in into something you're going to give it some investment you know we you we might say that study you that study sit down and study you're investing in your uh your whatever it is that you're seeking after maybe to be a nurse and you you want to invest in being a nurse well you just don't show up at the hospital and say I'm a nurse that's a get quick Rich Game you know or I did some online training you know you might put the bed Pine on somebody's head as a hat you don't know you get it all messed up there's you've got to invest you've got to invest in it because people that have set these uh certifications you invested to get that certification so to invest something means that that uh you've got to uh uh uh put something into it you know you you can't sit there and wish you got to do the work you got to do the work you know when you show up on your job uh you know and we got people that show up on jobs and collect money and if you show up on a job and you don't invest in that job and you don't do the work you're a thief that's right and you say well I just testify on the job you're a Biblical Thief does the Bible says there's a time and there's a season a time to work a time to talk time to sing you know we get DP that just goes oh I just what would you get anything that I know but I testify to a guy you robbed Robert you know you that guy might get to heaven but you're lost that's not kind of investment you invest in your job you invest in your work you get there you give it a hundred percent and then you receive the reward if you don't like the rewards you're receiving to your investment go to your moth say I'm working here you're not paying me enough that's not hard to do but you have to invest and there's something the prophet of God's cause this calls this message the investment so there's got to be something worth investing in yeah and I'd like you if they're read with me if you you you would that uh this paragraph 39. and the reason I take the time to read the paragraphs with you because I want you to understand that there's been a Vindicated profit sent to this day that's trying to get something across to you and if you don't listen to it and you don't invest in it and you don't understand what he's trying to say you miss it right so this guy saw it after it didn't he but then when he heard what was said that's where the problem came in so people in the map the prophet in search this in here to make it personal to each of us individually you've got to choose what you're going to put into something your every day's breath every heartbeat is put into something and I know the uh I thought this was quite a statement that when our brother was here testifying our brother Billy Paul he testified he said daddy told me if I was going to be a bum not to work one day of my life I know you're going to invest in being a bum be a bum you know what I mean don't don't worry about it be a bum what you're going to invest in be a bum he makes a statement he says now there's not a man that lives that in his right mind but what's always wondering where he come from who is he and where is he going just think of that there has been many books written philosophers has raised philosophers have raised and fell but there is only one book that'll tell you who you are where you come from and where you are going and that's the Bible it's the only book of all the fine books we have you could trash you could trash them everyone this is the truth anything contrary to this is not right Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall never fail Every Man's word shall be a lie God shall be true so you know what's he saying if we would say this this morning what is your view of yourself it's what he's asking any man in his right mind wants wants to know knows this he he wonders you know where did he come from where did I come from how did I get in this condition that I'm in not where did I come from my mommy and daddy but what path brought me to my present State of Mind what path brought me to the condition I'm in the depression I'm in the the the if I could say it this the the self-worthlessness that I have the complexes that I have the fears that I have the doubts that I have what brought me to the personality that I have the way I respond to things and so if we ought to ask that question and if you're in your right mind you ought to ask that question because all of us have all kinds of Mind battles going on and we don't realize that this mind battles are affecting us and these mind battles are going to cause us to go in a certain direction in that he says wonders where he's come from who he is and where he's going so where is this present mind thought that I have who am I and where am I going now if you if you don't have any of those questions if you don't have anything I would have to say that if he said you're not in your right mind then I'll let him speak for me because he's Vindicated so we're not just talking about a story we're talking about a story that is a reflection of our condition basically saying every single one of you this morning sits in the same spot that that Rich Young Ruler sat in because he identified the condition of the age is that clear so we we have it set right before us so we can look at ourselves right now this morning and say where did I come from what got me here you might be sitting in class because you might say how would I get into this class why am I here taking this class is this who really am I do I really want to be a nurse do I really want to do this do I really want to do that I'll let brother Adrian's testimony could be a vindication of what's being said this morning if you're in your right mind you're asking yourselves these questions yeah they might give a my own personal testimony my brother Dennis went overseas so he had a painting truck and ladders and everything so I thought you know what I'll do I'll just buy all that from them he can use the money to go on the mission field and I'll keep his business alive and when he gets back in six months because he's bound to be a failure I'll give it all back to him well six months turned into I don't know how many years so I had all this stuff and I could never do nothing halfway so all of a sudden I had 22 painters working for me I have five or six Vans I I put a you know I put a hundred and some miles on a pickup truck in one year one day I walked into a a house that I was painting and I thought I don't want to do this what got me here where is this taking me I mean it was just like what am I investing in what am I putting all my effort in where is it going what what's the outcome of it it can't and I began to view myself this isn't who I am I had to go back and and look at my attitude I had to go back and deeply consider go what was what was I putting into it and what the return was going to be and I don't know uh it wasn't my calling but I had to examine what it is that I'm investing in now we're not we're not talking about carnal but we're going to use the carnal or the natural to type the spiritual and because he said it's not good to leave something in your pocket but to put it into circulation could I say this stuff this morning it's not good to keep your faith in your pocket your faith needs to be in circulation we look at this break a thing that was here so this man came up and his attitude has changed he runs up and the only thing that the Lord Jesus can do is provide to him the opportunity the opportunity to put himself and answer the questions who am I where am I going uh uh what's the outcome of this how did I get here so he got there he realized he didn't possess eternal life maybe you've sat for church for years and you realize you don't you haven't really received the baptism of the Holy Spirit you believe with all your heart and that's good that's all you can do live it with everything you've got but if you're lacking something you ask him for it Lord give it to me knock and it shall be open seek and you shall find all that the father has given me I give to you take those promises and believe them and expect them to happen so he was given the opportunity so the opportunity to invest was given him you want eternal life do this he said I've done all those things and I still don't feel I have it and that's what happened it'll happen to you you come to the best church and you've got the best fellowship and the best preachers the best word in everything but there's something that's not satisfied on the inside that's what's lacking is the Deep that calls you understand that the boy lacked what sulfur the sulfur the need the lacking of sulfur was what was calling it was the deep that caused to the Deep if there's a dissatisfaction in your mind a dissatisfaction with your condition a dissatisfaction with where you're going a dissatisfaction with who you are that's the Deep that's calling and then there's a deep to respond to that he'll respond to that he'll answer those questions but the opportunity is given the opportunity was given to him to invest in eternal life but what what when it came down to it can he really looked at it uh in in it was the opportunity to to receive it you know what he just didn't invest because he didn't want to do what came with it you know he I think he saw the value of it but he wasn't willing to pay the price he wasn't willing to uh to take on what went with it because so if I could say it this way he he wasn't interested in the cost of it the price that it was he didn't want to take that challenge or he didn't want to invest that much into it you know he he was willing if it was a little lower cost or a little lower price if he didn't have to give is all you know I mean then he could have he could have got by with with uh just to say okay Lord I'm willing to give an hour a week I'm not willing you know there's another good couple that was offered an opportunity to invest in the Bible you know who that was don't you it was ananias and savira amen they were given the opportunity to invest into the kingdom but they they weren't sure of it they weren't sure of the investment it wasn't a hundred percent they didn't know what the return was so they held some back just in case good morning but there's one thing that's lacking he said sell all that you have give it to the poor and come follow me oh wait a minute all of a sudden eternal life didn't have the same value and that he didn't value eternal life may I say this you want to make the rapture right well in order to make the rapture you have to invest in the rapture it isn't an investment if you don't put anything into it and you can't tag along because every credential you understand that when you come to the gates of that City that there's the spirit of God is there to examine the credentials that there's the blood is there that the spirit is there that the investment is there he's looking at you say have you invested in this Kingdom have you invested in this city of gold have you invested in this New Jerusalem I I don't see that you've got a dime on the books you haven't put nothing extra into it you get the bare minimum well the bare minimum return is you miss the rapture you come up at the Judgment seat he exposes all your life all your sins and then you still get in but you're not living in that City you won't get the full reward you invested dime you get a dime you invest a dollar you get a dollar right what you saw is what you receive you invest in the world you get world it's a law of investment Jesus said that he gave man things and what he judging by how they invested how did you invest with what God gave you told the told Parable on it but we actually sit here wrap ourselves in a religious blanket called the message thinking that because he made it we're gonna made it but you just look at his investment into this message for what he believed he lost a wife he lost a child he lost a reputation he he suffered he went out and prayed for the sick tried to win souls live on sandwiches witnessing in the face another he didn't get there without putting anything into it now you didn't have to pay the price but there's still something that you invest you invest for return we just read what he said you look for something that's got good what good dividend good return you're going to invest in it because there's a return it's not a get rich quick scheme and there's I'm only going to put a little bit in and get a ton back you know like a Ponzi and all all of these business schemes he said that's not a long-term investment a long-term investment is something that gives continually returns for a long time now there's people that that invest in what they call short-term Investments they put a lot of money in to get a quick little bit of money on that real fast and then they've got they look for another short term and another short term but they're continually investing continuing investing I like the Long Haul you know I like more at the end than lots of little bits in between now I don't want to sell all that I can have from the word of God for a little sensation or a little feeling so let's just take a look at them a mark so he wasn't interested when he found out what it cost but the investment was made very clear to him it was worth investing in he said now he said this is uh he says this kind of in paragraph 45 this Hebrew lad being raised up in a home and knowed the Bible had clearly told them the Scrolls god Jehovah had said If they raise up one among you who is spiritual or a prophet I the Lord will make myself known to him in visions and in what he says comes to pass then hear that Prophet for I am with him but if it doesn't come to pass then don't hear it so he recognized that the investment was valid how many people have I seen fall from this message because they didn't think the investment was valid they didn't believe they fact they finally figured out that they could make the Rapture some other way than this oh Jesus Loves Me He died on the cross for me Jesus loved the Richmond ruler Jesus loved Judas the scripture said when he came he loved them but his love was the opportunity he still had to invest he had to put something into it and because to this man who he was where he come from and where he was going the only way for him to get eternal life and Jesus knew that by Discerning it that this man couldn't continue on the path he was going and have eternal life the only thing he had to do is cut away from the whole thing how many knows where the Bible says we find them we find them later with Lazarus at his gate and then we find them after that begging for Lazarus just to put a drop of water on his tongue because he missed the opportunity because the cost was too great but that cost was the only thing that was going to deliver him from who he was where he come from and where he was going do you hear me another he had to invest in something else and he had to invest big time because he had a big devil and Jesus knew this is the kind of investment that it's going to take you understand so here's what he determined he said in paying a language it's only sound thinking if he said it and it doesn't happen then it's a lie God did not say it but if he says it and it does happen it's truth and nothing is more more truer than truth so that was the determination that was the determination of whether it was Worthy to invest in if what he said comes to pass then you know this is worthy this is true this is worth investing in so when you sit back and you see him turn us back to the audience you see him tell what people say you saw him prophesy about the conditions of the hour about the condition of the day about our political country you see the lady in purple you see the test tubes you see them going hiding out and locking themselves away you see everything that's been said come to pass and you're still in question whether this is a worthy investment what are you holding on to that isn't it Worthy in other words this young man looked at it and he wasn't interested I'm sorry I'm really not interested I've determined that it's the truth I've determined that the judgment and the the the test of the investment is true see knowing that it's true didn't help him it was the cost of the Eternal Bond it was the cost of the title deed it was the cost of the abstract he wasn't willing to pay the price for eternal life now I'm just talking about attitude this morning are you willing to pay the price to invest in the rapture and we look at them right when we when we think about it and we see what that what that he did and and what where he was at he saw the test he saw it was good he saw it was everything but he didn't want to give up his traditions this is how he says it so this young man because paragraph 47 so this young man has seen the Lord Jesus and know that he held the keys to his eternal life am I drawing the picture good right this time come from a wealthy home he'd come from a religious background he had a lot to give and the only thing that would free him from that devil of where he was going and where that life was going to take him was for him to sell everything that he had Jesus didn't say that out of spite that would make him a liar and you can't have anything more than truth look at what happened to him he missed it and he found himself screaming out of the fires of Hell send Lazarus huh sorry you didn't invest you didn't put into it what was necessary so you've reaped what you sow a pardon's not a pardon until it's accepted as a pardon a revelation only takes on life when you accept it as being from God and not being intellect hey I don't want to go there alone I can't go there alone you are part of my inheritance it's all or none with God we're all gone so we all better invest in it we all got to see we're a part of it and that that elect lady will invest but he didn't want to he you know what he said he said he he had the keys to eternal life but he turned down the opportunity to make his investment he wasn't interested in such an investment although he was well identified that he was the son of God is perfectly identified the Virgin had conceived brought forth the son he had done every sign the Messiah was supposed to do this guy knew he had it his Revelation was so deep that he knew he was the result of the Virgin birth are you sold out that that's Malachi 4 5. that's the angel of Revelations 10 7 are you sold out are you so absolute true that he's the absolute that there's one voice one Prophet Messenger to each age and that profit messenger has what the spirit of God is saying to that age or are you weighing your Investments are you looking at other opportunities I just can't believe God put Adrian up here to say what he said that's in the mouth of two or three Witnesses under pressure and indebtedness he had a way out he called me I said Adrian well tell them both if you need to because your mother is sick that's true but he said I but I can't leave out the other I said well good tell them both now he can choose which one he wants Adrian walked in here said God told me not to go amen buddy you are crazy but you know something he was willing to pay the price if it cost him his job his career everything but let me tell you there's fiction it'll be a tremendous Liberty amongst the Spanish people people speaking people that have been in nickel lady and bondage and that man back there that paid that price is a great part of their Deliverance [Music] but he wasn't willing to give up his traditions now our little pea brain thinks he wasn't willing to give his religion that wasn't his traditions his Traditions was who he hung out with who we did business with that was his tradition it was his way of life Jesus was asking him come change your way of life he said Lord can I just give no I don't want you to give I don't want you to use your money I want you to sell all your money you follow me you won't need it because down the road I'm going to give a power down the road I'm going to give a return on your investment but here he is he doesn't want to give it up he doesn't want to give up his life he doesn't want to get about what he does on Saturday he doesn't want to do what he does on on the morning where he meets with the guys and he discusses his business he doesn't want to give up the power and the authority he doesn't want to give up his position oh that's too much it was such a strong pull he he knew that was the prophet he actually knew that was the Virgin that was promised by Isaiah brother Birmingham just said he did wouldn't pay it now that scares me could ask me one question what am I holding on to who am I how did I get here and what condition I'm in right now where am I going to be with it and it might behoove me to invest a little bit and investigate a little bit and find out if I have I have been up an investment opportunity that I need to make into the rapture but we just don't want to hear it's too unusual every other voice is saying live any way you want to you can live any way you want to God's going to come get you he said he was going to come kill you you don't have to invest in it it's free no it's not free the opportunity for you was paid for you think when he said come follow me Matthew had the opportunity you don't think Matthew heard you have some fairy tale uh two watching too many movies how it went Matthew knew who that guy was he knew how he paid his taxes he had a full understanding and when he started seeing Jesus come down that street he was going whoa you think he was just all smiles I'll tell you what he was he was shaking in his boots that seed that was in him started the pulsate he could feel it all over him [Music] isn't it that was the prophet of God told us we've got to learn to understand that pulsation that call began to wreak reap in him he thought oh no look at this guy he's different he's unusual he pays his taxes out of fish bellies he did you know he's a guy that told them I thought we were going to attack get him on tax evasion or tax conspiracy and he said oh whose image has done that render to Caesar the things that are Caesar to God the things of the God why do you think they trapped them they may have even tried to throw the Trap at the advice of the position that Matthew had Matthew may have been the very guy that set the trap to Jesus to fulfill the tax laws but we're living in a religious Bible story fake fantasy it's time to bring this gospel down to earth and ask ourselves do I have that life or have I invested in it you just don't put a sign around your neck and say I'm a Christian I'm going in the Rapture that's a get quick Rich scheme and any preacher that's offering you that is offering you a sensation is offering you a free ticket is lying to you the kingdom of God is taken with Force you've got to possess the gates of the enemy you have got to fight the Mind battle you have got to make it sound you have got to make a decision you've got to invest your life you've got to die but he didn't want to pay the clock cost he said but in order to accept him he had to get away from all his traditions he had to turn away from it and we don't want to turn away from our dish video game tradition Cowboy game tradition Sports tradition music tradition I love Christians today so what they do is I I'll tell you I'm standing right here I witnessed it exactly for myself I went into the Christian bookstore the one that used to be on that Big Church where Trinity Broadcasting was I went in there and they had a great big wreck and it said if you like Dolly Parton here are the Christian musicians that's got her sound and they listed worldly art after worldly artists and the music that was done in their Style now I'm not going to start a music Crusade I'm just saying it's so close to the the very elect it would deceive the very elective was possible that's why he said you have to examine the investment and examine the return God doesn't ask for an investment if you leave your father and mother if you give it'll be given to you a hundredfold in this life or the life to come come follow me bury your cross Satan has desired to Sifty like sand but I have prayed for you I mean we're starting to to preach this message like it's a free ticket Christian Life Tabernacle Baptist message believers nothing against the Baptist they're sincere and I believe there's a reward for them based on what they've done but but the the problem is is is that they they don't want to move up that that's what he said he said he says he said just listen to this he says that's where the where we people have got we've joined Church which is all right we do those things but you say you are a Christian I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a presbyterian I'm a Pentecostal or something else it's a tradition and there's no entering in sincerity anymore unless you don't have to be sincere anymore you don't have to get you don't don't have the preacher put any heat on us I don't want to put the heat on you but I've got something I've got to meet and I have got to be able to stand on that day and said I have declared unto them the Full Gospel I never put my thoughts in it I read to him what your messenger said because I have enough against me on that day and if I can just get in on that I'm going to do my best if that's the only place I can invest I'm going to give it my all he said they won't move up cope up with the scriptures and things they just live any way they want to and the rest of it you know so they they don't they don't want to move up they don't want to get any stronger any higher any more spiritual they they they they don't want to gain something you invest to gain you don't put a hundred dollars into something at the promise of getting a gain and didn't get a hundred dollars back I don't want to put an investment into something that has a losing record that has continued to fail and man has continued to fail in every age you want to invest in Civilization look at it Civilization now this is so scary but we don't want to cope with it we don't want to move up we don't want to take these thoughts into our investment strategy we don't want none of the truth of things to determine how we're going to live or how we're going to change our life or how we're going to change our attitude but they're passing a law now in California If the child under your roof decides that they want to be called she instead of HE and you withstand it the state can take it away from you that's the world that you're investing in that you can steal up to eight hundred dollars free of charge that's the world you know what it's all fine tell it you're eight hundred dollars all those people in New York oh let them come in it's wonderful we're the Open Country uh we're uh what do they call that a sanctuary City some little guy in a wheelchair in Texas decided to send 200 000 of the 2 million he had he only gave him ten percent perfectly scriptural and all of a sudden it's on their dirt oh we got to do something oh we got to do something to close the border close the barter well if 200 000 worked send them 200 000 more you get more return this is what's going on this is what the bride of Jesus Christ is investing in it's investing in the world it's investing in their jobs it's investing in their their temporary future they're putting nothing into the kingdom of God nothing I'm thankful for the brothers that showed up the other day I I'm thankful well you know I I just wonder sometimes they don't want to move up spiritually the investment has got returned it's got gain it makes you stronger so the the more you put in the more you get out of it that's a quote you know that you get in you get out of it exactly what you put into it if you've come to find something to criticize you'll find something to criticize if you come looking for the spirit to move if you've come for God to speak to your heart if you've come to sit back and watch how the psalm how the testimony and how the scriptures all fit together and you can't see God in it you've got blinded because you've got you've not taken the isab for this day you haven't put on the gold Trident fire you haven't clothed yourself in white randomly you want you didn't want to invest in it you didn't pray this morning you didn't read the scripture if I sat in this church and the prophet preached to me out of the the Palmer worm the Caper and Ida went home and read it I would have got on the same page but you'll walk out of here and you won't remember it because you've got something else to invest in and you don't believe he's here that he could Veil himself in something like this that can't speak that can't talk right that can't raise the emotional excitement we can't even seem veiled in flesh not just me all of you in one another's lives Adrian may not be a genius when it comes to all the scriptures I don't know but he knew when God talked he recognized the word in its day and he invested into it what do you think he's got coming I say by the word of God he's got a hundred fold in this life and the life to come what do you got in it how much prayer do you have in it I did somebody else mentioned tide say I never but he said you do it that gets an investment you know prayer is not used just to meet a momentary challenge prayer is Money in the Bank excuse that expression but the prophet of God said he says we got a whole account but we don't know how to write the check because we never invested in how to learn how to write the check we've never invested on the in the approach how do you approach them how about fasting about praying we don't do none of that we grab our school book and we bury our nose in it oh my goodness I'm I'm going to learn this I'm going to go take this test and I'm going to make seventy thousand dollars a year that's poverty you know why he's going to do that to the world because God came to the poor in this world rich in faith so you better invest in something that's not going to lose its value but if you invest in the world it loses its value it loses its value every day you know another thing that makes you lose your value is age I had a guy there to tell me I'm stuck with this job because nobody's hiring anybody over 50. I say you've got the wrong recruiter you get Jesus Christ as your recruiter he'll find you a job when you're 99. why because his investment said I shall not see the righteous big bread it says word but if you don't invest in that policy if you don't take that policy and invest in that until that becomes a reality on your heart then you're wanting it to produce a return on its own and you don't have any skin in the game you understand that you know you know if somebody offers to sell you a card zero percent down and you can't make the payment you know what they know they've inflated that car to you you're going to lose it and they can sell it again you're just a pawn in their game if you really love somebody you won't let them get into that position but they don't want to gain something they don't want to invest prayer is Money in the Bank you look you don't you you it builds up and it builds up and it builds up and one day you got to make a withdrawal but it's there to withdraw you can all of a sudden run you get in the back like oh God oh God please help me out of this mind I'm so bad Oh Lord You're so wonderful you're I believe you I believe you now but why didn't you put money in the account I've got nothing to draw on that little boy when he is in court he said your honor I stand on my record he says that's a problem son you don't have one you want to go on the Rapture you don't have a record of prayer you don't have a record of fasting you don't have a record of trying to win souls you try you know why you don't believe it you do not believe that there is going to be a translation of your body and there is a people that are going to leave this earth there are people that come from God and are going to God [Applause] you're not sold out you got hope so it's okay to have hope so but today There's an opportunity being presented to you to reconsider your investment strategy [Music] I like this investment I want to cope up hey man I I want to cut away my traditions I want to cut away the things that are keeping me from moving up but I want to return you understand that if you don't invest prophet of God said it's not good to keep your money in your pocket it'll be stolen now you just maybe think about someone going in and stealing the money out of your pocket because I don't know I usually don't bring my wall it's strange that I have it I have five dollars here you know I can turn this five dollars into 50. you don't think I can you need five dollars you don't you need five dollars you need five dollars EJ have need of nothing I could say this five dollars just for the first person that comes up here and gets it you know what I know I'm getting 50 back Lord showed me a long time ago if I turn off the faucet the water stops flowing I give 200 I got 400. I give a thousand I got a thousand to give oh I don't got a thousand for me I'm never turning it off let it flow because you cannot out give God but do you know what this five dollars would have bought you two years ago two gallons of gasoline now what does it buy one half of this has been stolen from me it's called inflation and if you don't continue to invest so you have 10 instead of five inflation will take the worth of everything you have away from you and the world the inflation inflation means inflated it means the increase the more abundance of in other words the cost of food has gone up the cost of gas has gone up the cost of clothing has gone up and all of a sudden your money can't buy what it used to buy you know what most people do I get a hundred dollar checks a month I'm grateful for them it's not my money it's God's money I just can't believe that's all you're living on you're living on a thousand dollars a month you're a miracle or you've been robbing from somebody I'm sorry I'm just talking about making the Rapture you don't have to make the rapture you don't have to invest I'm not talking about salvation I'm talking about an investment above salvation I'm talking about I'm not missing this flight amen but I have a fall black Plan I remember a guy came to me and said God told me to go to this meeting over here he said but if I can't get a ride I'm going to this meeting you had an Exit Plan from the will of God I had started walking and I'd say God if you told me to be there I'm going to have a Philip experience if God said so how many Believers are rapture so if you don't it'll shrink will be evil of the world you understand it would get so wicked that the righteous would scarcely be saved so your spiritual condition can no longer meet the challenge of the hour you've got to start investing more in your spiritual condition else your spiritual experience will inflate and now it won't be worth anything it won't be able to move a devil it won't be able to heal the sick it won't be able to deliver your family it won't be able you to sit down with your child and lead them to the Lord it will be worthless I don't want to be worthless how can I be relevant how can I meet the challenge is to revest invest in something that's got returned a return on my investment I want to invest in something that'll give power to heal the sick I want to invest in something that'll keep me through hard times that'll give me peace and joy I want to invest in something that'll defeat Satan depression weariness anxiety something that'll guide me counsel me and comfort me that's what I want to invest in I need the returns that'll fight the enemy of this hour and you can't live on yesterday's manna that's why he put it spiritual food in due season in a warehouse so his Spirit can go in here at the time it was needed take this message out and tell my people they're not investing in eternal life they're not getting any returns on the religious experience that they're living in fact their experience is shrinking Satan's robbing it from them robbing it from them they have less power less faith less belief less self-esteem more doubt more fear why they didn't continue investing and they're investing shrunk I don't want the church to shrink you know the scripture says wherever two are gathered together there all be he sent them out in pairs because the Bible says two are better and one if one Falls who would lift them up I don't want to be the only one if I'm going to take on a high risk investment and I need to raise capital I don't put all mine in it I get 15 people to join with me can I give the church today to join with me in investing in the rapture that the power of God would move can I apply the token can I kick out the cigarettes kick out the wine kick out this kick out that go in there and say I'm getting rid of all these things that are investing me that are depriving me that are inflating my experience that are making my experience of no value no power no good to me I'm going to change that out with prayer and reading my Bible and investing and looking after my brother and laying a pattern of good works go home sit down and write me a list of your good works I hope it takes five pins to do it but I don't hope you're not sitting there going to go to church uh I read my Bible that's all you it's all about you what have you done for somebody else what soul have you on you know how much winning assault's worth ten thousand worlds if you could get ten thousand worlds would you invest in ten thousand worlds if I could give you ten thousand Caribbean islands and all it took was to win one soul to Christ I'm telling the world if you don't invest spiritually what you have shrinks in this hour I was afraid he said he took from them that did nothing and gave it to the one who was willing to invest foreign does it pay off let's read with me this last paragraph and we'll close if I could stand in my own defense the prophet of God said sometimes you just got to clinch it down the message has been made clear to us it's undoubtedly the angel of Revelation 10 7 has failed himself in this messenger the prophetic scripture of Malachi 4 5 has come to pass in this body called William Branham you say he's no longer here he didn't come to be here he came to leave a message Revelation and stored up food and the investment opportunity for who's ever willing to invest foreign he said Jesus said this is 99 Jesus said to that woman you may be a virtuous as you can be but you'll answer for adultery in that day of judgment for wearing those clothes Jesus said whoever looketh upon a woman and lust after her he has committed adultery with her already in his heart you think she would have invested in some new clothing loser look lose the image of herself in the mirror you ever see these people that have these real old heritages from years ago because they think they look pretty in that they won't move up they won't cope they don't want a change of tradition they don't want to change the style with their already in his heart no matter how innocent you are that sinner will answer for adultery and you'll be the one presented it you say I can't help what he thinks you presented the opportunity you sisters who continue to wear high heels and you continue to wear tight dresses you will answer for adultery I don't care how many pictures of the pillar or fire you hang in a wall you know why you do it you love it you love the man whale makes you look you think if you can get those heels up like this the back side of you won't look so big you're ate up and investing in the wrong thing you can put makeup on to cover those wrinkles all you want that might last for 20 years but one day when you wash your face it's more wrinkled than the prune would you take a sister that's not worn makeup all her life she gets up there that Skin's Fair it might have wrinkles in it but it's right in those who look upon the Lord are radiant they just didn't want to invest in a little temporary shame a little reproach they didn't want to Bear it they didn't want to identify it like the little boy logging cap what did they do when they found out you were a Christian oh don't worry mommy they never found out see she said no matter how innocent you are you Christians aren't you ashamed you should act like Daughters of God and you man members of the church deacons even to ministers will permit your lives to do that you should be sons and of God it don't sound like the behavior of a Son of God with nature of his father in him afraid to say something because the organization would turn you out that's right now listen to this we're going to talk about the return on investment Daniel purposed in his heart that he wasn't going to defile his investment he purposed no matter what the world how rich the king gets how much he tries to get me off of the things of the world I'm going I'm not going to do it I'm going to I am not going to defile my investment oh Christian world don't defile your investment that you've made in eternal life you'll pollute it he said Daniel purpose he wouldn't do it it paid off by Saving his life when he was thrown into the lion's dead his investment really paid off yeah man the Hebrew children were determined that they would not worship an idol and it paid off by saving their life in the fiery furnace the investment pays off are you investing today in something that will pay off not only in the life to come but in this life I'm telling you invest in the word of God because what the world's fixing to do and force on us you'll have something that can meet the challenge of the day and make a payoff I I I call you as your brother ask yourself everything thinking man sits back and asks himself where did I come from how did I get in this condition who am I am I really this and where am I going where is my investment taking me I give
