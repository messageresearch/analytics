together heavenly father we want to express our gratefulness lord to have eyes to see lord that we would want to assemble ourselves together in obedience to your word lord and looking with anticipation father what you would speak to us individually lord we have faith god that that's exactly what you'll do lord if we have a need you'll address it god for you made us lord that way and we thank you for it lord jesus and we just want to express our thankfulness lord for your faithfulness to continue to perform this work in us to bring us unto that stature of a perfect man lord we have confidence oh god and i believe that you'll fulfill that in our lives individually lord we pray you take the man of god that set himself aside this morning and preparing for this service lord that you would be a vessel for your spoken word lord god we commit this service to you lord all the worship and may our hearts lord just be as one god as we approach the throne of grace lord we thank you in jesus name amen amen we're going to invite brother mike would come with our psalm reading this morning i just want to welcome you in the house of the lord and excited to hear from the lord today and give them praise and worship and just give them all the adoration we can together as a body amen good morning you know probably without question the most familiar psalm if not the most familiar chapter in the book of the bible is the 23rd psalm you know it used to be that you could ask any random person on the street what the 23rd psalm was and they could seem quoted from memory from their days in sunday school or whatever might be the case maybe not so much anymore but you know it's still arguably probably the most well-known scripture in the entire bible in pop culture and denomination probably there's hundreds of churches that stand up every morning and read the psalm the 23rd psalm together you know certainly any of us could probably quote that from memory but you know as believers i wonder if we recognize the significance of the statement that's being made in psalm 23. you know the very first verse begins with the phrase the lord is my shepherd and the whole rest of the chapter lists the effects the benefits of him being your shepherd you know but the thing is is that though it's quoted by everyone this chapter isn't for everyone you know all the benefits all the comforting statements everything that might be offered as a a prayer of comfort or words of encouragement or assurance if you don't first know the shepherd none of the other verses apply you know and if you're not experiencing the things that psalm 23 describes you could ask then who is your shepherd because if he's your shepherd these are the things that are attributes of his work but you can't benefit from the attributes of his work unless he's your shepherd you know isaiah 53 6 describes the human race as a group of wandering sheep it says all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and outside the presence of a shepherd and entrusting ourselves to that shepherd we're just wandering through life trying to find our way especially in a very confusing age in matthew 9 36 when jesus was here you know he looked out at the multitudes and it says in matthew 9 36 it says and when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd so they were faint they were weary they were scattering they were wandering because they did not have the shepherd you know john 10 that entire chapter speaks of a shepherd it says in verse 14 i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep you know not everyone who's a sheep has him for their shepherd there are those that are his sheep and that's who the 23rd psalm speaks of you know i wonder if we read psalm 23 this morning if you just look at that through the lens of he is my shepherd and i pray that he is otherwise you're just a wandering sheep you know the good shepherd says in john 14 16 i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth and then down in verse 26 6 it says but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you do you see the shepherd notice he said comforter as we'll read in psalm 23 thy rod and thy staff they comfort me you know you look even at verse 1 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want you know there's scriptures that speak about what that means psalm 84 11 no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly psalm 34 10 they that seek the lord shall not want any good thing see that it's not with this shepherd it's not like all of a sudden you're showered with things and you no longer have want but he changes what you want and you're satisfied your want changes you look in psalm verse 2 he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters not just any pasture you know it says in psalm 95 7 for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand it says in psalm 103 know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture you know a shepherd is known by the pasture his sheep are in oh that pasture belongs to so and so so that's his sheep and the sheep are known by the pasture they're feeding it you see psalm 23 is only four a specific kind of sheep who have him as their shepherd you know we could go on and on and looking through that but you know i think the important thing is is to make sure that he is your shepherd and even it happens to all of us you go about your daily life and you find yourself struggling with a decision or a circumstance or whatnot if psalm 23 isn't applying to your circumstance you might check and see if you are allowing the shepherd to be your guide you know as we read psalm 23 this morning just be mindful of john 10 it says and when he putteth forth his own sheep on someone else's he goeth before them he prepared the table before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers i don't know about you but i am grateful that there's a shepherd in this day and age i don't know how you could find your way through all the voices and all the chaos and all the influences if there wasn't some superseding shepherd voice that a certain type of sheep could follow so i hope as we read this to this morning you know psalm 23 will have a little bit of significance the lord is my shepherd amen let's read that together starting in verse 1. the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anoinest my head with oil my cup runeth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever may god bless you you have your seats sing this song is the lily of the valley amen i have found a friend in jesus and he's everything to me [Music] all i need cleanse [Music] [Music] the right [Music] [Music] [Music] world oh me and save jesus [Music]

before i can even leave the house and amen but i'm thankful i can stand on my two feet i'm thankful i could take my bible and come and share his goodness once again and when you realize if in the health you cannot take it for granted everything we have we cannot take it for granted so therefore whatever he gives us we have to bring it back to him and glorify him with it and praise him with it because he deserves all of that let's just bow our heads this morning our gracious father what a privilege to be gathered with your saints this morning in the house of god lord to lift up our voices and to bring our testimonies together testimonies of praise of good things that you have done and and father when we look back and we see where we are today lord it's all been nothing but your goodness and your grace guiding us and leading us every step of the way lord and we're here so your word can speak to our hearts lord and we hear so we may receive of you lord we hear that we may as a prophet will say that we may find out our weak points and our low points and that we may take all of that and give it to you so that we may be strengthened this morning lord bring your word in such a way that it would touch each and every individual this morning that we can say surely it was good to be in the house of god we love you this morning we commit all that we are and invite you that you will be the guest of honor in all that we do we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen man god bless you want to welcome once again everyone in the house of god all our visitors amen greetings from our pastor brother david i spoke with them last night he's doing well and it's doing some work around the house the mom's house and trying to get all the things taken care of him and amen let's open our bibles in matthew chapter five matthew chapter 5 let's go to verse 40. it says and the if any man will sue thee at the law and take away that court let him have that clock also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twin it says give to him that asked thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn out it says turn not thou away as he have heard that it has been said thou shall love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecut and despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye i want you to think about the the the the shift or the change that is bringing its disciple to of what way they've known and where they going and and and it says uh for ye love them which love you what what reward have ye do not even the publican uh do the the same and if you salute your brethren only what what do ye more than others do not even republican so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect let's also turn in first corinthians 13 verse 9. it says for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when now which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with in fact this is the interpretation of the scripture we just read above they did it in part that's what they were taught but but when christ came he showed him a better way to do it he showed him a more excellent way for them to approach it he says when us when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as i am known i am also i am known and now abideth faith hope and charity these it says these three but the greatest of these is charity you may have your seats man let's also turn one more scripture before you close your bible actually two more hebrews chapter 6 we're going to start from verse 1. it says therefore it says it says therefore leaving the principle of the doctrine of christ let us go unto perfection not laying again the foundation of of repentance from dead works and of faith towards god of the doctrine of baptism or of laying on our hands and of the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment this will this will this will we do if god permits in matthew 11 and chap chapter 11 and verse 2 he writes it says now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent the two of his disciples and said unto him it says although and i'll pastor read the scripture a couple of weeks ago and we just want to reference it again it says they said unto him thou he that should come or do we look to another jesus answered and said unto him go and show john again those things which ye have heard and seen and and he kind of brings into light the things which i have heard in sin it says the blind received the sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death the death here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them in other words what what jesus was doing here he was basically instead of answering john and saying go tell him yes that's it no he took the manifestation of the word and he brought it back to john which was the interpretation of the scripture that was given he took the manifestation the things which have seen the things which have heard what are you seeing now what are you hearing now he told them to go and tell john about those things because he knew that was the confirmation of the things of the promise that they were waiting for this morning just for a few minutes i want to speak on moving to perfection moving to perfection as we just read there are many things that we come across in the bible and and the things even in our natural realm it's it's hard to the things of god are not to be interpreted by men's mind we understand that we in fact the scripture tells us that that the things of god are foolish to men and the things of man are foolish to god god's thinking and men's thinking are not made to walk together in the scripture tells us that carnal mind is enmity against god why because of the way we've been trained to think the way we've been brought up everything about us you know i was thinking we we think about fairness you say you have to be fair and and yet you go in the scripture and the scripture says that uh jacob if i love an eso if i hate it and one will hear such a thing and said uh before the children have we even done any good or uh or evil but the purpose for election of god may be fulfilled one will look and say how can he he didn't even do anything in fact if you were to put the two together you will put jacob and you will put esau it seems like israel was the more acceptable son it seems like esau was the more a son who wanted to do good who took care and issa who was a cheister jacob as a chaisto was the one that god chose and we find the premises of god choosing was the fact that that that jacob regarded the birthright as the most important thing and god looked at it as righteousness to him so we see what we call justice or what we call a fairness within the saints of a human mind sometimes running contradiction with what the scripture tells us about those things and we think fairness it means fair to all and everybody receiving equal everybody being at the same then that's fairness but we fail to realize when we come to god god is not to be compared with our carnal mind when we say god is just it doesn't mean we have some form of understanding of justice somewhere where we put god on one scale and our understanding of justice on the other scale and way god to say whether god is just or not no when we say god justice is god himself righteousness is god himself truth is god himself is not to be compared with another but he himself is those things he himself is the very reflection of those things so when we say the truth we don't take it and compare well truth means it has to be equal to this it has to match with this it has to match with that then that's true no if he came out of the mouth of god that's truth if he came out of god it's righteous whatever he says is right and whatever he thinks is true oh i tell you whatever he thinks he brings it to pass how many times we have vain thoughts within our mind we'll think about this and and then jump on and think about the other and turn our minds and think about in other things and everything but we realize that the mind of god the moment he's become a mind and spoken that which he has spoken will come to pass so therefore we we when we come to the bible it's important that we come to the understanding that when we read these things that he has said about us when we read these things that he has said in the scripture that's the righteousness of god and there's nothing that can change it anything that's built outside of this foundation of god will fail anything that's built up on this understanding that god is establishing will not stand so if we come here we say oh he looked at the scripture says when lucifer's sin when iniquity was found within his heart god cast him from heaven down the scripture tells us but yet when adam sinned the scripture says god didn't apply the same thing he come and he in fact he provided a lamb and he provided a sacrifice to redeem this one one can look and say that's not fairness that's the carnal mind but to god that's fairness that is fairness why because what he does is true what he does he cannot be compared with some understandings of man with what we see out there where everyone has his own definition about what's supposed to be right what's supposed to be just and everything and that's why the whole world is collapsing why because it's built upon the understanding of man that changes every minute now as we read the scripture here in matthew chapter 5 it says be imperfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now he he he just told them what they should do and he just uh uh i told them in matthew uh uh uh in matthew and here he was and he was telling them i'm sorry matthew 40 here is telling them what they should do he said don't just don't just love the one that love you don't just do good to the one that loves you don't just do this because that's what the public can also are doing he's trying to establish the difference between the children of the kingdom and the children of the world he's trying to bring apart and bring them to a place to an understanding where they need to know that they were not made to be like the others that were made to be different that they were made to be an extension of what god's thinking was they were meant to be an extension of god's love for the people that were made to be exactly like their father was and i want to say this here it says be perfect isn't as your father in heaven is perfect i want to say this there could never be a call to perfection unless there was something that was provided in order for you to be perfect you in other words you can ask the dog to lay an egg because it's not within the nature of a dog it's a mammal that can't produce that but you can ask that to a chicken or you can ask that to a bird but therefore when god comes and he says be perfect it's because you the scripture says that you were once the children of unrighteousness you were somewhat the same as the world you as he quickened he's taken you out of the world and he's bringing you and he brought you and he give you the new birth so you can become the son of righteousness and therefore when he says be imperfect it's because he knows within you he has put the potential for perfection and and i want to say this this morning because it's very important when the scripture says be perfect as your father in heaven is perfect is directly connecting you to god it's a direct link from you your birth you i want to say this your birth is not the the birth that your parents brought you here on earth and who your parents were naturally that's not the birth that i'm talking about every one of us had that kind of birth but this breath that i'm talking about is the birth that he the lord himself has come and has changed you from what you were he's giving you the new birth and taking away your old nature it's taken away the desires of the world he's brought you from the kingdom of darkness in the kingdom of light and is looking at you this morning and you say be imperfect and i don't want you looking at me this morning saying oh i can't i can't i can't do this i can't overcome this i'm struggling with it because if you say that then the scripture is not true but what i'm telling you this morning is he's calling you to win because within you there's a potential to be that so therefore stop saying i can't and begin to say i can why can i because he told me that i can because his word is calling me to perfection therefore i don't have to act like the world i don't have to think like the world the first thing i need to change is my thinking took away my thinking my inability the things that i cannot do and rely on his word and what he says in order for me to achieve it so he's made you a new creation a new creature you have been born by the spirit of god he is your father your heavenly father and is perfect so therefore when he says be imperfect is only asking you to be like your dad the one who's birthed you the one who brought you here the one who changed your life from the sin that you were in into the kingdom of righteousness therefore i want to say this righteousness is your portion this morning holiness is your portion this morning godliness is your portion this morning the holy ghost is your portion this morning let us get out of the thinking of man where you coming you're like oh god oh god i need this i need this he's telling you this morning come up higher i have made you perfect i created you by my own seed and my seed in you will bring you to perfection so the scripture began to say he began to say he says again in matthew 13 if you can turn there this is the parable of the sower it says and it says another parable he put forth and unto them saying the kingdom of heaven his lack and unto man which soweth good seed matthew 13 and 24 it says good seed in this field and it says but while the man slept his enemy came and saw terror among the wheats and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruits then appears to tear also so he so the servants of the household came and said unto him sir i said did i not they did not that i saw the good seed in the field from whence then had the tear its tares it says he said unto them an enemy had done this the servant said unto him well will thou send will thou then will that then that we do and gather them up but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up also the weed with him but he said but let them both grow until the harvest and in the time of the harvest i will say unto the rapper i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tear and bind them in in bundles to be burned them to bed to burn them but gather the wheat into my barns now i want you to realize here the air is jesus telling his disciples about the end time and the things that's supposed to take place now he's he's specifically speaking about a duel happening at the end time that we're going to see he he's saying that okay the first thing that's going to happen is let them grow we know that we know the parable we know that jesus explained it how that the good seed were the children of the kingdom the one who so was the son of man so the seed the one who saw the tare was the enemy was the devil and the the harvest time is the end time and we know all those things so now he's telling them but i want you to realize now he's talking about two things that's happening at the end time one of them is the fact that one seed was so another was so in the beginning but at the end time there's going to be two things that will happen the first one was to gather up all the tears together now remember he told them not to do it while the seed was young because in doing so it will hurt the seed but he's speaking about a certain maturity or a certain perfection that will be within the seed that when the time of the harvest will come that it will give them the ability to come and gather up all the tares without hurting the seed so it will tell in them about the time that will come where all the tears will be gathered together in other words is talking about the end time when the manifestation will come it says talk about the end time where we can see all the tares gathered together where the churches uh the the the the churches will come together where the confederation of churches will happen where darkness will be upon the earth where all these things will happen it says when that happens it says then we can come and gather up the seed why because the maturity or the perfection of a seed is when the seed that was planted into the ground come into the very maturity of what went into the ground is when you can come the maturity of a plant or the perfection of a plant is when a mango went into the ground and you're able to see a mango come to back forth it's not just when we can bring up leaf it's not just when the tree is growing but it's when you can see the fruits of something and and equate it to what was planted is when the manifestation of something becomes the very fruit of it is when you look at the fruits and it gives you the identification of what went into the ground that's when the perfectionist comes he says they will come to the church the church will grow up the church started just as a little at pentecostal church it came on the day of pentecost god came and he saw his seed he started his church and and yet he went to sanctification and justification and sanctification to the baptism of the holy ghost that and he was moving forward and every forward but then he comes to a place where that church becomes the manifestation of what really actually went into the ground becomes into the manifestation of jesus christ himself and he says when it comes to that time it will be the perfect identification where you will not come to the field and confuse the terror with the seed it's not going to be a time where you look and say is this the tail or is this the seed or or can i take this or can i take that it will be so clear that's why the prophet tells us it says in the air it says when it's still very low or when it's at the beginning it's hard to tell the difference the air when it's just here it's still very hard to tell apart but it says let it go as he began to progress as he began to come forth and everything and it's as it's coming into its perfection it becomes more and more clear which is the seed and which is not the seed and here is telling them it says that that in the evening time i will come it says the manifestation will be so real that you'll be able to tell them both apart now i want to say this he's saying that because we as the church of god have been called to come into the maturity of the seed that went into the ground we have been called into such a manifestation where the scripture says that in fact i'll read it in a moment here but one of them says that she the bride will become will it will be her instead of christ she will be the representation of christ in other words she will be there at the place where you'll be looking for christ she will be there because she will be just like he is now that's very important to us because the the the end time manifestation it is not a time for babies it's not the time for uh for for for children's behavior it's not a time for confusion you know i want to say this because but when i preach a message uh uh uh satan's eden or god of this evil age how that the devil what he wants us to do is to miss the mark what he wants us to do is to fail to realize the promise for the day and to be caught up in everything except what has been promised to us to be caught up in all kinds of things to be displaying all kinds of things of the world except what we have been called for then we worshipping him because remember worship for the devil all it takes is just the same way that eve doubt one word that's all it takes for you to worship the devil the the devil's worship is not uh uh uh uh one like uh like who would say with the horns and and now presents himself and say i am the devil i am the devil no the devil's worship is when the word has been put aside is when the word has not been taken into totality is when the manifestation or the understanding of the promise is what has been for the edge to pass is when the devil or something has been misplaced and the world is not matching anymore that's the devil worship it will do anything to cause you to disbelieve the word to misinterpret the word to put the word for another age to set aside what has been given to you so you can worship him now i i want to say this um the promised word for our age the barbarian will will tell us it says the promise is that the church that started at pentecost it progressed through faith and through knowledge and temperance and godliness and brotherly kindness and all these things will come and be joined by the head christ himself which is the head of the church in other words is to for us to come into the stature of the perfect man is to us to be brought up back into the stature of the perfect man now prabhanam says in question and answer he says this he says this is in 64. a question and answer he says first corinthians 13 says when that that when not which is in part has come when that when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with i want you to think about this when that which is in part in when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with he says so all these little things of shouting of jumping all the little things of jumping up and down like like a kid trying to talk in tongue and all those things when that which is perfect so now he he is showing the the the current circumstance what's happening right now there's the jumping there's the trying to speak in tongues there's all those uh kids behavior that's been put on display but it says when that which is perfect it says then what do we have today so trying to speak in tongue and all the other things that which when that which is prophetic has come it says and and and we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with the fine vindication then that which is in part is done away with now i really want to press this within our heart because it's very important when that is which is perfect uh and i'll read the definition perhaps later it doesn't mean perfection when we say that which is important not which is perfect there's no such thing as casting away the word of god because we understand it's all the word but but we are progressing and going somewhere so what that which is in part he says when we have what we have in part we speak in part we prophesy important we do all of this but when the perfect come it's the swallowing up together of all the things that has been going on it's the moving on forward to the more excellent way is the moving forward to a more perfect way it's the moving on together to the manifestation of the hour are you with me to the manifestation of the hour because oh my brother my sister if we are at the end time this is the time where what luther remember the prophet of this age was to tie all the loose hands of what has been left left by luther and by by by all the other messengers and all the others was to bring him all together why to bring up the perfection of god on display we can sit here today and say we have seen the perfect one come and i want to say this this is not perfection in the sense when we say when that is perfect will come meaning we have today as it says well the the word the interpretation of the word with divine foundation this is not some knowledge pass on where i sit here and say well you know i'll show you by the bible this is what it means this is what it means it's not an exchange of knowledge it says we have the divine we have the perfect interpretation and we have been told that god interprets his word by bringing it to pass in other words we live in the time where we can look at the bible and say that i have seen god's interpretation with my own eyes we can talk about luke 17 30 and say that i have seen the perfect interpretation with divine fornication we can talk about the manifestation of sons and say i have seen the manifestation with my own eyes because if this is just some knowledge transfer where we can sit here and say oh this is this and this is that that could be argued upon that could be debated based on who you talk to but when you have you yourself god has revealed it to you to where you can see the end time you can see what's happening out there where we can take the the message of the hour and be able to look at the world and see everything that's happening out there in the message that is the interpretation and that's what we are being moved into and i want to say this if we are moving into this interpretation into the perfection of god let's not settle for anything less and i'm not talking about just the message as being the body i'm talking about the promises of god for our own life i want to see holiness within my life i want to see the righteousness of god within my own life i want to see the healing of god within the body i want to see the salvation of god why because it's the perfect interpretation he says the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication when that which is perfect when where that which is in part is done away with it says when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things amen he says i go it says i go to preaching and they don't get these things when we see the interpretation there's no argument when we see we come face to face with interpretation there's nothing new arguing but all if we have his words and and and and ways to view things we all that can be debated and argued upon that's why this message it has to become a life to each and every one of us and i'm not talking about a one-time life it has to be a continual life life source within your body that keeps you walking that keeps you talking that that fills your mind in your thinking and everything it has to be something that continually you walk by it's not and i want to just jump ahead and say this because mainly when we look at the church world and the things that man is trying to do the word of god has become like a source of knowledge where people can go and gain knowledge and know how to speak and and now how to communicate with people and how to tell them about the goodness of god but i want to say this that's not enough god in this end time the perfection that he's bringing is he's bringing us right back into what was in the beginning and what was in the beginning in the beginning there was a man who was married in the image of god a man who walked like god walked who talked like god talked who thought like god was thinking and that man he was there with the mind of god being translated directly to him in other words what that man desire was directly connected to god's desire what that man was thinking was directly connected to god's desire and therefore we have to be brought into that same state we can't walk around with all the business of life and all the things and and the devil trying to choke the life out of you and and we feel like we're barely making it oh god if you can get me out of this oh god if you could get me out of this oh god it's telling you this morning be imperfect as your father in heaven is perfect in other words he's telling you within you i have equipped you with the power to overcome those things i have given you the power to walk in my righteousness i have given you the power to walk in my holiness i have given you the power for you to claim your family to claim your children to be to claim your healing to claim everything that you have need off we have to twist it out of the enemy's hand we we cannot let our minds be filled with the burdens of life and come to church and and just barely oh if i could just get something to lift me up that's not the life that god has called us to live he wants us to be overcomers he wants us to be his children he wants us to be his representative in fact he's put you here so when he desires to do something he can contact you he can come through you and get it done now let me read this as we continue on the scripture when we talk about uh perfection by definition and there's a lot of definition attached to it i just uh took few and uh and i hope you will help us just illustrate what we're trying to say this morning it's the process of achieving a spiritual maturity or perfection so perfect is without needing of anything perfection is the process of walking into perfection perfection is the prophet is a process of walking into what's perfect it's the process of a choosing of achieving maturity or perfection it says also apply to people it refers to the completeness of parts of perfection where no part is defected is defective or wanting it's being entirely without fault or defect the action or the process of improving something until it becomes thoughtless now when the church came into the ephesus the first church age when they were there all they knew was justification now for that time that was perfection to them that was all that was required it was the word that was provided them give them perfection for them to walk in but as far as god is concerned that's not the perfection it was trying to achieve that that was not the ending for excuse the word that was tree was trying to achieve then when they moved from justification into sanctification the church was moving up but as far as they were concerned they were at the end time and they were achieving what the word was promised for them to achieve but that was not god's goal he continued to move them all because he knew that his intention was that at the end time he will have a church that will be without sin without spot without wrinkle into his own image and barbara talks about the process of a gold purifying it says it will take gold and they will beat it and it will beat it when until the reflection of the beater is reflected directly into the gold that's when they knew that this is now perfect that's when they knew that the impurity was out of the goal oh my brother my sister god has been beating his church and and taking out the worldliness and all the things when until he can get his own reflection into his church and i want to say this this morning we desire each one i know but adam says that it says i know even as we sit here this morning that each one we desire a greater measure of god than what we have today we desire to see his manifestation and then i want to say this morning then let us move into perfection let us continue to walk let us if if we arrive then we shouldn't be here but if we're still here it means there's a perfection to be obtained but if adam talks about that sister the college sister who came in he said i would like to give a testimony for branham he says i'll say this i know i'm not what i ought to be i'm not what i want to be when i look at myself this is not the perfection why because i'm looking at myself through the word of god i'm seeing these things lacking i'm seeing the impurity upon me i see there are things that i'm i want to see out and i want to see things change and all of that but it says i'm not what i used to be one thing i know for sure is i'm not what i used to be why because i'm in the process of perfection i'm being in fact one of them says one place it says you're going somewhere you are headed somewhere and i want to say this this morning to each one sitting in this building and each one listening to this message you have to be for sure knowing that you're going somewhere whether you want it or not whether you know it or not you are going somewhere but it's upon us to find out this morning am i actually moving in the right way of perfection am i actually moving in the provided way the word and the message that's been provided to me am i actually being purified to walk into the righteousness of god it says here it says now this is when i'm speaking now he uh he he's uh when he's preaching the message that satchel of the perfect man he says in pr i believe in paragraph seven it says and this morning we want to speak to you on a subject or teach rather if we can if we can listen to how we called it building the living tabernacle building the living tabernacle of the living god dwelling places building the living tabernacle of the living god dwelling place the perfect man now how can god dwell in us when we are caught up in all kinds of worldliness every day how can god dwell in us when our minds all that we're thinking on is this so that and and never having to come back and say that i have been born by the sea the reason why he's asking me to move to perfection is because of the seed that he placed within me because i want to say this i i so enjoy what matthew preached wednesday and and i hope we can just build it upon this and and so you can come to the realization now remember he says he talked about april ministers my brother my sister we have been made be made able ministers of righteousness we have been made able ministers of the holiness of god why because the perfect sacrifice was given for us he he came to you he took all of your sin i i'm talking about past present and future i'm talking about anything you can think of i'm talking about things that you can't even think of i'm talking about things that cannot even enter your mind he took all of that upon himself he the perfect sacrifice so you can take his place and he took your place what a righteousness this morning and he did that so we can gather up this morning and not having to think about our sins and concentrate ourselves on them but yet we come back every morning our minds is full of our sins oh i did this oh i did that what else would you take what else do you need he's provided the sacrifice for you he's made made us able ministers in other words we were not able we felt short we came short of the kingdom of god the scripture says that he that was a children of disobedient you were children of of the world and you did all those things you you disobeyed the word of god but oh god reaching mercy he came to you he provided the sacrifice so you can be sitting here this morning my body my sister it's not it's not by america we're sitting here this morning and do not take it for granted don't ever think you are good enough to sit here this morning let me just just came to my mind and i'll say it i thought it was so wonderful i heard a man i believe he was on the radio you know i was listening to a radio going to work and i heard him saying i thought it was so wonderful you know he spoke he's speaking about humility he said you know in the church they decided you know the to vote for the most humble people and and so they they when they voted the vote went to went to the the the deacon so you know but jackson but gary and everything also they give them medals you know for being so humble in the work that they do and they appreciated them in everything so what happened is next sunday all the deacons decided to show up with the medals on and then when they showed up they took it all because they thought they were not humble they were not humble enough you did you catch it so in other words it's never us coming to a place where i think i deserve this i deserve that i did good enough and i must have added something that's why god chose me no it's you always constantly the moment you compare what is done with your life you look at yourself you can't even believe it you got to delete it and say it cannot be me it cannot be me i cannot deserve this there's no way i can deserve this but he looks at you and says i have chosen you and i want to say this that's the righteousness of god and i would rather walk by that righteousness than anything man can give me i would rather believe that righteousness why when you believe that righteousness it lifts you up it cleans your sins it took you out of the the drug house and out of wherever you were out of the world and he dressed your right it caused you to talk right it's not us it's him the perfect sacrifice and i want to say this you can never attain to perfection without the new birth you might as well forget it but one of them says this now when you talk about the statue of a perfect man or growing forth it's not uh a cell of a dog added with a cell of a cat and added another cell it can mix so perfection comes by him therefore the beginning cell is his self therefore the beginning of it is the new birth it's god himself coming and changing your heart and taking away your desires and when you've done that when he's done that then you can add to it then from faith virtue could be added then from virtue temperance godliness all of those other things could be added to it but it has to start with the new birth therefore the most important thing we can talk about this morning is you've got to be born again and i want to say this when you when you're born again you have to continually stay within the mind of god because the devil will try to catch you at every corner he's trying to build a tabernacle a living place for god and the only way it could be built is through him is the prefecture he's the the scripture says he's the beginning of the creation and prabhupada interpreters is the author the beginner the one who starts it now in in second peter chapter one i'm racing against times you've just forgiven me this morning peter says it says simon peter servant an apostle of jesus christ it says to them that obtain like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and and with the righteousness of god and our savior jesus he's letting you know where you obtain your righteousness not through yourself that have obtained righteousness that have obtained like precious faith through the righteousness of god in other words god deciding you you're going to receive my perfect faith you will receive my faith my precious faith and the savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and jesus christ our lord according as his divine power as given and it's been has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness all things that we have need of to life and godliness it's in him it's not in our self it's divine power has given us those things through the knowledge of him through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby our given are given unto us an exceeding great and precious promise by this that ye might be partakers of divine nature having escaped the corruption which is in the world through lust how many have escaped this morning oh i tell you it's not an escape where oh i saw it and then no he came he revealed himself to you he took you out and you look in the floor and says i can't believe the corruption that's in it why because he took he took you out of it and it says and beside this giving all due diligence that you may have that you add to your faith virtue knowledge virtue and knowledge and the knowledge of and not to knowledge tempers and temper spacious and precious godliness and this it says and to godliness broadly kindness and bodily kindness charity and then he says and if these things are in you and abound they make you they make you that ye shall neither be barren or nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus i want to say this we need to understand what road we are on this morning we need to be very very well aware of the direction and the road that we are in because it's very important that we come to a place where we are striving for the masteries like paul says where we are pressing into a direction it says one thing i do is i forget all things that are behind and i press towards the mark and i want to ask you what is your mark this morning what is your mark this morning is your mark so you can become more knowledgeable and get big great businesses and make more money and build more houses and do this and and then not needing to work anymore what is your mark this morning it's so that i can be the well-dressed person and i can look always good and i can do this and because you're pressing for something you know god of this evil age is one that is so disguised my brother my sister that will hide in anything in other words if it's 99 the word of god and one percent not the devil is in it and i want to say this it's very important we understand the the new birth has been given to me so it's an opportunity for me to walk towards perfection it's an opportunity for me to leave behind all the things that are bothering me all the things of the world that hang on me it's the things it's not the only thing that has been given to me for me to press forward and i want to say this prabhupada in a statue of a perfect man it says it says that's how we've passed from death unto life we look back to the pits where we were where we was hewing from it says we are not what we want to be we are not even what we ought to be but one thing we are thankful for we are not what we used to be if if you don't have the answer to that question you need to seek the lord if you don't know if you are better off today compared to what you used to be you are at a very dangerous place if you cannot answer whether you the version of that you are today compared to the version that you were uh five ten years ago even a year ago even a month ago you need to look in what direction you are progressing because one thing that we know is we we are bombarded with a busyness of life and and the things that you know i i you know oftentimes you've heard me say this you get to a place you feel like the days are like the days of creation you know you have children you walk out you got to get them ready for school and everything you drop them to school you come home you start working or you go to work and your alarm goes off oh it's time to go pick them up and then you go you pick them up you come you eat and then you go to sleep and then your alarm goes off it's the time to do the same cycle again so it's like morning and then it's night and then it's the next day life becomes so occupied so busy and and before you know you you try to pray in five minutes you're heading not and you know you you it's time because your body is so tired and i want to say this god didn't place us our priority for being here on earth it's just not so we can have families so we can buy cars and buy houses we are here for the purpose of of worshiping the living god that's the primary reason why we are here so when we take care of our children we worship god when we go to our work we worship god we want to worship god in every circumstances in any place that we are in whether good or bad whatever is happening to you whether you lost everything that you had whether you got more than what you did before the purpose is i need to be worshipping god these hands were not just made so you can work and make money they were meant to be clapped for god so you can say thank you god and lift them up but one of them says when you lift them up you defy gravity this fate were given to you so you can spread good news not so you can go and talk about people and and go to places you shouldn't go but oh if you think about your feet and say god you have given me this so i can preach the good news so wherever i go i can represent you the math was given so we can proclaim the goodness of god to people not so we can spew up nonsense and tell people how much we know and how much they don't know your body is given to you to be the temple of god we let our natural human desire overcome the very expression that we have been given and i say this this morning it says be perfect be perfect follow the example of your father follow in that and then he says you escape the corruption which is in the world the lust the corruption which is in the world you are above that it says that's the type of the person we are talking to the person that escaped these things the corruption which is in the world it says and besides this leaving all diligent unto you unto your faith it says add unto your faith virtue knowledge and knowledge temperance temperance patience patience godliness it speaks about all these things too now listen to what branham says now i thought this really pricked my heart when i read it last night he says this it says remember god revealed himself in three in three ways first the first time he revealed himself as the pillar of fire and he called fatherhood then he came down the same god man manifested in jesus christ which is he says which he built the body he made his body he says thirdly through the death of that body he sanctified the church that he can dwell in it god the father comes and makes himself a body called jesus christ a sanctified body a holy body and he takes the body and he gives it to sacrifice so he can move into the third stage of him dwelling himself so he can dwell he's sanctified so he can dwell in it it was god above us god with us god in us the same god that's the reason he was called father son holy ghost you think about the godhead you think about the definition he says not three gods not by not three gods but three offices of one god it says they've had they've had only thoughts of the uh if they felt if they only thought about that didn't announce in council we wouldn't have been with all the mess with all the mess up it says would we that's right not three god the people couldn't understand how jesus talked to the father and the father and the to the father and he and the father are one well the whole thing is sure just unfold unfolds it certainly it's not three god it's three offices now he says it continues on it says what is it god condensating condescending to his creation god wants to be worshipped oh my brother my sister if if your life and my life this morning if all that we can achieve if all that we can do if all of that could only come to a place where we can worship god we've done what we need to do if all our lives everything that we do everything that we involve ourselves in if all of that could be combined and say that i'm worshiping god that's what we need to be doing he said god wants to be worshiped the word the word god means object of worship and god trying to co to condition to condition his people so he can get them from what uh to get them from what he created them for he never met he never made you to be something else besides a son and a daughter of god if you if you have missed that if you have missed that of being a son or daughter you've missed the mark if you cannot look at yourself and say i'm a son i'm a daughter you've missed the mark if you can look at yourself this morning and and say that i can be perfect because he made me perfect i i could do better because he told me i could do better i could do that because he placed that within me if you cannot this morning link tattoo you need to go back to him why because that's the purpose of our gathering here is because we realize that we are more than what the world was telling us we are we are more than our own thinking we are here because someone told us that we were better than what we were and he proved it to us oh i say this morning let us move on to perfection let us move on to perfection now listen to this as i'm coming to the end now it says he speaks now in acts chapter 4 7 and 44 it says our father it says our father had a tabernacle of witness in the wilderness and he had appointed speaking unto them moses it says to moses that he should that sh that he should make according to uh to the fashion that he has seen which also our father had a father that came in from and brought in jesus said unto unto the the the possession of the gentile who were drawn who were drawn out before the face of our father unto the day of david found out the favor before god and desired to find the tabernacle of god of god of jacob but solomon built him a house now but i'm says this and i know for the sake of time i'm not going to go through all of it i'm just going to try to summarize summarize it i i and i think this is very critical now david had within his heart to desire to build god a house he said that i dwell in the palace but yet the the the ark of god is over there in the tent but now i want you to remember that the the design of the tent that he saw that the the the the ark was in it didn't come from themselves trying to do god a favor but it came from a model that god showed moses when he looked it says that i want you to to design or to build the tabernacle based upon the model that i have shown you in heaven so there's a tabernacle in heaven that was to be displayed on earth and and we know by the message that that tabernacle were made of skins they said body prepared for you the tabernacle was made of skin but now david looks and says how can it be my house looks so nice and building blocks and knits all of this i want to build god a house like mine a bigger house and things like that and the prophet looks at him and says do all that's in your heart to do and so david went on but then the prophet came back and he says well you know you are a bloody man god came and told him it says you can't build me a tabernacle but your son will build me a tabernacle so solomon comes and he builds the tabernacle and with all the material that david gathered all of it in fact the scripture says that everything fits so perfectly together because every machine everything all those stones were already so cut out perfectly to fit in the building and but then he says god is building a lively church not building of stones but a body has not prepared me it says so here it comes and it comes and i want to say this this morning because i feel like this is the human nature when you you read through the bible man has always want to get into some kind of a relationship with god where we have built this house for god and we call this the temple of god so they want to be at the place where oh this is where god dwells i can come in and fellowship with god and once i have enough i go back and i do my own thing and i go to places i want him and if i need to come and find god i go back to the building i go back to the building then i worship him again then i praise him but then i i want to create a distance i don't want too much contact i don't want to be constantly but when i have a need when i need healing i want to come to him when i need deliverance i want to reach out to him but i don't want too much contact i just i want to be a space between us oh the scripture says that job desires to have a go between someone who can put the hands on the holy god and a sinful man so he can reconcile them together someone who understood who god was and someone who understood who man was so he can breach the gap that existed but man wants to remain in that kind of relationship where i can dress wherever i want i can do whatever i want but when i'm convicted i have to come and fix it up again and then god looks at them and says that's not the tabernacle i desire that's not the table accolade desire this morning god wants a tabernacle that he he can dwell in it remain in it every day talk to you every day counsel you every day show you the way every day he can be there and it's his dwelling place not some kind of a far-off experience where you kind of have it at home you know i'll get closer when i need to but i'll go back that was the tabernacle in the wilderness that was remember when god came upon the mountain they had to step afore because touching the mountain will kill you but all through jesus christ the perfect sacrifice god came and he showed he ripped the veil of the temple to show that that's not what he desired anymore that was the falsity of man he came in the same time to show that he can dwell within a man just like he did in jesus christ i say let us move to perfection what is perfection god dwelling in your flesh what abandonment says luke 17 30 was one of the greatest promise think about it you're like oh i thought you know revelation 10 7 god no luke 17 30. what was it abraham came we went through who's this melchizedek what was abraham looking at he looked at there he saw god he saw the very mind of god revealed to him and he might not look at him and said is there anything impossible to god god in human flesh is the conclusion of the matter if you can miss it all the understanding of everything don't miss that it's god in the human flesh fulfilling the word for this hour it says know how that god is in his church the church now supposed to be taking the place of christ carrying on his ministry sometimes i feel like we are divided in observers and participants like our pastor preached the other day you know there are those that are just an arm length you know i like what's happening no i don't like this you know they're just picking and choosing what they like what they don't like this is his body he's calling you to be part of it who knows you being added to it and committing to it will actually bring us into perfection one thing we need to die on is our own ideas even as our prophet told us we need to die off our own ideas and take his ideas and i begin to think about this and i'll just skip for let me just read this excuse me we're going to get out of here shortly it says now it says believe me god works it says carrying on his ministry he that believeth on me the works that i do shall we do also yet a little while the world will see me no more yet you shall see me for i am with you i am with you even in you until the end time there it is carrying on his work now god or the bible says stephen spoke to solomon building the temple and the most high goddamn dwelling temple made of hands the heavens is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the place of my rest but a body as thou prepare me which body is that you have to say it's my body it's not good enough to just say it was the prophet's body it's not good he said to say it so it's the pastor's body or the minister's body it's your body your body you put your name in it you claim it it's your body he says our body is that prepare me god dwells in a stature of a man not in buildings the god is here because you brought him here when we go out of here god is not here man wants to go home and love god in the building i'm serious they they have places where they know they can find god if i go to church if i go in my closet if i go inside if i go to the pastor's house then i'll meet god no that's not the kind of relationship he's looking for he wants to meet you in your body where you are wherever you are oh that's why you know when when david speaks and swami says if i lay my body in hell be lo behold they were there why is god there because my body is there if i go to the extreme part of the fbo why because my body is there everywhere my body finds itself god is there it says a man reflecting himself into his being perfect worship god reflection through the being is the perfect worship he says god in us being the tabernacle god manifesting oh how much we could stay on this till you you would almost suffocate in here oh i tell you it's so wonderful there's so many angles there's so many things you look at it it's always god in its people it's always i'll tell you that you can read i can try to read the message i can undo it i cannot see it every time everywhere i look it's always god calling i want to dwell in you i want to do more in you i want to get you out of the things that you are in i want to move you further i want i just see i cannot see it that's all i see and then we gather here if you see people that are walking and you asking are you seeing what i'm seeing god has always all time reflected himself in man but random talks about oh robert now i'm going over time now just you know i think people like over them he said he would pray and he would tell people wherever you are i want you to touch the tv and have faith and this touch if you have faith that's such a tv it says then it will transmit from the electricity and and come to you one of them says i hope you don't have to touch nothing you don't have to touch nothing you have to touch him pray to him who's within you the only thing you need you don't need to touch you don't need the hands of somebody upon you if that will help you come forth right but what you need is to touch him is to say i heard your word and i believe it with all my heart and come and touch my life change my life if you need prayer prayer will help you but it's he that believes the word regardless of how you believe it it's the faith in the word that produces it he says god's journey in reflection in reflection in his people in his people so now he says yeah they were talking about the building building him a temple a house of him to dwell but failing to oh this is me that wrote by failing to understand that god was not interested in some building place a place where we can come and meet and go home and leave him until we come back again now i want you to see this it says here in paragraph 84 it says and since that time he reflected himself in his church this side of calvary so you see we are trying to get to this dwelling place the tabernacle of living god now there is some yeah it says now and then he continues on to something else now i want to say this i thought this came through my heart as i was thinking about this the the scripture speaks in the air we are the people that were given the word of god and i want you for a moment to think about their approach to what was given them their approach to the word of god that was given and the understanding of what was supposed to happen and and for the sake of time it's isaiah 58 let's start from verse 4. and this is god calling for a fast for the children of israel telling them that you shall fast and things like that now i want you to see what the understanding of men was versus the understanding of god in verse 4 it says behold ye fast for strife and debate and smite with feast of wickedness ye shall not ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high i want you to think about the reason what the understanding of the reason why they should be you should be doing it it says in five it says is this such a fast that i have chosen a day where a man will afflict his soul it is that the bow down his head as a bulrush and to to spread sock cloth and ashes unto under him will thou call this a fast and an acceptable day of the lord he's asking them a question yeah they were they were given a word and the word was you should abstain from this and do this and and do this and in fact i can bring it down to us yet we are we have been given the message and within the body of the message we learn everything that is about conduct about uh leadership about how we should treat one another about the things that we should do and everything and here is the attitude god has given us a tabernacle to worship him a place where we can come he's called us so we can come to church and and everything and and i want you to think this as our attitude when we come to church when we come to god he's asking and says is this the reason why you're doing it so you can come in such a fast i have chosen a day where a man will afflict his soul so you come on you're like oh it's time to go to church again you know you know i don't have an option you know if i don't show up very jackson will know i'm not there you know the pastor will find charlie will call me asking me where i am you know let's just go you know oh you come and you're watching the minister and your mind is in everything else except what's being said oh right now everybody's thinking about how the food is going to burn you know in all kinds it's everything except what's happening it's asking them that question but now listen to what it says to them in verse six it says is it not the fast that i have chosen to lose the bends of the wicked to undo the heavy hearts to let the possess go free and naive break every yoke are we not coming here to see those that are lost restored those that are healed those that are healed made right and those that have uh have trouble that he may come to the lord is this what we gathered here for what is the message being given to us for is it so we can talk about how much we know and others don't know is it so we can brag about what we know and how we can explain the things of god no he's saying that focus on the right thing it's for a reason it's so that those that are lost when they come into our midst they can sense the presence of the living god they can come to a blessing says that i have met god i heard that men speak i heard the scripture being read i listened to those songs and i believe god is in there and i want to touch that god is it someone is that sick and and you're walking on me and said i don't care what kind of sicknesses we serve a god who's able to heal all that diseases let's move to perfection and perfection is going back to what was in the beginning what was the church of pentecost they came and they sold everything that they were they came to a place where they believed that they were gathered there in the name of the lord and there's nothing that can stand against them now our expectation of yeah i know he can but even if he doesn't that's not faith that's not faith that's a weathering faith that's not faith that's that's hope so but when we come before the living god we burn all our bridges lord i don't have a way back it's either you or it's nothing it's either you do it or die it's either i go with you or i don't go anywhere like moses the lord tell me oh go ahead i want you to go forth and do this and he says if you're not coming with us we're not going god said well i'll do this it says i want to see your face i want to see you it says moses you know you can't see me no man has ever seen god and live it says i will show me your glory my brother my sister it's the heart cry of a believer that brings god on the scene when we come here we have to have an expectation that whatever you need is this morning whether it be a need for you to be more like a christian to you to come into but the desire has to be there you bring it to god and god will perfect it he's the beginner and he who started the good works will finish it now remember finishing is perfection when moses built us when when michelangelo puts a scripture he brought it to a perfection and the perfection was what he saw so much of what was in his mind until he broke it he says speak and barbara called it the masterpiece oh i want to say this morning i begin to think about this i said he says what kind of house would you build me i said lord i want to build you one i want to build you this morning a house full of praises i want this house when a man looks at it all they can see is the glory of god whether i'm going to a good time or a bad time i want to lift my hands and worship god at all time i want my mouth to speak his praises continually i want to lift my voice i want to do every bit of pray or power every bit of ounce of life that i have within this body to praise god i want to wake up in the morning and say thank you lord jesus i want to go and when i meet my neighbor tell him about the lord jesus i want when i go to work and i see a situation that people don't know what to do i want to jump in there and say that i know someone i want to praise the lord with everything that i have in the way that i dress in the way that i talk in the way that i conduct myself innovative everything that i do i want this house to be the house of praise of the living god let's all stand this morning that's the hot desire of a believer it's not to be caught up in all kinds of things it's not our mind to be filled with oh what i should do how am i going to get my bread tomorrow yes we go through all of that but when all of that is finished i want the lord to come and say yes i'm pleased with this building this is my dwelling place that i can come and dwell this morning he didn't build you but when it says i could just go on and on he says when you when a person builds a house is so they can dwell on it you don't build the house to leave it empty in fact the scripture speaks in the gospels how that when an evil spirit is cast out you have to fill the house fill the house quickly otherwise if you leave it empty the enemy that you cast down the evil that you cast down he's going to go find devils more stronger than him to come back we've been the demons have been cast out of us we know that the devil the the lord has delivered us of all the things that we were in in the world and i say let's fill this building with this goodness let's fill every fiber of our body with him so he can come and dwell in us let's just buy a heads our gracious father we're so thankful this morning [Music] god's dwelling place you said you don't dwell in building builds of men but a body as i prepare me the scripture says

that you renew us oh god that we may cast out everything that's in the building and and bring you back in that everything else that we've used it for that you may put it aside oh god that you may come and dwell in it lord we commit what we are into your hands we're so thankful to be your children lord if you've called us to be perfect it's because you have made us perfect the scripture says when
