how worthy you are what it really is that you've done lord my heart just bubbles inside of me tonight i'm just thrilled i'm so unworthy to stand at this place but father i'm so privileged to be able to let the words of the messenger of this hour roll from my tongue what an honor each of us has to be able to share in this great resurrection we ask you to bless us this evening as we fellowship around your word in jesus name we pray amen hey man i'm so excited i feel like a little kid i'm telling you i don't even i i just want to blow up and i don't even think i i don't even want to contain myself i just uh this message is wonderful it's just wonderful let's turn over to a scripture and it's found in the book of luke and in the 21st chapter and the 20 25th through uh the 28th the verse and there's a little statement that the prophet of god makes that inspired me to find the scripture and then when i found this scripture it inspired me to exactly where we're at but let's just listen to this it's marvelous and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations can we say that's true with perplexities the sea and the waves roaring what do we have two hurricanes coming right now you know just look at men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth doesn't that sound like this great virus that we've just been going through you know the things that have come upon the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your hearts for your redemption draweth nigh heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you you may be seated we're going to play just a few minutes but i i don't know whether to go ahead and share this part of it with you and then knowing this part you can we can listen to the rest of it and so that's kind of what's beating on my heart so uh if you if the brothers will put up and we'll go to our message i'd i'd like just to uh turn to this little part here that uh brother brown talks about right here in the very first part we're going to play and i will read this first part to us and then we'll go back and listen to it he says it's the same spirit that raised him up this is 119 that quickened the true believer to eternal life so that's the spirit that did it the spirit that saved us was not you coming to the recognition it was his spirit found jew and and so and that's the spirit by which he did it he said now remember potentially now watch as we are getting out of our time but notice the same spirit now romans 8 and 1 let's just read it again romans 8 1 and we'll see what that says that's right now not romans i mean romans 8 and 11 i'm sorry romans 8 11 but if there's the problem there's the catch but if the spirit of him god the holy spirit that raised jesus from the dead dwell in you now i don't know maybe things are just so simple to me that i get excited about things that everybody else knows you know but that's okay you know uh now there you are if the bridegroom spirit dwells in the bride when when god made his first bridegroom he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman in spirit formed in him in the dust of the earth to make him material so adam was both what male and female he was in spirit form and then he was formed in the dust of the earth to make him material now you've got to hold that about the dust of the earth and be made material and notice when he made eve from adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay the same word for adam was a spoken word see and he took from him and then he had masculine and feminine spirit and he took the feminine spirit away from adam and placed it in eve so it's still a part of adam's spirit it's adam's flesh then it's adam's spirit the dynamics that quicken the mechanics's body now if you you just take a second and look over at corinthians the first first corinthians and 15 i believe and 46. and we we read this before but it i i read it now it becomes more to life to me than it did before if sown a natural body it is also raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body so it it is written the first adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit now when you look at eve and what is what is uh uh coming here and from what brother braham is leading up to so he takes adam and he takes eve out of adam now adam has the spirit so he has the light so the spirit that was in adam is the dynamics of eve that's where he got eve got her dynamics was from the spirit that was in adam so if he was brought to life by the spirit that was in adam so that's who was that's how eve was raised up by the spirit because if god ever does one thing one way he's got to to do it the other way so can you talk about that where did eve get her dynamics he got it from adam so she got her her life her dynamics in other words what made her what she is that's the dynamics of something the description of it the the abilities and powers and things that that it has she got that from adam but adam was make just made her a living soul but this eve this bride amen she gets her dynamics because this adam he's a quickening spirit so his spirit comes to life so now you begin to see that how that the how he did it in the beginning god never fails everything he did was perfect okay so you know all of a sudden i say because we're gonna go back in to talking in romans about this mortal body eve's mortal body came to life because of the spirit of adam she he adam's spirit was her dynamics now what's our dynamics his spirit if the same spirit that dwelt in him dwells in you and then we can pick this up and then we'll go back through this again slowly so but when you approach what he's again going to be talking about that you've got to if you understand that eve didn't become what she was by herself she couldn't amen and and we can't become what we even want to be by ourselves but when you know it's a promise it changes things and and so i i mean that that just thrilled me to no end i guess it didn't thrill you as much as through me but i ran around the house about five times jumped up twice then had lay down take a nap because my head was hurting but i mean that's fabulous what a revelation this is so you understand here you are and that's why you heal you hear abraham said we're born of his bone flesh of his flesh we were part of him we were part of his spirit in the beginning now he's got to quicken it so how did eve come alive she didn't come alive by herself he didn't take different clay he didn't take a different spirit he took his adam's spirit and made eve she was the dynamics so what's our dynamics the same spirit that raised him up is the same spirit that becomes our dynamic so we don't have our own dynamics in other words we don't say i'm i'm going to i'm now going to go do these works you know what i mean i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that and i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that and we're going to go start this this program and we're going to start this program and we're we're going to have a crusade a thousand souls for christ you know a soul a night for the rest of our life program or or whatever program that man does no you can't do this but it is him becomes the dynamics he's the one that's do does the works he's the one that manifests himself through you they become one we become bone of his bone flesh of his flesh now a lot of people don't want want to have anything to do with him and we will hear him say that but there's something in you that cries for that amen that hungers for that dynamics you just don't want to believe in your spirit you want something to dynamically manifest in your flesh so we're going to pick up here at uh uh 11 uh 111 and just uh start listening again and we're only it's only about 15 minutes and and then we'll just fellowship it around it a little more but but with the first bridegroom if the first bridegroom got her dynamics from the the first groom then the second adam his bride has to get the dynamics elsa it wouldn't be the same thing and she is him just listen as we listen it's it's wonderful uh beautiful thing and it's going to help us with our our lives and all the battles we go through and everything so lord bless you as we just listen a little further down the message only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the rebels and is he being the group the bride has to come forth called this part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and the others that spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken his spirit to fame in his spirit coming the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him had put it together and made mechanics and dynamics and tell the church or the people all these easter bunnies these turtles and big churches and pirates will fail and pass away until that church become both diamonds and mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so hey why is that in john 14 12. he didn't believe upon me the works that i do shall he you [Music] amen also give him a charge of my dynamics and his mechanics that's the world when i'll be able to withstand it and i'll raise him up again at the last day hallelujah that's the easter egg the time and the mechanics together the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up down all you want to deny this word amen amen they won't do any good you're just cranking around them the pistons have got sparked out of fire but no gas need to far back it'll only work as they come together so one will set steel and the other will go up that's the only thing there is to it yet they both might look like both claim to be churches who claim to be bribed but one has mechanics and dynamics it brings it to pass but what he said is the truth it just won't no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics comes when the time enemy comes that bar is made to connect with that octane and the gasoline and when that exposures it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion ever moves for he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of god mechanics with the dynamics notice it's the spirit that quickens it's the it's the spark that fires it's not the gas that fires it's a spark that fires the gas see you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the words the father living father sent me so send i you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything i do only that which is pleasing to god now as he sent me so saying it was the same mechanics it takes the same dynamics to operate it and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the dynamics will take its place paul said the gospel came to us not in word only through gasoline only but through spark also to make it move it came to us in that manner it's the same spirit that raised him up that quickened the true believer to eternal life i remember potentially now watch as we are getting out of our time notice the same spirit now romans 8 1. let's just read that again in romans 8 1 and we'll see what that says all right and not romans i mean 811 i'm sorry and romans 8 11. but if there's a problem there's a sketch but if the spirit of him god the holy spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwelt in you oh there you are if the bridegrooms spirit dwells in the bride when god made his first bride grew he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman in spirit forming in the dust of the earth and making material and notice when he made eat from adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay the same word or adam was a spoken word see he took from him and then taken the he had masculine and feminist spirit and he took the feminist spirit away from adam and placed it in eaves who are still part of adam's spirit is adam's flesh then it was adam's spirit the dynamics that quickened the mechanics of his body so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones then how is this mortal flesh go become his flesh we'll get to it how is it done how what is this great transformation notice now if the spirit of him god that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you oh my the predestinated ones of course like the seed laid up on the earth the one that had life and many of them are dead they were just rotten seeds the waters and things burned them out but you know there was a seed laying there ready for life god know it was laying there now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the holy spirit for the holy spirit comes to claim its own how this is deep now be sure to catch this good now as the sun was set across the earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to lie it was not to bring all the dirt to the night but was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around alive not all men will receive crime oh no but those which god for ordained life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth that's when it comes to quicken they're the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the sun and say oh this old sun's so hot that rock said there's no sun so hot but that little seed said that's what i'm looking for and they begin to spring forth the line it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to quicken the rock not to quicken the earth but to quicken the life of the seed now the holy spirit comes now of course it wasn't set why won't all the people receive it it wasn't sent to him god told me i don't believe i don't care what you say if you could raise up the dead or anything and heal the sick and prove it anyway i still don't believe i said sorry not you're unbelievers it don't mean a thing to you it wasn't even sent to you it's said to those who will believe the message is to the believer to them that perish is foolishness but to them that are in christ and part of that seed is life my crude little story about the farmer putting the egg uh the eagle egg under the heat see that little eagle was absolutely he was a he was an odd looking little creature when this uh farmer had did that thing that he did to put this uh eagle egg under this old hand and she hatched out a funny looking chicken and it was a odd little solid he didn't look like him his feathers wasn't like the rest of him and he just he was an odd little guy and all rested chickens recognized him in odd fella and the hen went around he didn't even like the dikes she was feeding me he just didn't like that scratching in the barnyard he he didn't have nothing to do with it so he wondered why he had to be the odd one around there any thing and he never tasted anything that he just eat enough to keep him alive because he didn't like the taste of it see because he was a chicken too and uh the hen would cluck and you know jay's a miracle just past there is no such a thing he joined the church it just didn't hit right with the little guy so he fought around the hands until one day his mammy the old eagle old laid so many eggs and there was one missing she knew that that eagle was somewhere so she starts out on the hunt for him and she's circled over the mountain tops and down in the valleys over and everywhere where he might be by this time it's time for him to be born the time frame be hatched out so maybe a crow come in and picked up my egg maybe a vulture i don't know if something picked up my egg but i know that egg is in my mind i got a son somewhere i got the honey oh god he's that great eagle and his thoughts he wanted to have a church in order to have a people no matter what's cuddled him no matter what he's hatched out under he's hunting he's hunting for his own and one day the story goes this old eagle flew over the barnyard she's looking everywhere and she found him oh for that resurrection to recognize that he really wasn't chicken natural was an eagle and he's always taught to look down look for a bug or something in the barnyard but he heard a scream and said look up this way and he looked above him and there was a creature with 14 feet wings powerful in all the chickens he was in a barn heart and claimed him to be her son is that mama how can it get to you so just jump start flopping your hands or you're an eagle see she knew she had a son somewhere no matter what he's been raised up in she's got a son somewhere god knows hallelujah he's got a predestinated foreign church you know what he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere when the holy spirit begins to fly over that wave she he's the same yesterday forever not some mythical story but a reality no matter how many tried to tell him an eagle he didn't know what an eagle was yet he was an eagle he would understood it until he seen something that reflected him that he reflected rather and when we see not a denomination not a phd not a llg not a good neighbor but a son of god loaded in the image of god with the dynamic power of god to answer the request of this day that he's the same yesterday today and forever there ain't no hen gonna hold you hunch for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real eagle recognizes the call of god's word why he's an eagle a eagle to a eagle the word before the foundation the word to the word amen the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position he hunts for it this then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit of god to obedience to the word of god quickly what do you want to know how i could get there with her he'd been taught he couldn't do that you can't get a higher jump he's a chicken see but this eagle said that's not well look at the chickens no matter what the chickens are your eagles just start spreading those get a little exercise start moving up the word to the word the works that i do shall you also he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he also because i live he lives also in the spirit that raised him from the dead dwells in you he quickens your mortal body see what does it do now listen to what you know that this easter i want to mean more to you than any easter egg i want you to see we know what it's done for him but i want you to see it not well it has done the same for you amen what does it do it quickens the mortal body this mortal body that we live in it quickens it in other words brings it to life now you who once walked along with a great big cigar in your mouth and everything a bunch of cigarettes and you women who once had short hair and painted and carried on wore shorts and things like that oh it wants something to scream and you look down here and it was the word hey it quickened your you said no more shorts no more liquor for me no more lying no more stealing no more see the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in you will also bring your mortal bodies look at the rest of the earth into subjection you see what is it subjection of love christ who is christ the word not the theology but the word then you say that these things oh i think it's hard for women to wear uh flashes when the word says no see it quits you do that you're drawn to it see it's you then it becomes you become part of the word it brought your body not well you say well now let me tell you something my pastor i don't care what your pastor said what the word says if you want to be a chick and go on with him but if the pastor speaks different from this word then he's not a feeder of the eagles he's the feeder of the hymns see not of the eagles see eagle eats on eagles they queen the bible said it's wrong to do that demand and so forth and what all you do it's wrong say days and miracles just pass this bible said he's the same yesterday forever let's say that's mental telepathy there's some kind of mind reading this discernment all these divisions and anxious nonsense they are chickens that's right they don't know what eagle food is but brother when you hear that scream there's something in you you're eager to begin with why you are the seed that the resurrection of the s o n has gone in the wave sheep upon the earth to make you recognize that you are an eagle and not a denominational chicken you see it ha it's the spirit that raised him from the dead the word the dynamic of the word dwells in you it also quickens your mortal life now how we flesh would be flesh and boiling is born because quickly while we're yet moral sinners mortal ready to die these bodies it quickens that body what's quick it brings the life the spirit that wants like to drink run around commit adultery and all these it's quickened well the things die and you're resurrected it quickens your mortal body therefore your bodies is the temple of the dynamics because why from the beginning you are part of the mechanics [Music] there's your resurrection there's the church and the resurrection with you these bodies right now are quickened see you've heard you believe it changed you from a denomination to the word see the dynamic if it comes upon water it the dynamics strike that but it strike a chicken it won't do no good but when it strikes the eagle he moves out amen the dynamic with the mechanics you know what i mean that is if he is a true eagle now he will understand let me straighten a little scripture here for you i think we're off of the phone but we are still here amen uh saint john 5 24. jesus said he that heareth my word and believe us on him and say he has everlasting life now look i go down the street just take that literally what it is without the spiritual understanding i'll make it say nothing else but it's saying what it says see the right word there in the greek in the original it says he that understandeth my word now to prove that's right i go down yours there's a drunk coming along the street with some other man's wife on his arms and cussing and taking god's name in vain and everything else like that say did you like that preacher said did you yeah i heard it that don't mean he's got eternal life that understandeth my word he that is an eagle now brother brown want more scripture in that all right my sheep hear my voice a stranger they won't follow didn't that make you so happy amen i i'll just share with you what this is it's really done something for me because it it just is added uh just so much to just to understanding of the process of what uh takes place and and and how how beautiful uh it just all unfolds and and i just thought that was uh something that he talks about here uh in in paragraph 1 25 or just 124 right through there he says the predestinated ones of course like the seed laying on the earth and remember in easter seal how we went back and we saw that that seed was in the earth that our bodies was in the earth and and so we recognize that so our bodies are in the earth and we know that this that seed is within us he says like the seed laying on the earth it it one of that had life in them many of them were dead they were just rotten seed the water and things burnt them out but you know there was a seed lying there ready for life god knew it was lying there so we know the we talk about how he hunts it out okay and so i that kind of thrills me because of where he found me and and each of you have a story of where he found you that's your testimony if not your people mistake they think their testimony is what i've done for god oh i prayed for the sick i i've i've led thousands to christ i've been here i've done that i've done this it's not your testimony isn't what you've done for god your testimony is what god's done for you he found me on a rooftop in san diego that's where he decided to find me i decided to pick that time it didn't matter what i come from it didn't matter what was cuddling me i was being cuddled by a bunch of hell's angels by a bunch of drug dealers by a bunch of rock musicians didn't matter amen because he found me amen okay the shepherd goes after the sheep amen he'll leave the 99 to follow the one doesn't that make you feel comfortable there's there's a rest there because you you know we we let where we've come from way on us but now we begin to see the process of what that he quickens first he said he says now the predestined ones are the first to be quickened by the holy spirit for the spirit comes to claim its own now this is deep now and be sure to catch this good now when he makes a statement like that i stop now this is eagle food you understand i i you know it's a pet peeve of mine you know it's my soapbox and you know i can't understand how so many message people never play the eagle food for their people i like to get it straight from the chef you know what i mean i don't want my seasoning on it you know what i mean it's the spoken word is the original seed let's have something original you know now i might share with you my revelation and that's what i'm doing now i'm sharing with you by testimony what this has done for me but you've heard it too because okay it depends on what you are and what you heard and what it's doing for you you've got to jump in there remember what he said you've got to hunt it out you've got to say what's in here for me what's in that eagle hunting it out it looked for that mama mama how do i get there you've got to go under the word of god you've got to open that bible when you sit down in your study you when you go to pray you've got to seek seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened you've got to feast on it you can't let no preacher do your religion for you you can't let them provide an atmosphere that makes you feel good prophet of god said you can't make it without the sheep offering the eagle food being waved over you and fed to you you'll never come to maturity that's just like people they look and they see they look at god and some see three but a real seed sees one god he only sees one it didn't matter how many abraham saw he saw lord he saw one god he knew the whole picture was one god the whole plan was one god and and so you know it's deep so you we gotta you gotta understand that this is your hour this isn't a time for to pursuing careers you've got to have a career i believe in going to school i've encouraged people to go to school i've encouraged people to get degrees that's fine be a light there there's got to be a light but don't put no trust in it there's a lot of unemployed people with doctorate degrees there's a lot of lawyers driving cabs no but there's a lot of uneducated people praised and blessed by the glory of god that god's blessed because they put god first amen put god first amen hallelujah that thrills my soul my throne soul needs a thrill he said this is real deep now the sun was sent across the earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to life but it's not to bring all the dirt to life but was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around the life now you're the dirt this is the dirt the seed was in the dirt so now he can't just quicken the life without quickening the dirt because the seed can't manifest it manifests itself from the dirt oh i like this she says not all men will receive christ you know there's a theory called universalism that god's so good he's just going to save everybody all at once one day and everybody's going to be saved well if that's the case eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we shall die i'll go rob a bank and and live and do all kinds of crazy stuff because one day no no that ain't how it works you know how it works he's got a seed he hunts them out and he quickens them in the story all that the father have given me will come man rejected the way god chose to bring them to life that's why the scripture says if you call this beelzebub there's no more repentance for sin because you've eliminated the only way that you can be brought to life religion is people trying to bring themselves to life trying to put a covering on them we don't have to have anything fake we actually have the person of the lord jesus christ on the earth today moving in his word finding his children bringing him to life and bringing them into a union with the word what union would they be brought into they'd be brought into the union of luke 17 30 revelations 10 7. malachi 4 5 they would see the promised word the message the sheaf offering waved over and they would know that's the ministry that's going to bring me to the resurrections now that started in your spirit right that was in you first because that seed was there and that seed was quickened he said he all men won't receive christ oh no but those which god for ordained to life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth that's the one he comes to quicken they're the ones so as we look at this understand that that that spirit moves in you okay and you begin to know what's right you begin to know what's wrong and all of a sudden it places you in a war with your flesh because your flesh by nature is warring against the spirit the spirit wars against the flesh and the flesh against the spirit and these two are contrary to the one everybody uses that scripture but they never tell you the spirit wins that's right hallelujah i'm not going to war against the spirit the spirit's going to bring me into subjection to the word it's not going to be done by my might it's not going to be done by my will but it's going to be done by my spirit saith the lord that's why this was such a revelation to me because i always tried to do the mechanics to get the victory i'd make sure i paid my tithe i make sure i go to church i make sure i do all the things but that's not what's going to bring this body into subjection it's going to take the spark to do it i do someone sent me a beautiful quote and i was i could probably pull it up on my phone and read it but he says you do all that you can do that's the mechanics of it all but when you one day you realize wait a minute being free from lust being free from envy being free from malice being free from bitterness being free from gossip being free from envying strife and all the fruits of the flesh can be a reality i can overcome not we retake that scripture if the spirit that dwells in him it'll quicken this mortal body we've used that scripture over and over again placing it as a rapture one day i'll be changed one day i'll be changed but that's not what he's saying he says your body will be quickened now you will be conformed to the word now that's where it'll take place it's something i can look forward to that's a promise to me and i don't have to worry about popularity i don't have to worry about money don't have to worry about women those are the things the prophet said that i can have victory over all those things they become temptation but i got the power where did you get it i tried i tried with everything because my mechanics told me it was wrong my mechanics told me that you need this out you need that out you're doing wrong it's no good and i i you begin to see it oh i'm going to go clean this up i'm going to go fix this i'm going to go fix that and you labor in the mechanics you beat people down and you you drag them to the altar you're a sinner you're a sinner you you need to do this you need to do that always beating you down you know what the prophet of god said i'll just jump over and see if i can yeah he he said it he said it right here he said they are always taught to look down always taught to look down he said he said but now the dirt lay there in the sun one says oh it's too hot but it quickens that part of the dirt because the sun was set not the quicken the rock not the quicken the dirt but to quicken the life in the seed so it it he says now you guys i don't i don't a guy says he don't believe we read that he says now over here he talks about the little eagle he said he didn't even like the diet she was feeding him he just scratched around in the barnyard he wondered why he had to be the odd one around everywhere i like that and then uh let me see if i can find that statement i thought that yeah it's over on the other page so he's talking about this eagle and he comes down here and he gets down and he says he says so she was searching him and he says so does god he is the great eagle in his thoughts he knew he'd have a church okay he knew he'd have a church wait a minute i want to be a part of that what do i have to do what what what is it how is it done remember he says paragraph 123 so the bride must be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone then how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh that's the question how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh how is it done he says he says how become his flesh well we'll get to it in a minute see how is it done how what is the great transformation what is the thing the great transformation that's going to transform this flesh our mortal bodies this mortal body what is going to quicken this mortal body right here and transform this dirt to where this body is brought under subjection to his word it's a promise praise god it's a promise i can i can anticipate i can anticipate the victory over all the things that war against me but i begin to understand how that it does he finds me he quickens me and then i start hunting for that resurrected life in this body how am i gonna get it how am i gonna get there how's it done it's done by the feeding of eagle food that's how he's going to do it he's going to feed eagle food it isn't somebody trying to preach an experience that you've got an evidence that you've got the holy ghost it's a transformation god's power to transform every virtue that's in that seed into a total manifestation hallelujah in what in me and who in this flesh why because he said so not by will not by might but my spirit i know i can look i can see it when i'm standing here i i've learned to look at it in my own face when all the things that are wrong with my life are milling in my mind and i know there's a gap between what my flesh is really doing and my spirit and i find out that i'm two people i'm a i'm a flesh man and i'm a spirit man and i hate the disparagement between the two but i realize i can't live like that i can't live in the torment any longer of having something a part of me that doesn't conform to the word and i want that and i call for it but praise god there's a quickening spirit there's a spark there's an eagle food that can take this flesh the spirit and the mechanic and the spirit and bring them two together that the seed and the flesh become one hallelujah i could look forward to it i don't i don't care i've failed for so long i'd do good for maybe years and years and then flop and i can i go back and get all the mechanics right and now i'm realizing wait a minute there's a position there's a time there's a season finally the eagle food will come out finally the revelation will come forth finally it'll come out of the storehouse and feed me give to me the i said that i could live he said that dirt so we look and he says one day the story goes an old eagle flew over the barnyard and she was looking everywhere she found him oh for that resurrection to realize that he really wasn't a chicken after all he was an eagle that's the conflict am i chicken and my eagle do i got the holy ghost do i not got the holy ghost i am i'm a failure am i doing i'm struggling i'm struggling i'm struggling oh what what ends the struggle what ends the struggle the sheaf offering the wave offering that's why you sent malachi 4 5. that's why he sent revelations 10 7. that's why he turned his back to the audience it was not for the chicken it was for the eagle so you will know that this is an eagle you will know you have eagle food you know you have the word that will take you and transform you you don't have to look no place else there's not another place there's not another voice there's not another ministry this is him and it'll do what it's promised to do amen you think you can stop it no you might kick against the prick prophet of god said you'd save god and yourself a lot of trouble but you got to know there's not another thing you can't be lukewarm you can't serve two masters you've got to finally decide you've got to come to the place that you say i want my flesh resurrected i want what's in my spirit in my flesh it's like trying to fix the flesh with the flesh it can't be done [Music] don't get mad at yourself be real with yourself if you're drawn away that's what sin is every man's trot away to his flesh it comes in his mind's drive but when it's finished it worketh death now there's a power not you mustered up it's at the same power that brought you the revelation has got to finish the work you understand he's got to finish the work he's got to quicken that body because that body contains his seed and that it'll never bring forth he's got to quicken the dirt along with the seed oh i love it i've got hope let's just look at what he how beautiful he says it he says oh oh that resurrection to recognize that he really wasn't a chicken after all he was an eagle he was always taught to look down you say what's that we're always taught to look down on our failures to look down oh i'm so terrible oh i i lost oh i i speak i i oh oh oh you're always taught to look down look down look down look at what a miserable wretch you are look at what a failure you are look at all the bad thoughts you have but wait a minute when i see these things come to pass when i see the signs of the end when i see the son of man appearing in the cloud i can look up because my redemption the redemption of my flesh the redemption of my failures my redemption draweth nigh i can look up my redemption comes my resurrection's going to come it's so beautiful he says and that's what our trouble is we've always been taught to look down but now we've got eagle food that says never never never have a negative thought believe all things are possible to them that believe can you imagine the same faith that you would pray for somebody is the same faith that you can use to overcome something in your life that you know is evil that you know is wrong that you know you're doing that you're enslaved to you have the victory over that by divine revelation of his word when you come to the place and say wait a minute you're not going to hold me down you're not going to keep me in bondage i had there's a power that i'm going to ask for to come down and quicken this flesh and bring it into subjection to the word oh what a glorious resurrection that was what a glorious resurrection this is this flesh being resurrected into the quickening power of god in it having control over me oh my oh my let's just read this here he said and the barnyard and he heard a scream it said look up this way and he looked up above him and there was a creature with 14 feet wings powerful than all the chickens there was in the barnyard and claimed him to be her son what do you think god's been doing you're my son your name's on my book you're in my thinking so we always use that for our soul and for our spirit we always use it for the hope that we'll be there someday but i'm telling you you can take that same promise and use it for your deliverance use it for your healing use it for your complexes music for everything you can use that same word promise that quickens you in the spirit to quicken you in the flesh oh god i'm just i just want that spirit so bad amen i know i know by word promise that i can have victory not in myself but in him all things are possible he says he said mama how can i get to you she said jump start flopping your rings you're an eagle start believing for it you got a problem quit looking down look up there's someone that can deliver me mama you can deliver me from this chicken yard i'm in you can deliver me from this scratch i'm feeding on these bugs i'm feeding on this garbage i'm feeding on you've come by here to deliver me the reason you came by was to tell me you don't have to eat that anymore you got to just start flapping your wings she knew she had a son somewhere no matter what he's been raised up in she's got a son somewhere he said god was the great eagle didn't matter what you're raised up in i love that but i always wanted what was my way of deliverance i hope i can make that clear to you always trying to use the mechanics always trying to use the religion always trying to use the rules i'll tell you what i'll do i'll get over this i'll listen to a tape and read my bible every day i won't miss a service i'll do this if you can do one thing for your salvation he died in vain eat the food that's right eat the food there's no other food provided through this bride that didn't come through william mary and branham they don't even use his name hardly in church anymore they won't even say it they've separated the messenger from the message they separated the eagle from the food you know what he told the ministry to do break down the eagle food not come up with messages not come up with sermons there's a time to do that but we don't have a message you understand the son of man ministry was the resurrection life to have a resurrection let's just read just a little bit and and uh it just marvelous we'll just go down he says so she knew she had a son and god knows hallelujah he's got a predestinated foreign church he knows he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere and when the holy spirit begins to fly over it the wave sheath you understand you may be in this message for a long time be till that message really starts waving over you why is it going to start waving over you why all of a sudden in your life all of a sudden working on you working on your life working on your heart working on your spirit not mommy's religion not daddy's religion but it begins to work because it finally found you it's finally your hour it's finally your time i'd love to force it on my kids and i forced it pretty hard on them the mechanics you know and what did they do they just got in wreck after wreck after wreck after wreck but one day one day that holy spirit began to go over them and that russia mighty wind come in that sheath was waved you've got to understand what is the sheaf it's the word of god waived by luke 17 30 the ministry of the son of man you will never be able to separate it there's no life outside of it you can claim jesus christ 2000 years ago but this is jesus christ today not the flesh of william adam but the spirit that quickened william branham's body that that body came in and where paul could say be ye a follower of me as i am of christ he said he says oh my the same yesterday today and forever not some mystical story but a reality paragraph 142 no matter how many tried to tell him an eagle he didn't know what an eagle was he didn't know what an eagle was you can't become something you don't know you understand that you can't become something you don't know so what did he first have to do to you he have to reveal it to you he had to reveal his spirit he had to reveal his word he had to reveal the ministry then he had to reveal to you that you were seed now after that's happened now you know what you're to become because he put an example what was the example it was the sheaf that was waved it was the first fruit that was waved and what does it do when i see it and i recognize we read this quote earlier he says it shows you that you've been accepted that you too will come in so i got bugs on me praise god he'll spray the bugs uh i've got bad leaves on me praise god he'll pluck the leaves let the husbandry dig it up at the roots that have done it with the word of god that it will be barren or unfruitful oh my we're in the greatest our church it's your time to get serious with god it's time to get on board it's time to recognize the world it's time to realize this isn't an emotional outbreak this is bodies bodies human flesh bodies coming subject to the word of god emotions thinking everything becoming one with the bridegroom hallelujah he didn't even know what an eagle was you didn't know if you would have known you would have but he had to reveal it to you he had to bottle feed us year after year taking a little food till we grow into that taking a little food till we grow into that do you understand this revelation of this resurrection of this body 10 15 years ago would have choked us to death yes we wouldn't even believe it was possible but now we can actually believe that this wretched man that i am when i would do good evil's present but praise god for christ jesus paul didn't leave it there he didn't even know what an eagle was yet he was an eagle he would not understood it until he seen something that reflected him that he reflected rather would have never understood it you would have never understood it without this message without this eagle without this vindication you didn't even know your eagles now you know your eagles now we're starting to know that we're eagles and we'll just hurry here he says what is it then when you see not a denomination not a phd not an lld not a good neighbor you see that's everybody's definition of christianity a good neighbor a good doctor a good teacher a good church program said i've seen pride brides in churches and churches that i'll tell you that statement floored me especially when you have everybody running around every time saying we're the bride we're the bride we're the bride wait a minute where's the resurrection of your flesh he said a good neighbor but a son of god molded into the image of god with a dynamic power of god to answer the request of the day how many really have heard life's story of how this vessel was molded and what was he to answer the request what is the request you know what my request is brother billy that this flesh any real true person that loves the lord wants this flesh to come into subjection to god's word he knows he's a believer he believes what he hears the only problem he's got is his flesh and the request is lord let this flesh come into subjection i don't want the enemy to have dominion and power over me i want to be free to meet the request of the day that he's the same yesterday today and forever and there ain't no hen going to hold you i'm tired of old satan hand clucking around in our lives hunts for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real eagle recognizes the call of god's word do you understand what this message is calling us to be perfect because he's perfect the message has a call oh aren't you glad you've been called he wouldn't call you abraham's faith was he wouldn't promise me if he wasn't able he wouldn't call me if he wasn't able to complete because the scripture says if he starts a work in you he'll finish it you know what we're seeing now we're seeing the finish this is the finish victory victory over myself praise god oh i've been wanting it so long i hate this guy don't worry son i'll deliver you from yourself a real eagle recognized the call of god's word why he's an eagle a eagle to an eagle this message is to you because you are it it's evil to an eagle you're not a follower you understand you're not a follower in in the sense of just following like this he gave a beautiful he says there was one great bird that sat on the pond remember that story brother tim and he said at a certain season this one eagle knew it was time and he made the call and all the the geese and the ducks gathered around him and he set out on the flight they all were geese the the call inspired them to flap their wings and to start flying he says why he's an eagle eagle to eagle the word before the foundation of the world how long do you want to stay here if i'm getting too long please i'm going to take two week vacation i want to go out war out i want to empty out amen the word before the foundation of the world that's what's calling you not present-day work brother rem didn't preach the word from 1941 or whenever his ministry started he was preaching the word before the foundation of the world he was preaching the spoken word which was the original seed he wasn't preaching the man-made seed and then he come and exposed the enemy that added all his junk to it the word from the foundation the word to the word the word predestinated to the written word for the hour you realize your position he's hunting for it the written word which was from the follow finds the word the truth of it the revelation of it and and now what is the effect of that great thing and he goes on talks he sees talk about this power this hunt quickly we want to know how he could get there he wanted to know how he could get there with her he had been taught he couldn't do that that's what the hens taught they still teach it in their churches you can't be like jesus you can't do the works that he did you can't have the life they do that they taught you couldn't do it half the people are preaching this message as religion as denomination he knew he had a church he knew he had sons and daughters he knew that there would be people that manifest in their flesh that he's the same yesterday today and forever but what did they do they taught that he couldn't do that you can't get no higher than you can jump oh my goodness satan you're exposed he tells you look at the way you're living you can't get no higher you got lead weights on you you've got sin you've got all this stuff you've got all these troubles you can't get no higher than that oh you lying devil you've held me down long enough with that you've held me down long enough trying to get the mechanics to get all that right i can't do it but one thing i can do i can look for that same healing power that same quickening power not the same one that healed my flesh to heal my sin to heal my body to heal my doubts to take me higher then i can jump i can live higher than i'm living not by power not by might not by my will but by my spirit saith the lord quit trying to produce it it's killing you it's free you don't have to prove nothing your past is wiped out it's in the sea of god forgetfulness it's fresh today well i wish you knew how much he was here he couldn't get no higher look at the chickens that's what they say look at the chickens you can't get no higher look around look at all the other chickens look at all the other churches look at all the preachers look at all the believers quit looking at the chicken look at the wave offering eat the eagle food this is all right here this is what he's saying i'm not saying it you understand i'm just reading it i'm just repeating it but he stands in his word the same yesterday today and forever no matter what the chickens are you're an eagle just start spreading those wings just get a little exercise in them start moving up the word to the word it works that i do shall you do also he said that if you believe in me the works that i do you shall do also see because i live he lives also you know what one of the other works jesus did was get behind me satan we forget that work he could have never done what he did until he told satan to get behind him until he accepted that's in the message perfect faith until he accepted what god made them beautiful message exercise then the word to word the works that i do shall you do also because i live he lives also and if the spirit that raised him from the dead dwells in you it will quicken your mortal body this is the promise it'll quicken this mortal body what does it do now listen so that you all know and this is easter i want it to mean more to you than any other easter ever did see i want you to see it we know what it's done for him but i want you to see not will it's already done the same for you what does it do it quickens the mortal body not quicken you to another body it quickens this mortal body that we live in it quickens it in other words brings it to life so the same life that's in you now he's going to quicken that body and bring this body to life so the life that's in your heart the life that's in the your mind the life that's in your spirit is now actually going to come into your flesh all the chickens say you can't do it you can't jump no higher than you're living right now you are stuck keep looking down tweet just keep bringing everybody down around you the spirit nobody no preacher wants anybody to fly higher i wish you'd all fly higher than me i need help i'd hate to rely on a sick preacher to pray for me all the time i hope my spirit's right and then he talked you once walked it talked about and he says and he says then right in the middle of that the paragraph 49 he says he'll also bring your mortal bodies the dust of the earth into subjection so he wants to make it clear that it's actually your flesh this flesh it'll actually bring this flesh your mortal bodies the dust of the earth into ejection you see what is it subjected to what christ who is christ the word not theology but the word then you say that these things oh i think it's all right for this or that and he talks all and he goes down he says but brother paragraph 54. brother when you heard that scream there was something in you you're an eagle to begin with why you are the seed the resurrection of the s-o-n has drawn has drawed and the sheaf wave upon the earth to make you recognize that you are an eagle not a denominational chicken if the spirit that raised him from the dead the word that dynamic of the word dwells in you it quickens also your mortal body well the first thing he had to let you know is that spirit was dwelling in you you can't become something that you don't know now you know it and you got this flesh now he's telling you don't be discouraged i'll quicken your mortal body too oh thank you might not mean anything to you but i live so long for this it'll bring your mortal bodies objecting to the word then you say and he comes i said my brother when you hear that scream you're a seed paragraph 154 and that resurrection of the sun has drawn the wave sheath upon the earth to make you realize that you are an eagle not a denominational chicken if the spirit that raised him is dead the word dynamic word dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal body now now how we flesh of his flesh bone of his bone because quickly while we're yet mortal sinners mortal ready to die these bodies it quickens that body what a quickening life the spirit that once like to drink and run around and commit adultery and all that is quickened why the things die and you are resurrected the quickening of your mortal body the real you is resurrected in flesh what good does it do if the real you is still an old flesh you can't put new wine in an old body this is the gospel this is what he's been preaching this is what he's been telling us no wonder they rejected it because they wanted the un believer in their midst they didn't care they wanted numbers he says therefore this in paragraph 56 therefore your body is the temple of the dynamics because why from the beginning you are a part of the dynamics oh there is your resurrection what is the resurrection it's this man dying and being resurrected into full obedience and becoming the word as he is the word together there's the church in the resurrection with him these bodies right now are quickened you see you've heard it you believe it changed you from denomination to the word or whatever you are he says a stranger will hear my voice and they will not follow but we follow and so you ask where's this message taking you we've been so interested in going up that we haven't been interested in the resurrection that's here the resurrection of the real david mcgarry this dirt being quickened to life in his life that if christ be in you he's got to be in you it then by that spirit will quicken this flesh oh it ends the conflict it's so wonderful that that's also promised i hope you can see it what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is i preached a long time but i i just i i can't i just don't want to say it and read it and preach it and act like it's mine you know there's a lot of ministers i know them i'm not against preachers but they'll put they'll put one of brother brandon's quotes in their sermons and they just preach along and they read the quote just as part of their sermon it's plagiarism it's what it is but you know why because so many people get embarrassed when you say brother branham said i think i'm going to say it a different way jesus christ said through brother branham jesus christ used brother branham to say this i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ because it's the power of god unto salvation can you imagine them rejecting i think of that clip brother andrew when he says you want to get all that suspicion you want to get all that fear you want to get all that doubt out of your heart do you want to come under one headship you and your body united with him he starts going to the place discerning everybody and finally he looks down he says you on that cot rise up it's tremendous i think i can play that where's my phone go go get it do you have it on your phone andrew can play it just play that one minute clip okay united under one head ship i think it's may 26 1958 i'm guessing and then if you just go go up about five minutes ahead of
