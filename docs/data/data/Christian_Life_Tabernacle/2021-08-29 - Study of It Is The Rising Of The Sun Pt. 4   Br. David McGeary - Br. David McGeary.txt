of god those that are streaming through us that are here and then all our visitors will welcome you as you invite brother mike for our songwriting and man god bless you good morning you can read psalm 29 this morning you know it begins with you know these sentences it says give unto the lord o ye mighty give unto the lord glory and strength give unto the lord the glory do unto his name worship the lord in the beauty of holiness you know that was part of a song that david sang in worship the day that the ark of the covenant was restored in its place in jerusalem you know it was the day that the presence of the lord you know that mercy seat he that dwells between the chair of him was set in its rightful place in their midst this is an effort that david had been working on for months years to restore that presence that ark to its rightful place you know there was great preparation involved in that it had his complete focus on getting that presence of the lord back in its rightful place in their midst it says in first chronicles 15 1 and david made him houses in the city of david and prepared a place for the ark of god and pitched for it a tent says in verse 3 and david gathered all israel together to jerusalem to bring up the ark of the lord unto his place which he had prepared for it you know before that presence before that ark could be put in its proper place it had to be great preparation to make sure that everything lined up just just so everything had to be in its right place among between the ark and the people and how it was carried on and then this type of thing but when it that word that presence found its place there was now something acceptable that could be offered up it says in first chronicles 16 28-29 almost a repeat of psalm 29 give unto the lord ye kindreds of the people give unto the lord glory and strength give unto the lord the glory do his name bring an offering and come before him worship the lord in the beauty of holiness only now with that presence in its proper place could an acceptable offering an acceptable worship be made you know as much that could be said here you know brother david's been speaking recently about the importance of finding that presence of the lord you know it's all about our position relative to his presence you know the thing that struck me as i was reading psalm 29 is his presence has an effect there's an impact of his presence you know moses there was an effect of the presence of the lord in moses's life you know here he was just caring about his daily business and you know he saw something that nobody else noticed no other shepherd turned to look at this thing but you know he could have kept walking he could have gone on home and been content with testifying that he saw a work of the lord you know he saw the presence of the lord there was something he saw there was something that happened one day and just been content to live his life fellowshipping around the goodness of what god had once done without there being an effect of that present you know it wasn't until he turned aside and it began to affect his walk that if the effect of that presence began to be made known in his life otherwise it was just a tale to tell it was just a sign that he could point to rejoice of something that god once did but until it affected him until it changed his walk that's when the presence began to have an impact you know it says in exodus 3 4 and when the lord saw that he had turned aside to sea god called him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i not only did the presence have an effect but it had a voice and the moment he found his place in that presence that place where he was became holy ground an acceptable offering you know brother billy spoke last wednesday night about the effect of the presence on jacob that effect was is that he began to have a different walk he had a different identification he could now fulfill his place in the covenant you know it is interesting even back in genesis 3 8 when it talks about the voice of god walking in the midst of the garden the scripture calls that the presence of the lord because adam and eve hid from it so it has an effect it has a voice there's an impact of his presence you know we could all say amen that there was a voice a presence in our age in our generation but the question is is what effect has that had on us as individuals the effect of his presence isn't how you feel in a worship service but has your walk been changed has your identification been changed does the voice not the tape but the voice have an effect on us as individuals are we simply satisfied that god did a historical work and fellowship around the sign and the work and the things that were said and spoken are we satisfied with the doctrine or has the presence the voice have a continuous daily impact on our walk on our identification on our character you know as we read psalm 29 this morning we'll see that his presence his voice has an effect it causes births and it uncovers hidden secrets verse 9. it's all who truly come into that presence it brings glory to him in verse 9 his voice quickens and causes newness of life verse 6 his voice tears down every institution every monument all things that appear strong are shaken that voice has an impact has an effect so as we read psalm 29 this morning i would just you know ask all of us the question myself included is that voice is that presence having an effect individually on our lives let's read psalm 29 together it's just a short psalm starting verse 1 give unto the lord o ye mighty give unto the lord glory and strength give unto the lord the glory do unto his name worship the lord in the beauty of holiness the voice of the lord is upon the waters the god of glory thundereth the lord is upon many waters the voice of the lord is powerful the voice of the lord is full of majesty the voice of the lord breaketh the cedars yea the lord breaketh the cedars of lebanon he maketh them also to skip like a calf lebanon and syrian like a young unicorn the voice of the lord divided the flames of fire the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness the lord shaketh the wilderness of qadesh the voice of the lord maketh the hinds to calve and discovereth the forests and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory the lord sitteth upon the flood yea the lord sitteth king forever the lord will give strength unto his people the lord will bless his people with peace amen god bless you i have your seats [Music] let's sing that song in the city where the lamb is alive [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] is is [Music] [Music] oh oh [Music] well i am foreign oh is oh [Applause] is [Music] oh oh [Applause]

of his hand so we certainly are thankful for that let's approach him this morning if you have a desire on your heart just let it before the lord i believe he knows what it is before that you even ask but he still wants to see that you trust him and that you believe so father we bring this morning our petitions before you our hearts father we realize that we're needy of you father we examine ourselves and we recognize how really short father we are of the goal in the life we should be living but whether we've come here this morning that you would minister to us you would minister your word to us that you administer your spirit to us father that we could be a greater light for your kingdom father that we could do the works that you had done father that the love that you showed us that we can show others lord i ask for your presence and help this morning as we look to your word today for the truth of the hour that we live in we ask you to bless the people we pray in jesus precious and wonderful name amen amen god bless you if you have your bibles let's turn into our bibles into the the gospel of saint john in the first few verses of the scriptures and thank you musicians this morning this morning we're going to continue in our our sermon of the uh it is the rising of the sun and we're going to talk today about the chief offering so today we're going to try to go from paragraph 81 to 118 and then tonight from 119 to 116 so there's some just wonderful things this morning so uh we'll just rejoice and fellowship around the word of the lord so don't don't let condemnation come in uh if you love the lord and your heart has condemnation he's greater than your heart so let's just let's just soak up the word of god this morning in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the gospel of saint john the very first chapter first verse in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not our gracious heavenly father we ask that you would bless your word to us this morning in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated before we listen to our our uh 22 minutes this morning of the message i'd like to say that one of the great understandings of the gospel in order to go further with god and understand the word of god is you've got to understand the sovereignty of god amen that in the beginning was god and anything that was made there's nothing that was made that wasn't made by him and being the maker he is the purpose the maker has a purpose why he makes something so everything that is done and everything that has happened and everything that comes forth is according to god's good pleasure his plan it's his design it's what he's chosen to do and he has the power over the clay peter says he says well why do men say why if god made me thus and he says well does not the potter have power over the clay to make one to honor and one to dishonor so you have to understand that in the beginning it was god and man has been trying to figure out a god that can only be known by revelation to whom he reveals himself he said to peter flesh and blood hath not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it to you and we know that faith and revelation are the same faith cometh by hearing the word of god but it's not just hearing it's re hearing or understanding or having the word of god revealed to you and so in understanding the sovereignty of god then we understand that anything that man would come up with outside what is revealed is fiction and so this we read this uh statement and it's in paragraph 63 of the same message he says now is there another gospel and now that's a great question so there's only one truth one true gospel there's only one true god there's only one god that sovereignly bringing everything to pass just the way that he designed it it's his will and it's his place and it's his purpose so it's it's not it it's not given to man to know god outside of revelation and and so by in understanding that what we pray for is we pray for revelation we pray father open my eyes that i might see in this age that we live in it's referred to as i sap i pray for i sav that i might see now we know that we're in the greatest times of conflict that our country's ever been in we know that there's wars and rumors of wars there's plagues there's sicknesses there's earthquakes and diverse places there's hurricanes there's storms i just don't know what greater picture could we draw to mankind that puts a call in our heart i need god i need god and i i was raised in a world that didn't have god i was raised in the catholic church we thought we were the ones we thought we had the pope you know the vicar of christ the one that could have all the answers and he's a failure and a church is a failure we know the scandal that rock the church just full of perversion beyond the thing and that carries the name of the lord i mean what we don't it's hard to face the reality of things sometimes but god is not against us he's for us you understand he doesn't want us to walk in darkness he wants us to walk in the light as he is the light and he was the light of men in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word is the life and the light of men it's by the word that you see it's by the word that you understand it's by the word you know what god has for you you know so many times man wants to place it on an experience and experiences are wonderful i love experience i love to dance i love the shout i love those things i'm speaking in tongues but they're not the light you understand they're momentary blessings but they don't give you vision down the road they don't give you vision to the right they don't give you vision they don't it doesn't give you an understanding if it's a moment terrible personal uh maybe joy but you can't walk by it but you can walk by the light and that's what we're to be in is be in the light and that's when satan came to test him and tempt him on the mountain he said it is written it is written it is written the word said the word said because the word was the light of the circumstance that was the truth of it it's the word and and so the word is what the sovereignty of god expressed in other words i made it all i made it all for a purpose i had a reason in doing everything i've done it's not given to you to figure it out it's given to me god taking full responsibility to reveal it to you if you'll accept it he didn't put us in a maze and say find your way out he was the light of men he was the life of men and so he said is there another gospel paul spoke of it to one of groups he said i'm so surprised that you've turned to another gospel which there is no other but a make-believe gospel now i don't want a make-believe gospel i don't want a make-believe experience i don't want a temporary experience i want something that's genuine down inside and grips my my soul not something that's acceptable by by the norm or acceptable by approval of those that are around me i want it to be a personal ex expression of knowing that he loves me and that his love that he has shown me would would cause my heart to love him in return we love him because he first loved us you can't love him until you understand the love that he has for you now you might be going through all kinds of internal conflicts and you know teenage rebellion and social rebellion and all that thing but let me tell you something about this world this world's going to pass away but my word will not pass away civilizations have gone by i love a great lover of history i've been to the pyramids it's hard to believe that the people that built those are no more and and man has went to the grave forever but praise god we've got one that's come to the from the grave so he said this he said he says it's just a make-believe gospel to a denominational fiction of fiction now we don't want fiction so the only thing that ends of fiction is the truth the only thing that ends a lie is the truth the only thing that ends a deception is the truth because the truth is what sets you free and if the truth is what sets you free and we even see it in abraham when lot was brought into bondage abraham beat this his plowshares into swords and went out to recover his own and god is going to recover his own he's going to find his own he's going to find what he planted he's going to germinate it he's going to nourish it and he's going to harvest it god can do anything but fail and so this is when we approach this this morning as we begin to listen we we want to begin to understand that this is the sovereignty of god it was god's way it was god's plan it was what god chose to do and he's revealed that look at us this morning we're from everywhere and it's to show beyond a shadow of a doubt that this gospel is not given to the flesh it's given to the spirit amen and all of us live by his spirit and so we're going to if you have your bibles and brother brahms going to go to a scripture that we can read and and so to this point we've talked about the everything that was made was made by him and so we've been talking about the type of nature that's where we've been romans 1 and 20 says the invisible things of god are clearly seen by the visible things that are created around us that's a paraphrase but so we've been studying that as the s-u-n has come up how it brought seed to life so the invisible things of god are go ahead and put romans up if you can romans 1 20 we'll just spend just one quick uh second on on that before we move uh forward so romans 1 20 says for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen okay so that's the word of god so that word of god as we'll see here in a little bit is being presented to us the the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen so what do we see we see the rising of the sun we see the seed being planted we see the seed coming up we see it coming to harvest and coming to fruit so we know that god planted that's why he sent the s u n in the first place because he knew he had seed he had a purpose for that seed he had a fruit in that seed and so now we can clearly see in nature and by the creation of the world are clearly seen the invisible things of god so by those things we know that there's something in us that god wants to bring up for that's a good thing to ask yourself am i am i desiring to be what god wants me to be am i desiring to come into the sovereignty of god am i desiring to let him mold me and make me and reveal in me his will in my life that's a great question we don't want to add god to our program i want to be what god wants me to be i want to be what he wants me to be where he places me and i walk by faith i'm not questioning i'm saying i want to have the fellowship with him and if i can't have the fellowship where i am then it's a good sign to you that where you're at needs some adjustments maybe it just needs house cleaning just like i would suggest i i would never hear me i would never give up my teenage daughter or son a phone without having some parental guidance attached to it and if they don't want it they don't get it you want a phone i'm going to know who's texting you i'm going to know what you're watching i'm going to know the devils that are trying to get in your life so we can have a prayer meeting at your bedside before we go to bed but don't you put that devil in one of your daughter's hands because i'll guarantee you there will be a big old devil texting her hi sweetie baby have you ever considered this have you ever thought of this have you ever tried this yeah joke i don't know i've i've i know there's some out there some say bark's the best i thought well bark bark yeah somebody's gonna bark i think i'll bark but don't do it it's easy for us to fall into amnesia and not to realize there's real events taking place so the invisible things of god so we talked about that the type of nature the type how the sun came out how it brought the seed out how it had to come to maturity and we talked about the uh the the rising and how that the seed come forth and how it rise now we're going to talk what after that resurrection what does god do and now we're to this place in the church where we're going to talk about the sheaf offering how according to the word of god what was supposed to be waived over us and when we get to paragraphs 83 to 89 that that's some of the best explanation that i can find to why that we have service on sunday so we'll start with 81 and he's going to go to the book of leviticus the 23rd chapter and the ninth verse and we'll listen to those and then we'll listen to this part and then the 82nd paragraph he says when you get to your place and your position and i believe that that concerns that the the the time the age that we're in the time the church and the individual god god saves the world the church and the individual all the same way and so this is real good word now it's better than what you can learn in college because how many had well i i didn't attend college but at the university i went to that stuff still working i went some day to somebody else and someone looked me and says well we don't do it that way anymore so what do you mean 20 years we've done that no we don't twist those things on wires anymore we do this and forget that you guys are it's old-fashioned now it works and that's why we like the old-fashioned gospel so we're going to listen to 22 minutes of old-fashioned gospel we're going to talk about it and we're going to understand what that we're a part of the living word that we're a part of so god bless you this morning i believe you'll enjoy this next few minutes i'd like for you to turn to another scripture i got wrote down here it might help you a little it's found in the book of leviticus the 23rd chapter the 9th to the 11th verse listen close in the law of levitical law god speaking to moses listen all these things are types now and we'll stop here for a few moments to get into this type and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i give unto you unto the place of position that i have given unto you now you speak to the children of israel that when you get to this certain place that i promise you i take you when you get there in this land now speaking natural here type in the spiritual and shall reap the harvest thereof you may receive what i told you thereof then you shall bring a sheep of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priests and he shall wave the sheep before the lord to be accepted for you all tomorrow after the sabbath the priest shall weave it if there would be any holy ritual it should come forth on the sabbath day which was the seventh day of the week which is saturday but did you notice in this memorial the wave it on the first day of the week the sheep which was the first of your seed that you planted when it comes up and ripen you cut down this sheep and take it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the lord for your exception that you are accepted you have come with your sheep and he used to wave it before the lord on not on the sabbath the seventh day but on the first date which we call sunday of s-u-n-d-a-y that's a roman uh word which they called it the sunday for the sun god but how it is changed it's not s-u-n anymore it's the s-o-n-d-a-y the sunday that that part of wheat god's first one up from the dead is to be waived over the congregation that we are his seed and that's the first of the seed of gold the threat waved upon the first day of the week on sunday he raised up wave goodbye and ascended up on high in the presence of the people notice it was the first corner of god's wheat that had been raised from the dead god's first corner wheat by god's quickening power god had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was that sheep that's why they had to weigh that sheep or it was the first one that come to maturity and it was weighed as a memorial of thanksgiving to god believing that the rest of them would come there was a sign and today because he was the first son of god to come to full maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth and it's waved over the people oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although it had been typed in many times and we'll see later he was typed but this is really the first fruits of them to slept he was waved over the promised seed that had promised of life he was waved at the day of pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty russian wind and was waved over the people the pentecostal people that was up at pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and to be waived again we realized in the last days according to luke 17 30 in the sunday again in the days that the etho in of man will be revealed or waived again over the people who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word would say flesh and dwelt to and of all the teaching that we have in confirmation of the word of god by word of god by signs by wonders we see the day that in the book of of luke here as we just quoted from the luke the 17th chapter 31st and malachi 4 in the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again is ways over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the shot of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us has given us life as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth all those times in many places he was the first fruits of those who slept and the bride coming of christ coming out of the church there'll have to be a sheep wave to get in the laces oh waiting of the sheep what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheep i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the broad age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism it will be a message that the form of turkey on the word has turned back again in its full power and being weighed over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did that day all right it's called alien he live also speaking to his wife because ali you live also what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was way back to him on the day of pentecost the word made manifest now as i say to be waved again in the last days now for instance you say when i awaken it brother abraham i know what church that well i do too but now praises what if if we were going to go back to tucson this afternoon now and each one of us had a was going to go in a a big cadillac brand new and all of the seats were made out of absolute skin softest of the leather soft and easy to sit in and the floorboards were plush the steering wheel were nickel plated and had diamond studs all over it and the engine was mechanically tested to be exactly the right engine and the wheels were all had bearings and breeze up and the tires were all puncture proof and blow out free all been tested scientifically they've been pushed off the assembly lines both of them and both of them filled up with gasoline that's the running power the gasoline because it is the oxygen but now when you're going to start them all don't bulk up look just alike but there's one of them don't have any spark any firing power well you say the power is in the gasoline brother brand but i don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest those powers that's there's a power there to confirm that this gasoline it just might as well be water until no matter how much theologians claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much like the bible until that wave sheath until the holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move we put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics it needs the dominating power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest him and to bring to pass that this is gasoline it might be in a gasoline can it could still be water see but the only proof of it is put this life on it and it'll prove where it's getting sweet and when you try to put the holy spirit in the denomination you're as much as trying you could get a splatter you ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon but oh i'm so bad that there is a ten thousand power the word of god and a holy ghost light it up and to resurrect the power of god into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church that shoved that cadillac down the road on the dynamic power of the holy ghost which came back to us ways over the people at the day of pentecost making him the same yesterday today and forever that was the first sheep come up from all the prophets which was the son of god the king of all prophets there's been churches churches brides brides churches rise pride but there's got to come one hallelujah there has become a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamic shut up [Music] makes that church live in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simoniz job when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be a dynamic to make it work that's what he proves that's what easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was god himself the dynamics in the word body of jesus christ whole stepping dead in the grave shaken to life and rise again and roll away i am he that was dead so dead till the sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he was not only the mechanics god's word he was a dynamic to prove it and is he being the group the blood has to come forth god is part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and the others that spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken his spirit the family spirit coming the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dynamics and until the church or the people all these easter bunnies and turtles and big churches and pirates will fail and pass away until that church become full time and the kenneth and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so hey why is that in john 14 12 see that believer told me the words that i do shall he lose hope amen i'll give him a charge of my dynamics and his mechanics that's the world the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up down all you want to and deny this word amen you won't do any good you're just cranking around them the pistons have got sparked out of fire but no gas in the far back it'll only work as they come together amen so one will set steel and the other will go up that's the only thing there is to it yes they both might look like both claim to be churches proclaim to be brides but one has mechanics and dynamics it brings it to pass but what he said is the truth it just won't no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics comes when the time enemy comes that bar is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that exposures it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion ever moved for he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the research that's the real power of god but with the dynamics notice it's the spirit that quickly it's the it's the spark that fires it's not the that fires it's a spark that fires again you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the words the father living father sent me so send i you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything i do only that which is pleasing to god now as he sent me sir sandai it was the same mechanics and it takes the same dynamics to operate it and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the dynamics will take its place paul said the gospel came to us not in word only through gasoline only but through spark also to make it move there you are it came to us in that manner it's the same spirit that raised him up that quickened the true believer to eternal life did you get all that i'm still trying but let's just take a moment and just walk back through it just a little bit as we look at some of the wonderful things he's pointing out to us he says in 82 he says unto your place your position and you know we've talked a lot about that the positioning of the church and where that we are and i believe the church is coming to the position in other words the maturity it's coming to the place where the genuine can be manifested and we had to come up by the hearing of the word of god faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god it was it was a mistake that people thought that azusa street was the fulfilling of the word of god but let us just follow this through so we understand it took the sovereignty of god and when the church got to its place it then in its position and it got to the place that it could be fruitful in others it had matured up it had grown up to the harvest then you took the first fruits of that in the natural and waved it and i thought this was beautiful i hope that you caught it when he came through this through 84-86 he says not the sabbath the seventh day but the first day which was called sunday that was the day it was waived in other words it was the day that that seed came to maturity was on the first day of the week that's why we have service on sunday we're we're recognizing the day that the that that seed that that that first one from the dead the first one that came forth from the dead i was dead and now i'm alive forevermore the first one of all those that have gone before the first one that brought the life for all those that are in the future because i live you shall live also that's why we come together on sunday it's a celebration of the resurrection it's the celebration of the first fruit it's a celebration of what all the other days brought forth and that's why when people they try to say well the law says but we're free from the law of sin and death we are now living in the law of life and liberty look we don't celebrate the law that kept us in bondage we celebrate the life that has brought us to liberty and so this is a beautiful thing why that why was it because it was on the first day that the fruits of what god planted in all the prophets in all the prophecies and all the psalms and everything all the scriptures that were prophesying and all the types that were all given this was the day that the fruit of all that and all of what they prophesied was manifested and to be proved true so we don't celebrate the sabbath which is the prophecies we celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecies what was the resurrection so you know when you get a lot of times at high school or college or wherever you are someone will try to come with the sabbath and and they'll try to come with the law and they'll come with all these all these things from their point of view well you understand why that you do it yes that was good until the sheaf offering was waved until the first fruit of what's promised and it won't be long you'll find out they don't believe in a baptism of the holy ghost they don't believe in an indwelling spirit of the lord jesus christ coming into your life the same spirit that was in him in you that's what we're talking about that's what you can have this is what god's offering and so we look down so we see that through those verses through 89 he says that's why they waved had to waive that sheaf 89. for it was the first one to come to maturity it was waived as a memorial of thanksgiving to god believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign so that's what it is that we celebrate that's why that we celebrate on sunday not out of tradition we don't con when you come to church don't come here just because it's sunday and we go to church on sunday come to church knowing what you're doing knowing lord i'm honoring the fact that you rose from the dead that this is a memorial to the resurrection that and why that i'm here this morning is is not to be condemned of sin i'm here because you're alive you're real and and you said if two or three of us gather together that you'd be in our midst and if you're the same yesterday today and forever and you're here with us now you can do what you've always done you can make a difference in your life you can take my guilt away you can take my fear away you can take my depression away you can take my anxiety away you can take my sickness away lord i've come here because i'm in need of you i'm not in condemnation because i'm sick i'm not in condemnation because i'm struggling i'm not in condemnation because i'm a failure because i can do anything without you but what i am here to do is to come at your feet and say i'm a sinner and i need your presence i need you to come into my life and make a change in my heart and make me that i'm not barren and unfruitful that's why we're here if it becomes a religious ceremony then they're just as good as we are worshiping on saturday but we come on sunday with with with an understanding of why that we worship on this day because it's the first day it's the day that the first fruit came out of the grave it's the day that all what those prophets prophesied all what they were looking forward to all what they were talking about finally manifested now there was eternal life back in the presence of men to do exceedingly and abundantly above what we could ask or think so it's a beautiful thing any time that you do something with with understanding the intention of what you're doing you get the benefits of it if you don't you walk out and you say why did i come here why did i come here i come here this morning because i'm needy i've got a job to do but i'm trusting that the holy spirit will minister to me even as i look at this word i believe that he can minister to me that he can when i step out of this anointing that comes with the word of god and i'm just left alone without the gift being operated and without the calling because different callings are without repentance when i stand all alone out away from the word and out away from the anointing that just me and him if i never preached another sermon i could know that he could take me by the hand and lead me to that land that that that he's so real that i know in my heart beyond a shadow of a doubt i'm not questioning it i'm not worrying about i've got no question that i know that there's life after death i know that there's a heaven i've cleansed that out of my mind the question's not going i know because he lives i live also that's what he says that's what he says to his wife amen that that's what what we do we do and and so we we that's why that in those verses we come to the understanding and and the scripture says can you study to show yourself approve that you can give an answer to all men okay and so and you'll be challenged on it but you've got an answer you've got a reason you can explain that that first fruit was waved the first one that came out of the grave it's ever it it's you know i want to worship somebody that's alive not go back and say well they killed the lamb on the sabbath they offered the lamb yes yes you're you're celebrating the offering i'm celebrating when the lamb came alive i'm celebrating not what put him in the grave i'm celebrating when he took victory over the grave and he and he raised up and he's put death in hell behind them that's what we celebrate you understand why we celebrate sunday you understand not because america celebrates sunday they don't celebrate sunday in church anymore they sell it at a football field but we know why so i i just thought that was beautiful that you could just the first fruits that's what we're from the quickening power of god manifested quickened his life he was that chief amen and then it was waived at pentecost amen so we celebrated coming up out of the ground because if he stayed there then we'd know we'd stay there we'd all be sitting wondering what the next step is what happens next what happens next if when you put me in the ground if god chooses that to be you won't wonder what happens next you say i wonder what's going to happen to brother mcgary next can you imagine everybody they put in the ground they never had that question answered what happens next what's next what after this oh job he got to there what becomes of a man and all of a sudden that god flashed that lightning across them he says although the squinted worms eat my flesh yet i'll see god he knew what happens next amen this is why we're here today because we know what happens next amen aren't you glad of that i know what happens next glory to god i hate it when i don't know what's happening people call me up and say i'd like to sit down and visit with you i want to know what for i'll start asking a question will you kind of give me a general idea what this about i hate being blindsided praise god satan can't blindside us now he can't blindside with cancer he can't blindside us with nothing because we know what happens now hallelujah amen i wish i had known that in high school every time i took a test i knew i was going to flunk i'd say but least i know what happens next this off don't mean failure because he can't fail amen and that's so he says now today because he was the first fruit god come to full maturity that's why we what a glorious lesson now he said this is in types so we're going to drop down to nine anyway he said that wave to the pentecost there came a sound of from heaven like a waving i like that amen there it was you go wait until you're endured with power from on high this message gets really rich we're just starting to break into it right now i i want to skip all this and go right to what's next and then to what's next amen so we see that now let's take a second here and look at verse 92 i mean verse i'm sorry paragraph it says and to be waived again we realize in the last days according to luke 17 30 in the sun day afghan again it says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so he's telling us now that the this is a promise to the gentile church remember the first one was waived at the day of pentecost which we call is like the second exodus okay so he was he he came up and all those that were dead before he was the first fruit and they came and appeared to many okay so that that that that was the first fruit of that now there's a gentile church another wife that he's saying because i live you shall live also and now he's got to wave that over them too the great uh sheep offering the great wave offering and so he said he was the wave of the day of pentecost when there came a wave of russian and was to be waived over the people at pentecostal people that was up at pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and to be waived again we realize in the last days according to luke 17 30 in the day of the son of man will be revealed or waved again over the people what is being revealed the the sheep wave offering is what the word it's the word the true word not the fiction not this not the uh not the man-made gospel but the true word of god the truth what was in god's mind what was in his thinking what what the whole program was from in the beginning what if i could say it this way what was made you understand this was made in the beginning all things that made nothing that was made that he didn't make so what is being waived over you is really what god made it's not a fiction it's not a story it's a reality of god's truth amen not a a choice test you know let's talk i always like true and false i figure i can at least get 50 50. i might know some and then the rest i'd guess it ain't multiple choice you understand god can't reveal anything that is in him amen that's where people just can't man can't get away to bringing themselves into subjection and humbling themselves to the plan that god had made beautiful now he said who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that's what's being waived and we'll get to it just in a second he said and if all the teachings that we have the confirmation of the word of god by the word of god by signs and wonders we see today in the book of luke here that as we just quoted luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse and malach thai 4 5 and different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit among us and is giving us life he was the life of men you understand he's he's giving he he's giving us life and so we find out that that's the promise you understand that was the promise the promise was that malachi 4 5 would be waived luke 17 30 would be waived revelations 10 7 that's the reality of god that's what god's done that's what was promised and we'll just follow this through so we can tie this together he says he says wave the sheep what is the sheath the first one that come to maturity the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was was sheep now if it isn't it it isn't the that's why he couldn't come from denominations now everybody thought azusa street right was was the uh the feeling of the holy spirit and the baptism of the holy spirit but the baptism couldn't come until the sheep offering was waived so it proved it wasn't it because what did it do it went right back and denominated so something had to come with the power of the resurrection the same signs and the same wonders that he did somebody that was one with him the works that i do shall you do also so there had to be somebody come on the scene that could reimpersonate the gift that jesus christ displayed showing that it wasn't him it was the power of god the life the dynamics in him that man and spirit had become one hallelujah and that the rest of them would come to that same place it had to be waved over couldn't come from denomination couldn't come from teaching because somebody that could come and show the mystery of the grave you know what the seals are it's the mystery of the grave it's the mystery that put all of us in the grave religious grave denied us marked us with trinity doctrine marked us with all kinds of false things and false conceptions of god living in a denominational fiction thinking that we're going to be saved jesus himself said unless ye be born again you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven and he didn't put that on us he said i'm here to birth you what do you think he's doing in this day he's saying i'm here to birth you not make you shout not make you run in circles praise god if you do but to make the word and you become one someone said we had to go up there and get them kids the holy ghost i thought did you get them the word did you get them the sheaf offering did you give them luke 17 30 and malachi 4 5 and revelations 3 14 is that what you give them if you didn't give them that you didn't give them life amen the truth listen he couldn't it couldn't come from denomination it wasn't an azusa street experience it wasn't bringing people to identify themselves with an experience giving you a false evidence if you know me you know me a lot of people know me they don't exactly shout when they see me but they know me a lot of people avoid me i don't blame him but when you know him you know him how do you know him you only know him by one thing his characteristics his identification and what is his identification i do nothing until the father has revealed it to me me and the father are one i live by his word i i do i i do what he reveals to me we're one father i pray that they may be one as we are one that the love wherein yet you love me and i love them that they'll enter into that capstone they'll enter into that love let me tell you something when you start running after experiences and feelings it's because you're dodging the truth you're dodging the fact that you haven't confessed your sins a hundred percent then you haven't died out to yourself and that's your resurrection you're putting on a religious covering and there's no need to do that because he's here to forgive you of every unrighteousness and every failure he's here to give you life beyond anything you can imagine he's not against you he's for you chad you don't need something to those leopards weren't ashamed to go to because they had leprosy they said i got never see i always liked the story of the woman that washed his feet prophet of god said she sat there with that oil and she said if i go wash his feet he will know what i did to get this money and then she said but he's the only one that can help me oh wouldn't you like to hear paul harvey do something on her life the rest of the story i imagine she prospered and was a shining light who knows all that god did for her so we see this as as we follow down he talks about the the cadillac remember they can both look identical they can have everything the same they can have they're both cadillac they're both filled with with the word of god don't think that these people that are in denominations don't have the word of god they'll embarrass you they don't have a tape to listen to they read them scriptures they read the books of their denominations that tell him how to interpret the scripture don't think you're going to walk into somebody and use your intellect i've heard the prophet of god say many times i i don't know the book like a lot of you do but i know the author real well and he's here and i take every spirit in this building under my control what good is it the word without the life so we're just going to jump down here until we saw in 97 that he's speaking to his wife i just think that's beautiful he talks about the cadillac he talks about it all being exactly the same everything being right but let's just take just a moment to really uh look at this part here he says paragraph 103 no matter how much theologians claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much like the bible until that wave sheath until the holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move so it doesn't matter how much you got everything laid out how much perfect you are nothing is going nothing is going to be brought to life until the word i hope i can say this right is waved over you to prove that it's gasoline now what is waived okay he said what is the sheep offering what is it it's the word that's waved now we miss it sometimes because we think it was this discernment that was waived or the miracles that was waived no here's what was waived what was waived was luke 17 30. so all of a sudden here comes the ministry of the son of man which is deity dwelling in a prophet that deity comes out and knows the secrets of the heart it was luke 17 30 that was waved it was malachi 4 that was waved it wasn't the vindication that was waived it was the word in flesh being waived i'm going to wave malachi 4 5 in front of you behold i send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day i'm going to wave luke 17 30 as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man that's what he was waving waving revelations 3 14 under the idea under the angel of lady osea write these things you're blind miserable poor wretched and don't know it that's what was being waived the word was being waived to prove if the gasoline was gasoline because that's what ignited the word now we're just on the beginning of this joel 2 25 was waved all the cankerworm all the palmer worm what so much of his way john john 4 12 unless a corn of wheat fallen to the ground how many times did you hear him talk about the corn of wheat going to the ground coming up in luther what was that that was the word being waived over the people it wasn't it wasn't the signs and wonders and the miracles that just vindicated that it was the word it proved that it was a word it identified that this was the word because it did the same things he did a lot of people pray for the sick but you won't see them turn their back to the audience i don't know if my wife read to me the daily altar today it was beautiful i was gonna play it i was so inspired brother andrew sent me a a little clip the other day i was so inspired that i was gonna play it maybe i'll play it tonight but he talks about a woman that comes up to him and and he talks and he says he says oh you've got arthur you your knees are bad you've been in a car accident she says that's true and you got a short bald doctor she said that's true you've got you've got arthritis in your knees and now the skin is starting to rot around the joint that's true she says can i help can you help me and he says no but jesus can help you and he's provided a way says do you believe she says i believe with all my heart and then he says well go to the altar and kneel down she says no i'm gonna kneel right here where he saved me and where he healed me and she knelt down right there got up and skipped off the platform why that was luke 17 30. that was malachi 4 5. waved over the people so you can't get there you can't make it it won't be the real thing without that sheep offering waved over it it'll be so close that will deceive the very elect but the truth of it the non-fiction of it the true church is not going to get it by the experience they're going to get it by the word and god by the giving of divine revelation of the word the church is built on revelation god revealing to you that this is him it's him not a fiction it doesn't need my help i'm not ashamed of it god used william mary and branham as the vessel the first fruit that came to maturity not out of denomination not out of man but the first one that came to maturity out of the divine revealed word of god coming to pass that was what was waived go ahead build whatever you want to build on the past but the true bride has got to come forth sorry he says when you try to put the holy spirit in a denomination you're just as much trying you'll get a sputter boy isn't that the truth i've never seen so much butter how many people are just dropping like flies you don't drop if you're in his palm because he said nothing can pluck you out of my pawn i i i implore you like i'm imploring my own life make sure you're calling make sure your experience with him find a closet find a place someplace talk it over with him till you know you and him are one and if you don't understand it that's fine you can say lord i don't understand all the doctrine but i know you and i know you'll never leave me and you'll never forsake me he says it won't move we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics i i could just preach we've got the mechanics that's all we've stressed church order the messenger of the hour the doctrines who we are that's just mechanics who we are as a mechanic it's it's i'm a cadillac there's a lot of cadillacs did you did you hear what he said i i just i just thought this was so marvelous there's been churches churches brides brides church's bride's brides i thought you got to be kidding me really i don't even want to say i'm bride i'm bride been we walk around like we're the bride that's new no it's not we we got this whole exclusivity that's all built on us patting one another on the back our own fellowship there's only one fellowship there's only one place that god provides for worship and that's under the shed blood of jesus christ it's him and him alone and that's what he said he said he said it it's the power of god that shoves the cadillac down the road there's been all kinds of of brides brides but there's got to come oh hallelujah there has got to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics makes the church live move in the power of the resurrection i believe that that's where we've come to that we put our faith in the mechanics and all our leadership has been from the mechanics but now there's another leadership i'm dying to get into that message leadership where jesus he kept all the law he went to the temple he he did the works he kept all the things but then there was a part of him that said i have need to go by here there was another leadership of the dynamics there's a leadership of mechanics which is obedience i'm led to pay my tithe i'm led to give offering i'm led to assemble myself together i'm led to apply via token to my house and kick out the tv i'm led not to read this i'm led not to listen to this i'm led to be kind and gentle and peace and and those things that's all the leadership i'm led by the spirit into the statue of a perfect man but now there's another leadership when those mechanics are in place which the mechanics represents the flesh that now there's something that says the power comes to move you go here do this i have an unction another time first just not to hide in the car it's time to drive what we've got it's time to put on display that this is the word not manufacture it not go run to a hospital and say i've got the power of god i'm filled with the spirit of god i lay my hands on you and satan i command you to come out yeah you'll find out you're talking to a son of cephas right there i know a man that was praying and so he come i'm a woman come up he's going to pray for he lay his hand he starts commanding that devil and everything and she just punched him in the face and got down and started beating him he said call the authorities call the authorities she really does have a devil spirits are real god delivers his children of spirits praise god thank god but it's not we don't have to produce anything you understand this is what he's saying we don't have to produce anything the mechanics is set we need the spark we need that spark of the spirit that spark of leadership that spark of holy unction he teach a beautiful message called hear ye him something that's real i don't want to live a life that i've lived that i polished the hubcaps and and kept the mechanics in shape all my life and he never told me to drive it anywhere show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith by my works what is the works the works is obedience to that still small voice remember closing here he says he says until the church becomes both dynamics 113. both dynamics and mechanics now so we put all the emphasis on the mechanics paragraph 111 he says and he says as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and others has spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him now we're going to hold that because tonight we're going to talk about the other quickening here we're talking about the quickening of our what our spirit tonight we'll talk about the quickening of our body he said because she is flesh of his flesh just as a man and a woman are one taking from aside she is taking the spirit and feminist spirit from him the flesh of his side made both mechanics and dynamics the spirit of him and the flesh of him put it together and makes the mechanics in the dynamics and tell the church and tell the church or the people see in other words it's the flesh of him and the spirit of him so we have to be spirit and then our flesh has to come in to subjection i can't help but say it because we'll go through it but how he quickens your spirit he can all that same power will also quicken your flesh we take that scripture of romans and we keep thinking it means the resurrection it doesn't mean the resurrection it means this resurrection now this flesh coming out of corruption and sin and coming into the dynamic power of god where the spirit and the flesh are dwelling in harmony oh my flesh wars but i can bring it under subjection by the dynamic quickening power of god so it's in harmony with the word of god amen and then we'll just close he said until the church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things that he did if he sit on 16 cylinders so will the bride amen for he said in john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also i'll give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics i'll give him a charge of my dynamics and his mechanics amen i got my body under subjected now i'm going to get a charge that the world will not be able to withstand it and i'll raise him up again in the last day that's the easter message that's the dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics it only works as they come together amen so one will set still and the other one will go up that's the only thing there is to it yet they both might look alike both claim to be churches both claim to be bride but one has the mechanics and the dynamics it brings it to pass of what he said is truth and and you can read 114 for yourself they'll put it up on the board you can read it people think i'm against shouting and jumping but i don't believe you should shout or jump any higher than you live and then it settles this here this is the spark in 117 you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things and he is the word you can't do it without the word he is the power in the word so if you're going to lay hands on sick on somebody you don't have to worry about do i have the power you have the word the word told me to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover if they believe and you lay hands on the sick they know that you're doing the word so they know they're not looking for your power they're not looking for your faith they understand that this is the word this is what's coming to me it's the word that's coming to me this this is what i'm doing i've confessed my sins i've come up i'm being prayed for it it's not the preacher's god of power the preacher the power is god sparking the mechanic word to make it manifest so when we tend to say you don't go somewhere and with with an idea or trying to convince an idea you speak the word he's the power of that word that takes that word and breaks it to the person you're talking to in other words you've got to understand and understand that he's not afar off he's here he's with us he's in us you understand it is him bringing life to the mechanics that you've been obedient to now he's joining the two together so that he can spark it and move it down the road he doesn't want you to drive something down the road that doesn't identify him he doesn't want you living a life that doesn't identify him he can't spark that but if you get the mechanics right you apply the token you're doing the best you can you don't have to be perfect but if you if people know in your life i'm doing the best i can i'm trying to overcome i'm trying to live i believe god's working with me i believe that gospel testifies god will testify to that that's the word and he manifests the word that's your weapon that's our life what was waved over us was the word of god that's why they rejected the word they didn't reject brother random they rejected him because he was the word they looked at his plan and said no we don't need it your way we'll find our own way and they'll never come to pure bride life they'll never be this living word because they rejected the only thing that can spark this to life and so it it's beautiful i guess now this is good a place to close but you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as as he is the word is the father living father sent me so i send you as the father has fired me and push me into everything i do only that which is pleasing to god now as he sends me so i send you with the same mechanics and it takes the same dynamics to operate it all these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the dynamics will take place and don't misunderstand that in other words him pushing you is not like pushing you it's like leading you that unction is a push from the inside that little something that takes place on the inside that leadership to take what you know is the word of god and turn it from mechanics to dynamics amen i just hope you enjoyed the message this morning and and so we'll tonight we'll just pick up and it's 15 minutes long tonight and just fellowship and then after tonight i'm going to go out in at my mom's house so i can rest for a couple weeks to get ready for the meetings i'm not supposed to think you know all my life they've been saying what have you been thinking or don't you think before you act you know now they're telling me don't think so i don't know how to do that i wasn't supposed to preach for three weeks but i told that ain't happening because that's the only time i really feel good but uh so we'll cut we'll get to the halfway through the message tonight we're only halfway through i mean have you seen all the things that have just poured out and and tonight he's going to talk about the same spirit i'm sorry i have to it i'm so excited about it but the same spirit that brought your seed to life and gave you the revelation of jesus and changed your nature now that same spirit can come into your life and rule your flesh so those temptations don't have any power over you and that's where a lot of us are weak he can just get there and get us we pop off we watch things lust rules over us but praise god he's showing us that the same thing that made us believe is the same quickening power that can take this flesh and take all the gossip out wouldn't all you sisters like to be free from all that gossip all that tongue waggling you do all that talking about the sisters and all their life and all the stuff that's going on don't you want to get that all oh i know who you are would you like to get that old unruly member just locked down we're bitter and sweet don't come out of the same you know what that takes takes quickening power you don't take willpower you've got no control it's a hard thing to rule it takes god it takes the same spirit that brought the word seed to life in you to now overflow and bring this body under subjection and you say well that sounds simple no after 50 years i'm starting startling finally to understand that my health wasn't in the mechanics i tried to bring it under subjection by mechanics but it's not it's brought under subjection by dynamics may god bless you brother billy will lead us to worship let's stand together it does anybody have we don't have room for a altar call or or anything but this morning just looking at your own life and knowing what your own struggles are the scripture says he knows what you have need of even before you ask i know we have those amongst us that are battling sicknesses and the world might call them diseases or whatever but it doesn't matter because we know that god has the power to make a change and whatever we have to do to get in position to take the place that's promised to us and when we move into that place that's promised to us god then can wave that sheaf over us and spark that gasoline that's in us to make that word move i hope that i can explain that to you so you've got the gas in you you've got the word if you're in position then all you need is for god to spark that faith and when that faith is sparked it'll move the mechanics it'll move you into that place and so brother john i know many of you don't know brother john marar very well and sister gladys but he is one of the most lovely men you'll ever meet humble i went to visit him at his house and you thought the president of the united states had come [Music] you know and for the whole time they just talked about how glad they were and to see me and what an honor it was and just humble tries to make a disservice every time he's got and he sent a text he said you know the doctors told me they can't do nothing the hospital told me they can't do nothing medicine said they can't do nothing they say here's what we'll do we'll send you home we'll give you a bunch of drugs so you don't feel a thing and you can die i believe there's another option and you say where is that option brother mcgarry it's right here ask anything of my father and don't doubt in your heart and sometimes our heart condemns us because our mechanics aren't right but what happens when your mechanics aren't right you take it to a mechanic right how about taking your mechanics to jesus the same spirit that gave you the revelation of him is the same spirit that convicts your flesh and your mechanic and the more we start applying the token the more we start bringing our mechanics into obedience the more we all get together on the same page i thought brother mike's exhortation this morning was so beautiful i was going to stick my head out the door and say amen when we bring our lives all of our lives not having a spiritual life and a physical life but when those two can come together as one and i know we got our spiritual life right you've been taught it's our mechanics that's a little rough so we need the power of god to come and work our mechanics and give us a tune-up if so if you have that this morning just ask him to come by and help you with those things that you have some people it's alcohol some people it's cigarettes some people it's sports there's all kinds of things that satan tries to gain power with us and all things are lawful but all things aren't expedient and we must do all things in moderation but sin is not anything you can do in moderation because it's death but let's keep brother john in prayer that that he could have a miracle in his life that the god he served and loved and praises will reach down and touch his wife the others that are sick and you know if you made a mistake then you just put it under the blood he's righteous and faithful to forgive you he doesn't want you to fail he wants you to live and with peace and joy unspeakable and full of glory he wants you to have a peace that passes understanding i don't know why i'm so peaceful with all that i've done because he came by [Music] so if you'd have something on your heart someone on your heart if you have a desire to draw closer to god than you've ever been before i'm not preaching at you this morning i'm standing here with you i want my flesh and my spirit to come together as one i hope you can show that to us tonight lord you know the needs of each heart i ask that your holy spirit would go by that the word would go by and you'd speak to their heart and father they'd forget their mind and just look what's down inside and i believe if they look down inside they will know that they really love you though they may be ashamed of so many things yet they love you lord and most important you love them and lord that's all you want to do is clear the air remove any petition that's between us lord in my heart's desires to draw closer to you lord how i feel like i've wasted so many years lord how i've battled my flesh the wrong way for so long [Music] and you've been there all the time to touch it and to heal it and to give me the power to conform it into the image of your word and lord i want to turn my struggle into your hands i want you to mold my life [Music] i want really to be lord if you would have me to be a part of that real bride that real union [Music] that we talk about lord i know we talk about churches and churches and brides and brides lord i just can't believe that your messenger spoke that lord i just want to come into that real genuine place where that love of god is shed abroad in my heart by the holy spirit father and i'm sure that there's those here this morning that are joining in prayer they're hands lifted to you lord that you can see that they're sincere lord here i am my hand is raised lord i'm here i'm in this crowd i'm in that place please see me lord see him see you hear my cry pass me not old gentle savior hear my humble cry while others without our calling oh please do not pass me by or may your love be our portion this morning if there's anyone that's sick this morning and you need healing in your body [Music] and you'd like to lift your hand to the lord and say lord i'm sick [Music] lord i i need a divine touch this morning i'm putting my hand up i know you're the lord i know your god i know you're the word and lord now i'm raising my hand that that spark can come and ignite my faith that i can accept my healing so if you're sick this morning just raise your hand to the lord oh lord i know we'll see supernatural because you promised that the pride would come
