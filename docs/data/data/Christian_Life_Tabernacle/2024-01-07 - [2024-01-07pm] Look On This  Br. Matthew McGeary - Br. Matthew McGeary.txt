we just approach you thank you for your love your grace and your mercy that you you have shown unto us Lord to bring us to this place where we could worship you in spirit and in truth Lord and we've just come now uh to partake in communion that ordinances that you've left for us Lord you said that we'd be happy if we would do these things and I pray Lord just may Joy be poured out amongst your people father for that we would be in Fellowship in this great hour when there's many people that are being uh uh torn apart and consumed by the enemy Lord but we're safe and secure under your wings Lord in your presence and we're so thankful for that Lord so we just pray your blessing upon this time of Fellowship we love you and ask your blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord if if you have your Bibles let's go ahead and turn in Ephesians uh we'll read um chapter 1 and verse 9 and then also um chapter 3 we'll just be a few moments and um see maybe what the Lord would have us to hear this evening Ephesians uh chapter 1 and verse 9 says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself and also Ephesians 3 and verse 9 reads and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats I just want to uh read a quote uh just a few quotes and we'll just see where the Lord would go but the prophet of God would say this in adoption he would say now he said he made known unto us the mystery get the Holy Spirit on you sometime and start running that and just watch how it goes well I want that you know we we don't want to just let that slip right over the prophet of God is saying get the Holy Spirit on you sometime and start running that and just watch how it goes this afternoon oh I had oh about 30 minutes to study just to look the lesson over maybe not that I'll say uh half of that 15 minutes between uh the times and I got to running and I thought the mystery how mysterious and the scripture packed me back into the Old Testament and then back over into the New Testament I want to say he wasn't in time no more isn't that wonderful he said oh I I only had about 15 minutes but when you get in the presence of God I want to say uh time is no more everything stands still and he says the in the scripture packed me back into the Old Testament then back over in the New Testament tied something together see the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will the mystery of us sitting together I I like this now now we're just we'll just go as long as you pull uh remember it cannot be taught in any Seminary it's a mystery you cannot uh uh you cannot know it by education by theology it's a mystery that's been hid before the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God I mean I tell you that's just a powerful quote there the mystery of his will the mystery of his coming and the mystery of us sitting together I believe that's all tied together we're living in the hour of the mystery of his will the mystery of his coming and that mystery is us sitting together there there's something that God wants us to know about that and and my I I just just wanting to surrender to the Holy Spirit as uh we were closing out this morning's service and and we were praying that just uh as we were saying the closing prayer I just felt these words uh just came on to my heart I I didn't know why but it said uh just look on this look on this and and that was just the most recent thing I I remember um the the the still small voice saying to me and then uh when we were asked to minister tonight the the only platform or the only thing I could think of was what the Lord just spoke in my heart look on this so we're we're going to find out what we're looking at or what we're going to look on or look at this or what the Holy Spirit uh would have us look at but you know there's we could go into many messages and and the prophet would talk about Look Away to Jesus or he would speak other services and expectation and things and it say it depends on what you're looking at you know and I and I would say the same thing this evening when he says look on this you know there's a lot of things to look at today and I would tell you we're living in Satan's Eden where the devil's doing his best to get you to look at the things that he has to offer to get you to look at Satan's Eden to get you to look at all of his devices and all the things that he has to offer and my I tell you it's there there's I I guess you couldn't exhaust it all whatever you want to get involved in whatever information and whatever entertainment and whatever games and everything my and all the advertisements and everything Satan's Eden has to throw at you I tell you there's a lot out there and I and I wouldn't doubt that that you you you uh you couldn't even digest or consume at all you hear people talking about if you're not careful you get online and all a sudden you get trapped in a rabbit hole and you're you're way down in this hole you're like how did I get down down here on the back side of the internet why am I even watching this you thought you were going to watch something funny and now you're watching something that's not funny and you you feel defiled and you're back looking on things you shouldn't be looking at like we shouldn't be living like that we want to be living in his presence we want to be living in the shakina of Glory we want to go in behind the veil we want to be able to enter into his presence where we're eating uh uh the the hidden Mana right uh we want to be feeding on that and if you're feeding on that in his presence we could just break out onto that and brother brandom talk about how there's people that are that are outside of the holiest of holies and they're eating the Mana but since they're not in the Holy Place eating the Mana that Feast is running out it says there's two types of people they're both eating the same thing they're both digesting the same Mana but but one's Feast is running out one it's not producing a life they just have an education they just have a knowledge they just have an understanding of the message but there is a people that is has gone in behind the veil into the presence of almighty God and that Mana will never run out that Mana will never rot because you're you're feeding on the hidden things of God and we're living in the hour where now our fellowship is on the mystery of God oh how mysterious is this mystery but talk about a fellowship talk about a fellowship we're fellowshipping on the hidden things that were hidden in the back of God's mind before the foundation of the world but God has now made them known to you and I oh what a fellowship we have that's why this is such a Brotherhood that that's why we have brothers and sisters around the world with with such a love and a Zeal because your eyes have been opened you've heard the shout you've heard the message of the hour oh it goes beyond the theology oh if we can just get the life of the message within us if we could just be feeding on the secret things of God I want to be be different I want to be changed I I want to know what he's talking about I want him to tie these these things together in my life what is the mystery of his coming what is the mystery of his what is the mystery of us sitting together and I'm just by God's grace maybe we'll say something that can stir up your minds to remembrance something that'll get you hungry for the word of God oh there's so much more to this message we haven't even scratched the surface don't you realize it's an inexhaustible Fountain where we get ourselves in trouble is when we make it Creeds and dogmas and intellectual and religion and we we we all just we got a little group over here and this is what we believe it's so much beyond that and there's so much more don't you realize it's going to take Eternity for God to unfold himself to us eternity we can't even com what do you mean it'll take eternity to unfold himself we can't even be we can't even comprehend it scripture says it has not even entered in the hearts and minds of comms the things that he has prepared for us but God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit I'm so glad that God by Divine promise has come in this day to reveal those things to us the fellowship the hidden Mystery so just trying to be faithful to the little word that uh uh God put on my heart just uh look on this we would have to maybe uh jump into uh into uh S as this the end time and and and uh that that's actually comes from a dream that Junior Jackson had so we'll just try to walk here a little bit and like I said if we if we get a little bit down the road praise God if not we'll go right into communion but we'll just see what the Lord would have to say here he says uh in um uh let me get my my books right here because that one's not going to work might work a little later but in uh is this the end time s uh the prophet of God is he's referring to to um uh uh some dreams and uh some happenings and if you're very familiar with that message I tell you you ought to go study it because there's there's uh uh I mean by the things that happened leading up to the preaching of the seals oh just so Divine and so Supernatural but the prophet of God would say now listen this Angel come down from heaven see the other seven angels of the seven churches was Earthly Messengers but this Angel all the message is finished the seventh angel winds up the whole thing and this Angel comes not to the Earth he isn't a man from the earth as The Messengers to the church ages that's finished but this Angel brings the next announcement and an angel means a messenger and he comes down from heaven clothed in a pillar of light a cloud with a rainbow over his head and a rainbow is a covenant it was Christ with one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and he swore that time will be no more where are we ask what's this all about I'm asking you so notice this is uh December uh 12th uh I believe uh uh uh 29th uh December 12th uh let's get that right the month is December and it's the 29th of December 1962 I believe it is it should probably say that but brother brandom is preaching this message is this the end time s because of all these happening and he says what if it's something to let us know how to enter into rapturing faith is it we we will We Run leap over walls is there something fixing to happen and these Old marred Vile bodies are going to be Chang can I live to see it oh Lord is it so close that I'll see it is is this the generation sir my brethren what time is it where are we at he's sincerely asking the question because of the events and the things that have taken place and the prophecies and the dreams and the way God has been dealing with his heart so now paragraph 371 he goes it might be closer than you think it is it's got me scared oh I haven't done enough where are we at now take notice of this now and let's not you lose the sobriety of how the prophet is earnestly speaking to his congregation and he's saying it it might be closer to you think it's got me scared oh I haven't done enough where are we I say if the prophet could come to a place oh my where he would sit there after laying his life down for this gospel and preaching and and being an obedient servant and surrendering his life and all the signs and the Miracles and the travel the books couldn't even contain uhh the things that were performed through the ministry of the son of man in our generation and here he would stand and say that come on he would say oh I I I I I I haven't done enough I say if there be anything that you would take away from this this service if you could ask in your heart oh Lord have I done enough I haven't done enough Lord will you come will you come pick up the clay will you come pick up the vessel Lord if that was 60 plus years ago and the prophet was saying oh it might be closer than you think it gots me scared oh I haven't done enough where I say oh God I haven't done enough Lord forgive me for my sins Lord forgive me for for not taking this serious forgive me for being dilator and and and and having a a revelation of the message of the hour but then leaving it on a bookshelf somewhere Lord may I take the book May I eat it up Lord may my life be a prophecy again to fulfill the very words that you have spoken oh I want to be that surrendered vessel that God can speak through he said time shall be no more he announces that time is over what happens what happens could that be so now Brethren seriously think of it if if it is then the pyramid is capped by those seven Thunders you remember the pyramid message it's the Capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual and sealed it and went and added to our faith righteousness and godliness and faith and so forth and kept adding till we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is God that's how he makes the individual and caps him and seals him with the Holy Spirit I want that in my life Lord I Want You To Build Me Up Lord and cap my life with your Holy Spirit Lord I want all of those things in this message Lord that you have preached to be fulfilled in my life as according to your desire according to you word not according to how I think it should be see we always uh uh got something made up in our mind of how the word should manifest in our life our responsibility is to believe the word and say Amen to the word and then as you receive the word you become the word when you reject the word then there's no hope for you if re if you reject Grace there's nothing left but law but if you can accept this message of Grace and say Lord be it unto me according to your word just as Mary when that angel came and said Thou Art highly favored among women don't you realize that Malachi 4:5 is saying unto you Thou Art highly favored amongst all the churches amongst all those people out there that are claiming to know me and are claiming to be Believers but you oh you are highly favored among women that you would be the predestinated seat of God that could receive my word and become the word and I would Veil myself in you oh what an hour that we're living in living in the hour of the manifestations of the Sons and Daughters of God what a fellowship it is Lord may you cap our life off with that then if that be so he's got seven Church ages that he's had seven mysterious that's been sounded away and they've fought for to bring back and now the headstone comes to cap off the church does the Thunders mean that my brethren s is that where we're at juny I want to take your dream look Junior before the pyramid was ever preached months before it seen this dream now he's referring to brother Junior Jackson which I he had a dream I believe it was in 1961 in February he says you say what about a dream now I like this really close you want to follow this he says what about a dream you say well brother Matthew what about Junior's dream what about it well let's just see what the prophet thought about it because I wonder have you ever studied out the dreams have you ever studied out the things that the prophet lays out on tape are you aware of sister stephie's dream are you aware o of of the seven dreams before the vision and the vision in 1958 have you followed these things down through the scriptures or or down through the message because it plays a very integral part just like the road to emus why did the Lord start at gen Genesis and expound all those things because he was coming to a place in an hour that the veil was going to be taken away and that they would see him standing right there in their midst and their eyes would be open he didn't just start at Genesis because he felt he just thought well I guess I have nowhere else to start no there was a purpose look there's an eternal purpose what it said God had an eternal purpose everything the way that he was doing it was for a purpose you being here in this building in this moment is for an eternal purpose but we got to believe it we got to live like it we got to act like it what are you looking at maybe that would be a good title what are you looking at that's how a lot of beef starts out in the world forgive that terminology but some of you know what I'm talking about you're walking through the mall you're walking through the hallway or something like that what are you looking at what are you going to do about it I want to ask you what are you looking at and then what are you going to do about it he is telling you to look on this Nebuchadnezzar Dreamed a Dream he says what about a dream well Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a dream that Daniel interpreted told the beginning of the Gentile age and when it would leave and it's done just exactly that way not one bit of it has failed oh you're telling me there's an importance of a dream absolutely there's an importance of a dream I will say so much but more the interpretation of that dream and that's what the the prophet is standing here doing he's interpreting he's showing all of these events that have been stacking up to the hour that we're now H H uh uh uh jumping into he says you notice the writing was on the Rocks I was interpreted it for them they were related that's the mystery of God that's been not understood for years could that be and then a voice and then notice in some mysterious way we we picked up up out of the air a sharp tool that opened up the top and in there was white granite but it wasn't interpreted there was no letters I I didn't interpret that that Junior I I just looked at it and I said to my brethren look on this now notice his statement here he says and that's fulfilled tonight and while they were studying that I slipped towards the West what for maybe oh my maybe to understand the interpretation of what's written in the top of this could it be and those blastings the other morning That Shook Me Plum till I raised up in the air as high as this building that constellation of angels seven angels in the form of a pyramid is that them Thunders that's coming forth could it be do do we do we are we're message believers we study the message do we even know what he's talking about and that's okay if you don't he's talking about the mystery of his will he's talking about the mystery of his coming he's talking about the Fellowship of the mystery but now what is he doing he's referring to a vision that he had on on on December 22nd and my if if you would just go into this and study it out it's such a beautiful thing because it starts with brother brandom having a vision in 19 1958 about going west you you understand that that brother brandom's whole purpose in life if I could say he he was born for a purpose and there was something always in his life to go west something always pulling him to go west what for because there was scriptural prophecies that had been written down that his life that he was born to fulfill you say what do you mean he was Bor born to fulfill yes uh William Brandon was born to fulfill Malachi 4:5 just the same as Moses was born to fulfill I shall send a deliverer that's right right he was born to be that deliverer to Israel that was the the predestinated one that was born that God would use to bring the children out by a mighty hand and bring them into the promised land and for this purpose uh Malachi 4 five our precious brother uh Brandon was born for this purpose that these things would happen and now he's coming to this place and he says is this where we're at because what did that Vision say in 1958 he said go out west when you see that steak being put down in your yard right he you know it kind of in that Vision it's really uh you know none of this we'll just we're just having a little fellowship tonight he you go you know he brother brandom had that Vision in 19 58 and and some guy come through with a bulldozer and just bulldoze the street and knock down his corner and his mailbox and everything just tore it all out and brother bam you know being a little Irish he got out there and started to talk with him a little bit and and you know he got in the flesh a little bit in that vision and he started to pound him a good one he went down the hill you know and the angel lord said now bypass that bypass that and go out west now the now what the prophet is saying he's now taking you I know we're just jumping in the middle of something we don't have time time maybe to lay all this out but he's jumping in and he's saying right now now brothers that's been fulfilled tonight why is he saying that because this is the last sermon he's preaching at the Tabernacle he gots everything packed up and he's going out west why is he going out west to bring the interpretation what's in the Capstone now let's just jump back and try to in that same message here and and try to catch a little bit I don't know what happened to the book there it is try to catch a little bit more on this uh if that's all right if if if like I said if we say anything just to stir you up and to go back and and read some of these things um so the the prophet God now if I can maybe just give a little background here so um Junior Jackson had a dream in 1961 so this is going to be in line with the vision so brother brandom has this Vision about going West in 1958 and and now the first Dream that's going to be in line with that vision is from Junior Jackson in 1961 in February and now from that there's going to be another uh uh uh six dreams there's going to be seven dreams in total sister stephie's going to have a dream so and it's all going to be in line with this Vision in 1958 because the the prophet of God cannot miss this this is why he was born this is so that so God is putting down landmarks and he's laying it out there confirming to the prophet where he's supposed to go where he's going to be and so now you lead on up um in this and on December 22nd this is when brother brandom is caught up in the vision of the Seven Angels but if you if you studyed out even that same night is when brother brandom had the the the dream about the the man with three clubs and how that was uh uh uh the the uh um help me out thank you how that was the Trinity the father son Holy Ghost and how that they Satan was beating down the church with that he had that so if you want to count that one that would be the seventh dream and then that morning he woke up I believe it was about 10:00 in the morning and there is the the prophet of God is caught up into a constellation of Angels in a vision a little bit up to speed so so that's where we're jumping in now brother brandom is actually referring and maybe just why why all of this is coming forth because this all pertains to The Fellowship of the mystery this all pertains to the Capstone this all pertains to the coming of the Lord this all pertains to the mystery of his will the mystery of his coming and the Mystery of us said I tell you this is a pretty big mystery you want to try to figure out while we're all sitting together it's a mystery to the world it's a mystery oh but praise the allmighty god the mystery of us sitting together is cuz we have heard the shout hallelujah our eyes have been open that's the mystery of us sitting together tonight is that we've been joined together right now by the quickening power of God that we might be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye that we would receive that rapturing faith that we would be gone right so just trying to jump in here somewhere where the prophet of God is is is is talking about this he goes and then it come to me this is uh paragraph 211 and is this the in sign of the ERS he says and then it come to me not a voice just come to me oh that is the angels of the Lord coming to give me my new Mission and when I thought that I raised up my hands I said oh Lord Jesus what will you have me to do and the vision left me for almost an hour I couldn't couldn't feel now you people know what the blessings of the Lord is but the power of the Lord is altogether different the power of the Lord in to in in them kind of places I felt it many many times before in Vision but never like that it feels like a reverent fear I was so scared till I was paralyzed in the presence of these beings I tell the truth as Paul said I lie not you never caught me saying anything wrong about something like that something is fixing to happen he said then after a while I said Lord Jesus if I'm going to be killed let me know so I won't tell uh my people about this but if it's something else let me know uh but nothing answered he said and the spirit left me for about half an hour I guess or more and I said Lord if it is then then I'm going to be killed you're you're finished with me on this Earth I'm going to be taken home now which which if that's it that's fine that's all right so if that is let me know send your power back upon me again then I'll then I'll know not to tell my people or anything about it because you're fixing to come and catch me away nothing happened I waited a while then I said Lord Jesus if it didn't mean that it it if it didn't mean that and it means that you've got something for me to do and it'll be revealed to me later then send your power and it almost took me from the room I found myself somewhere over in a corner I could hear my wife somewhere trying to shake the door the door in the bedroom was locked and I and I had my Bible open and was reading uh uh where it says I believe Romans 9th chapter the last verse it's Romans uh chapter 9: 33 behold I lay in Zion a Corner Stone a stumbling Stone a precious Cornerstone and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed whosoever shall believeth on him shall not be ashamed look we've received a message with is Christ and if you believe on this word that you have received you shall not be ashamed and I thought it'd be strange that I'd be reading that Spirit still packing me in the room and I closed up the Bible and stood there behold I lay in Zion behold I lay in the bride what what are what are these things all about what is he saying look on this because what is coming forth It's that third pull it's the opening of the word it's the Capstone coming crying Grace Grace look on this I tell you there's a lot of things to look on and Satan is doing his best to distract you from the message of the hour this is that which is going to give you rapturing faith and he's doing everything in his power to distract you from looking on this message and earnestly praying right earnestly praying God reveal this to me see we have to understand you are Your Own Worst Enemy and Your Own Worst Enemy that first nature that must die is a very religious nature and it can grab a hold of a quote or an idea and make you feel all nice and fuzzy and warm like you've arrived to something but we haven't arrived to anything oh I say where is that evidence in our lives that we've been changed that we've been born again that we're in there behind the veil living in the shakina glory where where the pillar of fire is and we're feeding on the Mana and Revelation is breaking unto us I want to live in that place I want to die to this flesh I want to crucify this flesh I say Lord reveal yourself to me I want to live in there prophet of God would say this in the indictment he said he said I challenge any man to show me anybody and and know this tape goes around the world any Bishop will come uh uh uh uh to my study or before this congregation and point their finger to one place anybody was ever baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost in the New Testament I'll show you where every person that ever was baptized and those who were baptized different had to come and be Reed baptized to get the Holy Ghost what are you going to do about it stay out there in your Creed stay out there in your dogmas and die now I say there's a great danger that comes upon us because we have been called out we feel like maybe as we we are uh in the association of the so-called message there's nothing for you to come out of but we got to come out of our thinking we got to come out of our ideas we got to come out of our preconceived ideas of what we think the message is when the last time you really got on your knees and prayed for God to reveal and give you the Revelation who is this mzc who is the son of man what day are we really living in Lord I want a greater revelation of Malachi 45 all of these things look it's constantly unfolding and we want to be living in the presence of God behind the veil where the word is constantly unfolding in our life other than that we become stagnant we become just borderline Believers we become just a good religion with our Creeds and our dogmas but God is calling say look on this look away from those things let's look at the revealed word of the hour what are you going to do about it stay uh stay out there in your Creed stay out there in your dogmas and die you're you're guilty with Wicked hands you've took the Prince of Life The Word of Life and crucified it to the people now what did they do they didn't know it today men walk ignorantly they don't know that it's the truth they think it's some kind of ism they don't dig down now this is where I wanted to get to they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation Lord help us now we know he's preaching the indictment he's inditing this generation with the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ I'd say he had to be here to be crucified that's right A lot of people get things out of balance they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough oh my is he talking to somebody or do we we got that down we we we cry out we pray for Revelation enough we get the spirit of Revelation upon us enough I mean we're just good right no they just take it they just lightly take it oh well I believe there's a God sure the devil believes the same thing oh I believe the message sure the devil believes the same thing the de the devil believes it more than some people claim to believe it the devil believes it and trembles now follow this hey this is convicting to me the de devil believes and tremble people just believe it and go on but the devil's trembles knowing his judgment is coming and people believe it and don't pay no attention the judgment is coming is that how we've received the message is that how we're believing the message we just believe it and go on whatever career path whatever uh uh thing that we want we just we just go on any kind of way never really earnestly contending for the faith never crying out to God for Revelation never getting down and getting into your Bible and getting into a place oh where you just feel like the presence of God is packing you up in the room and and you're in your Bible and it's I want to tell you that's not just some fantasy that was reserved for the prophet that's for every son and daughter of God if you would just get away somewhere from the busyness of life and quiet yourself before God and say God I need an answer God I need a revelation God I hear the pastor speaking I hear the the the the the Evangelist speaking Lord I need something more Lord I need a revelation I want to be in that place I want to be in your presence I want to be eating that Mana I want to be receiving the spirit of Revelation oh God reveal yourself to me and when he does that then there's a change because if you don't have that your Feast runs out oh you go you go to the camp meetings and and and you you you go to the church service and everything and you get all revived and you feel all good but what do you do you go right back down into that cycle the prophet of God would say why and why are people so tossed about he said but you ever meet somebody they're the same on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday said he don't need to go to church to get pumped up he's just always the same why because he's living behind the veil I say oh God if that's what you're Prophet said or me into that place I want to be the same s days a week 24/7 living in your presence I don't want to be tossed to and fro back and forth don't you realize that's what the devil's trying to do is get you out of his presence get you out of the message look at this look don't you realize the devil's over here saying look at this look at this look at this look at your job look at your friends look at social media look at your bills look at your debt look at everything you're going through that's what the devil's screaming is look at this look at me look at say look at your condition look at your trials look at this look at uh your doctor whatever he told you you have what do you call those things symptoms diagnosis look at this right just reminds me of that story when brother Brenham came and prayed with that couple and their their daughter was sitting there uh dying on the bed brother random came in and and prayed a simple prayer and that couple got up and said oh thank you Jesus our daughter healed and that little nurse standing there she just couldn't take it like what do you mean what are you talking about she's over there saying look at this don't you see the diagnosis don't you see how bad this is your daughter's going to die and that brother just like a fatherly figure just put his hand on his shoulder said oh honey I understand you're trained to look at that you you've been trained to look at all the don't you realize that's what Satan's Eden's trying to do do to you young people it's train you teach you how to think how to process all of his agenda and everything that you're digesting and consuming don't you know that science and education is of the devil why do we put so much importance on things that are of the Devil look at this look at this career path look at this job opportunity look at this advertisement look at this news look at this sport look at this hobby look at this knife look at that pan you can spend two hours looking at pans yeah I mean you can spend two hours looking for the best this or that after you read all the reviews I like to go to the bad ones first you be like me I don't care if it got 4.5 Stars I want to know what what the the bad ones are after five years and five honey I got it studied out I know exactly what to buy honey the kids grown out of that we didn't need that for four years it's not going to help us anymore I want to ask you all these things just be how how much of is it going to help you take a body change I tell you some of us get real real serious about careers and educations I don't know why we're here we put a lot of time and money invest into that I want to ask you how much closer has it brought you to the Lord we should pray about these things look everybody doesn't have to go to college there's a pressure though the pressure of this age for you to go to college and get an education and all of these things the pressure just weighing upon look at this look at this this career and that that that that you say you know you got to be like that brother say I you've been trained to look at all these things but I'm not looking at what the world has to offer I'm looking on this I'm looking on the revealed word of the hour I'm looking on a Divine promise that has given me rapturing faith that I can be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye that the quickening power oh if that same spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you it will also Quicken your mortal body oh praise His Wonderful Name hallelujah praise His Wonderful Name the prophet of God would say this we got a little time Pentecostals you say well we believe in speaking in tongues for the evidence sure speaking in tongues is all right now we're we're in uh now we're just jumping around here in an absolute because brother brandom preaches the absolute that morning to Serv as this the time and he references that same scripture uh Romans 9:33 so we just read a little of this uh he says speaking in tongues right but that is still not the evidence many people speak in tongues that's true and that's as far as they ever go the devil can impersonate any gift the devil can impersonate any gift that's got any gift that's in the Bible Paul said though I speak with tongue of men and angels though I give my body to be burned a sacrifice though I sell all my goods to feed the poor and though I have faith to move mountains though I went to the Seminary and learned all the knowledge there is to be learned I'm still nothing it's the person of Christ Christ receive him and you can't receive him without receiving the word hear that now yes sir you can't receive him without receiving the word the word has to come first then I want to say if you say you re I'm sorry I'm just going to say but if you say you re receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost outside of this message that is fine I want to say there is more of the baptism for for you of the Holy Ghost in this message because he's saying you can't receive what he's speaking of without receiving the word first so you might be able to receive it under a dispensation of Pentecostalism or under the blessings of the Pentecostals but when you come to the truth of the age or to the revelation of the hour there's the person of Jesus Christ that makes his embode inside of your heart and the heart is the ark and what's in the ark [Music] Hallelujah that's where the Mana is that's where the presence of God is is back in there that's where Aaron Rod would brought forth life and it bloomed and it never withered oh if you can live in there that's what this message has come to do that's what the Capstone could it be yes this is the revelation of those seven Thunders to bring you into the presence of God Glory he says it's the person of Christ Christ received him and you can't receive him without receiving his word the word has come has to come first then the life comes into that word and is man and manifests that word that's powerful pray that the the Lord would bring more Revelation to that didn't Jesus say if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me it was the word of God being manifested God was in Christ Rec reconciling expressing himself to the world that he was that was the absolute that was the Eternal absolute there now you say is that Eternal brother brandom that was then what about today Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also it's the same absolute all right each one has their own absolute oh my it's just like it was in the days of Judges every man done what was right in his own sight I know it's a little bit of reading but bear with me in the days of Judges every man had his own absolute he did just what he wanted to sounds like today we just do what we want to we just do what we plan and what we want to do and that's the way it is now every man done right in his own sight now you know the reason they did that in judges this might shock you a little bit but the reason they did it in judge is because they had no profit in them days for the word of the Lord to come to so every man can do what he wanted to is that in his own sight and that's exactly what's happened today we don't have the prophet in these day in these days of denominations but God promised us one see and he did in the last days he would rise up and send Elijah back on the scene again and he would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers back to the original Pentecost you know what he you know he said that just a few more paragraphs now I know you'll re now I know you'll refer as he did there at John over in Matthew 11 chapter and the sixth verse I believe it is when they said who do you think this man was this John he said if you can receive it this is he that was spoken of behold I send my messenger before my face that's Malachi 3 not Malachi 4 but remember if that was the Malachi 4 then the word failed because he said but just at this time the whole world would be burnt and the righteous would walk upon the ashes of the wicked don't mix it up brother make it say just exactly what it says that's right he promised in the last days and it'll be right there in the midst remember when judges every man done the way he wanted I know we're laboring you a little bit but we'll get we'll get through quickly there was no man no man that could make the word live there was no Prophet the word of the lord always comes to the prophet right and he was always hated only the little group that loved him see but I mean there was always that God doesn't change his policy he cannot and be God if God ever says any or does anything he must do it the next time when that crisis arrives if he don't act the second time the way he did the first time he acted wrong the first time right now I know I'm killing you with a bunch of reading but but at least it's the word of God so I can I can rest assur that and who and and who will accuse God of acting wrong who are you can you lay sin to God that's what Jesus said which one of you can accuse me of sin what is sin unbelief he that believeth not and is condemned already which one of you can show me that I haven't fulfilled everything the Messiah should do and catch what he's saying here you're not speaking about 2,000 years ago see nobody spoke a word the Messiah was a prophet and he had proved that he was that they hadn't had a prophet for hundreds of years since Malachi and here he rose on the scene he was a Mystic to the people and a stumbling block to their church cuz he said behold I lay in Zion a Cornerstone a precious one tried oh a stumbling Stone yeah but whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed that's right there he was Oh Praise His Wonderful Name there he was and that's just exactly fulfilled scripture but those who believed him had an absolute that's why you're not to tossed to and fro because you have an absolute because you believed on him Christ the word he said look at little Martha when she seen Lazarus come up from the grave she knew who that was even before it was done she had the absolute of knowing I believe that thou art the Son of God that was to come into the word even now though my brother be dead just say the word God will do it again amen was absolutely positive that's right he said and she meant it from her heart and he said where have you buried him where have you buried him why because that was the word made flesh that was the Messiah where have you buried him you know that struck my heart I just think of it I I don't know about you but I was buried I was buried out there in lady oia I I was buried under sin and buried under complexes and I was buried and felt like I had no no hope and no peace I tell you if anybody seemed hopeless it was Lazarus Lazarus seemed pretty is anybody here that's more hopeless than Lazarus somebody here more hopeless than Lazarus well Lazarus would done already dead he was already rotten and maybe your situation stinks maybe it's rotten to the core and it feels hopeless you feel like your marriage is hopeless you feel like your family's hopeless you feel like your job's hopeless you feel hopeless you feel like everything is hopeless but I want to tell you I don't care how hopeless it is when the voice of the Resurrection comes when the absolute stands there and says Where have you laid them where have you buried them all that voice said Lazarus don't you realize that we have heard the voice of the resurrection and this day calling you out of dark denominations and traditions no matter how rotten your situation is there is an absolute here tonight to call you out of that if thou cast believe all things are possible oh that's what we're say look on this look on this look on this word look on this Revelation we'll just find a a way to close look on this what have you been looking at what have you been called up caught up into lately huh what's been consuming your life what is this all about what was it the prophet was born for this purpose he was born for the purpose to go out west to be caught up there with them seven angels and to come back and give the interpretation of what was inside the Capstone just as John was was there to introduce what what was he born for John was born to introduce the Messiah that's exactly what Malachi 45 has done has introduced the Messiah if you're looking for something far off in the future if I could say look on this he's here that's what this message has declared is he's here he said over and over man's always looked into what he's done and what he's going to do but he's failing to see what he's doing right now he's here he's veiling himself in a bride according to as he has said prophet of God says this in the indictment he says but the hour has arrived the last days are here when God promised according to Malachi 4 that he would raise up in the last days and would turn the hearts of the people back to the original blessing and the Pentecostal Faith of Our Fathers and you can't deny it you can't withstand it now he's he's preaching the indictment and he's telling the clergy and he's telling the denominations he's telling the whole world that God has proved he's the same yesterday today and forever everything that he has promised has been fulfilled here he is right you right here in the midst he say if if don't believe my words believe the works that I do for they testify of who I am over around the world seven times declaring he's here he's the same yesterday today and forever now I want to say I like this now look what he said it's almost like he's saying it in the in the negative he says and you can't deny it and you can't withstand it oh they tried to deny it they tried to extend but I want to look on this as a positive because for the predestinated seed you can't deny it either and you can't withstand it you can run but you can't hide go on prodical you can run but you can't hide I don't know what you're going through but I want to tell you there's a predestinated seed inside of you that cannot deny it and you can't withstand it Hallelujah I say oh God I can't deny this message and I can't withstand I've been consumed by your love I've been consumed by the message Lord let me look on this let me look on the revelation of the hour just in closing the prophet of God would say this he would say in Christ the mystery he'd say and here he is today in the same manner by the same Pillar of Fire expressing himself and vindicating him self the same revealing the mystery of God that's been hid before the foundation of the world I want to say that you're part of that mystery come on you are part of that mystery the mystery of his will the mystery of his coming the mystery of us sitting together you are part of that look this thing doesn't go without you but what have you been looking at you looking at symptoms you looking at unbelief you looking at your past let's look on the word let's start looking on this let's get sincere let's start realizing that you've been born for a purpose just as just as John was born for that purpose to introduce the Messiah what's your purpose John why are you here I'm here I I'm here to manifest Isaiah 40 I I'm here to to inter introduced to you the Messiah the Savior that takes away the sins of the world where he came to that place and he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world what is the purpose of this message is to introduce the Messiah to you to introduce to you the one that can open blind eyes the the one that can fix your problems the one that can take care of your situation that's what this me and I say look on this don't be distracted by all the things of the world as we just move to uh communion let's just stand look on this I Pray something was said in s somehow some way maybe just to stir your heart up let's look at the word of the hour let's look at what's been prophesied let's let's get in there and pray for the spirit of Revelation you've been born for a purpose prophet of God said you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God I say look on this let's look on the things that God has for us the brothers that are going to prepare uh we just want to read in our scripture in uh Corinthians 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23 is everybody feeling okay man it's good to come to the communion table um that it shouldn't be approached lightly it shouldn't be approached out of routine it should be approached sincerely and reverently 1 Corinthians chapter 11 it says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this is the cup of the New Testament of my blood this do as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my breth when you come together eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together un commination and the rest will I set in order when I come
