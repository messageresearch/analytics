stronger that will help us to serve you better that will be a greater witness to those on the outside because that is what you commissioned us to do we just pray father that you'll be blessed in this service bless those here in jesus name amen amen so this morning [Music] good morning you know as we mentioned last week we're going to take the next few weeks and go through psalm 119 together just a beautiful chapter you know the portion that we're going to read this morning begins in verse 9 and it begins with this verse where with all shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed thereto according to thy word so the question is asked where with all or with what shall a young man cleanse his way the answer is by taking heed thereto according to thy word you know and suppose many people look at that and read that and and you know they turn that into an act of religious discipline they'll read the scripture you know how can a man clean up his life and they'll read that and say well by lining up with the scriptures by disciplining their life according to the teachings of the bible you know that represents probably 90 95 percent of christianity today disciplining yourself to line up with the scriptures and that's not even what the scriptures teach you know we know that paul and jesus even brother branham talked about you know righteousness doesn't come by disciplining yourself to line up with the scriptures this is speaking of something else notice it doesn't ask the question wherewithal shall a young man cleanse himself but it says wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way you know that word cleanse actually means to be made clear or transparent to make plain or to have clarity actually which way do i go what path should i take especially in this day how do i know the course to take where with all shall a young man cleanse his way you know this is not ordering your life according to scriptures this isn't about you know lining up with a book you know as we mentioned last time psalm 119 is all about a relationship with the word you can't have a relationship with a book you can't have a relationship with books and tapes you know this is about taking heed to the word you know jesus told the pharisees in john 5 39 he said search the scriptures for in them you think ye have eternal life and there they which testify of me you know those people ordered their lives according to the scriptures probably more perfectly and more completely than you know anyone possibly could and yet when the way himself stood in front of them it wasn't compatible ordering your life according to the scriptures in that case resulted in a rejection of the way it's certainly not the kind of taking heed according to thy word that cleanses his way you know as we go through this this section of psalm 119 we read about what it's like to take heed according to thy word you know and it beautifully paralleled as i was looking at this john 14 and 15 as a group of men are taking heed to the word showing them how to cleanse their way you know it says in verse 9 of psalm 119 wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed according to thy word and it says in john 14 6 jesus speaking i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me verse 10 psalm 119 it says with my whole heart have i sought thee oh let me not wander from thy commandments and the way says in john 14 15 if he loved me keep my commandments and again in verse 21 he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is the love of me in psalm 119 verse 11 it says though thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee and the way said in john 14 16 i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen says in verse 12 blessed art thou o lord teach me thy statutes and the way said in john 14 26 and the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you in verse 13 it says with my lips have i declared all the judgments of thy mouth and the way said in john 15 7 if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you speaking his word verse 14 i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches and the way said in john 15 11 these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full just beautifully paralleling the example of having a relationship with the word not being you know disciplining yourself according to the scriptures but there's a relationship here the word is more than a collection of books or books or tapes or whatever there's got to be a relationship there to cleanse your way wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed according to thy word you know it's just a beautiful example to me as i was reading through this is just you know i'm grateful personally that there's a way to get leadership right there's a way to get clarity there's a way to get guidance in this probably the most confusing hour you know we haven't been left without a word we haven't been left without guidance it's him who's with us to open the scriptures to talk with us along the way just as he did on the road to emmaus you know i pray as we read this little section of psalm 119 this morning we're just going to read these eight verses starting in verse nine first of all that we see the mirror of ourself and that we see jesus in the word but second that we have that relationship not just with a book but with the word talking with us along the way to help cleanse our way wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way let's just read those verses together starting in verse 9 wherewith all shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed thereto according to thy word with my whole heart have i sought thee oh let me not wander from thy commandments thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee blessed art thou o lord teach me thy statutes with my lips have i declared all the judgments of thy mouth i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches i will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways i will delight myself in thy statutes i will not forget thy word amen amen god bless you may have your seats man let's sing when i see the blood i'll pass over you amen [Music] all cries are redeemer [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] is is [Music] over here [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] for me [Music] me oh is me uh [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] hey me sunday morning [Music] david is especially if you could come at this time amen god bless you church um the title of my song is open my eyes that i may see um and uh i was like i was listening last sunday when the pastor was preaching you know we know in the world about the letter kill it i can know everything about the message i can read it um but i think i can only serve god better through revelation and so and that's the reason why i chose this song open my eyes that i may see glimpses of truth thou has for me placing my hands the wonderful key that shalom clasped and set me free silently now i wait for thee ready my god thy will to see

is well and and we just know that you have such a protecting hand we ask you to continue to help all the needs that we have this morning for we ask these things in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you let's open our bibles again to the verse that we've read so many times here in romans the 8th chapter i believe it's the 11th verse yeah and you certainly this scripture gives us a lot of hope and it also gives us exactly what it is that we should desire amen but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious and holy name we pray this morning amen amen god as you may be seated this morning you know i have a little something on my heart and i i don't know exactly how to go about uh expressing it this morning i've i i've jotted down some notes you know this is what my notes look like and and and it's just an idea that hold my thought this morning and so i i was going to play a little portion of a message this morning to tie it in but i may just visit and then play that little portion at the end of service i i like us to hear the voice i really do i believe it has a positive effect on it sometimes you don't even realize it but there's just something about the voice and um you know i was fellowship with brother andrew the other day at lunch and and this was on my heart and i began to talk about it but you know we've been listening to this wonderful message called it is the rising of the sun and we know that we were talking in this message about how there had to be something that came in our day like it was in type so god did everything in type he in the old testament it was the shadow of things that were going to come so how many have you ever seen a telephone pole shadow somebody what how some of you out in the woods somewhere where they've got telephone oh that's right this is a whole brand new generation they have cell phones how many have seen a cell phone tower all right well us old people had telephone poles and in the morning you would look and the telephone pole would have a great big long shadow and all you would see is the shadow and you look at the shadow and you could see by the shadow it was a telephone pole but as the sun rose and the sun became brighter the shadow shrunk right and finally there was no shadow that told you it was the telephone pole the telephone pole itself was telling you that it was a telephone pole so the shadow gave way to reality that's right and so when you look uh back at the old testament it was it was the shadow and types of things to come so if they and that's what jesus scolded the scribes and the pharisees about he said if you would have known the scriptures and there was if you would have known what to look for if you have known the promise if you had known what to look for if you would have really read them for what that they said and trying to build yourself the system instead of burdening the people instead of turning my house into a a den of thieves uh could be before rising yourself up and sitting in the high places and all the corruption that went on he said if you would have just looked at this word and understood the promise of it and seeing the word he says search the scriptures because in them you think you have life but they are which were the shadow that was testifying of me so they could see the types they sat there and read right in the scriptures just the curtain was rant and just the scriptures that they were reading were being fulfilled up on delgado at the same exact time but they failed they failed to see the word of god revealed for the day that they were living in so they they didn't even see the shadow they tried to create a light and artificial light never works the only light that we've got to walk by is the light of god's word and and god does that by revelation so we understand that he gave a type and in this message brother brahm takes the type of the sheep offering of how that it was shown to the people that it was something that would be waived and then uh and then we understood that we've came down to our day and and and we recognized that that that life of the resurrection was waved over the people and they didn't recognize it in fact they rejected it and crucified them and because of that this gospel has come to the gentiles and so if i could say this a new crop was raised up something now was planted it wasn't the planning of the 12 tribes of israel it wasn't the planning of the menorah and of worship and and and going back to the things that of old this was a new exodus this was a new beginning it was a new life it was a coming out of the law into grace because something had been waived over and and and came to maturity and that's what he was jesus was the maturity of the old testament he was what everything the law was talking about and and jesus kept now maybe not in the eyes of man because they said oh you didn't wash your hands and you didn't do this and you heal on the sabbath and and you know and just nitpicking and everything but he fulfilled every shot in every tittle of the law he said search the scriptures because in them you think you have eternal life but they are which testified of me they were the shadow of me and so we we went through that and so uh we see from that that we definitely want to be aware and and so uh you know i was thinking of a title for my thought this morning and i i thought i would call it the the the battle of the voices the battle of voices the working of the quickening power i thought that was a good title you know what i mean i don't know if i can put the substance in it but like someone said if i can't do it i might as well have a good title huh but and and so we we understand that god has a way of working and and so that's the way that god always done he always has used prophets he's always used seers and seers can see and foretell what's coming and so as we were sitting there and i was thinking on the thing i just taken back as i've been reading this message and and listening and it's nice to have leslie back with us so anyway that makes me happier uh but as as i've been listening it just seems like i keep rolling back over these other thoughts that brother branham is bringing out in this message and i marveled at how that he places it together how he's in the beginning he talks about the sun drawing the the natural seed and then he talks about the s-o-n uh drawing the seed and he lays all that out there and he he goes back over it then of course he talks about the little eagle and and i began to just catch up something in my heart and i saw it like this if i could say it it just appeared to me i'm not talking about in the form of a vision but in in a mental uh uh visualization you know what i mean i could just visualize it as i visualized it and dwell on it it just became like so real to me i saw the prophet of god standing on top of a tall building or like a mountain and he could see know what i mean he was a seer he could he could see and and again we recognize it is that that he was the first fruit of the gentile church that came to maturity amen amen you know he wasn't caught away in denominationalism he wasn't caught away in trying to build the system he wasn't caught away in fact if you look at his ministry the power and the influence of his ministry and then look at the houses he lived in looked at the car he drove look at where he stayed they said there was one time i've heard the story that that he was staying at a certain hotel and he just thought it was too nice you know i mean he didn't want the people to have the wrong idea you know what i mean now i want you to see when you look around and you see what is every time you turn around there's a scandal because there's some television preacher that's uh stashing millions of dollars i think just down here in the uh one of these local churches down south here they were doing a remodel and they tore out a bathroom wall it was stacked full of cash because anybody checked the bathroom walls you know but but look at look at the example you understand he made statements like like the gospel didn't belong on television and we saw in him in the way that he lived the way he conducted himself how dedicated that he was to the cause of the gospel how true he was to the scriptures it didn't matter what the voices were it didn't matter what the influence was that was one of the definitions and the way of a true prophet a true prophet stayed with god's word he stayed with what god told him and what god instructed him to do with and so a lot of times we hear things but when you compare them you understand when you compare the life you you saw the humility and you saw the simplicity and then he and he and he speaks to us a message he says that god's hidden simplicity he kid in humility he doesn't come to be educated he says if you're not careful education takes you farther away from god and so we saw in him such an example and and and somebody that was so true and yet seemingly in the eyes of man on his own now it wasn't on his own because we know who was doing it but without denomination affiliation without joining any organization could just by the very essence of his ministry and how that had unfolded how he went to georgie carter's how he went down to the church and how good he went and that woman up there on the hill that was sick remember the story of the life talking to the old man just by the life that he lived and and what was radiated from him that his ministry ended up going around the world seven times millions of people heard the gospel thousands upon thousands of people were healed hearts were discerned everything just so miraculously moved without ever being part of a system that's right what transpired in his life transpired because he had a personal relationship with the lord now i know that he had a ministry and we know that an angel appeared to him and told him what would transpire told them that he would preach the king's and potentates but it wasn't a man-made system that brought that to pass it was an individual relationship that he had with obedience to the word of god and his recognition and acceptance of his calling now i want to say that again to us this morning with the recognition and acceptance of his calling each one of us in here this morning has been called we have been called in this day to manifest the spoken word or the prophesied word for our day okay i think mike touched on a little bit on his psalm that it's not our righteousness and it isn't us trying to look at the word of god and say i'm going to live it right we are called and you if you don't accept that calling you can fall into the system of the message of the hour and the message is not a system but man takes everything it's man's nature you know to try to organize it you say well how come this hasn't organized i'll tell you why it hasn't organized because nobody can agree on anything you know i mean every time somebody wants to come up and have influence and spread that influence there's something in us that's right you understand that the minute we start going down ground that's not right there's an automatic repulsion in us because we are designed let me just finish my my thing before i go to that point so the problem of god's on this building and he's seeing what he's seeing now we're not there we're not on top of that building and we don't see what he sees we are down here looking up at where he's at and we hear the things he's saying but we don't really see what he's seeing you can't because god's designed things in a certain way he designed a prophet to be a what a seer so he's seeing so as he sees he's designed us a certain way and and god has designed in his plan he designed things to come forth he did everything in the beginning he always designed things by starting in seed form you say why did he do that he did that because god is an evolutionist you ever heard the theory of evolution where did they get that from darwin just one day didn't come up and say oh the view theory of evolution no god is an evolutionist he started with void and nothing right and then he evolved it and then he said let there be and then he evolved it and let there be so how did it evolve it evolved by the spoken word it evolved by god amen evolving it that's right by taking it and evolving it by his word so it didn't start there now if i would have done it i would have just created everything boost but i i wouldn't have had a very long-range plan would i most of us don't have long-range plans i'll tell you the biggest enemy to a long-range plan is a credit card you say brother mcgregor that's not very spiritual yeah you know what people do they live for the moment they want something they can't afford it they really shouldn't be there they shouldn't waste their money on it they have um other obligations but man this thing is awesome just pull it out get what you want and you've just taken 22 out of your income you have no idea what effect that momentarily action has on your life your family life your finances this guy this can take you from making twenty five dollars an hour to making ten dollars an hour because that's all you're left with now there are certain things you have to have that you can't get any other way like houses and cars let me tell you buy your house and your car don't get in debt for anything else it's a good discipline it's good advice and if you are in debt don't be a task master to debt that can affect your thinking that can affect your decision-making debt credit allows you to live beyond your means and now have another task master have another voice in your life plus it's good to get out of the habit of to everything that calls you every voice that comes up that the voice of the restaurant you know it's hard sometimes and and and you know i like to go out with people and i like to to to take people out but i don't like to take people out if they can't afford to go out so a lot of times i'll help buy their meals because i know they want to be there but they can't afford to be there but sometimes you've got to have the discipline to say no you've got to have the discipline to say i'm not going to be drawn down this road i'm not going to be be moved by my desire by the temporary thing i'm going to have a longer range plan and if i could say it this way god has always had a long-range plan [Music] and he unfolds that plan he evolves to that plant he moves towards that plan very meticulously and right on time and he schedules everything to fall in place history events wars rumors of wars everything is working together in a beautiful plan for god to bring to pass his word now believe it or not you're a part of that amen you're a part of that you know what i mean and some of us that have worked at construction and things like that if something doesn't fit you get the file out you know you can make it fit hey we have an expression what this needs is a bigger hammer you know what i mean and uh and so you you you're going you got and god's like that he's going to make things fit and so the problem of god sitting up here and remember he is the voice of god so we're talking about the battle of voices he is the voice of god so he is going to speak what he sees by sun drive tying in diverse manners god spoke to us by his prophets what did they do they they saw visions they had dreams god moved on them they said things they didn't even know what they were saying can you imagine when they walked up that day and said hey you said a virgin shall conceive i did yeah what was that he was under the inspiration you know what i mean he maybe didn't even understand what he said but it it was the great evolver the great voice so god does everything by his spoken word the spoken word is the original seed not the man's interpreted word but the spoken word was the original seed and god has spoke everything now so he pleases a prophet and i just in my mind i saw in this building and i saw him speaking what he was seeing well he's speaking this in 50s you know and and the the 50s and 60s he's speaking these things that he's seeing and and now we're just starting to see some of the things that he saw because we caught up with the prophecy amen now the minute is spoken it's real but we finally caught up with the prophecy and so we nobody understood what brother branham was saying he talked about the corruption that was coming into the church he talked about the corruption that was coming into hollywood evangelism he talked about the money and the corruption and the scandal and the big houses and the big ministries and and the money and building all those great things that what's going on he talked about all those things but they hadn't caught up with it yet because they didn't understand that he was up someplace that they they couldn't understand they couldn't recognize because all that they could hear were the voices that were of the present time the present moment how many of us really make decisions sometimes wondering how it's going to affect our eternal destiny i'm not very good at that you say well the scripture says take no thought for tomorrow no you've got to understand that scripture doesn't say take no thought to the moral he says place tomorrow in the hands of him who is running your day today if he has control of your day-to-day you can trust that you don't have to worry about tomorrow because he has today and if he has today he is an evolutionist he will evolve you to tomorrow connect what we're doing so as he sat on this mountain what he saw he began to speak what he saw and we're down here looking up so there's only one way that he can get to us what he's seeing and that's to speak it you understand that faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of god what is another word for faith revelation what is revelation something that has been previously hid and now is revealed or seen amen so we're we're talking about the how the quickening power works and so he he speaks it so that's what he does he starts speaking it and then god allows man to invent a tape recorder for his message amen now that's what it was invented for america all right i know they put everything else on it in the world they put all kinds of other voices on it didn't it so the minute that was invented it became the battle of the voices right right that's good right everybody was out there radio preachers were out there everybody was out there's all kinds of voices and and we've watched the voice evolve haven't we we've watched it evolve from for real to real we've watched it go to eight tracks anybody in here old enough to have an eight track and there's a very few i got you old guys cassettes on and on and cds and i guess now i don't the world's digital and and it's satellite and all those things because it's evolving right and why is it evolving its voice is evolving it's trying to get its message out that that's what it's doing and here's here's why because when god made everything he put it in seed form so god designed us the seed of god he designed us to hear the voice of god amen amen now nobody else hears the voice of god except the seed that had god has designed with the receiver to receive it so this great seer is up here and he's seeing things and he's speaking what he's seeing but now that has to if i could use this in our thinking has to come down from the mountain from the from the from the the high places and it's got to come down and it's got to make contact with the seed because the seed is designed to hear it it's designed to receive it but when you receive it do you automatically go up to the top of the mountain or the top of the building no because what good would it do you to be on top of the mountain if you can see what good would it do to you to be caught up if you can't see and and so many times can i and i'm not critical i'm just you know i i i don't try to preach to the world i i don't try to have a worldwide ministry i've put in my heart a long time ago if god wants me to be here and pastor whoever he brings into the fold i want to do my best to tell them the word of god i don't have a universal message william branham had the universal message all right i don't have the explanation for the message the holy spirit has the explanation of the message we are here to grow as a body and to let our light shine and and not to put our candle under a bushel basket but do exactly what the prophet of god said he said let it shine in your neighborhood let it shine in your community let it shine in your city i don't know how many guys i've known in my life that want to go overseas they want to go overseas and they haven't even talked to their neighbor right you know but we won't go there so but i've already been there so i guess i can leave so there's something that that god's created you so you're not going to fly all the way to the top and see everything that the prophet of god saw because god doesn't work that way he always works from seed up you understand he always works from from the inside out so the first thing that he's got to do is he's got to quicken the seed he's got to bring the seed to life you hear something you're designed to hear it amen every seed will bring forth of its kind so if every seed brings forth of its kind and a seed can only be brought forth by a voice satan's only a perverter he's not a designer if god designed that if that his seed would be brought forth by a voice and he designs that every seed would be brought forth by a voice or brought to life or impregnated by a voice then every seed has a voice even if even dark seed has a voice but you have a voice that speaks to the seed that's in you and he's not he's not instantly changing you because that's not what he is he's an evolutionist i know that word sounds terrible but that's what he said he was in other words god evolves maybe i could use this other word god is a grower why he's a husband sure he digs up he dungs he has fruit he grows he doesn't he doesn't instantly do this and instantly do that so he first of all he's got to come into your life and he's got to germinate the seed that's in you now that's pre-designed if you if we can rest in that this has been pre-designed at the whatever time he determined he was going to bring to life in me the seed and that seed just all of a sudden comes to life and it it the antenna goes up [Music] i don't think there's anybody in here that's old enough to remember that show but yeah and the antennas come up and you catch the word you're hearing a voice you never heard before and you're attracted to that voice that's right there's something about that voice i love hearing the prophet of god's voice i mean the minute i hear it there's a peace that comes over me even when he's you know convicting me and and pointing out my mistakes and planning out my lack of dedication there's some comfort that takes place in my heart when i hear that voice because i know i am hearing the voice of god amen i've been designed to hear the voice of god amen now there's other voices that are battling for that spot and just like every other seed we could pick we could pick music we could pick sports we could pick anything there's seeds out there that manifest all them spirits and when you get when those voices of the world speak out they bring to life those seeds and then maybe a young child he'll he'll he'll be a young person what maybe they call a protege or something and that voice begins to speak to him and pretty soon they dedicate their whole life to baseball you know they eat drink sleep baseball they throw the ball they go down at the batting cage and everything there's a voice the voice of baseball you understand and they hear that voice and as that voice speaks to them they keep evolving into a ball player they start out in little league or t-ball you know and the kid don't want to play t-ball he walks up there with the bat in his hand he looks at the ball and the dad's scoring hit the ball what's wrong with you hit the ball i told you that how to hit the ball and you sit back no this is not this is crazy what's happening that person's under the influence of a voice he wants his kid to be a ball player he wants he wants he wants them to shine they have all kinds of psychology for it but it's just nothing but the devil that's right i've seen guys jump over fences and run out and punch out the umpire because the umpire called this kid out at second base get a life no it's sick and you know why it's so sick now because there's more voices out there than there's ever been and these voices are pointing to the wrong thing and why are the voices out there the voices are out there to manifest the seed that is in them because every seed will bring forth of its kind and this is manifesting time so there's voices out there that are looking for that seed that they can attach to and manifest oh that should be raising some questions shouldn't it what seeds in me what voice am i listening to you say well do i pursue a career or do i just go lock myself up in a room and listen to tapes do both you'll be successful so there's this battle because god's got a way of doing things he first of all he germinates the seed do you understand that the seed comes to life but the seed has got to grow now this is a tremendous scripture in hebrews 5 and 8. and it it it it kind of struck me uh in the light of this understanding and because god can't break his plan do you understand otherwise he can't he once he does something he's got to continue to do it amen right so once he started with seed form even he had to create in mary seed he didn't use her egg he had to create it but jesus didn't descend down from heaven did he because that would have been out of the plan of god he couldn't have been a kinsmen redeemer because that would have been out of the plan of god but every single one of us in here started in seed form as a prophet of god sent to the betting ground to mother we came forth but that's the way that god did it and then you've evolved right into whatever you are now and you are what you are now because of the voices that you've heard you know what i mean mama put in front of you a nice salty fish head and she said this is good that's right and you ate it and you were hungry and guess what it was good you know i had spam i had leslie buy some spam the other day i'm gonna fry it up eat some spam like i did when i was a kid here you understand you are been molded by the voices that you've heard that's right and we are what we are because of what we heard now there's a great transformation going place on there's something that's evolving that's greater than if it's ever been and so in hebrews 13 hebrews 5 8 it says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him my sheep hear my voice the relationship starts when that seed is quickened if the the relationship starts of obedience to the voice because the voice has been sent from the top of the mountain if i could say it this way they're the top of the building the voice is being sent to you so that you can come up to the top of the mountain and see what he's been seeing but you've he's got to evolve you to that he's got to bring you to that place by obedience to his word that seed has got to mature it's got to grow it's got to attach itself with that voice it it's got to it's got to uh it's it's got to come into a relationship with that voice that that is what's drawing it you can't mix it that's what lukewarm is is trying to serve two masters it's trying to serve two voices there's got to be something in your life a voice that becomes an absolute and and it can't be secondhand revelation right right and many times god will put you in a circumstance where you hear him tell you something you know it's obedient and it looks like you're in an impossible circumstance that's right you're going to offend people you're you're your people's not going to believe you then then those other voices start coming in it's going to cost you your job everybody's going to think you're this what are you going to do about your bills you've got all this credit card debt you know i mean you're all the way over here and you're in school and and what are you going to do about school and all the voices come in the voice is a compromise the battle of the voices prophet of god said where does it where does that battle take place in your mind god gives you the weapon which is what his word his voice but if we don't have confidence in that voice then satan appears as an angel of the light it he offers all kinds of other ways to do things he has your own program he'll give you a program because he wants to bring forth a reality every voice is trying to bring forth a reality they're trying to make that seed what that voice is preaching become real every voice of the enemy every voice that's there every seed that's out there is looking just like that kid that sits there in this room and he's playing his guitar and he's listening to all those licks and he's sitting in there jamming and doing all those things there's a voice that's calling him to be a rock star he wants to be a rock star that's what he wants and pretty soon he's in a garage band you know what i mean and he's trying to do this and he's doing this and pretty soon he's got the look you know if somebody he looks like and he's emulating somebody and he's talking the language and he's in there pretty soon he's smoking dope and he's there and and there's this voice that's calling him to be a rock star and and that voice is wanting to make that a reality for him and if he'll submit himself to that voice and he'll give himself over to that spirit and that voice that voice will make that a reality you think that makes them happy they kill themselves by the truckload board anything the desire to make it a reality is there anything we want made real in our lives what is it that we want to be made real in our lives we want the works that he did that we do also amen we want to see i counseled to thee to buy of me i sat that thou may i see we want to see what he was seeing we saw the works we want to do the works that he's doing but if that's not there's only one thing that'll keep you from obtaining that is if there's another voice that's battling for that possession of reality you know we think being a doctor being a lawyer or or being successful there's no life in that i've been in the doctor's office i've i've had my doctor in tears just talking to me about god and and you know how that he lost this and how he loved that and i'm sure he's good with giving up pills and poking me and making me hurt and stuff like that but when it comes down to something that's really down on the inside there's only one thing that meets that place and that's the love of god shed abroad in our hearts by jesus christ there's only one thing that's real so back to what we're saying god starts it that way he starts it in seed form he germinates he germinates that seed that's in you and and then that seed has a thirst that seed has a thirst it's like the eagle if i could express it this way to you because uh what i'm trying to say i guess this morning is is you've got to understand the quickening power evolves in you it starts on the inside and works its way out the first thing the seed comes to life right and then it starts its journey well you look at that little eagle here's this eagle it's in the barnyard right but what's the one thing it doesn't know it doesn't know it's an eagle the only thing it knows is it doesn't know he doesn't know what he really is he knows he's different he knows there's something about him right right whether it's on the inside and most of the time it's on the inside most of the time it's in our mind and most of the time of a lot of christians i've dealt with through my life and my experience bringing people to the lord that difference in their lives has caused complexes now if you've been blessed to be raised in a christian home you ought to thank god every day when you're not and that seeds in you you find yourself doing the most crazy things you even sit back and say what am i doing you don't know where you are you can't you don't fit there's an empty spot inside of you you you you drift and aft and nothing's been settled with inside you and that's what this guy's there he's out there he's eating bugs you know what i mean he's eating rock music and and smoking and drinking yeah you're getting garbage you know what i mean loves the garbage and all the other chickens it's great you know what i mean and the chickens are going off to the slaughterhouse you know i mean and ended up missing and gone and in jail and cracking everything just picture the big old chicken yard and all of a sudden they come in and they grab them and they throw them in the cage you know everybody's going to jail when i was in that world everybody ended him in jail everybody was running from the cops you know what i meant they were getting in wrecks they were they were overdosing yeah why couldn't a guy sit back and look at the fruits and say what's going on around here you know what's happening what's really going on so that eagle doesn't even know it's an eagle right it's just up there flying it doesn't even know it's an eagle and all of a sudden it hears a what a voice and that voice identifies and quickens something in that that little uh half chicken half eagle you say half chicken half eagle yeah his inside was eagle but his outside was what still chicken right because this quickening power i'm just gonna jump also quickens the what the mortal body but it it only now knows it's a chicken so it's half chicken half eagle but it doesn't know that so all of a sudden the word speaks to it and it realizes something comes alive in it and it says i don't know what i am but i'm not this it hurts something it looks up right and it sees the eagle on the mountaintop on the top of the building it sees them out there and it's heard from him but it can't fly yet because there's got to be an evolution that takes place within the eagle you understand that this eagle is going to have to commit to the voice in ever to be able to fly out of that yard because now that mama eagle if you leave and listen to the story is going to have to instruct that eaglet how to fly but what's got to happen inside of him first the first thing that he has to have is then after he realizes there's something different then he's got to have the desire to fly that's right doesn't do me any good to say i'm an eagle do you want to fly no really mama come on down here have some uh bugs have some scratch come down here let's go into a cage every night and into the barnyard that eagle what you understand that eagle's seen miles it seemed beyond the barnyard it's seen beyond what's temporary oh eagles this morning we're not looking past our barnyards we're not looking into the possibilities we're we're not looking into the heavenly realms we're not seeing beyond our problems we're not seen beyond our flesh we're not we're not seen beyond our condition there's got to be a uh uh obedience and a transformation something working on the inside of us in order to to bring us to this place that what is promised to us will be quickened in the flesh philip and stephen they got they they were so full of the spirit that stephen was so full of the spirit because it was on the inside of him and if he was finally convinced and sold out a hundred percent he denied every other voice and he's when they were fixing the stoneham he just did nothing but tell him the truth you're blind you're the ones that destroyed the lord of glory he they started chucking rocks at him he says oh what did he do now he was on the mountaintop now he was up there he said i see the son of god sitting at the right hand of the father hallelujah now his flesh was quickened his body was quickened the life that was in him moved from inside of him literally in to his flesh where he can lay his flesh down for the glory of the kingdom of god [Music] but that didn't come overnight philip phillip they're filled with the spirit of god the seed was brought to life now he's living and he's living the life he's obedient he's preaching the gospel he's in a meeting and the spirit moves on go over here so he goes down there and there's this enoch eunuch excuse me driving down the road in a chariot reading the scriptures and he he runs alongside the guy can you just picture it hey dude what are you reading well i'm reading over here in the prophets you know about this does he speak of of himself or one to come oh he says i know who he's talking about i've met him personally now philip has something on the inside of him it started out when when did it start out we said go get your brother you know what i mean way back when when the very first word was spoken to him and he said come see that that life i come here a man come hear somebody i've heard him it it brought something to life in me then he was led of the spirit obedient to the spirit he came along in his life and he was he he was living his life he was preaching the gospel he was carrying out the commission i hope you can point kind of see what i'm trying to say and now he's running this alongside this in the this eunuch and and he talks to him about the lord jumps up the chariot and he preaches the gospel to him and the guy stops and he says there's water what hindereth me from fulfilling the word of god now what has philip done he just started the eunuch on the same transformation process that he was on now what does philip do all of a sudden his mortal body this flesh this body that you are living in it translates to another place his fleshly mortal body got quickened by the spirit that was in him because the spirit that was in him had rule until you go back to our eagle all of a sudden it's in this yard and now it finds out i've got a desire to go up higher the first thing the mother eagle has to do in the story is convince the the person the eaglet that it is an eagle amen you are an eagle amen right it starts to talk about the identity right and it starts to so you don't you just picture it now here's the eagle sitting on the post of the barnyard preaching to the eaglet you are an eagle your name was written in my nest before the foundation of the world i saw you you were in me you were a part of me you came from me your bone of my bone your flesh and my flesh you're you're you're here i not only i have identity with you you're his lady you're his bride you're his elect he's got identity with you he's got to bring you to the place to evolving you by his word that you can take and accept the identity that you have in him that thing that bird was never going to flap this wings till it believed it could and that mother because it had that identity sit there and talk to it and talk to it and talk to it and preach to it and inspired it and did whatever it could because she knew why she laid that egg and what that eagle could do and where it's supposed to be and where it's supposed to go and what it's supposed to do and what its works are and what it's supposed to eat and it was out of place and that eat little elif looked up there and she went and she'd take a she'd jump off that post and go fly over that eagle what was she doing she was waving over that little eaglet what it could do come back down on the post and say this is what you were made for the works that i do you do also the way i fly you shall fly also you should you can overcome all these voices all these chicken things then the voices yeah you don't want to go out there look at this nice warm chicken house you're in how many's ever been in a chicken house a stench chickens are nasty i don't know why we eat so much of it i'm not against chick-fil-a so don't but there had to be a mental transformation from being half chicken and half eagle had to come to the spot you understand where it understood it was an eagle and it was possible to fly it hasn't flown yet you understand its body had not yet been quickened in our bodies heaven yet but they will and i believe some of you i won't even put my thing are coming to where your bodies are now becoming totally subject to the word of god you're denying the lust of the flesh you're denying the pride of life you're starting to bring this body under subjection you're starting to say no to the things of the world why that's just the beginning of the transformation of your body amen because part of this promise is not that some day will be resurrected the promises this mortal body this mortal body it will be quickened that i can fly this body can do the works not the preacher too many times our works is a collective work instead of an individual work when your body's quickened you don't have to be in an atmosphere right you fly because you're made to fly you don't got to go to revival to flap your wings you don't got to have someone just hype you up so you can flap in the hype right when you roll out of bed in the morning come on you stretch them late why because your body has been quickened so this little eaglet it's down in the it's down in the uh the yard now it's starting to hear the gospel what's going on is starting to evolve the seed is moving in to the mind the seed is hearing the word and moving into the mind where it's going to battle the voices because that's the way god works he works from the inside out and we can't look at the outside because that hasn't been quickened yet it's starting to come quicken it's starting to come subject they're starting to finally look at it and say you know what i'm tired of watching this junk on the computer it makes me feel bad i'm tired of thinking bad thoughts i'm fired i'm tired of of having bitterness in my heart i'm tired of not being free i'm tired of being worried i'm tired about financial troubles i'm tired i'm tired of this that little eagle had to come to the place that it was tired of the barnyard and it was hearing a voice that the first thing it was doing was changing its attitudes changing its thoughts changing its mind and giving it the hope that it too could come on top of the mountain and see so there it is now it wants what i want to fly i want my body quickened that's what that little eaglet was saying how do i fly how do i get my body quicken you're an eagle to begin with okay i get that start flapping your wings start doing the works start acting like it start moving it start walking into the christian image start walking into the image of christ start acting like he did start thinking like he did what's happening those wings are starting to move why now it's on its way to the quickening of its body first of all it had to start on the inside the seed coming to life secondly it had to be instructed of what it was where it come from and who it could what it could do but there has to come a time it's got to move into the body enoch got so close with god and he walked with god that he walked out what happened his body was quickened do you understand the promise of the resurrection it's not some day but that this mortal body by the spirit that was in jesus christ that spirit that was in him he puts that in you first he works from the inside first he brings the seed by the word of god you're brought into obedience to the word of god you receive the spirit that was in him if the spirit that was in him is in you then it quickens the mortal body jesus died of what a man how many knows that jesus died a man he died a man if i could say it like this without offending nobody but jesus said heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away jesus as a man didn't quicken you it was the spirit that was in him which was the father that was god that was eternal he was the son of god and god imparted all that he was god poured into christ but he showed us by dying going there that spirit left him and he died a man why did he die a man because he oh it's so beautiful forgive me if i'm i'm caught up but he said he sat in the garden he said can this cup pass me he sweated even to the sweating of right blood he agonized but he knew that this was the cause that he came into the world you understand what the word said who he was and what he did he was so given to that amen so from the inside so from obedience so understanding having such a revelation of what he was here for what he was called to do that he died a man but guess what that mortal body got quickened it rose up showing us that all of our mortal bodies will be quickened also this quickening power don't leave you with death it never leaves you not only will it quicken your body this mortal body now but if it goes into the grave it'll quicken it again because that quickening power never leaves it never fails to perform what god wants and when that little eaglet in that barnyard got its mindset and finally realized i can do that i've been made to do that i've been called to do that how many in here really believe that you've been called to lay your hands on the sick and they recover not produce it you know not say the bible says i can lay my hands on the sick and they'll recover you know most of us pray like this i hope it happens no no not petering them guys they just come out of that quick and empowered they they knew what this this is what job said would happen this is the word of god living in me now it's going to quicken my mortal body he didn't say oh you know jesus said that you wouldn't you could be healed and jesus said that you could walk and you know what i mean that's the inside talking but they talked beyond the inside they talked with their mortal body silver and gold have i none but that which i have he reached down he grabbed him by the hand and pulled him to his feet and said walk now remember it's not going to do you any good to jump on top of the mountain and think you're going to go not until you're 100 given over to the voice jesus said i do nothing until the father speaks to me but when it spoke to him it didn't just quicken his mind it just didn't quicken his spirit it quickened his mortal body also i'm trying to tell us and trying to tell myself that that spirit that's in me will also quicken it'll bring this body to life it'll bring this body subject to the word this body will do the works that he done this person this flesh will walk and perform the works of god it won't be in my heart it won't be in my mind it won't be me praying for somebody else it'll be me amen me i will do the works that he done by will by power by might no but by his spirit saith the lord and and i can flap my wings and fly into the heavenly you know because god worked from the inside out you know god's got to fill us and and that's what we got to realize we need our bodies quicken amen the flesh wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh our spirits are right our minds are right our hearts are right we've got to start dealing with this thing we start to kind of start taking it under subjection we've got to we've got to bring it under total subjection to the word of god because when it comes into the total subjection of the word of god then god can quicken it amen and it can identify what's on the inside but bitter and sweet can't come out of the same fountain you can't be on the hilltop one day and then the valley the next so ask god to work on your inside because you have a desire to be what he's prophesied that we would be in this age i have a desire to fly there lord i have a desire to do the works that you've done i have a desire father that it's just not in my spirit it's just not in my heart it's just not in what i believe and okay but i want it to be made alive in my flesh and that's a promise and god's working and you say well what's he working toward we already know he sent a prophet there anybody in here that doesn't understand how that brother brahm's a prophet why he's the prophet and the scriptural word i'd be happy to sit down with you and explain to you the promises of luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 malachi 4 5 revelations 3 and 14 the promise of our day coming to pass just like paul did with the jews he sat down and went through all the history of the word and how he was the high priest and it showed them through the scriptures that this was the fulfillment of the prophecy of the messiah the only thing that's taking your total complete submission is other voices other reasoning eve had a voice don't eat and it was the battle of the voices and she listened and we've got to see understand that the one that was on the mountain the one that could see what was coming the one that was on the building he spoke to us this is what's coming this is what coming and that words fall down on our hearts it quickened us it brought us together from all parts of the world formed us into a body and it's dealing with our hearts dealing with our minds that we can come in one accord by one spirit that the love of god would be shed abroad in our heart that we'll be committed we won't be running off into the world one day and out friday night doing this and and doing that and in and out and listening to this and listening to this and then come together but each of us individually will say you know something i don't want my body to do what it's doing anymore amen because it's at war with my spirit and god promised me you understand it's not your battle he promised me lord that i could fly he promised me that this body also too would be quickened and lord now i'm here praying for the quickening of my body that little eagle was saying lord i see it i see the sky i see what he's saying i see those things lord i'm praying that i can flap my wings and fly out of where i'm at and be in the heavenlies and do what i'm made to do because you'll never be happy being under bondage to any other voice but his voice and you say well he leave me no he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you i'll just make your life so miserable that one day you'll stop and say okay lord amen don't quicken my mind only don't quicken my spirit only but also quicken this mortal body let's stand together this morning [Applause] you love them this morning is that your heart's desire let's bow our heads each of us and let us look towards heaven in your heart he's looking at each of you and he knows each of your life he knows what you struggle with he knows if it's lust of the flesh pride of life ego he knows all the voices that talk to your flesh he knows all the desires that your senses have satan has so many things to attract the senses he has so many spirits to soothe the inside realm but way down in your soul way down inside of your heart if you would ask yourself is my flesh under subjection to the word i'm i'm still doing a lot of things in my body and i want you to separate your body from that part of you that believes and ask yourself you know i need this quickening power in my flesh i need this to go from the inside of me to the outside of me and lord you work from the inside out i know you sent a prophet i've heard that there's nothing in the world that'll take that away from me [Music] lord i know what's right [Music] and i have the desire to do right i love hearing your word i love going to church but father my flesh [Music] just hasn't been quickened all the way nearly not in the realms that i should be i don't have the understanding of this life that i should have lord and i want to come up higher and i've been told by your gospel by one that sat on the top of the mountain that sat up on top of the building that looked afar off and he said i see the quickening of the body i see the church i see the believer i see what's looking up at me from way below ascending to this place and seeing what i see and doing what i do and father they're on their journey up and now they realize lord that this has got to go beyond their minds and beyond their spirits it's got to actually come into the flesh in the beginning the word was made flesh now the flesh is being made word lord and i need that power this morning and i want to lift my hand up this morning and i want to say lord i want this to move from my heart and from my mind into my flesh i want it to be in my life in my bones and actually the bones that i feel i want to feel vibrating and full and submissive to your will i want it to live out of me where it could be seen lord and i want it to go into the secret places i wanted to go into the closets of my life and wanted to go no matter what it takes father if it takes sacrificing the thing i enjoy to do the most i'm willing to do whatever
