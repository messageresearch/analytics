we love you [Music] we pray to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen as we're still standing let's take our Bibles the relief of the Mark chapter this in Mark chapter 10 verse will read verse 17 to 24. Mark 10 17. only [Music] and when he was gone forth into the way they came running and kneeled down nailed to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus answered unto him why call it thou me good there is none good but one God is good that is good foreign thou knoweth the Commandment do not commit adultery do not kill do not still do not bear false witness defraud no defraud not honor thy father and thy mother [Music] s and the answer and said unto him master all these I have observed from my youth is if the monkey shows over download [Music] and Jesus Behold Him and loved him and said unto him one thing that lacketh go down go thy way sell whatsoever thou has and give to the poor that thou shalt have Treasures in Heaven and come take up that cross and follow me officiated and it was said at the saying and went away went away grieved for he had great possession [Music] did you and Jesus looked around about and said unto his disciples how hard how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God latency [Music] foreign [Music] and the disciples were astonished at his words but Jesus answered again and said unto them children how hard it is for them that trust in the riches to enter into the kingdom of God who prove with us we may have your seats I really like this portion of where Jesus tried to clarify his thought to his disciples because when Jesus told them that it's hard for them to have riches to enter into the kingdom of God the scripture says that his disciples were astonished and Jesus understood the thoughts and now Jesus is is giving them Clarity that in reality is not necessarily being rich which is a problem it's not being reached that makes it difficult to get into the kingdom of God but it's when you trust in your riches that's when it becomes hard to get into the kingdom of God will also take the Book of John chapter 1. John chapter 1 we'll read verse 35 to 39. [Music] again the next day the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus he was he had walked and saith Behold the Lamb of God they do discipline a civilian and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus Jesus then Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them what seek he they said unto him Rabbi which is to say being interpreted Master where dwelleth down then they came and saw where he dwelled and Abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour may the Lord bless the reading of his word I believe we are happy to be gathering the house of God tonight yeah Sunday was a great blessing when Brother David asked me to speak tonight I was still thinking about the service on Sunday where we saw that our bodies and is like a city that we need to build walls to protect it and for those walls that we needed to have doors that need to needed to be shut down and some doors that needed to be opened [Music] and Sunday night about Sunday night my my daughter who's four years old she came she was crying out to me Oh Daddy my stomach hurts my stomach hurt the Paramount I told her close that door femla close that door she said okay Daddy I'm gonna go shut the door we prayed she went to sleep and in the morning she was really happy she said Daddy I'm no longer in pain I shut the door [Applause] and we also saw that we're living in the uh in the world of pressure that regardless of the pressure we have yeah that there's a place that there was someone to whom we can put our pressure that we can get our pressure off of us that it was Jesus Christ that in the choice of trying to get the pressure off that there was two types of people that every time they did wrong they were feelings bad sad they wanted to do good like Paul could say that the good that I want to do regardless of the wrong that they were doing they didn't care and I was I was still speaking on that I'm gonna title the choice of following Jesus and the reward the choice of following Jesus and the reward we know that in everything that we do in life we have a choice we have chosen tonight to be in the house of God there are some that have chosen to follow online and there are others that have chosen to do something outside of the word of God it's always a choice every day every time every moment we have to make a choice and a choice is a decision it's a decision that we take even when we say we have not chosen in reality we have chosen because every time we have to make a choice and every time we make a choice behind the choice there's a recompense there is a reward because the choice is a preference between two things or I prefer one and when you choose it's behind because behind that choice you are waiting for something and the the life is only choices as we saw among as we talked about the doors [Music] today we have all kinds of social medias that take uh most of our time for young and old it's a choice you have the choice to say I'm gonna deactivate the social media continue like this or you have the church to say I'm gonna continue and when you continue on that you you know what the recompense is you know what is it that you're waiting to gain from it it's a choice and tonight we want to speak on the choice of choosing Jesus because we believe it's the best choice that we can ever make in life and Jesus speaks to us about the story of this young man says this young man in in his early life young life was already rich says he had a great reputation this young man what I want to say tonight it was preached October 30th 1965. I will come back to the the extract of that message so I can bring forth my thoughts this young man was already rich he was still young in a young age in life everything that we do no devoted we have to be led by something we have to be led by someone even when we were babies the first step that we took news we were helped by our mothers who helped us take our first steps when we started walking we took the uh we were given the education of our father to show us we have received the education of our teachers to show us how we can live in society this education is no longer the best God don't know the government because in our schools now on different men um they they they teaching they they they're giving wrong information to our children they're giving them a lot of information that's against the word of God what is the the new Society or the actual Society find normal and they want to put it into them the children but glory be to God because if we have enough Faith to believe that we are saved we have to have enough Faith to believe that our family is also saved to keep us to help us keep our children in line to follow the word of God sometimes we are we are subject to the influence of one another sometimes you esteem others to be smarter his way of doing things is better that I would like to to do like him I would like to be like him because in us God has placed the desire for us to be led by something in all those things it's the Lord Jesus Christ we see this young man who received the really good education a good religious education in one education it's good uh education in society he was a great manager he was rich but regardless of all this education regardless of all these instructions due to their short proven satisfy all those things could only satisfy the carnal flashes but we are only not built upon carnal flesh or focused on not that inside of his soul he realized that something was missing he knew that something was missing he was conscious that he was missing something regardless of the fact that he went to church regardless of the fact that he practiced the religion of his parents but something was missing something he knew that he could receive what he was missing from Jesus he had the the right way of approach that you could have he said he came closer to Jesus as we came to church tonight as we come closer to the message he went to Jesus good Master Cafe what would I do to receive what I'm lacking what do I need to do to receive eternal life Jesus Jesus knew that it was religious yes Jesus knew that he he was tied to the religion of his parents sometimes we'll come to church just because we have a friend that we like and that is in church just because we know our parents wants us to be in church just because my wife wants me to come to church just because my husband want me to come to church and we only take religion he was conscious that he was missing eternal life he came closer to Jesus good Master what would I do to inherit eternal life Jesus sent him to his religion oh ten commandments we can say tonight Jesus sent him to his religion he says oh wear long skirts do this do that he said well since my dad takes me to church I did all of those things but it wasn't sufficient the Bible says Jesus looked at him he loved them because it was good it was already good it was something good to follow that religion to believe that there was God behind that religion but if a market but you have to take the next step foreign there is something missing sell all that you have a distribution and distribute everything you have to the poor We Fear then come and follow me and that was the hard thing that was the hardest thing for the young man he looked at all the reaches he had passed reaches it's not just money it was just not the uh uh uh the the material privilege it's sometimes the privilege it is for the young girl it's her beauty it's the riches something that you cannot sacrifice for the word something that you esteem that you cannot abandon to follow the word everyone can know what that thing is sell all that you have deceiving to follow Jesus the foreign it is all now foreign now just religion won't work this Young Ruler here said good Master Suave now remember before I say it only he had been taught to walk right he had a good education he had been taught in business he was rich he was a ruler he had religion but it was confronted with another problem and problem okay and he was confronted and it confronts all of us eternal life religion doesn't give us eternal life religious religion is a covering but it doesn't give us eternal life and yet here and yet him taught with the best teachers there was he was yet lacking something it's a genomics of it and a young man knew it because he said vomit good Master what can I do to inherit eternal life now you you believe Jesus Is God don't you know so he knew the thoughts of the young man he said now in other words keep your religion he said [Music] I have did this since a boy like like a little boy my mama my papa and my priest taught me religion measures but I know in my religion that I still don't have eternal life see because when we choose Jesus the the reward that's behind the instructions it's not uh that is giving us a great instructions he's not giving us wealth in the world Jesus can bless you message but if you only trust in that blessing you are you are you have lost the true purpose because the objective or the goal to follow Jesus the reward that's behind us is it gives us eternal life love we are President the life might be after this Natural Life of the occasions that I had to talk to a few people here to bring to to either invite them to church or to speak them about God you you realize that people have a door come see they only feel like life only stops here comes in apartheid as if there's no life after death you know if we are standing here the both of us don't say today in the same thoughts you you will lose you will always lose because there is no life [Music] even my me who was believing that there's a life after that if I get to the other side and there's no life I will realize there's no life there is a life and you that refuse it before you can even get there you already lost [Music] we know that there's a life after death because the right components of the reward of following Jesus he said he gives us eternal life [Music] religion won't produce eternal life form the forms sometimes we have forms according to message sometimes we walk like uh humble people with our head bowel it's only a form it doesn't give eternal life receive the Christ in us do not I'm in our souls and to have eternal life it says the forms Sensations you feel something sometimes I when the word is being preached we feel good we sing something sometimes when when the the worship we feel the presence of God it's good it's a good thing but it's not what he's talking about he said you can be scared and feel something crying that's good who said that Christian shouting that's good but that's true it's not it you are confronted with eternal life we are confronted with this thing come and follow me it's not the uh the wealth that we have he probably wanted to make of him a Peter so he can go preach and the Bible tells us even after he rejected he continued to Prosperity he continued to have even more riches they don't like benediction so the the the the material blessings it's not a sign that God has accepted you we are not against the blessings we are not against instructions but when you when you confide yourself or you trust in them Jesus said it's hard for you to get into the kingdom of God this young man prospered and when we follow this young man the Bible says he prospered so much that this young man who was religious he get he got to a place where his heart was hardened that this young man he had a a bad girl a poor who was called Lazarus who was at this door and he was eating up on the up top on the Upper Floor and Lazarus was feeding off of the the few things that were falling off the table that Lazarus was there eating what was the food destined to dogs and Lazarus had boil all over his body it comes and because he had nothing to buy some medicine to apply on there those dogs will come and and they will lick his womb so they can help him but this young man we will see what he became in Luke chapter 12. Luke chapter 12 um verse 16 to 21. and respect and he spoke a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he taught within himself saying what shall I do because I have no room wearing to bestow my fruits and he said this will this will will I do I will pull down my Barns and build greater and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods and I will say to my soul soul thou has much good laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry but God said unto him thou full this night thy Soul shall be a required of thee then who shall be who shall those things be thou has provided that he didn't have enough space for him to store all his Goods he said oh my soul lay down East I have many Goods I have I trust in my goods and God said fool [Music] your soul will be required of you tonight we can read that in Luke chapter 16. looks up it says Luke chapter 16. verse 19 we believe uh adventured there was a certain there was a certain rich man which was clothed in in purple and fine Lennon and it's the same Rich Young Ruler and finally and and subterious every day and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sword and desire to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich men stable moreover the dogs came and licked his swords it says and he came to pass that the Beggars died and was carried by the angel into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes began to begin being in torment seeing Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy upon me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in the flame in this flame but Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime received thy good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou are tormented and beside all this between us and you there is a great golf fix so that they which would pass from hence cannot uh you will will pass from hence and you cannot neither can they pass out to us and would come from the ends then he came then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou would have sent him to my uh father's house for I have five brethrens for he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of Torment Abraham said unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them and he said nay Father Abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent and he said unto him if they would not hear Moses and the prophet neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead so we see the end of this young man and his faith was deter his faith was determined by the decision he made when he was alive he had the opportunity to meet God he had the opportunity to meet the world he made his choice yes sir and the choice that he made brought him to the place that he was here and when he went there it was too late that they may receive the same calling that you have received if they make a good decision they will not come where you are it's a choice that we make sure it's a it's a free moral agent uh called a choice we make a journey says God doesn't impose anything upon us God he leaves us as free moral agent we can make our own choice it's not that God has chosen because what you've accepted that you will accept that the other will not accept but it's the God who knows the end before the beginning that this when this calling will come to you then you're gonna accept it then he'll elect it is that every one of us makes and when we make the choice we know what to what is waiting to for us on the other side we know that there was another young man in Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11. verse 24-25 24 to 27 by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the Sons of pharaoh the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteemed the reproach of Christ's greater riches than the treasures of Egypt in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible amen we see this other young man who was also Rich he had the Activision who was smart who had uh he had prospered in his life Moses can teach wisdom to the Egyptian boy is Moses was next to take the The Throne of Egypt presence and Egypt was the greatest power on Earth for that time in other words if we're talking about today Moses was predestinated to be the president of the United States he was he was more richer than the other young man he had more privilege than the other young man but when he came across the same Choice Moses considered but the knowledge of God to give himself to God to commit himself to God he considered that to be a greater privilege done everything that he had fellas Moses to make the choice for him to go and work in the mud but Moses made the choice for him to be marked or someone they they mocked him who was closest to the throne Jack said you have accepted to go and to be in the mud to accept you you accepted or you agree that the one who was yourself and beat up on you because of Jesus because of the message because of the word Moses considered that it was nothing sometimes in life in our own environment sometimes they make fun of you I remember when I was still in school there's a friend who told me it is I'll tell you something I was 17 years old he didn't ask what you said he says you know you didn't really go through youth alone you went from uh being a child to being an old man because you're thinking your way of doing things it's not like you're a young man for him it was monkey it was a way for him to mock me down there I looked at him I said glory to God you know what that means when you will have your your sadness of being young come see me I will educate you says paragraph 109. sometimes when you little boy in school that figure little boy will say bad words and they want you all to say them you little girls the little the little girls will say bad things and I want you all to say them who did no more you say no I'm a Christian Express The Gospel movie and they say and they say hey big you know they go on like that you see stand up let's say I'm glad to be that foreign [Music] we see that we saw the end of the other young man because of the choice that he had to make it was hard but it was the right choice it was the best choice it was what was needed to be done the Bible tells us in Deuteronomy chapter 34 think I said five to seven that when Moses was ready to die do you remember God himself took Moses from all the people remembers of secondary so he can take care of the burial of Moses without a witness some person no one saw it no the the Bible says no one knew how Moses was buried but glory be to God as we have a prophet he saw how Moses was buried you know he tells us don't ethical country to be in a leadership paragraph 124 he did dollar people he says in the Bible you know there was a rock that led that that that that went with Israel and when Moses got ready to die he stepped Upon This Rock and this rock was Jesus you remember when Jesus was talking and in Saint John chapter 6 well it said a father ate manner in the wilderness and he said my father gave you that manner and he said yes they ate manner that's right they are all and they are all everyone dead but enough powerfully continue because they wouldn't keep going on small see they were they says they were everyone dead but he said and the bread of life that came down from heaven the predict you of the from Heaven from God our Father drank from Iraq Moses smoked a rocky and they said and the water came forth he said I am that rock that was with him and look when Moses died he stepped upon that rock you know what happened the Bible says that the Angels came and got him the people of Israel they didn't know how Moses was buried remember but Moses got on the Rock and Jude 1 9 tells us that even the devil even that's the body of Moses with the angels they just said to Wikipedia but God took care of the body of Moses until many a hundred years later Moses could be seen coming forth next to uh Elijah on the Mount of transfiguration because he made the right choice because he chose Jesus and he had the reward that was needed eternal life and to follow Jesus to choose Jesus we saw the story of John the Baptist couldn't appreciate when he preached John had disciples today had disciples to get ready my second coming John who had his disciples he presented Jesus to his disciples as this message is presenting us Christ as this message is presenting to us the word God said discipline conditions when his disciples heard John say that this is the Lamb of God they didn't think about it you know what are you looking for he didn't make it says master who where do you dwell where's your Dwelling Place where is your Dwelling Place when we make a choice we have to look for we have to find a place where he's dwelling and when we find where he's dwelling consider discipline as the two Disciples of John we're gonna dwell with him at that place to abide with a means to stay there it means you're not you're not leaving that place anymore and God he abides in the message of the hour God dwells in his words and if we want to have eternal life if you don't have a fellow bushes and if we have to make the right choice tonight is to abide in the message that may this word tell us something that's hard and where do you dwell if it if he gives us courage that where do you dwell we want to dwell where he does we want to make the choice because we know but if we dwell with them that is that we will receive the reward that is behind making that choice to receive eternal life my brother my sister some have made the choice many years ago those who some had made a choice one day but one they made a choice one day and then the next day the backslided Let's do laundry and then the next day they felt like they had to make a choice again and then another day they felt like they need to go back Master where do you dwell when we go where he abides where he dwells when we when we dwell in the message when we dwell in the word that it may be Tempest that they may be tornadoes that there may be difficulties we know that when will you abide with them we'll have a recompense immensely but foreign it's not easy it's not always easy but God wants that we may abide there that we may stay there that we may maintain in the choice that we have made you don't have to continue Did we tell them I'm staying here there is a power of transformation when you are weakness regardless of who you are abide there don't be discouraged well there I have no place in the world that's the choice that we have to make that's what God is calling us to to choose Jesus the reward is certain yesterday's other things they can tell you but if you choose this we're going to give you such and such but sometimes we choose and then at the end they're not giving you what they told you to promise you but one thing is certain God has promised something he always brings it to pass [Music] when you make the choice to choose you make the choice to follow him if you abide where he abides and Assurance he said he will give you eternal life he will do it it's not it's not depending on you what all God has asked you to do is to make the decision is to choose as soon as you choose and you choose it without your heart you said I'll follow this message to the end the rest is up to him to bring to pass [Music] let's stand [Applause] [Music] thank you Lord people to be a sanctuary [Music] pure and holy for trying and true we face [Music] Lord we pray [Music] you'll ever be trying [Music] to Grace [Music] foreign [Music]
