Amen Hallelujah Lord bless you this morning uh we're we're going to just start this morning um with uh we're going to read uh uh a passage from Psalm but we're going to let uh our our Prophet read that to us and if you turn in your Bibles to Psalm 42 and uh I don't exactly uh uh but you're very familiar uh with the scripture I believe it's the second verse so we're going to turn to Psalm 42 uh we'll uh we're going to listen to just a few moments uh of a message called thirst and we're using this as part of our Foundation to share with you uh what's on our heart this morning so we trust that the Lord will uh speak to each of our hearts uh our our theme I express to you is uh we want to uh have a path forward amen we're not leaving that thought we want to have a path forward and we want to grow together uh closer to one another as a body so we want to gather up the Loose Ends and and pull all in for one goal and one Accord that the Lord will richly bless us so we'll just listen to a just a very few moments of this message thirst uh it's uh really pretty tremendous message when I begin to read it and see what was in it but we're just going to start just on a small portion of of it this morning so after brother brandom reads the scripture uh uh feel uh free to take your seat God bless you as we start our morning now Psalms uh 42 as the heart paintthe my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirst for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night while I while they continually say unto me where is thy God I think David in the writing of this Psalm must have been in distress and it usually takes distress to bring the best out of a man it really uh that's when God gets down to when we fast many times to get herself in position to get herself out of the way and I think when David got in these places then he began to meditate on the Lord begin to think about the things many times God gets us in in tight Corners where we have to look up sometimes we even have to get on our back in the hospital or a bed somewhere so we can look up to see where the great blessings of God comes from now the word I want to speak from tonight one word out of the Bible and that is found in the second verse uh thirst the word of thirst I was looking in the dictionary when I was uh looking up this word I was thinking about a sermon one time I preached on um thirsting after life and uh tuck it out of the Psalms too when David said thy statues I believe are more precious to me than life and I was looking and thinking about that word thirst so I looked up in the dictionary to see what it means and here's what Webster says it's a painful desire a painful when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you uh now that's uh it's not a unnatural thing to thirst thirst is a a natural thing it's just simply something that God has given us that we could U to give us a a desire for something sometimes God has uh also has given you a a control tower something that sets inside of you that that controls these different desires and this uh thirst this control tower that sits in a man's heart is something that God giving to to warnning of the desires that's needful for him now there is two different kinds of thirst there is a thirst physically and there is a thirst Also spiritually I would like to read this what David said again my soul thirst for God for the Living God not some historical or some something that happened some years ago or or some tale that someone told but for the Living God a God that's ever present and his soul thirsted for that God not for some historical something now we find God gives the control tower to you to give to you the things that you need now the control tower in you is what directs you and this thirst runs in on this C to uh control tower and tells you what you have need of spiritually speaking the control tower in the body and in the soul also there's a control tower in the body that tells you the need that's needed in your body and it's brought to you by thirst also there's a control tower in your soul that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of something in your spirit and and You by this can tell what kind of a life is controlling you when you uh when you can see what your desires are then you can tell but that what kind of something it's in you that's creating this desire that you have see there's a certain thing that you thirst for and it and it can tell you in your soul what this desire is by the nature of The Thirst that you have I hope that's you can understand that there is a a control tower of the soul and one for the body and each Tower is a warning caller for the need needs of the other each one calls to the Need For What the caller is calling for it sends out a wave of warning for instance the the flesh thirst to satisfy the desires that's in the body and the Spirit uh desires for the things that's in the soul desire is and many times these War one against the other we find there what's the a great trouble today that too many people uh try to live between those two desires for one of them desires the things of the Earth the other desires the things of Heaven like Paul said describes this in Romans 7:21 when I would do good then evil is not when you try did you ever have that in experienc Christians that when you're trying to do something that's worthwhile go to make an effort to do something that's good then you find out that there is a devil on every hand just to upset you everything that you and that's one good thing that I'd like to say this and the Christians might know that when you're when you're starting to do something and there's something always trying to upset you in doing it do it anyhow that's the devil they're trying to keep you from doing what's right now many times I meet people that's prone to be a little nervous when they find out that they're trying to do something and and everything's just blocking it off on both sides and say it might not been the will of the Lord see uh don't let the devil lie to you like that the first thing is find out whether it's the will of God or not and then if you want to know where's the will of God look into the Bible there is a thing that's that sets you straight is the word of God and then if you see it's in the word of God for you to do it like for instance seeking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost many times I've run into people say well I sought for the Holy Ghost and I just couldn't receive it I don't believe it's for me every time I get down I get sick and I go to praying if I fast it gets sick and if I try to uh stay all night I say I get so sleepy I I can't get off my feet remember that is the devil because God intends for you to have the Holy Spirit it's for whosoever will many times you find when you're prayed for in a meeting for Divine Healing then the next day you find out no doubt that the devil will make that twice as bad as it was the day before see remember that's just Satan trying to get you away from the blessing that God's got for you don't you listen to that fell see always press right on I had an experience of that just recently on the road to Africa if I ever had any time that the devil ever did press at me was to go to Africa this last time and become one of the the finest meetings and times that I ever went overseas I got I believe more things accomplished in that little time that I was there besides my hunting trip than I ever did at any time I always thought that those churches didn't want me there and come to find out I had a letter from someone that it was U oh they didn't want me there all the association and found out it was one man with a letter head from an organization that said we don't want you he meant him and his family see so then when I got over there see just we that was he and his family and it wasn't the people at all so now it's a great Field open up for us to see what Paul said when I would do good then evil is not you let a young convert come tonight to the altar somewhere here in this Tabernacle or or out Across the Nation and just remember tomorrow mother will be more Angry than she ever was dad will be all upset and all the school kids and everything just goes wrong because it's Satan trying to get you to turn around he's trying to run you off the path when I would do good then evil is always not now let us look at the thirst and let's see whether uh actually thirst is a natural thing I've had people to tell me oh I never did I believe it's just far some people to want to be Christians oh all that's wrong it's actually a something that's associated with every human being it certainly is true when we come to this country in the early days we found the Indians here and the Indians though they were Heathen at that time they worship the son or something as long as they are human there's something in them a natural thirst calling out for God somewhere back in the jungles just recently back there uh 480 miles from the coast this civilization a little small town of about 3,000 people of Barra and mosm Beek we found natives that didn't even never seen a white person I found a native girl she had no clothes on any of them harly have clothes on and she was sitting up in a tree and I was tracking a line and there was I heard something like a human being screaming this native girl sitting up there walyed holding a baby and what she was scared about that your only protection is get up a tree from a lion leopard or something or some animal and she'd see me and heard it was a human being but when she looked and seen a white person she had never seen one in her life see and she was scared to death see but when we find those people even in that primitive condition back there they were still worshiping before we called a lion in they poured out some me meal that's what they eat on a little leaf and clap their hands and called on the spirit of some great something they didn't know where like a patron saint or something to a Catholic to protect them that they wouldn't be uh killed during the time of the charge of this line see it's something natural it's not an unnatural thing to thirst for God it's a natural thing it's just something that you should do God has made you up like that and it's no superhuman it's just actually a common human being it ain't just special for some people we're just uh wanting to uh lay a a little Foundation uh this morning for the thing things that we uh are Desiring to uh share with you so uh uh we want to do that so I i' also see if I've I've got him here uh I I wanted to also uh read to you a uh a few statements that are our messenger made and I'm going to build uh to a little something so uh if you would uh bear with me and help me uh go along and pull a little bit When the Thought uh comes along so we we realize that we've talked before uh and we want to establish this that God was the original maker of man so you you when we understand that that that everything that God put in man he put in man when he made Man In His Image and likeness so he said every seed when God made a seed he made that seed he put all the fruit and everything that was in that seed he put that that was in the seed so you take a corn seed and all those seeds you might put several different kind of seeds out there they're all small little seeds and uh the scripture even refers to the Mustard Seed how it was just a very small seed but in that seed God had placed in that seed what it was going to become and the fruit that it was going to produce and and so when we we begin to understand these principles and so God's the Creator Satan is the perverter and so when God you saw the seed so if you saw a corn seed or a wheat seed and you plant that seed it it doesn't just come up a a seed in that seed was a a a a little stock a little a blade that came up and then it moved into a stock and it and it grew higher and then it formed a ear and uh uh I don't know why they call it a ear it looks more like a nose to me but uh maybe they don't call it a nose of corn but they it it's a they call it a ear of corn it produces a corn and it wraps itself with a a shock and and you've got to peel it back to get to the the back to the original Fruit uh that was planted it's it's so many uh types of that the wheat and the shuck and the sermons that we have about the wheat the wheat and and the Shu so when we begin to understand that God put a thirst in men so in other words that thirst was created in man God we just heard him say that that that thirst was created ated in man and to take care of the natural thirst is to take care of the natural man the spiritual thirst is to take care of the spiritual man but he said these two work in harmony right they they work one towards the other and and so we when we begin to come to the understanding that that we were made a certain way and so I'd like to uh this is from a message called uh the union of one God in the one church he says you know God has made man to achieve that's what man was made for all down through life he has tried to achieve something and his achievements the reason he TR tries that is because he was so designed to do so so I I I want you to get that you were designed to thirst you were designed to achieve that you didn't choose these things there there there's a a a drive in you that God put there to get better you know in other words if if you're cold you're going to seek shelter you know if you're hungry you're going to seek food and maybe uh if if you're if you're thirsty as our Prophet said then what you want your achievement is to quench that thirst I mean you so you've got to achieve that you've got a a accomplish that you've got to perform that you've got to reach out to that it it becomes a force within you and and you you can try to get away from that Force but the bum will have to drink water he'll seek food he'll seek shelter you understand the the the the drive to achieve that is within them so it's not a bad thing you understand it's a good thing if God made you that way then it's a good thing God does everything perfectly and I I'm I'm building to something so I just want to we're going to have a little bible study this morning to get our Focus uh this was on my heart and and David Jr preached a wonderful sermon uh uh a Wednesday touching on a lot of these things that were in my heart so it was a blessing and so he he he he says this as we read just a little farther now in the beginning which is the seed chapter of the Bible we find that there that in there that when God made man he made him in the way that he knew that he was to be so this thirst this desire to achieve God made that way he made you to be that way and and I I might as well insert this as I try to stay with my notes and I always get off but Christianity has almost got sometimes to try to make it that the man doesn't achieve I was raised a a Catholic they always preach poverty and and they always preach uh you know Penance and and de privity God don't want you to live that way he wants you to achieve he wants you to be successful you he made you that that way and and we am uh so I I just like to to have you make that solid in you just for a few seconds this morning and so he put it that way that he knew how he was to be and then he he dropped I'll drop down here a little farther and just read this statement you can go read these paragraphs 17 18 19 20 through there he says he says God put he he he said he had got it in such a condition till even his creator grieved him in his heart that he ever made man so it it God got to the place that he grieved that he ever made man and this what he says he ever made man you and you can imagine how how God felt when he seen the very creature that he made in His image and had had given him dominion and how that he made him to do something for him and yet he turned all of his strength and his power over to selfish desires and achievements so he made him to achieve something but then he sought trying to achieve the wrong thing he says man's always trying to aieve something by his head he's supposed to achieve by his heart this is paragraph E8 I don't know this is from looking to the Unseen uh but I I didn't want to get involved in just trying to put the quotes up I want you to hear the thought okay so uh but I want you to let this part of it settle in he says but his heart that that's a control tower where God controlled him and directs his thoughts directs his walk directs his emotions sometimes I get so happy till I get loose and I I look around and see somebody and I got my eyes on the people but God helped me to keep my eyes closed I I want to just be led by the spirit of God that the flesh will have nothing to do in it so we as as we talked to you before now we're we're not into a theological discussion this morning I'm not going to talk about the ministry of the son of man how that we know in our day that the in order to test the Gentiles that God had to give the Gentiles Something to Believe on the very same line that he gave the Jews to believe in other words I'm not going to test your math skills by giving one person um uh two plus two you know what I mean and that's their test and then give another person over here E equals mc² you know and then say it's a equal test that wouldn't if I could say that that wouldn't be just and so we could we could go into that we could go into how Jesus was a man just he looked like a man he he would appear maybe to be somebody a little taller than I am for kind of a little lot skinnier than I would be but nevertheless you would identify him as a man there was nothing about him on the outside that would separate you him from every everybody else but it wasn't until he spoke and it wasn't until he acted and then like and they said well no man could do these things L God be with you he spoke like no other man have spoken so his identity was in what proceeded from him and now the test was what was that and some people said it was beel up other people said it was God no man could do these things you know and then Jesus asked them who do you say the son of man is Thou Art the Christ in other words he was saying Thou Art the Fulfillment of the scriptures Thou Art the Fulfillment of the promise this is what our fathers look for and that would and now in order to be just TR to judge the Gentile Church in other words all that the father's taught in the Old Testament the temples all the scribes and all the Pharisees everything they taught was finally put to the test he said search the scriptures in them you you say you have eternal life but they are which testify of me so coming at that time it proved everything that was before him that was the test of what came before him now in order to be just The Same Spirit that was in Christ Jesus had to show up in our day in flesh in a man no different until he spoke no there wasn't a guy that spoke like he spoke now not everybody thought that some people thought he was ignorant and unlearned they thought that about Jesus but it was the test so in the Gentile age we had the test God came in human flesh to test everything that the church had built everything the denominations taught everything that they said that they were he put God right back in their flesh in human flesh doing the same works the same signs the same wonders preaching the same gospel and what did they do they crucified him again so this generator was indicted now I'm not going down that path this morning these are things you ought to to know we're not going to talk about the seals this morning how the horse riders went out and how Satan disguised himself in four horse riders and how he brought the church and through four stages of four horses four powers the history of his poers in the church ages we could break the church ages down and show the influence of the first church horse in these Church ages the second horse rider in these Church ages the third horse rider in these ages then we could show the last horse rider the confusion that we've got in the land the pale horse rider then we could show the beasts that came out the the the lion we could show the ox we could show the man how the lion went out and and how that that the lion was the word of God the battling and and then we could show how that the ox went out was the Martyr and the sacrifice then we could show how the next one was the man which was the reformers the intellect bringing people back and then we could show the eag you know these things and yet all this Revelation and all this knowledge isn't showing up in our lives you know we're it it's you know it's like you know the uh the amers you know are just starting everything's starting to cool down it's just a little heat like the flame is is starting to go out of the church and and and uh there there doesn't seem to be uh if I could say it that way there doesn't seem to be a lot of success or achievement and nobody is striving for those achievements now we know in and this is kind of going back if I if you don't mind going back with me just for a moment and I'm I I I only can only preach what God moves me to preach and then sometimes I start preaching sermons and then I come four or five weeks later and I I I see where where God was taking me and I I'm starting to see when we came back when we talked about the two puzzles you understand there was there were was two pictures two puzzles and so the one puzzle had a picture and another puzzle had a picture but nobody's seen the picture of God alls we had was the picture of Satan's Eden so we have this puzzle it's called Satan's Eden the God of this evil age and we try to fit all of our Lives into Satan's Kingdom because that had become the measure of success we measure success by what a level of achievement we've gained in Satan's Eden we measure success in dollars we measure success in possessions we measure success in influence we measure success in power we measure success in Authority position I'm successful because I'm the manager of Andy's custard store that don't mean nothing you talk about you know they say Bill Gates I don't know Bill Gates uh uh I wish I'd have an opportunity to meet him I would tell him he needs to get saved you don't think I would oh I'd love to a lot of talk nowadays about uh uh musk and and this person and that person and they attribute them to be successful they they're a billionaire multi-billionaire and so we find out that that our Su that our vision of success and and what that what it takes to be successful uh there brother makes this this this statement if if you also in this message uh see if I open my book to it here he says there's also a thirst for Success so man's made to achieve he's made to succeed he's made to do things he says so many people today how we school for this thirst we start the university up we do down spend thousands of dollars to send their children to school to universities to college and so forth to get an education to be what to be successful so this it it's not a bad thing you understand that and the prophet of God divided it there's spiritual side and there's a natural side it's natural to be successful it's it's a a part of it and and so they've come up with so man has a drive in him to be successful and so they studied this this drive to achieve they've studied this thirst for success and then they stood back and they looked at people that have accomplished what they deem as being successful and they say what are the practices and the habits and the decisions of successful people so that they do certain things okay but now now remember the things they're doing God put in them to do it was in their makeup that's right so man begin to identify what God had put in them their drives their patterns their decisionmaking the things that they did and they begin to categorize them they begin to identify them they begin to recognize the habits of of those people that are successful now the habits and everything were in there God put them in there man didn't put in there so it wasn't the drive or the characteristics the pattern of success they took all these successful people hundreds of them and all of them had certain patterns certain things they did certain characteristics they followed and when they did that they were extremely successful so it wasn't the pattern that was wrong it wasn't the decision making that was wrong it wasn't the habits that they possessed that were wrong what was wrong is what they were using for cuz Satan's a perverter now I'm saying this because we we want to be spiritually successful so what did Satan do he changed the object he changed the meaning of success Jesus was trying to re reestablish the meaning of success because he knew that man had all these characteristics in there put in there by God and God made him to achieve am I clear this morning you know like I said I'm not preaching to the internet today I don't care if we have another technical failure that's fine with me I'm interested in you you that are sitting here this morning I want you to reach your full potential I want you to be everything that God made you to be and I want you to take back from Satan what's yours so Satan takes all these characteristics all these things in man that God put there to make man achieve The Thirst the desire to achieve the desire to be successful he perverts them so that man's me meaning of success his measurement of success is all those are all wrong Satan changed the goal he made the wrong achievement so now he takes possession of achievement sure he takes possession of achievement he takes possession of success he takes possession of what the goal is every athlete in order to become a pro they all have certain ethics certain work habits certain mindsets where did they come from they came from God and what did he do he got the Christian to shy away from everything that makes you successful cuz Satan changed the goal the definition the meaning it's the truth David didn't thirst after religion he thirsted after a living God a God he could touch a God he could labor for these men were great Achievers Abraham job all these things were great men were great Achievers I'm going to read you just a few items I'm heading in a Direction but I hope did you understand those things that I said right so this is just this is just some of the characteristics that they they they they're now they're saying to be successful athletes businessmen Educators everybody that's been successful that they could measure all had the same identifications and characteristics and every single one of them came from God so we say I'm not going to do what he does because that's not the success I'm trying to achieve he stole it from you you just aren't trying to achieve what they're trying to achieve but your way of getting there is the same hallelujah it's the same you got to do the same habits you got to do the same practices you've got to do the same things you won't reach your goal without putting in the work how many of you hear the guy say well you got to put in the work you got to put in the work no I'm going tocate that's religion that's the Catholic church I'm going to join and go no you're not going to join and go you know we think oh if I just get the Holy Ghost I'm I'm just going to I'm just going to skate in you know what I mean I I'd like to read you something just now that I I got to take a moment calm down listen to this right we're talking about thirsting we're talking about feeding Fe ing you want to achieve you got to feed achievement right if you want to do you want to be successful you have to do the things that God put in you to be successful I'll emphasize it again Satan identified those things and perverted it for his own use he looked at Eve what did he offer her oh if you partake of this you will be successful you will achieve you will become like God why he couldn't have pulled that on Adam so he pulled it on the bride he couldn't pull it on Jesus but he's trying to pull it on the bride so here he he's got her listen what he says listen to this paragraph 180 in thirst he said says you neglect to Milk The Cow when the cow is when the utter is full of milk and if you let that cow stay like that she'll go dry that's exactly right if you neglect to take a drink of water I just ain't going to drink anymore you'll die if you neglect to eat food you'll die this is so profound so if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit the word of God you'll die who ever thought we had to feed the Holy Spirit but if you don't give this that unction that spirit that that that move if you don't give it the word of God it'll die it might go off into some great big thing but it'll die spiritual moves without the word of God die I don't care where they are I don't care who their preachers are that's thus saith the Lord they die doesn't have to do with the person the personality the goodness it's a fact just like your desire to achieve is a fact the characteristics that God put in you to achieve are a fact they're not attributed to man they're not attributed to psychology they're not attributed to life coaches they've been there all the time are you with me you say why are you preaching like this I want to help you I'm tired of seeing people all deadfaced because they got a house payment and they they don't think their house is good enough they don't think their car is good enough and they don't think that's good enough and they compare themselves with one another what would You' like to have right now a nice car a nice boat a nice house and caner what would you like to have high pain job big title and have so much stress no it's just out of balance now here I'm going to read you a bunch of stuff we're going to dig in just for a few moments you all got me thing okay this is some of the things that successful people do keep some balance in your life I'm not going to read all the stuff they say Protect Your Sundays am they found out that successful people take Sunday offall can you believe that they protect their Sunday they pick three things to do every day they they adapt to what the presents hold so they deal with what's happening not behind or ahead I want you as I read these things in your mind I want you to start attaching scriptures okay because what that's what I'm trying to show you this morning that all these characteristics of success God put in you it it it says uh it it say another thing they do here I'll just read them try to read them quicker de uh de we prioritize opportunities which don't fit your goals in other words don't seek after things that don't fit make a list of goals for improvement listen and learn put in extra effort to stay organized do all things things decent and in order just the scripture pay attention to detail keep a Daily Journal but do it right away how many know brother Ram kept a journal do you know that he kept all his visions and all his dreams check your pride at the door never give up surround yourself with positive people remove fear unplug without a device those those are just some of the things there are seven other things that a a a different list has now what I want to do for a few moments because I want you to establish that every single one of those things that I've read They're scripture form they are scriptural practices The Book of Proverbs is a whole book of successful practices Solomon was teaching his children how to be successful in life and business and in re and naturally physically and spiritually so I'm going to just take a few I'm going to take 10 of these characteristics that are in you that God put there and try to attach some scripture to them because I'm tired of Satan deceiving us so he says all these successful practices all these things that I've taken and I've taught all my people that they can achieve Great Heights in my Eden and they say they're mine and I'm saying no they're not I can do these same things these same practice practices but I can do them for a different Kingdom a different Eden and I can be just as successful in my world as they are in their world because these two worlds are coming to a showdown and we just heard our Prophet say you can't get stuck in between the two control Towers you can't confuse the message amen we do all the same things that they do for a different purpose for a different achievement for a different result but we're doing the same things they do to get rich we do the same things to get rich that's right he said The Thirst is on both sides natural and spiritual the same things they do to reach to reach Fame to we re we do the same things to reach a good testimony but the the the method is the same it's just two different roads two different goals and when you get those confused when when you get when when it it becomes a blur that's lady OA lukewarm all of it is yours every good and perfect thing comes from the father above if you have your bibles if the brothers could keep up with me one of the first characteristics that they found with every single person they studied thousands of millionaires billionaires athletes this one characteristic stood up they wake up early Mark 1 35 I don't know if you guys can find that as quick as we can uh and in the morning rising up a great while before day he went out and departed into a a solitary place and there prayed if if we read John 8 and2 I I would have marked all these out but can you find John 8 and2 and early in the morning he came again to the temple and all the people came unto him and sat down and taught them the another scripture it says that he he woke up early in the morning which was his custom oh I want to be successful get up wake up the the uh Proverbs uh 31 and 15 she riseth also it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens oh man I got to get up and cook breakfast you want to be successful get up I'm not even going to read all the scriptures is about a sluggard let's just read Proverbs 31:15 that was good Brothers oh that I've already gave that one okay let's let's go to uh Psalms 1438 just a few there was 50 or 60 on this one thing cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for in thee do I trust cause me to Know Thy ways wherein I should walk for I lift up my soul unto thee in the morning why do you start up wake up early to start your day right you'll never be successful waiting till 8:30 in the morning to tear out of the house to get your job at 8:00 you will never be successful cuz God put it in you to wake up early now I'm not going to go into the rare occasions you start work at this early is early number two they all do read more read more how many knew the prophet of God was a reader Psalms 119 105 Thy word is a lamp under my feet and a light unto my path Psalm 11918 open th my eyes that I might behold wondrous things out of thy law that's what they read just just Proverbs 15 and 15 and four a wholesome tongue is a the tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach of the Spirit uh that was no I'm sorry Romans 15 and4 that's still good that comes under a different category so what soever things were written a four time were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope read [Music] more you say I listen listening is a whole different characteristic listen and learn read more I'm not going to go into the psychology of reading but when you read it you can write it on your heart every single guy that ever was successful he writes down what his thought is prophet of God said a sermon came to me I wrote it down oh we want you want to skate in no skating in here we're done with skating you show up to church at 10:00 and can't come early you you you you don't show up to work that way it shows what your thirst is it identifies you acts 17 and 11 these were more Noble than those in thessalonia in that they received the word with all Readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures Daily whether those things were so so here they're over there saying read more that wasn't they didn't come up with that it was in in the scriptures why was it in the scriptures because God put it in man to hunger and thirst after righteousness everything they're doing to get rich in the world are the things we do to get rich in Christ second Timothy 2:15 I think that study to show yourself approved I'm not yeah study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth that that's one okay you know the I'm not going to go a long time into this one take care of your body exercise they say prophet of God always preached about high breed food what it was doing to us that's the one we think we can get away with there's a lot of other things we can teach there but we we know that the scripture tells us that we are the temple of God you know so we won't spend time there self-focus take a look at yourself David said I lay on my bed and I meditate Lord I searcheth all my ways there's there's there's scripture after scripture that you'll see that these men they they they they stopped Jesus taught it this way in Matthew uh 7 and5 he said remove the beam you can put Matthew 7 and5 up there he says Thou Hypocrites First cast out the beam out of thine own eye then shalt thou See Clearly to cast cast out the moat of thy brother's eye Jesus is teaching this self-focus look at yourself first make sure there's no hypocrisy in in in yourself uh Philippians I believe it is four uh six and seven be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving giving let your request be known unto God in other words these are these are self uh Reflections I believe it is Philippians 2 3 and 4 there's a lot more of them let nothing be done through let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowless of mind letting each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man on on his own thing but every man also on the things of others so these are these are things that you reflect on yourself all these people that were successful they did self judgment they looked at themselves they looked in the mirror Jesus said walk a mile in another man's shoes that's this brotherly kindness brother brandom said brotherly kindness was to walk a mile in other words think of what your brother's feeling look at yourself self-focus everybody that was successful self-focused they to take a minute to look at themselves we're taught to do that right judge yourself before you judge another the same judgment that you judge yourself by or how you judge is how you're going to be judged so here you look at somebody and you say wow this guy's Rich he's the president of the bank how did he get there you know how he got there he followed the scriptures he didn't know he was following the scriptures cuz Satan robbed it out of the scriptures and presented it as psychology and philosophy and as a method to get to his kingdom God wrote him in the scriptures for his children to become Saints and pillars in Christ despised of the world but the crowns of Glory Paul says I'm waiting to get the Crown of Glory I've ran a good fight i' I I've did the thing I've done the work of the Lord I'm successful and Jesus says take no thought of what you eat or what you wear look at The Sparrows look at the birds everything that man has done to become successful they robbed from God and they took it out of the scriptures because Satan is a perverter you can do these very same things you can take the self-help book you could take the success books every single one of them you pick the subject ask your Bible where is is this in the Bible and scripture after scripture after scripture will come out these are not Secrets Satan stole them the their next thing is act analytically I'm going to move fast now in other words that's discernment John 7:24 judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment to analyze means to discern to look at it pray about it don't make quick harsh emotional decisions first John 4 And1 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out under the world they're teaching this for those guys to be successful in the world they took them from our Bible they're ours we do that but we're not trying to get to the same place they are but the method was put in Us by God to thirst after the things of God to do these things for the kingdom of God what they're doing for the world we do for God they wake up early to get a head start we wake up early they read more we read more for for a different reason they get up they read the market they read the tick or tape they they do all this stuff by 9:00 they' they've accomplished three or four things they've got all the cobwebs out they're on fire for God 1 Thessalonians 5 and 21 prove all things hold fast to that which is good analytical now I'm asking you are you doing these things if you sit back and say oh that's in the Bible I believe that no you've got to be a doer of the word not a hearer of the word if you are reading these things and not practicing them you are suffering from religious fantasy the scripture says go the extra mile if your brother ask for your Hammer give him your saw also we got some work to do out here I just want to let you know you can out give God but if if here the here they take everything that was given to us to be superch Christians and they take it and they do it for the wrong reason and are wealthy Rich everything a guy asked me how do you get rich I said be a Christian you can outgive God you can't outdo anything for God can do it I want you to succeed I want to succeed how am I going to do it I'm going to follow the word of God if you don't feed the spirit the word of God it will die if you don't do these things thank you Lord if you don't see a decision and do it we just heard brother Bram said when Satan tries to bother you and stop you from doing something what do it anyway Colossians 2 and8 I really want this one to beware lest any man spoil you through philosophies and vain deceits after the traditions of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ be analytical we call that what discernment disc discern everything of what Spirit it is discern the motive discern the objective I I I want you to discern me I want you to discern my motive I want you to discern my objective I want you to discern my life I want you to look at and say where's my heart at because if it's not right then you can come to me and restore me back to the Faith we're not afraid to have people look at our lives especially if we're trying to reach the same goal then let's just read Hebrews 11 and3 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seemed were not made by things which do appear not everything is oh church this one's a big one to me because that's one of the failures I think most in the Church of the Living God is discernment where is this taking me and then Hebrews 5 and14 be strong but strong meat belongeth to them that are full of age even those by the reason of you of having their senses exercised to discern both good and evil do you all understand that they stole that so if they stole success for their Kingdom why don't we go back to what was ours all the time and use the same methods to achieve our kingdom where's your thirst if your control tower is thirsting after that bank job or that Prestige or or that wealth but yet really you're called for this Kingdom you're caught in the middle how many knows what the definition of ladyo is lukewarm caught in the middle there are two things you got to do the same things to be good at your job good at what you do you got to do the same things to be a good Christian you say brother McGary this sermon sure ain't very deep it's deeper than you imagine because it's real it's real scripture it's real word and it's what the prophet taught and practiced and I'm going to say the best thing I can say you can do it it's in you to do you've just got to shake yourself and go back do a self-examination and reset your path going forward practicing successful Christian practices surround yourself with good people Proverbs 13 and 20 he that walketh with wise men shall be wise but the companion of fools shall be destroyed do you understand I we could preach a sermon on every single one of these they're out there every I went to sell sem surround yourself with successful people get around people that'll be success like it'll rub off on you hey how about reading the Book of Proverbs uh uh 1 Corinthians 15:33 or second Corin yeah 1 Corinthians 15:33 be not deceived evil communication corrupts good manners don't hang around gossipers how many knows brother Ram taught that don't listen never receive an accusation against an all Elder I'll go one step further never make one against an elder 1 Corinthians 5 51 when when I but now I have written unto you not to keep Company If any man that called a brother be a fornicator Covetous an idolator a or a drunker or an extortioner which such a one do not eat you don't F you got to discern and surround yourself with good people don't surround yourself with people that are so negative when you're done you feel down I like to be around people that they don't care how bad it is man they love God God is good we can do this you you know what I mean we let us get this done well you know God's good we're going to go forward I don't care what the Satan you know get you you got to surround yourself with faith you want to have faith be with faithful people you want your faith to grow be with people that believe how can two walk together unless they agree here these guys are paying millions of dollars to go to school and have a success coach get up there I want every businessman in Dallas Fort Worth to know that I am offering success training not only success TR but I will take you to the very root and Foundation of every successful habit there is the word of God no wonder let's just take a couple more I know I'm wearing you out but I I want to wear you out Psalms 1 and one blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful surround yourself with good people people of like Precious faith and if you're listening to someone on the internet that don't teach it the way you believe it don't quit keep drinking the poison if I stood up here some Sunday let's say I had a big name and a great reputation and I was kind of preacher that people really enjoyed and I started getting up preaching the Trinity I hope you'd vacate I hate you that you wouldn't sit there listening to something that you know is not what the prophet of God taught because you've got friends and you've got reputation and it it doesn't lead to success spiritually the trou with leaven is a little leaven leth the whole lump that was one of the things they said get stuff out that that don't fit and don't tell yourself oh I I I just changed tires if you change tires you can be a successful spiritual Giant a burning light a powerful candle maybe not in their world but you look oh I won't go there that I that would get so big Proverbs 18:24 a man that hath friends must show himself friendly and if there is a friend that sticketh closer than the brother stay with the people that loved you walk with you through everything you've ever been for have loved you with an undying love and has given their life walked in every decision you made right always been there those are the people the knives of a friend are sweeter than the kisses of an enemy we don't social climb we don't hide we got one goal and that's eternity if I tell you the truth it's not the truth to hurt that's right the truth's what set you free it allows you to make decisions I'm not against any decision you make but keep God in everything you choose to do you choose to go off to school go off to school and be successful keep God there you don't have to hide what you're doing the scripture says that he knows what you're doing in your tent well there's nothing hid from him let's go together a friend sticks with you not against you he's for you I've said hard things to hard people but it's made them better that's right I'm not here to judge I'm here to help I got to look at my own self I got to cast out the beam I've got plenty of failure but I'm going to deal with them and overcome amen by what by the washing of the water of the word how do you overcome by the washing of the water of the word you must feed the holy Spirit the word and then second Corinthians 6 and14 be ye not unequally Yol together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communication hath light with Darkness how many have ever heard them preach be around successful people if you want to make your game better play what better people you know I like playing checkers with six years olds man I play checkers with guys that have me so cornered so quick how did you do that but the only way you'll get better and we're not talking better in the world we're talking spiritual the only way you're going to get more spiritual but if you hang around with people that keep giving you an excuse and help you do things that are contrary to your conscience all things are lawful but all things aren't expedient if everybody wants to go down and and go to a ball game and it's not in your heart then you don't do it don't hang around with people that are keeping keep you always pulling down your your standards and dragging down your principles and and making it a way for you you know that's just like the guy says oh just one drink just just one dance don't be an enabler that's why I told told Lord I'm not going to be a bank this year and not there's if if someone's continually in a problem what's the root of their problem it's not bailout right you know what I mean there there's there's there's there there there's successful things that aren't being practiced and I've been telling you these these are all the things these are the things the world is telling their people and yet there's a scripture for every one of them I hope your minds are going a mile a minute looking at your lives and judging your actions and judging your thinking because a tree that is unfruitful is hewed down and throw in the fire and Paul said I would that you be fruitful that you grow in the knowledge and the wisdom of the kingdom of God these things are practices believe it or not that are word practices and Satan robbed them and made his kingdom successful and accused us if we do them we're Sinners can you believe that you know what that is that's Garden of Eden deception that's decep Ion on the scale of the Garden of Eden thinking people that they can have an experience a one-time experience without putting any work having any life style having any pattern Paul told Timothy lay for thyself a pattern of good works every single one of these says have practices you want to work out you don't go to the gym once a month or once a year like me if you're going to do something about it you got to have the self-discipline you got to put in the work you can't imagine the result I

by the Holy Ghost I want you to know what hour know your calling know how to get there be doers of the word not hearers of the word you can't have sweet water and bitter water coming out of the same tongue all those things amen are things that we have thought we could cover up with the message of the hour we can say I believe in brother brandom I believe he's a prophet I don't have to be a Christian you're a Catholic that's how Catholics think I was taught from day one that I was going to heaven because I was a Catholic I can almost sin any sin and I might have to do a little time in purgatory but I was going why are you going I'm okay Catholic I'm a Catholic brother Ram said what are you he says I'm a I'm a Methodist he said what what that don't have one thing to do with it I'm telling you church I might be long this morning but I want you to know beyond a shadow of a doubt if you are not practicing these scriptures that I'm reading to you you will will not be spiritually successful plain and simple we'll go quick set a goal and follow after them I'll just read the scriptures and you don't we won't look them up Matthew 6 and33 Galatians 67 James 47 and10 Philippians 3 and14 have multiple incomes you know I always in my life I've been with people that they won't go to work for $15 an hour because they make $50 an hour they worked one job one time got $50 an hour now they make $50 an hour they won't mow a lawn they won't flip a Burger they won't do nothing they'll wait and wait and wait for the bucket at the end of the rainbow they're little leprechauns they're they're they're dreaming Irish dreams that's the world have multiple incomes I I I took that in in in a in a whole different light read your Bible pray fast and pray Ephesians 5:19 did we go dead here it is speak to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart in the Lord have multiple ways you bless yourself have multiple things you do to lift your spirit up all is theirs is about Earthly income collecting dollar bills we don't collect dollar bills we have a promise seeky first the kingdom of God and all else will be added unto you the righteous shall not beg bread the Lord know what you have need of before you ask it our Lord Our God supplieth all our needs we've got that that's not what we're after we want multiple ways that the spirit comes to us multiple in income not dollar income we want multiple things coming into our spirit multiple things coming into our heart do you have multiple things in your life are you just rolling in here on Sunday morning and getting a little tidbit of a grain that this poor preacher can whoop up and that your food you'll starve to death right no matter how in my mind I want to think I've got a great ministry I Don't Preach like a lot of people preach not my calling but you've got to have more than one food source you can't throw all your self under one Ministry and one voice and I'm not talking about going on the internet and searching for voices I'm talking about what the scripture says that's just one of them uh 1 Corinthians 14:26 how is it then Brethren when you come together every one of you have a song half a Doctrine half a tongue half a revelation half an interpretation let all things be done unto edification amen all these are sources not just in the church not when you just come together here when you come together at home when you come together at work I love it when we work out here with the brothers and they're talking about God and they're talking about this and they I love these brothers that go to these chats and they put quotes down and they're edifying one another and they're feeding one another have multiple sources of Fellowship in your heart uh Colossians 3 and16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your heart to the lord it's an atmosphere multiple sources of Christian atmosphere and finally the last two are be frugal and I'll just read the scriptures John 16:12 Proverbs 13:22 and the last great thing that they have is share Ephesians 428 Matthew 8 and10 it's freely given freely give so here's Satan the only way he could be successful and have a kingdom is pervert God's success all the things that God put in man to do to reach spiritual Heights Satan stole them and made his angels in his Satan's Eden where he's the God of this evil age and took all those people and gave them success to worship him but I say they were mine in the beginning God put in me the thirst for him God put in me the desire to be like Paul to be like Peter that's right to have my role models what I consider Stars what I consider great and I trust this morning that as long and as hard as we spoke that going forward that you will take a new focus in your life that the distractions you'll move them out of the way and you will repurpose Your Existence and your reason for living as you read in thirst the prophet of God made a statement he says it's only natural for a boy to like a girl he says that's a natural thing to fall in love let's don't take things that are natur natural and try to do away with them let's take the things that God gave us naturally and govern them by the word of God and you'll be successful be
