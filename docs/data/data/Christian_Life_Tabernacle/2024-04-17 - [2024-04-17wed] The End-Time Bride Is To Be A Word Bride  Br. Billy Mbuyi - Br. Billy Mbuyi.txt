good to be Gather in the house of God Amen I trust you're excited to be here amen U let's open our Bibles um uh we're going to open it in Zachariah we're going to read a a scripture in Zachariah 14 um let's start from verse 5 and it says and ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains for the Valley of the mountains shall reach unto AEL y ye shall flee as ye flee from before the earthquakes in the days of usza the king of Judah and the Lord my God shall come and all the saints with thee it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known of the Lord neither day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light and it shall be that in that day that Living Waters shall go out from Jerusalem half of them towards the Eastern Sea and half towards the hinder sea in the summer and in the winter shall it be and the Lord shall be king over all the Earth in that day and in that day shall there be one Lord and and his name one our gracious father we ask that you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you may have your seats just want to speak for a moment TR say we don't have a clock like we used to be so um but we're going to make sure we don't take too long and just ch as much time probably need to buy a clock and put it in the bag um just want to speak for a moment is just a thought that was was on my heart that I've been looking at and um and I want to title it for the sake of just framing our mind and and getting us into one mind uh the end time bride is to be a word bride the end time bride is to be a word bride but will speak and in Zachariah as we read it says in that day it shall be day or night neither day neither night uh but Ram says it's going to be a foggy day he calls it uh which we can understand from the description that is given in the scripture about the time that we live in it would speak about a day of confusion a day of deception where uh even things that people say don't really hold the wait you know it used to be a time where someone if someone said I'm a Christian it me something it meant something now everybody's a Christian it's just been so watered down it doesn't mean much anymore and it's a time we live in as we speak we look at the scripture I I was even thinking about it this afternoon the day of artificial intelligence what we call AI you you see a picture of someone but it's a fake person that person doesn't exist at all is a is a computer made of of someone's imagination of how they like the person to look you see a a a picture of someone online you're like and then you met the person they nothing compared to what you saw online why because everybody's fake nobody is real nothing is real everything is fake uh it says it's not so much what you claim to be to say you are because everybody can claim anything uh people that have no job experience you go online my goodness they have a resume that's filled a 100 pages and they are a CEO of a company that only him and his wife run it's it's a day that just doesn't make any sense as the scripture will say so much confusion so much uh fakeness just being projected and and the Bible will say it's a day of a fallen away where many will live even the very Faith a day where the condition of men is such uh they are so lukewarm and they're mixing and there's a day where it's hard to find something that's actually original to find people that are original that are who God made them to to be and uh people that that are satisfied with just being what they are everybody's trying to add to what they are everybody is trying to change what they are men are wanting to be women women are wanting to be men nobody is satisfi with what was in the original to begin with there's so much fakeness people really and and you look in the church realm uh it seems yet we are on Wednesday night and and you think about the numbers that was here Sunday morning you wonder where is everybody the the the the enemy it is such about with destruction and and and so much uh uh busyness of life you got to get this done you got to get that and that done and he it's so saturated there's not a moment that you you don't have anything that needs to be done every moment is occupi if you have 10 minutes there's enough to do in 10 minutes if you only have five the devil has got enough for you to do in that five minute it's the age where people have a passive attitude we would say where they they just seem to be uh uh just relaxed and there's no fervency or need and now remember the BAM speaks about they say it says what what we are waiting for it's not for God to do something more God is waiting upon you and I to get ready for the Rapture in fact it speaks about it I believe in the uh uh evangelism in the end time the end time it says the end time message is not so we can have great great campaign and have so many field the building and all of those things no the end time message and the end time evangelism is the Gathering of the stone that were predestinated the Gathering is the chipping is the the will say it's the forming of the stone that would fit the building that God has been building so we find out it's a lukewarm time and he would say the prophet will say and we know that Civilization travel from east to west the older civilization we know we have is China and it says civilization has traveled from east to west it says it's become uh uh because it follows the Sun and now we have gotten all the way to the West Coast and if we go further we'll go back again East see so we are at the end of the road so now that's something we need to be uh uh brought to at this same time that we are living in this is the end of the road there's not another age to come in fact it says one place it says if you look at civilization when it started off it came and as it was traveling all across what it did is it picks up all the scene along the path that when civilization get at the very end it's worse than when it started it said America they used to go to Europe and them and to get uh models and and and and and all the kinds of things and fashion now it's at the it's at the West that they come to find it and you find out it's the same and if you look at it it's the very type of the church yes's the church is started off on fire and everything andam says the first thing that went out was the love that they had they forgot the first love and then you come at the end time Christ is found on the outside so we are at the end we can't keep going in the same direction that we are going and it says and here is the world in its condition and there's Nation it says there's a nation and it and its condition there's a woman in its condition there's a man in its condition there's the church in its condition there's everything the elements the signs flying flying sourcers and everything in the sky and all kinds of mysterious things they says they are um sea roaring and and tide waves and men's hearts are failing and fear and perplex of time and distress between nations and churches are failing that's the world that we live in that's the condition that Zachariah is saying that it shall come a time where there will be no day it's not going to be a day or night and it's going to be a dismal day it's going to be a foggy day it's going to be all kind of time but he says but in the evening time there shall be light that day is only known of the Lord but in the evening time of that day they shall be light and butam will say in the message the Seas is not air with a shack it says the world is in Sodom condition and the church has went into Sodom with it with lot and his wife and I say there's an elected church somewhere in the world that's pulling out set aside from those things and the manifestation of God has attracted his attention we are in the last day oh I want to say I'm thankful because the manifestation of this light the manifestation that is talked about has attracted my attention I'm here because my attention has been attracted by a prophet messenger I have heard the evening I have seen the evening light I have heard the evening messenger that's why I'm sitting here tonight I'm not here by help and chance I'm not here because I wanted to be here I'm here because there's a seed word of God in my life that's calling for me to come out of the lysia come out of the things of the world come out of all those things and come unto me my people he says the Shar has given forth his strength into the seed it says they went out it was a good shock but it served its purpose see the word Bride of the word groom I like that it's just not any bride it's the word prde of the word groom if the groom is the word the bride has to be the word otherwise they cannot be a union if the bride cannot is not a full word it cannot have a union why because the the bridegroom or the bridegroom is a full word so has to be the bride and I love this in evening messenger I want you to hear this this is the prophet speaking paragraph 81 he says this is this this is repeating each time through the Bible we find out that it's in the sacred scripture all the way through that just at the ending of all of an old age that the new one comes in so now the prophet is trying to uh uh show us even when you you you you line up the ages he will say so one age will end and it's not a an Abrupt end but it says it is into another one but and then he says but in at every End of the Age the messenger doesn't come at the beginning but it comes at the end of every age so it says at every age uh we find out that a sacred scripture all the way through that at the end of the old age the new one comes in it says that age Fades out into the new age comes in and God sends a message messenger now listen to this it says and and and and as always every time that messenger comes it always comes back it always it's always a call back to the word never fails remember this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ there cannot be nothing added to it or taken from it it's a complete revelation of Jesus Christ the only way that we can ever be sure says if anything Rises Among Us that's contrary to the Revelation then it's wrong see it's back to the word and it's always calling back oh I thought about it I said in every age thank you yes God will send when when he's sending his word to his people it's always the call to come back to his word why why people fail because they walk away from the word why are we in the condition that we are in because we walked away from the word the first age walked away from the word when the messenger comes is only one thing come back to the word it's not a secret it's not magic it's the same program of God and God's word is the program of God it's always returned back to the word I want to say this this morning if you have a need to this tonight you got to come back to the word I'm sick come back to the word I I don't feel right come back to the word why because the word is the answer to everything God has never changed his program from the first CH Church age till now why he only got one program The Promised word for your age what the moment you recognize the promised age that the promised word that is given for your age the better you are off why because you would understand that in that promised word God has given everything that you have have need of amen that's good you bet slide come back to the word you need a job come back to the where what's going to save us from our challenges God has provided a word that can bring us out of those challenges so he says it's come back to the word it's back to the world is always it says is and always calling back that's the promise the promise was that there shall be light in the evening time oh my God God's way of doing things is always to send a prophet messenger we we heard it from our pastor last Sunday it said God as it's written in Amos he cannot do anything unless he Reveals His secret to his Prophet the servant the prophet and oh my I don't I don't I don't even think I have enough time to go this if we can just look at what a prophet is and what it represent we we just don't have enough time but I want to just say this what because God we chose by the way of a prophet for him to bring forth his word the prophet says this in the in the evening messenger says now God always uses a prophet aen and if you use a bunch of men you get different ideas I like that I like that you know a man can have a vision if I don't see that Vision there's two things I can do I can either argue with him and say it's not true or I can line up and just believe that God spoke to him and I'll follow there's only two way out of it so God doesn't use a group of people that's why I I I Marvel people come and they get into the message and they begin to tell you exactly how to position what the prophet said and how that the prophet changed and evolved and how that the prophet it was God that spoke to him he didn't speak to you and if there was anything that God wanted to change he was going to use that same Prophet to change it it was not going to come to you well and and let me say this it's the way of God of doing things to reveal his word to one man yes it's always been one in the day of Moses he used one man in every age God uses a man by which he would reveal himself to and let me say this when God calls that one man that man is Vindicated by God himself and and I was just thinking about it when we speak about vindication now remember the prophet tells us that the way of a true Prophet is always to remain with God's word with the word so when he he says if what speaks is the word of God then you believe him so in order for you to do that you have to have a record by which you can judge him right but now there's always there's also another way that the prophet said he would recognize a true prophet he says if what he speaks come to pass then you know he's speaking on behalf of God if what he speaks come to pass you have to say that this man is sent of God right he speaks and he says two men it says never did two major never did he have two major prophet on Earth at one time it takes one so that the other one can take its place for another day it says another messenger he never has two he has one at any time he says and the infinite God never changes his program we he says he must always stay with that stay with what he started with and the reason the and it says that's the reason we have confidence in what he says he cannot change he says if he save a man on the basis of his faith in God the next man will have to be saved the same way he stays with the word and and I in the moment just give you a moment as I'm laying my Foundation I think it's very important that the end time Bride is a word bride sure that's right and and we'll get to that in a moment it's very important so in order for God God's program to continue in the end time he has to send a prophet messenger and without and let me say this many hearers and said well I hear I don't believe he's a prophet now let me just said this when God sends a prophet it's a predestinated prophet for a predestinated people all it means is it's not your prophet he was not sent for you because only the elect remember a prophet is only sent to the elect he not sent to the whole world the whole world will hear him but some will deny some will reject him why would they deny because they don't have an instrument within themselves to receive the word of God by a prophet they think they have enough intelligence for them to open the Bible and they go go why because they they have been deceived by Lucifer they have been deceived by the devil that they can get a word without the prophet but those of the seed of God they have one understanding in fact they have been built in a way that when they hear the prophet when they hear the prophet he answers the questions in their life when they are in trouble they play the prophet he answers the question in their life when things don't go right all they need to do is hear the prophet yes and that settles everything because they know that God who spoke to that Prophet that same God is able to come and vindicate the things which you are hearing it's not because they have it figured out not because they can put two and two together they have one understanding that my heart longs to hear for this person they know within themselves that there is something that just calls for that word the more I hear it the more he just makes my life clear he makes the trouble that I'm going through just wor it everything I'm going through my the word of God just makes it worth it every time I'm in the challenge I go I read and I hear that Prophet messenger he speaks to me and I get an answer to others they'll find all kinds of errors all kinds of mistakes well he said two over here he says three over there he says five over there yeah but to the others to the elect the ears are tuned to only hear what God wants them to hear they don't see no fault they have an understanding heart everything it says makes sense to them even though they can't explain it so so the messenger this Prophet messenger that God sends is the only one responsible to calling the elect is the only one responsible in gathering ing the elect why because God knows that when he begins to sound of his message he says in in that time it says when the seventh angel messenger when he will begin to sound forth his message it says then there shall be time no more and he knows that when he begins to sound this message it's like that story that brother bam talks about the Gees they are here and when time comes for them to fly out he said all of the sudden one of them stands up all all of a sudden one of them in the group stands up and he began he says it's far away it's naturally impossible for him to know where he's going he was born there he was born there he's never been where he going but all of the sudden something rise up within him why because God is calibrating his life and God is molding him to be a leader and all of the sudden he hears the word of God and all of the sudden he's quick by the power of God and it begins to fly and all the rest of them they follow right you're like this is Perfect Insanity come on the leader doesn't know where he's going and everybody is following him why it's God's program of the nature God shows you in the nature so you can understand in the spiritual realm God is doing the same thing am true and it's only those that are predestinated to follow those will follow it's not made for everybody the message that is the prophet that that is to the prophet that a prophet has given has the food and the ingredient to call the elected people to others is foolishness to to them it's the food that their soul need it's the manner it's the fresh manner that they feed upon when they hear the word of God it satisfies the soul they hear they are in tune with the message they hear the message and it satisfies their soul why because their souls have been aligned to hear the word of God his voice answers the questions to what they have need of his voice is a satisfying voice his voice is the answer to all the trouble his voice makes more sense than anything his voice is the very word of God to the his music to their ears they want to hear it all the time why because they are a word bride because they are a word bride if they are not a word bride they'll be attracted to everything some will be attracted because of the energy in the building because of the music and the emotion and all of that but the word bride listens to that word and when they hear the word something just satisfy they come in with a burden and they go out free they come in with sin and they go out clean they come in with all kinds of stuff but they go all the burdens are lifted off why because I have heard from God I have heard from a prophet messenger let me say this the word word is the only relationship that exists between us and the prophet it's the only connecting element because we he's the word and we are the word therefore we are in relationship but whatam says this in the evening messenger paragraph 97 it says now we find out that God vindicates his word the prophets word and if he is a prophet then he's speaking according to the word it says and the Bible says in one place it says if they speak not according to the law and the prophets there's no light in them then call he says this is the messenger call out and the call out ones listen to this and the this is the messenger calls out the call out the called out ones he is right he is right by the word of God proves that is right he not proven by himself he proven by the word of God God proves that he's right I want to say this the revealing of the son of man Pam says this and specifically focusing on the time time that we live in we we understand in the scripture in Luke 17:26 to30 if we could read it quickly it says and as it was in the days of Noah it shall be and it says and it shall be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wise and they were given into marriage until the day that Noah enter into the AR so that is one of the promises one of the characteristics of the time when the son of man will come it's compared to the time of Noah and then it says and then came the flood and destroyed all and then on 28th it said likewise also as it was in the days of lot so there's the time of lot and the time of Noah that's put together for the same age for the time it says they did eat they did they drank and they bought and they sold and they planted they build it it says but the same day that lot went into uh went out of Sodom it rains fire and brimstone from heaven and Destroy them all even thus shall it be in the days when the son of man is revealed but whatam say this in paragraph 101 of the evening messenger says there's three destructions want you to follow this close one of them when Noah went into the ark the second time when lot went out of Sodom so this is parallel speaking of the scripture we just read watch Jesus referred to them as it was in the day of Noah and as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the time the in the coming of the son of man it says watch one went in the other came out and the next goes upall I want you to get that one goes in the other goes out the next goes up goes in comes out and goes up now that's the order of the Lord Jesus referred to them as two Prophet as it was in the day of Noah as it was in the days of L Abraham being the prophet and then so shall it be in in the in the in the days of the coming of the son of man see it refers back to them I want to say this we we we are the group that will go up we we we we we have we have come out of denominations we have went into Christ now it's the time to go up now we remember remember now now it was Enoch who lived at that time who went up there was those that went out and there was those that came in but that went into the ark but it was those that were promised that they will go up and I want to say this we say this there's not another age to come after us there's not another age that is to follow after us so therefore it's very important when we receive the evening messenger we have to know what was he sent to do butam says the evening message is to prepare you for Rapture the the evening message is not sent so we can go back in Pentecost the evening message is to send to move us forward yes to push us into the Rapture to push to move us to take us from this earth into the presence of God why the whole program of God is not so that he can keep people on Earth forever the main program started with God when men sin down and he came down on Earth God wanted to restore his people back into the Garden of Eden so he kept going and going and the purpose that he was working on is so that at the end he can restore people at the rightful place he says in the invisible union he says I'll skip some for the sake of time it says paragraph 10 uh 190 says and then the life that came out of denomination goes into the grain then what happened the grain began to grow paragraph 190 of the invest visible Union they began to go to get bigger and then he so he came to cover over something denomination pulled away from it he said you you said we we ain't get we ain't got a denomination out of this they never will he says it's the grain it can't go no further he says we are at the end time so what does it what what does it have to do now it says lay in the presence of the son to be ripen that's exactly he says the word to be ripened into your heart to bring forth and live what you are talking about yes sir it says then you are no longer you are you then you will have no more doubt if you let the Holy Spirit reveal it to you like the queen uh like the queen said unto about about Daniel it says so can we be thankful as Pilgrim like Abraham separate ourselves from the things of the the world and and all of our association Abraham was a pilgrim God separated God separated us from all the dead denomination I'm speaking Across the Nation now all dead Creeds and to what separate us to and open open to us a new land a new message for this day Pentecostal dried up listen to this Pentecostal dried up and die Luther Wesley and the rest of them it says no one none of it says it's no more it's no more than a bunch of of of churches pulled together God go it says good people in there but yet they've got to come out it says what did he what did he what did he do he open he opened up the Seven Seals of the last message he says you notice that the Seven Seals which all the mysteries of the seven Church Ages were sealed with the Seven Seals the reformer didn't have time to do in their days they didn't live long enough but this blessed revelation of the seven Sals it's open to us in this last day from a prophet that went forth from Arizona oh my we know where he came from we know what time that came about so we know it's in the age and the time that we are living in and let me skip a little bit for the sake of time paragraph 3:24 it says the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work in this day paragraph 12 1 124 he says the word that fail on the day of Pentecost will not work in this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride oh my God comes in this evil age a time where there's all kinds of distraction and all kinds of confusion and all the thing and the churches look warm and everything he says in the evening time there shall be light in the evening time and in revealing the light in the evening time God is gathering to himself a group of people in this lysan church ages he's moving them from a church age into the bright age he's moving them from the leadership of man into the leadership of God himself listen to this growing on he says going home of the pride he says we got something different the Pentecostal it says that the Pentecostal represented that again we are in the bright age no more it says that word of Noah would not work in the day of Moses no more than Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul here he says he tries to he tries to tell them you are dead to that and you cannot heaven right let me say this it's very important that we recognize the day and the message that we are living under so it's important as we come to church to know I'm here because I have been moved out of the denomination out of all the things of the world I have been brought into the bright age oh my in the message the anointed ones at the endend time but whatam says paragraph 160 says but remember that Pentecostal Church in the last day was that Lan and Christ was turned out and Colonel the wheat itself when he dried remember when he tried to manifest himself to the church he was taken out now remember when he got when he was taken out of the church where the church got to where they would rather enjoy what they were doing they would rather have the Spirit Fall have gifts in the church and they take away they took away the word word from the pulpit they will come and they will rejoice and say there's no need to preach because the Spirit Fall where they will come to a place where the word never had no more preeminence in them where they would not care or have a care about the word of God coming forth from the pulpit they came a time where they rejected this message was revealed to the Pentecostal remember whatam said he went to that uh h a meeting where he went and people were speaking in tongue and all of that he said God sent him to go there he came and they came and yeah they are they gathered up against the word they said we we don't have a problem with you Healing The Sick we don't have a problem with you and you know doing all the things that you are doing but the only problem we have is the things you're speaking they don't make any sense so they would rather they would rather have the gifts and the manifestation of all the things and reject the word forgetting that it's the word that produced all of those things who have you heard say that if if what I say is not the word if what I say is the word of God then let him come and vindicate it to you what was he doing he was presenting the word so by believing the word you will receive everything with it but if you receive all the other things without the word then you were under deception that's right now he says but here is the word Christ himself that's the anointed word which was which which which shall come uh for the rest of the Body for the rest of his body the bride the anointed of of the same water and now watered the wheat and we talk about also the water that water the tear anointed one he says one elected and predestinated will be able to detect the difference between them Ephesians 5 and one tell it says tells us so about about about it about what it was about how it was in the rising of the son the prophet says as Jesus paragraph 94 it says as Jesus was the first one as Jesus was the first one to raise from all the prophet and so forth it says although typed in many places he was the first fruits for those that slept in the bride coming of Christ Hallelujah in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there were be a sheave wave again in the last day now listen to this waving the sheave what was the Sheep the first one that came to maturity the first one that proved that he was wheat to prove that he was a sheave Hallelujah I'm sure you you see what I'm talking about it was the W it was it was waved over the people the first time he says the first time they came forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of the dark denomination will be a message uh to for the full maturity of the word has to turn back again into its full power being wave over the People by the same sign and wonders as he did back then let me say this why this is important God could not do this in Pentecost because Pentecost has stopped in fact it says if Pentecost has progressed then were going to be into the bride so what happened is God was moving forward with the goal of achieving a full maturity and that's why the scripture says that all that God was he poured into Christ but whatam says that in the end time he says that all that Christ was he will pour into his church why because he promised that in the last age there will be a manifestation of Christ not not just a partial a full manifestation of everything that he was why because everything that he was the bride has to be everything that Christ was the bride has to be not a different not a small portion [Applause] everything if Jesus saved the bride can save if Jesus healed the bride can heal if Jesus raised the Dead the bride can raise the dead that's why it's such a deception when people hang on to just little things or oh I just want to do this and speak in tongue and I just no God wants to fill you every fiber of your being with his own presence he wants you to be a full word bride I'm getting to my message I feel like I just need to jump in there I'm just trying to be patient a full thir bride he says I have heard but now I see he says he says the critics say why wouldn't God have mercy he could open up the Red Sea and stand and stand and let the poor Christian be beaten by lion and bird and burn and and all kinds of things and and and it just he laughed about it the poor ignoramus did did he not know except the corn of weed falling to the ground he abides alone it says and he dies and he die and and and and and dies through those ages those Dark Ages like one of the Corn of wheat that went underneath the Earth and to be buried to bring forth the First Reform Reformation of the two blades Luther and the and the star and it was to come forth in the West Land it says out yonder to bring forth the pollen and the tassel and and the great missionary age and it was to come forth in the Pentecostal for the restoration of the gift he says almost to deceive the very elect look like a wheat again he's speaking about the Pentecostal the last the very closest look like the wheat grain open it up it says there's no wheat you open it up there's no wheat in there at all it's only a shock but back it says but back there then they begin to reform to form the Oneness organization the trinitarian the Trinity organization the tunist organization the Church of God organization and the organ and they all organized and and just just death exactly and now what happened but it's sheltered for the wheat but it's but it's a shelter for the wheat it's been growing through all through it all that time now listen it's began to pull away the wheat begin to see to be seen this is not the Pentecostal age this this is the latter day age this is the bright age this is the evening light this is when malachite 4 must be fulfilled to grow God's pattern of Luke this is Luke 17:30 to be fulfilled this is the second and Jeremiah and and all the rest of them that Joel has spoke of these days this is that day I have heard of the Lord I was it says and he was coming but now I see with my eyes what are you seeing with your eyes what are you seeing with your eyes tonight are you just seeing a bunch of people that's gathered and and they just come to rejoice and then go back home and do the same things over and over are you seeing a bunch of backslide and people that don't believe the message and uh come on people that coming day in and day out to they are not changing all of those things no let me say this in the midst of all of this God is bringing forth the promise of restoration and the promise of restoration remember God says to restore is to bring in its original state Amen to restore is not to exchange to restore is not to replace to restore is the man the same man that fall in the Garden of Eden God in the end time message is here to Resto that man to bring him in that same Authority that he had in the beginning that's right that's what the end time messages come to do don't sell yourself short of anything whatever God was you are today whatever Adam was you are today why because it has to be a full word not a partial word a full word manifestation what Jesus was we are [Applause] today but yet we are and our hearts are turned towards how am I going to pay my bills and now did Jesus Wonder or have times where difficulties arose yeah if you go read they came a time where they needed to pay taxes but whatam says there came a time where he came and he had a headache he had to go rest and and he got tired he had to sit and but he didn't rely on his Man part to solve his trouble he didn't rely on that body that got tired he knew knew that he was predestinated to be there to lay his life down he knew the purpose that he was sent for he knew that he was there to fulfill God's word that part of the word that was given for him to bring to pass and let me say this it's not different than you sitting here tonight the problem is we rely on our men part our intellect and our abilities when God is wanting us to rely on what he's made us to be am but what I'm says in in in in uh perfect faith it says he relied on what God made him to be he RI on the word that was made him to be he believe he was the word and he rely on what the word was supposed to do at that time he says can't we also rely on what God has made us to be he's not made us to go work for Pharaoh every day he's not made us to go and rely on the economy of pharaoh he's made us to be people that can bring them the kingdom people that can pray and things will happen and people when they find difficulties can say I'm a child of God and things will happen I I was thinking about butam talks about the story the story of the slave from Africa and I I just thought about it so hard and and yeah he was and and perhaps you will find yourself in a similar situation or worse and I want you to imagine that he had things he couldn't do perhaps you know lack of certain abilities and I don't imagine was the strongest of the bunch I don't imagine because I think when we think about that story we make him like stronger we make him perfect in every way but there was something a characteristic about him that the prophet mentioned is that he did the best that he knew how to don't you to think about that I don't believe every Rock that was big that they asked him to makeig it was able to pick it up but he had a connection somewhere there it is where he was he knew PR says that he knew that where they came from that his father was a king and he said he relied on that that was the source of his strength in a situation that he would find himself if he find himself he couldn't do anything if he find himself he was weak or if he find himself at work and he was so tired he couldn't even lift up his hand he reminded himself who's your father where did he come from how did you get here yeah I'm a slave but I don't forget where I come from so just the reminding of him of where he came from give him the strength to do whatever was before him and that's what attracted the Master's attention sometimes we feel like we got to be perfect in every way to no just remember who you are you sick just remember who you are you don't have a job just remember who you are if you remember who you are and you have a connection with your father something will rise up within your heart and you say I've had enough of this I can stay this way even let me say this if the prodal son could remember where he came from and remember that in my father's house if the prodical son just the memory of where he came from was enough for him to stand up and walk away how much more we in whatever circumstance you find yourself tonight just stand up and walk away just speak the word and say my father can do this there's nothing too big for him there's no challenge too great for him you whatever circumstance I find myself yes sir if I can't do it my father will do it for me if I don't have food my father will give me food if I can't have this my father will give it to me that's your word connection that's what makes you the word bride I I think I'm running out of time I'll just say it oh word bride butam said that when we recognize who we are right we'll become an invincible Army true but Ram also said that the bride under her Messenger will be the final voice to the final AIDS but all of that comes by the word yes sure it it's not because we dream ourselves big and we go and we sing loud like the armies of bail and then we think we're going to become the no it's the obedience to the word that takes us to that place in other words the word is the only let me say this the only weapon yes come on that actually makes you an invincible Army by taking the word you are becoming an invincible Army by walking away from the the word you are walking away from being an invincible Army think of that we go and we take our own understanding and we drum it up and we think oh now we are an invincible Army no it can only be by the word why because the word is the only thing that never fails if God spoke it it will come to pass so our protection is to be behind the word yes we have to eat it we have to drink it we have to talk it we have to sleep on it we have to do everything by it why would the prophet said never have a negative thought never speak negative never do all of that because by doing that you are giving yourself to negativity and therefore you are being defeated why would he say always be positive always speak the word it says the word is near thee even in thy mouth but guess what it feels good to complain think about that so it feels good to weaken yourself uh it feels good to belittle yourself I'm no good I can't do this I'm too sick I'm to that I'm to this what says I'm happy I'm glad I have God in my heart everything is well listen that woman when she came to Elijah she had a lot to complain about she had a lot to complain about but when he asked him it says all is well [Applause] the word we become an invincible Army by partaking of the word if John is the type of the Bride then we have to be the bride itself that eats of the word we have the bride that loves the word we have to fell in love with th this word is us this is not sometimes I think our approach is oh I'm going to go and read and and find things I never heard before you're not doing yourself a favor come on I would rather read one chapter and live the rest of my life to make sure I become that chapter it's it's your book it's your message you eat it you become it amen when you go out you say I want the author of this word who called me to be an overcomer who called me to be an invincible Army who called me to stand against the army of the Satan who called me to cast out demons who's called me to manifest his very life to this generation who's called me to be the very representation of who is who he is to this world I want him to make his word true but what says if Jesus came by the word of the Prophet The Bride will come by the same because the same word that calls for Jesus the same word is called for the bride it's no different if the musician could come we'll continue another time and this becomes important because remember only the word bride will go in the Rapture only a word bride our emotions are not going to get get us in the Rapture our singing is not going to get us in the Rapture though we love to sing and we could jump up and down that's not the requirement for the Rapture right we can do all that we want to do but it's not until we become the word we take our position in the word the position that the word has given us remember we didn't give ourselves this position the word has called us to be this only when we do that we'll become an invisible Army but whatam says this year is the most evidence evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of God in his ins son was by indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works that is exactly what we have been teaching all along when the rde will get back to being a word bride Hallelujah I I read it and it just ringed different when the bride when the bride will get back to being a word bride I realize there's something we need to do there's something we need to pay attention to we don't come to just jump oh I'm save I'm I'm called to be part of the Bride yeah we everything we talked about is true but it's only by the word that we enter in is only by Believing by the word being a word bright meaning I recognize what the word is saying about me and I'm staying in the presence of that word so I can mature to what that word has called for me to be not my enthusiasm by being a word bride again she will produce the very works that Jesus produced the word the word is God the spirit is God they are all one one cannot work apart from the other if one has truly the spirit of God he will have the word of God that is how it will be it will be it will that how it was with the prophet he says they had the indwelling spirit of God and the word came to them this is how it was with Jesus Christ in him was the spirit without measure and the word came to him Jesus both began to do and teach my Doctrine is not my own but the father that sent me it says in another places out now let us go on a step but before we do let us review our case thus far first we must all know more we must know more assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election it was purposed in himself that he was going to purpose to bring forth a people liken unto himself the purpose of God was to reproduce himself it's not so we can just come and say praise God for what you've done no but when I'm Compares it says the idols of the word of the world is those that they have statue where man has to constantly come and pray to and offer sacrifice and do works for the for the God so that God can bless him but says but the god that we serve when he comes to you he says he makes you and I Idol what does he do he he takes himself and he dwells within the worshiper himself hallelujah what kind of God do we serve it if you pray to him tonight if you believe him tonight if you believe his word tonight what it does for you is not just send you what you have need of and say Yes healing yes that no at the end he himself he himself let me say this he's the same in power he's the same in substance he's the same in everything he's the same in attribute he himself he comes and he becomes one with the very worshipper tell me another another God that can do that tell me another one that I can go worship that does that we are such a privileged people we are such a privileged people oh if we can only come to that understanding he he tonight not another night tonight within your heart you can raise your hand and say Lord I believe your word I want the manifestation of your word your word is life to me he will come he will come according to the scriptures according to the promise of your time let me say this if you've walked along and it doesn't work I invite you to take the seed of the word tonight and plant it into your heart and say God I heard your word and I'm planting your seed in my heart and I want you to take that word and let it just bring forth into my heart whatever you have need of he will give it to you why because that's the kind of God We Serve by predestination he predestinated before you came the prophet was predestinated the people that is calling forth are predestinated all we doing is coming together according to that great manifestation that he had purpose within himself yes why you believe because you were predestinated to believe that's it why you sitting here trust me it's not by accident it's not because you said well I have to go no outside of all of those things there's a seed of manifestation a seed of predestination playing a role somewhere why because because if God predestinated a bride to be here there has to be a bride nothing can stop it so I say let's go back to being a word bride again God bless you let us [Applause] stand amen amen am man if you have a need upon your heart tonight and I know you do I just want you to think about these few words that we just shared and I hope they have a meaning in your heart and that you would understand the Beauty and the importance of the word and wonder what what role does it play in my life am I just want that would come and hear a portion of a sermon and and be satisfying it or am I actually going and creating my own relationship with the word and and want that word to become personal to me and it's that your heart desire why don't you just lift your hand to him as we pray our gracious father you are so wonderful to us Lord where would we go oh where would we be if it was not for Grace Lord Lord we pray tonight that for the uplifted hand oh God and may you come and minister to each one oh Father and Lord they have heard your word and they have believed and you promise to come behind your word and make it a reality in our heart and we pray tonight father let us not go the same way we came in and but father let a portion of your word and a part of yourself be added unto us father that we may be fortified that we may be renewed oh God and to go out and ready to fight the battle Lord and the battles of life and to know that we are made into your image that we are made to be Sons and Daughters of God lord we ask that you just remember oh God and the needs in the church and father all the requested we know our father we pray Lord we need your manifestations in our life and we pray father that the reality of your promises in your word let it be made known unto us Lord forgive us our shortcomings and our failings and the things that we have done and said that's not pleasing to you Lord we pray that you wash us from the blood of your son Jesus Christ and bring us into that place Lord where we care about nothing but what you said where we stand on nothing else but what you said oh God we love you when we commit what we are father and we ask this things from our heart in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen let's just sing now give me your hand oh and let's agree together oh that all of our oh we crumble at your feet [Music] ohw [Music] Jesus oh we've got the power in the name of Jesus we got the [Applause] power in the name [Music] the we got the power in the name of the Lord for many years now for many years [Music] The [Music] Jive oh mighty we [Music] all every B of the Lord our side oh we got the power in the name of Jesus we got the power in the of the oh we power in the of the oh my wasn't that wonderful well you ought to be rejoicing all in your heart for

the world's all confused hey they they're trying to be something they're not they're all mixed up and confused and you know it struck me as he was speaking I I I I got to think about one of the tactics in maybe war or or they throw what they call a flashbangs or percussion grenades and it disorients the people I maybe you came in disoriented this evening you forgot who you were you forgot where you came from but I love how he started to talk about that story of the slave is he wasn't disoriented if anybody had a reason to be disoriented it was him he had been captive he'd been taken a slave he was away far from his country but even though he was in that condition he was I'm a son of a king I'm a son of a king and I got that I just struck my heart I was rejoicing over there because here everybody's confused and trying to be something they're not and never can be they want to be some athlete they want to be some movie star they want to be this or that and then God sends a message and starts to tell you who you are the great Jehovah eagle flew over your Barnard and we're not aspiring to be something worldly he said but you are that bride you are that word bride that I've called and predes well I'm happy if came in a little disoriented maybe you need prayer maybe you feel like you just can't shake and I said don't leave don't leave in that you don't have to leave the same
