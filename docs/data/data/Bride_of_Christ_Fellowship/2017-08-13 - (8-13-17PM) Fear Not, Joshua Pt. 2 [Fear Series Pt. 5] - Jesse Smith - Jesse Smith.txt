[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] arching daddy loves you raised alone let's take our Bibles tonight by God's grace he meant so thankful for God's love life - book of Joshua I think I'll just continue on this very good I've never seen that I want to get out gracious Lord let's go to if we can joshua 8:1 that's going to reach Josh but we'll reach a little more on the background of this but if you remember I Chapter seven Joshua had just dealt with the sin of akin basically put him out of the church like the Bible says and God had judge akin as you remember and so now they're going to they'd already lost to a I write because they can sit and now God is encouraging Joshua Joshua got a little scared after that first defeat got a little scared like we're talking about the spirit of fear but in Joshua he won the Lord encourages him again this is the second time God tells him don't fear Joshua need one let's read that together one two three and the Lord said unto joshua fear not neither eat out the same take all the people for with thee and arise and go up to a i see i got given into the and the king of AI and his beautiful had a city that's fair never need on your hearts make an alert to God here only father you see the hands Lord you see the needs of the people thank you for this opportunity to again be in your house the Lord I see as my personal revelation Lord that Lord you said gather mowers you see that day approaches Lord God that's where I see Sunday night services Lord it's an opportunity for us to gather more lord I just pray you to take this time bless it Lord for that Kingdom Lord we see that Day approaching on where we see it approaching steadily we see the US and Israel and everything that's going on distress of nations men's hearts failing them for fear but yet we see the Word of God and Lord we're looking at the promise today we're not looking at the inhabitants of the land we're looking at the promise of God so Lord strengthen us here tonight North I know you will father our faith is in you our trust is in you encourage us in thy word Lord and help us to be just like Joshua you said if you're not Joshua don't be dismayed take courage where we take courage tonight speak just through thy word help me to heal myself to you in Jesus Christ's name all reset a mess you didn't seem crazy we'll try to be just about our okay so we got our scripture there so I'm just gonna call this fear not Joshua party to the Lord I want to just give a quick overview of the book of Joshua so we can kind of understand the setting a little bit and then we'll look at those three times Scott go Joshua to not be afraid and look at the context of each one so we opened the Joshua here by the grace of the Lord and Joshua chapter 1 we read a little bit about that but Joshua was commissioned in Chapter 1 we know Josh she was a new Moses right he said as I was with Moses so I'll be with you so God was raising up another Moses a man like in the very ministry of Moses he said as I was with Moses I'm gonna be with you the same anointing was with Moses I'm gonna be with you as well amen and no man said this about Joshua and as Moses he said now Joshua and all his knowing that the command was great his command was great remember to take all these seven nations who spread his rough but having the assurance he could be fearless so when God told him I'm with you be strong very courageous the Prophet said Joshua could be fearless Amen so we can be fearless tonight too he could be and this is program saying and we call it reckless as long as he was pointed the right way he might break up against the hill that would not get backwards when he was headed the right way look at that reckless in other words he could be fully persuaded he was going in the right direction do you feel that way that's the kind of Liberty we want in our lives well I know I'm going the right direction I know God called me to be a pastor I don't God taught me to be a father all these things I just want to feel reckless like I've got the Word of God I'm doing exactly what God called me to do he was reckless because God had told him I'm with you and told exactly what to do he says it again he said now so in the church let me god be reckless and fearless aren't you glad you could be fearless Church in faith if we're pointed the right way for he said as I was with Moses I'll be with you I'll not fail you nor forsake you he never forsaken Moses he never failed Moses he will not fail Joshua he will not fail us you'll be with us amen and as we find Joshua mission knowing the responsibilities was leading them through lands now and that he'd have to go over into the other land he'd have to set up the kingdom he'd have to divide inheritance among them now here's the point I mentioned on Wednesday look tremendous quote he know the Commission was tremendous far more than what Moses had done did you ever know that Joshua's commission was greater than even Moses's Commission momenta Joshua had more to do that Moses had to do my stress that is a striking God Moses did the plagues right Moses did the Passover he brought them out of Egypt brought them through the Red Sea which remember brother Graham said the Red Sea was the red blood of Jesus Christ for us that's why it's called the Red Sea I'm gonna BAM said all of our sins and taxmasters we're drowning the blood of Jesus Christ amen so there's Calvary in this picture we know the promised land we were looking at the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost but there's Calvary that read see that blood Red Sea hey man ha there you go thank God for that but he was he was taking them out of Egypt to the promised land but bromantic said Joshua's Commission was greater he said that he had more to do yet to take them in drive out the inhabitants and then place them positionally amen so that's quite a statement there I want to make sure I read that here by the grace of God does that deals with chapter 1 he could be fearless and you and I could be fearless you can be fearless on a Sunday night praise the Lord you can be fearless here tonight there's nothing to fear there's nothing to be afraid of God is with us we're pointing the right direction we're pointing right where the word tells us to good day then we got to have that same fate praise God now chapter 2 as the chapter of Rahab and the spies were very familiar with that of course a habit you know her history she married a a general of the Israelite army and then brought forth Obed and bo hats right and Boaz brought forth I think it was him through Oh bad I got a mixed up but out of all as soon as she came Jesse Jesse come David praise God a David come Solomon and you take it all the way down and here comes the Lord Jesus Christ out of the genealogy of Rahab the harlot and Romansh dramatized and he said this might not be scriptural but he said let's say that as parents were paralyzed or sick and she had to sell her body in order to provide for her family knew was wrong the whole time to sell out her morals and God looked at that condition and had mercy upon her but even in the midst of that God knew Rahab was a real believer so God sent the spies to Rahab praise the Lord God numbered the footsteps of the righteous are ordered to the Lord God knew which house they had to be at peace amen I knew which house those two spies had to go and praise the Lord and members she would live which was striking to she lied he said I don't know where they are they went northward and they were up their honor on your road right hiding under the flax of the plants I forgot what it was exactly hiding under there she even lied and somehow Oh God must have forgave that but that's chapter 2 and member the Scarlet thread and and brother Ralph said that's what we must do as well all those who can be saved we must get them in the house everyone who is in Rahab's house would be saved in the prophecy we must do the same thing we must get them under the token amen I'm gonna leave you oh you're still praying for your loved ones I'm gonna leave and support to pray for them God bring them into the house God bring them in the house bring them under the red token the red Corps so that they might be saved I don't want to see my family destroyed with the the heathens of this world that's right chapter three they pass over into Jordan and brother Branham said to see they put the word first God told Joshua sanctify yourselves people to sanctify themselves let the art go out first the people I love the ark let the word go first he said don't get ahead of the Ark but follow the ark how many follow the art today we can't get ahead of the word we can't try to interpret the word ourselves we got to stay behind the word and stay in our position amen no not the word interpret stuff let the word go out before you believe the word but let the word go don't try to get ahead of the word and break things the pass he said that's how you cross over into the promised land and chapter four they give the two memorials I forgot one I think I forgot what I want to go over just a moment here I missed the I missed the capture the Lord host what chapter is a didn't I miss dead I'm sorry anybody see that that's one thing I forgot to look up I got a good quote on that oh they're just yeah chapter five all right yeah so there it is brings a little sorry about that reading chapter four they dug two memorials they've done a stack of stones outside of the waters and then they build a stack of stones right in the middle of the waters and you remember what that was for that was for the children of Israel when they would grow up and they say daddy why are all those 12 huge stones in the midst of Jordan and God told them to answer this is because the Lord brought us through the river Jordan it was set up as from memorial that the children would know the power of God amen they and we must keep the memorials going that's what I like to hear the testimonies like brother Jose's last week you need we keep needing to testify to though we'll tell what God has done never forget what God has done God literally command them set up the memorials don't forget what I've done tell everybody about what I've done that should be not discouraged as you remember that I'm the same yesterday today and forever amen chapter 5 is the new generation gets circumcised so as soon as they cross over the Jordan River soon as they die to themselves and get the baptism all the ghosts they get circumcised and we know that's cutting off the excess flesh cutting off all the desires of the flesh crucify the flesh we'd say right the new generation and the Bible said that was the reproach of Egypt right living a fleshly life living in the world living in the things of the world being circumcised was getting the reproach of your past life cut off from you grace not in men so glad he does that evening and then at the end of chapter 5 Joshua meets the captive the host and I think it's wonderful in verse 13 Joshua says are now with us or for our adversaries did you notice his response do you notice what the angel the Lord said things old the Lord doesn't say yeah I'm with you he says nay he says nay but as Captain to the host of Lord am I now coming what does that show us Church it shows that that God's not doing this for our glory God's doing this for his glory praise the Lord he tells Joshua no I'm not for you or them I forgot hey then and you gotta follow me crazy moment and you gotta follow the true captain of this army which we know is the angel the Lord praise God amen I think that's so striking there see there that's not like God loves us so much but Adam we're not so much better than anybody else that he'll he's for us because we're better he's for his word amen and he doesn't risk use now the respecter of persons he doesn't love our church more than any other Church he's for his own will in his way and we've got to follow his villain way we're not better than anybody else he said no Joshua I'm not on your side I'm on God's side I forgot I'm God's Cathy you must follow me I think that's important notes you church I think that's important but as for the same thing he said Joshua draw a sword and sell you with us or for them he said in faith 1953 he said nay but I'm the captain of the hosts of the Lord he said yes sir hey out of them again he wasn't free he was a picking size he wasn't doing favours he was for the plan of God amen we're thankful for that praise the Lord so that was chapter 5 I want to make sure I get to that in chapter 5 chapter 6 these are the battles with the Canaanites the first battle chapter 6 was the conquest of Jericho you remember that of course they walked around seven times each day I'm sorry six times and on the seventh day they walked around seven times right and they had to hold in the silence that very it's a very passive victory we'd say not didn't give them that much to do there wasn't much fighting all's that had to do is silently keep walking with the Word of God this was going to be a victory where they didn't have much to do I noticed God gives different types of victories that he kept did you catch that in Josh but some victories you just sit and praise God and you're just quiet all the time and other victories you're out there fighting with the sword grace you're out there on the frontlines fighting with the sword witness to that there's times God has done the whole thing and all you've done is sat back and watch them do it praise God you just step back and praise to them give Him glory another different situation with the church and other things where I felt like I didn't have to do anything I just sat back and gave it time and God did all of it amen like problems and situations and God worked it all up but there's other times I had to get right there on the front lines of Matt a little bit deal with people individually Greek scriptures and try to bring correction and things like that Omar talk to be going up you say don't come to church or you know things like that you're not welcome until you repented this or that there's time you had to get it right there and fight at the very front of the battle and other times the victory so passive so what do we need the leadership of the Holy Spirit man they did and Josh was learning this he's learning not to fear trust God every battle might be different so he must follow the will of God for each battle and that's what this teaches us in chapter 6 the conquest of Jericho is a very silent victory if Mary wasn't there wasn't a lot going on it was just walking in praise right just walking with the glory of God ain't it now chapter seven is a sin of Aitkin 36 men die in verse 5 36 minute and Joshua about loses the church what did you you just told the walls fall down with your first battle the next battle 36 men died and you're running away but you know God told you no man will stand before you all the days of your life and so what do they do they would repent into sackcloth and ashes and look what look what look what Joshua said in verse 7 look at verse 7 Joshua has the same kind of can I say it like this doubt he has the same type of complaint that they had in the wilderness watch for seven look versa see when fear gets upon us we start complaining like like they did the winners like when we were in centrifugation right sometimes serves things come out of our mouths that were so kind of surprised to hear our own self say right we revert back to what we used to say look at verse 7 this is powerful and Joshua said alas o Lord God wherefore hast thou at all brought those people over order to deliver us in the hand the amorite and destroy us look what he's saying this is the same thing they said and you brought us in the water so we die of thirst look Joshua is shouting the same way that in the looters but what it was just a moment of weakness and you say amen to that those other people that died the voters that was their whole character but Joshua was just he had a moment of weakness he's a born-again believer he's in the promised land and one defeat one defeat really discourages him he gets a little discouraged brother bed and he starts talking like they used to talk out denomination say like that you understand I just used to talk like they they were they were more worldly out in the world out in the desert you know talk like those other church members he wasn't talking like a real son of God Amen now look what happens look what he says I think this is striking would to god we been contented well the other side of Jordan by now he's nobody's like reverting back to what he used to say before he was born again alright never why do we even press through to the Holy Ghost why didn't even pray and fast why did he even do this if we're just going to get destroyed he lost his he's like he fell a little bit on his face nobody see that he got discouraged he got weak the Bible says that's right but look what the Lord says birthday oh lord what shall I say when Israel turned their backs before their enemies he says verse 9 for the Canaanites and all that happens the land shall hear of it and shout and Biron us around and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do into the great name look at the Lord says look at the Lord look how look how straight God is with Joshua the same way he was with Moses verse 10 and the Lord said to Joshua get the ax wherefore liest thou upon that face that remind gift when Moses said and he cried out to God remember the Lord your lettuce died why have you brought us here to the Red Sea and he said why he cried unto me speak to the turn of Israel and go forward amen and he just lost his vision for a moment he just got weak for a moment and God has gotta correct him said get off your face there's any time to get on your face this is time to search the church and get him cleaned out and move forward amen see God doesn't want us to wallow around right wall around your mistake look this mistake was a lot around Burton love God got him up off his face got it cleaned up and started moving forward again hey Ben don't you like that bad but you like that army this is the army of the Living God amen Oh hallelujah praise the Lord I hope you like that amen God encourages them he just says a verse 11 that Israel sin they transgress my covenant and he says I got search and go through the land cannot be a curse stick amen alright now verse enough sorry man let's get the rest of chapter 7 you know that all his girl stones with stones the Bible said they burned them with fired their families it's quite an awful picture but that shows what we should do is sit in our lives right yeah the Holy Spirit the Bible said God is a consuming fire let God let his fire consume all your lusts or your desires I don't mind up with the Word of God let him burn up that lust exactly right it was lust to be like Babylon in the garments you know all these gold wedges and all these things all these gold fancy things like we're talking like we're preaching about amen go get concerned with those now verse 1 of chapter 8 that was our text so immediately after this they've got the sin taking care of the sin is confessed and now God said the second time he said be not afraid that was our text tonight be not afraid if you're not so Joshua got to the spot where he's a little fearful he's crying out so the Lord wish maybe we shouldn't even cover though the promised land maybe we should have not pressing the backs of the Holy Ghost if we're going to just be defeated they take care of the city but that God has to courage him and say don't fear there's nothing to be afraid of I'm with you and notice he says verse 2 and now shopping to a I to her King as now gets under Jericho and hurricane only the squirrel thereof in the calendar shall I take for a prey unto yourself lady an ambush for the city behind it okay now in chapter 8 he finishes off AI which AI was a great land about it was a great mighty land and they get the victory at AI that's the second you call them fear no chapter knife you have your Bible chapter 9 is the lead with the Gibeonites now this is where the Gibeonites memorably where they hid ice if I'm not mistaken my mistake just a minute right does anybody remember I can't remember sorry it's the third one I would start at the fourth one I went down forgive me hey bite with the lead the hip is raptured the Gibeonites so here we see a picture in Chapter 9 forgive me I had them better memorize this morning chapter 9 is that unites the member Gideon's was a huge city even greater than AI in chapter 10 verse 2 tells us that but look at chapter 9 let's just look at a few scriptures in chapter 9 now look at verse 15 and the men took of their victuals and ash not counsel at the mouth of the Lord look at this Joshua listens to their plea they say oh no we're not we're not from his land iversity let's make make a league with us then he don't kill us and they didn't even ask the Lord didn't ask the Lord oh we should pray every day then we should pray and ask God what's your will for them the next step what is your will so once this is the one mark I think I can fight against Josh with anybody think about the others I can't think of any other marks against Joshua I have secant but if you can't let me know I like to know because he's such a beautiful type of the Holy Spirit such a beautiful type of Christ and brother branham which love em said right so look at he says here they didn't ask counsel the Lord that sounds just like David David was on a he was an invincible man admits Volare by the Holy Spirit till he stopped and didn't ask God about Bathsheba remember God said had you asked me from actually but I might have done something right I might have answered your requests or something like that but he didn't ask the Lord oh my god help us to ask the Lord for everything Amen verse 15 and Joshua made peace with them and made a leave with them let them live in the prints of the congregation the Bible said swear unto dead remember they were not supposed to make any leave with anybody that's Deuteronomy 7 - and you're Josh no forgot to pray about it remember you just got discouraged Mike start talking like a sanctified person let's go back you know let's go back to God we came to the promised land you know and then God says fear not they get a great victory but the next step you just made one mistake he didn't pray about the Gibeonites and so the Hittites make a league with him now I want to show you the scripture where they find out because it's three days later yeah verse 16 and it came to pass at the end of the three days after they made a leave with them that they heard that they were their neighbors and that they dwelt among them and then they get upset with themselves now Church did you did you notice this I don't know but you read through this lately but Israel cannot change their work Joshua cannot go back and undo this lead he can't break the Covenant because he said I give this covenant in the name of the Lord in church of we give somebody a promise in the name of the Lord or we promise something you never take it back did you make a vow the Bible said make sure you pay it defer not to pay your vow and all of Israel says well we can't change it now we've got to live with this we're just going to make them our servants so the Bible said lift out of verse 27 and Joshua made them that day hewers of wood that became cutters of wood and drawers of water for the entire congregation and for the altar the Lord even unto this day in the place where he should choose so Joshua says fine I can't take back my word but you're gonna cut all the trees for us you're gonna bring all the Potters to us these are the Hittites right the Hittites and remember him I've typed out friendship with the world see they made friends they should not have made friends and the Bible also calls that you know it all for your spiritual adultery spiritual fornication they have this friendship that they should not have had right oh my church we see that a lot with relationships you know you'll see people coming to message them though they'll get involved with somebody's not a believer right and then they'll pretty soon that relationship will pull them away or we've seen this a lot lately two people are married and they say there are believers but then one of them will start out the message and then they'll start pulling the other one away you know that and they have that French if they have that association where they choose friendship with the world more than friendship with the Word of God and that's the him I that must be driven out but this is the one where Joshua failed he made a mistake he wasn't supposed to do that now chapter 10 let's go to chapter 10 I'm almost to the spot I want to go to chapter 11 church and then I want to go back over those seven of seven nations briefly and I want to read the scriptures how that explaining the types that overcome it and I feel pretty good about this and I feel like I've caught up pretty good about the grace Lord okay yeah so Josh looked at not okay so here's the third and final time God has to tell Joshua don't don't fear so go to verse 8 chapter 10 verse 8 now let me bring you up to speed on verses 1 to 7 all these nations I'm sorry there's there's five kings of the am rights start hearing how a I was defeated and so they say we're working that their hearts are melting the Bible said they say we got to get in one league and we gotta fight against Joshua so we'll come to Gideon and we'll have a five-fold kind of battle a union against Joshua and we'll destroy them ahead to November the Gibeonites were greater than Israel every nation was already greater than Israel so now they got five nations greater greater than that coming against them they got five nations already greater than them coming against them I can't imagine that you and I we can imagine that and they're all gathered up at verse 8 let's read it together 1 2 3 and the Lord said unto joshua beer mem not for i have delivered them into thy hand there shall not a man of them stand before the hay then so get the picture there around the gibbet which member was right in Jerusalem and Joshua gets word that 8 kings and all my kings have gathered around so they're surrounded there I'm sorry I'm not sure that they're surrounded let me take that back there's something somewhere around there there's some wherever on the Gibeonites but look at verse look at verse 9 God is Joshua a secret way to to attack them verse 9 Joshua never came up unto them suddenly and went up from yoga all night so he does a night attack right a surprise attack when the enemy's not expecting it God brings Joshua with the power of the Holy Spirit amen but they're at least expecting it when the other B comes in like a flood the Spirit of God raises Haman and are then you might have a great battle in front of you but watch God you'll bleed you took the right time and season to get victory over that great head man 5 ever-ripe Kings oh let me see what the hammer is Burgundy's I keep forgetting these I had them good this morning okay that was the fleshy lusts that war against the soul these fleshly habits and addictions right there was five kings that type out these fleshy addictions so there was a great fleshly lusts you know habits there and God sent Josh with the power of the Spirit and suddenly took them over amen glory and he slew east lose them with a great slaughter and the Bible said even cast greatest in verse 11 cast down great stones from heaven upon them so there were more that died with hailstones than they whom the turn of Israel slew with the sword so really it was a very very easy battle they had to kill a few people had a little bit of fighting themselves what God did most of it by great stones by great revelations I don't think so it is a revelation ain't that upon this rock I'll build my church amen Church and that honestly is my testimony think of all think of yours think of all your fleshly dishes I could go I could name some really awful things I was addicted to but when the revelation of this word came it came so probably just the revelation of these stones that they just started pulling off one after another no one ever begged me know that the preach I've either quit smoking and all these things like that and chewing and then the evil movies all these things by the grace of God with these great stones came it was a mighty victory amen I didn't have too much of a fight it was God's doing it for me I didn't say amen to that these are flesh you love these are amirite Kings 5 of them 5 great fleshly habits that God knocks out so I said suddenly a mad sudden victory praise God can you relate to that have you had a time where God gave you great sudden victory over numerous enemies numerous addictions praise God I hope you can and if not the praise the Lord God give you victory some other way amen because you're sitting here tonight in the house of God hallelujah thank you Jesus so thankful yes I'd love to see myself in the Word of God I notice you mama just you had something like that happen to you crazy done you can see yourself as Joshua praise God because you got the victory hey so that's where five of the hemorrhoids Kings were destroyed that's chapter 10 and that's the last time got us to tell Joshua don't fear that's the last time truth he's already told three times and that's the last time he's gonna do it now if you know the story those five kings were caught in a cave remember that so they went and killed everybody you know all those soldiers they come back to the cave and here they roll back the stone from the cave look there's got to be a type in there of the Resurrection cell now I don't know I haven't caught that one yet but hang on maybe they will get it but they roll the stone away and out set these five kings and Joshua says this in verse 24 and it came to pass when they brought out those teens of the Joshua that Joshua called for all the men in Israel and said the captains of the war which went with him come near put your feet up on the necks of these kings and they came here and put their feet on next these pigs and Joshua send them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against whom youth fight and they got slew right after that so did you catch that at this moment now Joshua's not the one who's being told to stop fearing now Joshua is the one saying to the people don't fear amen he's matured so much spiritual that now God does have a stomachache no fear Tasha but we discouraged he's now so seem so much victory in his life that now he's the ones other people don't fear look at these enemies fall before you we're gonna keep going we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus amen if these five himself what about the rest so that's all about this now Josh was the one said what the father said praise the Lord that's what we have to God was God wants us as sons and daughters to saying what he already said he Laurie thank you Jesus he's saying what God said they meant he's confessing the Word of God I love that so he gonna find that that's in the scripture there he's repeating what God told him be strong and of good courage will overcome the rest of the enemies praise God amen now chapter 10 also you remember was the time where Josh would need a little more time to fight and he spoke to the Sun and the Sun Stood Still praise God right in there so he used the spoken word and did a paradox for the grander center he spoke the Word of God the Sun Stood Still not explained that scientifically how the Sun stands I don't know I can't explain that but we don't have to praise the Lord right the Bible says that and he speaks the word and eat a little more time for the Emiratis and God gave them that and God will give us a little more time as well amen now chapter 11 this is where I'm gonna start moving to get ready to go back to the 7 here this is the last thing I'm gonna really say chapter 11 is this is chapters called the final conquest of Canaan and remember this is after many years so let's go to Joshua 11 so you can see this that some of these battles are spread out over many years this is all that happened in one year like the Bible said God didn't give Joshua you know a victory right away over everybody he had to fight year after year after year look at verse ad Joshua made war a long time with all of those kings you see we're getting a picture here where these battles are told but these are just the highlights of the many battles that he fought right because number chapter 12 he lists 31 Kings that he and Moses off slew 31 you can you can count about chapter 12 is like the Train on the Lord's robe you know remember the train filled the temple and the longer your train was was the more victory she had on your on your road there under training and that's what chapter 12 is like it's the roll call of all God's victories it's all the testimonies of all the the names of enemies that's been defeated by God's living army amen and that's what chapter 12 is now in chapter 11 glory I want to show you too that God everything Joshua was commanded to do he did I want to show you that flaming the scripture let's go to verse 15 11:15 and then as the LORD commanded Moses the servant so did Moses command Joshua and so did Joshua he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses amen no where's he finished the ministry that was before him and church that's what we're supposed to do we're supposed to finish the Great Commission I mean know that we're supposed to prophesy again the word the open book all the prophecies were supposed to take that eat it and prophesized every nation amen this is exactly right now verse 23 as well so Joshua took the whole and according to all that the Lord said unto Moses and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes and the lambs rested from war praise the Lord so they had a little time of rest after all the victories amen now one more thing about chapter 11 chapter 11 lists a lot of the enemies that weren't defeated okay let's go to verse verse one okay Berta chapter 11 is another great huge conquest it's another united battle against Israel and Israel wins again despite all the demon spirits uniting against them what a testimony praise God all the demons can unite all the demons can fight this church but if we've got the Holy Spirit we'll beat every one of them amen no matter who well let's say try to do it up put poison in this person or or put give a sickness on this person would it mean everyone if we stay true to God you and they can rally around and do whatever they want if we got the Holy Spirit were more than common that's what they try to to try to bully up like good Goliath you know try to bully because he's bigger you know have an intimidation but they'll never win over God's Word amen now verse 11 verses 1 to 1 - 2 numbers 3 & 2 the Canaanite on the east of the west and to the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite and the jebusite and the bow said they him i under Herman in the land of miss us obviously there are some Hittites that were not in a given but also south and look at all these nations these are most of the nations that we just we've been preaching on they all gather at some point in verse 4 and they went out they and all the hosts with that much people even as it's and that is upon the seashore and mom food with horses and chariots very many and when all the kings were met together they came and pitched together at the waters of Marah to fight against Israel and the lord said unto joshua be not afraid because of them I'm sorry I missed that that's one more time he said be not afraid forgiving I think that's the third and final time I missed that one two three oh there's four okay forgive me that was four times Joshua was home for you're not in one time Joshua told them fear not so forgive me I got my number to myself I've missed this there's actually four times God tells us Joshua don't fear this is a fourth and final time which that would type out good because there's four annoying things that we overcome by through the seventh seal remember that the first four seals that's a good now verse 6 and the Lord said to Joshua be not afraid because of that for tomorrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel thou shalt off their horses and burn their chairs of fire and so Joshua came and all the people war with them against them by the waters of Maryland suddenly and they fell upon that and the Lord delivered them into the head of Israel who smote them and chased them unto great Sidon and unto this Ripoff wreck made and unto the valley of Mizpah eastward and they smote him until they left them none remaining and Joshua did unto them as the Lord made and he caught their horses of Burger charts with fire amen praise the Lord so you can see this the Bible is in chapter 10 and 11 all those seven nations in him against Joshua and knotted at the same old times he gave them a sudden victory praise God seven victories over all seven of these and churches many know about deliverance many times God does deliver people suddenly right there just be a certain moment there's a certain service there's a certain moment but man bought it from that time line there's a certain time where somebody gets to victory and that's how we say it's a red-letter day bromance and that's a red-letter day when the victory comes and God brings the victory suddenly now these victories might be spread out over years right little by little they're spread out over years but see that's why we always hang on because we never know like I told brother amen when he first came into vestige I said brother I've seen so many miracles and he said well we want to go he was kind of led to see once I said just come to every service just be in the house of God as much as you can because you never know when God's gonna leave early in that and it's got to be there be faithful watch God and gotta bring deliverance amen not very victory we just got to trust in the Lord in glory see sudden victories over each one of these nations each one God getting from the victory and each one they were outnumbered each one that should have lost by looking at the physical the natural but Josh boys looked at the spiritual a day man he looked at this captain of the Lord's host praise God amen and he obeyed the Word of God he had good courage we could be a and every battle we fight no matter how we do you no matter how great the child is we could be encouraged grace God let me just go through briefly chapters 12 is a list of the feet of canes through Moses and Joshua because Moses even defeated some amirite Kings as well lead to a muraki's before they even got to the promised land chapters 13 2 through 22 gosh would divides up the land and I heard of a minister one time say he wasn't a message minister he said this is kind of the boring part because it talks about all the quarters now might be boring for us to were Gentiles but that meant a lot to those Jews in other words they could say this is from the border the coast of this to the north to the to the southeast that meant off then because that land was theirs praise God this was there this was their book of inheritance we'd say what's the word I'm looking for this was their title deed that's it that's the word I'm looking for this is their title deed to us it might not mean much but to them it gave of all the details the call of God upon their life they met I can live I can drain it from here to here and this is the boundaries that I would be a king and priest in this land they better that's chapters 13 to 22 in chapters 23 to 24 Joshua's final words now let's go to chapter 24 I wonder what make sure I read that to Joshua 24 I just want to read those last few scriptures so you can see that once again Josh was going off the scene and he tells him you've got you we've given you the victory we've got the victory but you gotta serve the Lord and you gotta keep these coming back in is if you left that back in that you have two goats back in God's gonna kick you out of the land which is exactly what happened is fortunate all right that talks about Bailey Balaam and Balak and Chet and verse not high verse 10 verse let's read verse 11 and you went over Jordan and came unto Jericho and the men Jericho fought against you the hammer eggs the parasites the Canaanites the Hittites and the girgashites and the Hivites and the Jebusites and I deliver them into your hand you picture this Josh was dying and he's saying we've defeated everyone that God said we would in other words this day this scripture of Moses is fulfilled amen we are standing in the victory we are the fulfillment of all God's promises to Abraham haha 900 years of fast and now we're walking into life we're marking where the Apostles have trod amen can you understand we're walking into the blessing we've been used by God to fulfill his promise word we are the conquerors they met mother knew again verse 12 and I said the Hornet before you which traded them out from before you even the two kings and the hammerheads I was with Moses but not with thy sword nor with my boat and I've given you a land for which he did not labor and cities that you built thought and dwell in them of the vineyards and olive the arts which you planted not do you eat now therefore fear the Lord serve Him in sincerity and truth and put away the gods which your father's served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve the Lord and here's our famous scripture the one that's all over posters it's all over cars and all over churches and haven't seen Eve unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father's served that we're on the other side of the flood of the gods-damned writes in whose land as well but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord even not beautiful they've defeated all these seven nations we'd say these seven demon powers and Joshua still telling them choose who you're gonna serve you've got victory but you've got to keep the victory that's why we keep coming back to church that's why you keep reading your Bible afraid to listen at the brother Han stage if you've got victory praise God but you've got to keep the video game in because you don't know what the future holds but you know the enemy's gonna come in like a flood amen all right now let's go back to the side show me okay let's go back and I just want to read over these positive New Testament Scriptures again and I want to rehearse those that I have maybe a quote or two to finish how much time I got okay seventeen minutes he barely made us take a deep breath been praising the Lord amen let's go back and let's go over those one more time I want to hit the highlights yeah let's go back there real quick by the grace of God I hope I didn't go too fast for those this morning but if I did forgive me but like I said he could preach a whole series on the root of evil you know being the love of money you could preach the whole series on that okay so let's go to first john 2:15 let's just read that by God's grace first John 2:15 through 17 these are the modern-day Canaanites it's a real battle America isn't it Church isn't it it's a real battle American this even types over to our Laodicean Church age rich and increased with Goods this is clearly a demon we've got the battle on this day the spirit of the Canaanites we say which is natural but the spirit of it which types riches treasures merchants right possessions we've got a battle that but we're more than conquerors they've been looked out the world these are the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world and the world passes away and the lust through but either do it the will of God abideth forever amen now there's another scripture I want to go to let's go to 2nd Timothy was chapter 4 it just kind of came to me about the snares again I know I got snares on there later but I want to go to this one here remember where he charges the rich of this world maybe I got the wrong book or chapter I'm sorry 1st Timothy 6 forgetting not second Timothy its first Timothy 6 forgiving [Music] okay verse 5 verse Timothy 65 perverse the students of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself that's a great lesson we can learn just because someone is prospering physically with more money or something that doesn't mean God's with that that's what the scripture is playing on that they suppose well to seem like it is godliness most like they must be serving God right if activity says well withdraw yourself from those who think that gain is godliness that's why we're against the prosperity gospel right that's why we don't preach that's why we don't follow that's why it's not the name and claim on a million-dollar search cuff you know we just don't do that because the Bible says would draw yourself from anyone like that get away from that because that's getting into this Canaanite spirit but godliness with contentment is great gain and I think that's what we have to battle right can we be content with our wages right can we be content with our homes and our cars and can we be content with that and I think you can see that we need God's grace with that right in America there's so much all the American Dream the American Dream the American Dream there's so much pressure with riches and that's the pressure for our age but the Bible says you we must have contentment and that will give us a great spiritual game I know this is familiar but it's good to read it over verse 7 for we brought nothing into this row and is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be therewith content but they which be rich fall into temptation and a snare and too many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition now that sound like akin right drowned and destruction right is like God drowning in stones he was drowned because of his loss of money most of the gold weighs must about loaning garments for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but Thou O man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness and fight the good they lay a hold on eternal life amen aren't you glad you could fight the Canaanite today amen you can fight that spirit that gain is godliness right amen so that was good hope that's a blessing member hittite I'm gonna skip ahead to this was fear fear let's go to first John 4:17 very familiar but I want to read it as well by God's grace there's been numerous times I've got text and even posts on YouTube about how things I've preached less different people around the world most recent was El Salvador some from the Pennsylvania Saints you know different things so we must never underestimate just the power of the word of God say nay 1st John 4:17 here it is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment because as he is so are we in this world there's no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we loved him because He first loved us and Benny man say I love God and hates his brother he's a liar he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he hath not see and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God mother's brother also how many believe you got to fight this in the message right st. he'll try to get us upset with other people in the message how many understand that he'll try to divide the body of Christ but we've got to have love that overcomes fear I know numerous people that won't even go talk or shake somebody's hand in the message because of just a disagreement this person freaks is it this way when he preaches it that way and they don't want no fellowship to do with it we need to have the love of God church to overcome our arrogance seeing our pride we can out of that pride we have to have love the Bible said if we have love we will love those who even disagreed with right if you say you love God but can't love your brother you're lying and remember love is more than a word love is the action praise God love is the action and let me just say this before I get to the complex barber when I had accomplished I had against five preachers and I didn't even realize it so I started studying complexes I called all five of the preachers to apologize for my complex and they didn't realize that had a complex against them but I didn't want to do I had a complex because whenever I knew their name I give though jealous I get a little upset alright say I wouldn't say you know I wouldn't say nice things you see that and so what did that love did that love show me we must love everyone the fathers made right the Bible says that you can't love God and then this life that people God made amen I want to make sure I bring that out that was back in I think 2012 or 2014 I'm not mistaken one of those years so perfect love casts out fear so if you're afraid to talk to somebody or afraid to fellowship with somebody you're afraid to address a certain situation that's fear that we must have cast out fear crazy God please go now here Mike's just someone I've messed up on her with a give a nice this was a friendship with the world forgive me let's go to change far for forgive me I couldn't think of this it lights it Mike's really give me nice James 4:4 so sweet see the Bible Tyson adulteress and fornicators with friendship connects those two together verse 4 you get doctors and the doctor says know ye not that friendship of the world is hatred with God remember brother am like in Samson of the flirting with the world he's flirting with Delilah in a adulterous he was already married a golfer's type the situation there right program likens it unto us you know this in the rock-and-roll or loving the things of the world we used to love flirting with the devil flirting with sin right after the Bible accidental verse for whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is an enemy of God now look at verse 5 or 6 I'm sorry five do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit of the dwells in us to lust is to nd how many know the Bible said our God is a jealous God I had a sister this week in the Apostolic denomination called me on my way home Tuesday when I dropped off brother Sampson and Lima she called me up and she said thank you for your message on long dresses in the Bible and makeup in the Bible and modest clothing she said the Holy Ghost has been in my ear telling me that I'm jealous of you cover up your thighs because I guess she was wearing even in that massage church where he skirts up went up and shown her thighs and old high heels to that's the one she was on she said you need to make a video on high heels I said I might do that if I didn't have the time to do that but she said the Holy Spirit kept time you had to jealous over you don't push yourself up in those high heels no don't show off your your body I'm jealous over you and she said I couldn't get away from it and then God led me to your videos and then God led me to call you about high heels on my shoulder isaiah 3:16 number that they were mincing which means short steps and was the other one tinkling and tinkling is an actual noise of tinkling so they had some shoes that were similar to high heels they may not been exactly like high heels but then some and they do short steps and they make noises as they walk and she said oh praise the Lord I never seen that scripture she said God's answers are all the Bible amen I said sister there's nothing new Under the Sun all these things that they're doing now there's it was already been done the Bible says right it's the same spirit behind it might be a little different but the same spirit behind it praise God and she said that she said the Holy Spirit I've decided I'm jealous over you now God will tell an apostolic woman that he's jealous over her behavior how about how about us those of us who sit around more of the state oh they have some good that's it the Lord they have water baptism and they had to Godhead they have some good things but how much more UPS I don't say Lord and let the Holy Spirit be with me more I'm gonna say that praise God yes I want to say Holy Spirit be in my ear let me hear your voice if an apostolic woman can hear that about iost what can we hear get rid of the SAP get rid of the don't word of this website anymore right don't fellowship with that don't know don't know don't know friendship with that and if that's how we started what about true the true apostolic glory all right parasites thought that encourage you I just been really encouraged my god has been sending people to call me I got from South Carolina called about these bits of God's really been using these videos I've heard encourage parasites are worldly mindedness or spear and Eva your so really minded you forget who you are let's go to first Corinthians three three that now this is what we gotta be careful Church because we've all seen it some people have their favorite preachers right they'll only come expected when a certain preacher comes right yeah that's right that's right and that's a carnal mind and that means people are not really eating on the word they're feeding on an individual they're caught up in that person's personality I've had it to where people get excited when I fell them and there's moves of God and I leave and I the pastor's later they're kind of like oh you know I've talked to them about I know and they're talking about because it's a honeymoon with me when I come in it's like a honeymoon oh he don't do nothing wrong he just no he's he's the wonderful be someone different than our pastor and the pastor's get caught that'll be discouraged I'm better than Toby that church I know what I'm talking about they see why they so why can't God who like that when I preach yeah yeah I said I said the Rosales one time I said brother I've said because of all your planting we had an increase when I was there I not the reason there is an increase the reason there's an angry says it was because God's time to give an increase we didn't see what I'm saying I said brother you had just as much part in this because he got a little sparrow hawk on my ministry I'm the pastor how come I said brother god bless you I said has nothing to do with me it's all God's time that taught me a great lesson I can't meet a scourge if four people come up for prayer with stems and Shetty preaches and nobody come up this morning I can't be discouraged because all's I got to do is plant the Word of God and God sees it don't bring forth all the victories in our lives believe that I've gotta be like I'm not let that fear you know and you got not let that spirit get on you or you you pull for other people and not for the pastor you got it we just got a poll I got all of that four minutes of that all right and I'd rather could not speak unto you as in the spiritual but as in the carnal even as babes in Christ I fed you with milk and have not with meat for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are you a table for gr yet what carnal seat Rolly money for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are all not carnal and walk as men now look pulsing in the Corinthian church there's people and meeting other people I wish I could sing like that or I wish I dress like them I wish I had money like them where they were strike and divisions well you believe it this way I believe it this way I'm right you're wrong you know just divisions you see in churches you know especially messenger just because it's the word of the hour and say he's battling us I'm not bashing the people I'm just saying Satan's not down at the bar he's right here battling us because we're the ones think we got the Holy Ghost we got the word of the hour God is with us these signs follow us so Satan's going to battle us right so we're the ones who really got to battle this division is carnality strife divisions for well one says out of Paul and another am of apollos are you not carnal Oh see brother Jesse's my pastor brother Don he's my pastor I came to put myself in the same breath as these brothers brother San Jose my pastor brother at mystical zwei I can't even put myself in the same breath because of all they've done for the Lord and that's just respect Rankin's you must give a double honor you know get with no honor to the elders would you see that I'm saying people of they'll attach themselves to a personality in a card away and they'll they'll think because Carly I would this person I'm better than so and so we've got a better Church than this church we're not we're not to be carnal let's let's defeat those parasites praise the Lord parasites now remind you this respecter of persons you know we don't we don't like that we don't let that worldly mind forget who we are we're not a divided we're United Church we're united with brother Samuel church were united with brother Randy sighs sisters we're the same gospel we are the same charge take the head there's no one better there's no big guys little use we're all United who do I do we all need to draw closer to God absolutely so let's do that ain't head let's do that let's not divide us a walk this is my pastor these brothers chat lamb it's my pastor her brother Jim she makes my past you know we don't rally around the man we ran around the word who that is father Paul's writing Who am I in other words first I Who am I and who suppose what ministers by whom you believed even as the Lord gave to ever met I'm just a vessel that they heard to believe I'm nothing all right now but stop right there I was going to Hebrews to I meant with that scripture I've done yet I'll stop you just Hebrews to is one I really chopped up this morning forgive me I I couldn't quite remember that description so forgive me I really didn't mean to chop this up peepers to this is the sphere of the perizzites we're trying to overcome this worldly minded spiritual amnesia Hebrews 2 verse 1 therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for up the words spoken by Angels will steadfast and every transgression and this will be intercede a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation would you first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by then that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will there it is neglect we've heard the deep things of God so we must be more careful with them we must not let this opportunity slip through our fingers you see that don't let it slip through our fingers you must hang on to this and we must be careful that we have always have a Holy Ghost salvation message amen salvation and to the baptism of the Holy Ghost we cannot stop a safe occasion we've got to press all the way in a bet and if you get it you sure got a battle ahead of you I knew you Thank You Laurie now can everybody see that the parasite worldly buying spiritual enemies you don't forget don't neglect this great salvation don't get all caught up in carnal and thinking I love a brother song so I'm of this church of that church be a solid Christian praise God no no respecter of persons there's my Hauer okay I'm not gonna set the timer I'll just try to finish it Girish site was the clay okay so these are unstable this is a double-minded man that's what I need

need to hear David say well it's almost 40 versus two out and equal bus I think you'd be blessed yeah psalm of david praise the Lord so remember clay represented instability right it's the opposite of a rock it's not stability its instability 40 verse 1 I waited patiently for the Lord and he played unto me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon the rock and he established my goings so see what you're the rock you're established you're not going anywhere I'm here to say Amen hallelujah and he put a new song in my mouth that even praised unto our God many shall see it in fear and shall trust in God hey now the rest of you guys go to Matthew 7 9 we're not going to read all that but I just want you to see this is a double-minded man this is the instability of disappearing but not doing let's read over that parable again verse 24 Matthew 7:24 we would have to read all that all that verse 24 therefore who suffer here at these things if I to do with them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock so see hearing and doing is so critical don't be a forgetful here don't be a sphere jam easy right it'll be the double minded man and woman and the rain descended the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell that for was founded upon a rock there's a foundation amen there's that established I've established I found it so when I know the rains are coming I know the floods are coming I know the Devils coming in like a flood I'll be able to stand because I'm gonna rock baby I've obeyed the Word of God I'm a doer of the word and everyone that hear these things am I to do with them I shall be like it in a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it now look either way Saints gonna beat on you right both houses got beat upon either way you got beat upon but it depends what you're founded on if you'll stand you can handle the beatings if you're coated on Christ Jesus amen the rock of the same glorious rock of Revelation what does say the Lord is they met and then church will defeat those Kurdish Heights amen you'll try them out if you're following on the rock be an obedient stable solid holy ghost' church memory and I said like that

believes you you'll be solid amen all the Word of God obeying every word of God 6m rights we kind of went through this this was the lust that these are the fleshly habits less she loves that are strong remember these are the Chinese these are those some of the last remaining Giants well sister Jaya fleshly habits we'd say okay now let's go to James for one again dr. James for this has some of these spirits all on the same chapter there remember they were very warlike mouth and ears and then to the mountains he's huge Giants we were a comp Ark a few days ago they have these huge shells and I ran up the hill and I was huffing and puffing now can you imagine running up in the hill and there's Giants at the top you need God that's when you need the supernatural God either to blow down the the walls or send the hell stones or something they're conquering Giants on top of Hills they met so they needed the power of God that's what we got Church we got great Giants and conquered our eyes he's ready fleshly lust you know now war against sometimes we've got to cast some down in Jesus Christ they drive them out in the name of Jesus amen these wars have battle inside of us James for one from whence come Wars and Fighting's among you see and rights for warriors more like Mountaineers come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members is the giant fleshly desires inside of you that you've got a capstone and many times it causes war with somebody else it might be the pastor if I caused a war between you and the Deacon or the song leader whoever your sister your brother the Lord but if the lust inside of you that start these wars as we saw you lust and have not you kill desire to have and cannot obtain you fight in war get you have not because yes Amen let's go to first Peter 2:11 I hope this is a blessing Church offices of us is never it shows you where you are brother Ram said God wants us to know that every time where we are where my out with God which of these of my fighting I need to think about that for myself which one of my fight right now I'm about to just meditate on that for a moment first Peter 2:11 dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers of the pilgrims and staying from fleshly lusts which war against the soul sometimes you have such bad habits Church right so that we learn our habits go the fleshly habits that sometimes with you know if we're not careful will battle a my Savior I really have the Holy Ghost a little battle against your soul because you're in the flesh so much to set up walking in the spirit that's right that's right ok 2nd Timothy 2:22 then we're almost dead now Christine you've been so faithful today god bless you your hearts but I hope you're really enjoying this I I was so excited to preach this spiritually I was excited I just couldn't wait to get to church today you know preaches to everybody hope it's with less these are gold nuggets to me Church that all lines up scriptural to everything lines up for these write and order lines all up 2nd Timothy 2:22 flee also youthful lusts but follow after righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of the pure heart amen we must run human runs will never let God fight plus she loves with war against it so I would say the biggest one I've had lately Church honestly was when I told you about remember I was watching sports videos about the Cleveland Cavaliers men when I told that I just got caught up in watching that and I prayed Lord let the Cavs win this is about a year ago if you let the Cavs win I won't watch them right away in the morning and by God's grace a habit that was those that really bad on me like I would have actual night battles without guilt now some of you watched videos right some of y'all watched videos on our phones we got to be careful we watch praise the Lord that's the most recent one I can think of where I had a really fleshly lust that wore that kind of war with my mind you're not a faithful pastor let me do you know you're watching these highlights and all these things up you can't even start your day in prayer I had a real battle with that and the warrant against me but I'm thankful to say he gave me the victory in church out of the crowd like they even set out to cry oh wait patiently on the Lord he delivers last Jamie sites let's save our feet so I I'll close soon and remember this was a tough one this was a little bit tough because Jay G Buster gave us Jesus you have to look it up in Easton's and then it says fastness she must means fastest or and actually if you look at then you look up fastness and the dictionary calm it means stronghold that's where you'll find that there these were those that this was a type of strongholds and it wasn't a lot on the Jeffie sites I remember right yaks I don't have a whole lot on them so strongholds we have to drive out the complexes the strongholds like I said with my complexes I had to call those individuals and now I feel so grateful towards those people I love having them come in I love fellowship with them I'm happy for their ministry I want to see God use that more with wazzle jealous remember bloody women pride you know what one thing I mad was pride and popularity that was a lot of bad the most and so we got to go to extra Lakes so what I try to do with those of you that come and try and getting an extra blessing monetarily if they come in or if I have anything against them I'm trying to be extra black to make sure that Jeb you site doesn't run doesn't rise up that's right brother banner said again to remember his battles money had to make special efforts so he didn't take any money for himself to make sure that came to night in the rise up in him help me that was good he had to keep that Canaanite under his feet all the time so I'm not taking any money for myself any extra money my income I've given it to missionaries that's what he had to do to make sure so what I do try to bless those brothers or say such great things about them - brother - the souls over me his preaching is fantastic because I don't want that jealousy to come back up in my life I want to say evil about this preacher because he's got a bigger Church they have more Americans I don't I don't any jealousy to get in there I just want to be Jesse Smith who God made me I'll be happy for all God's children I'll be honest oh thank you I don't run with money or wind up very thankful for that does that be a heart that might be a harder battle I'm thankful for the battles that I do face because I know he's a call Korea okay last one complexes and it's very interesting like I said this is the seventh one and it's the last thing perhaps the last great battle brother Graham I'm struggling with interesting interesting okay let's go read second Corinthians 10 will read these and we'll stop by guys I just want to read ten and then we'll stop I'm not going to read Hebrews 12 that's the root of bitterness it's the same thing second Corinthians 10:3 - six again thank you for let me go over a little bit you've been such a great audience being such good attention here I appreciate that God god bless you richly amen I love to preach it I just want to see you happy with it I just want to see God was in it you know god bless somebody had this want to see God and I work - the sheep feed on the word of God you know I see a solid growth that's all I see there's just people love of God it's like are these ten three okay for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh so in other words we don't have to fight our own bodies right you don't beat up the Autobots for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds that's an actual Bible so the word complex can the Bible word for that is stronghold or root of bitterness from what I can see my scripture because it's something that takes a great deep hold of some people remember of fusion sport 30 looks like 429 said neither give place to the devil so when someone gets a complex they give the devil place in their mind against I got this against brother Jesse I got this against brother Hannah I got this against brother brother vanie they've got they've given a place of their mind to the devil and it's it where's it at in the realm of imagination amen their imaginations been clogged up and so they imagine a well this person got something against me every time i preacher they look at me with this mean face you're not okay they got this imagination they let their imagination get clogged up by the devil look at verse 5 passing down what imagination so these complexes are in your realm of imagination brother Randall imagine that nobody was getting anything out of this preaching but yet the bride was but there are some little person in there believing it that eventually pass it down this you and I what's he say was boundless imagination all they're not good here yeah it's not even worth going there every Sunday it's not your the word preacher Wednesday on but safe was trying to discourage them there's discourage him but there was somebody if God sent you there be somebody to hear you and I'm a testimony of that God sent me here to be a pastor there's always been somebody for me to feed praise God along with myself because I need these services as well storm's my wife so does each one of us casting down imaginations every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing the captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ so any thought that comes that's contrary to the word you got to make that a slave bind it up and then cast it down come true saying that anything so oh this person has something against me pass it down or if you really feel like that's true then go talk to the person if not you're letting the juggies nice defeat you and we don't we're not to be defeated no Devils to stand before us all the days of our life right no complex the love of money should stand before the Christ all the days of her life that's what nothing should stop us we should be an invincible army back you're right and this is how we good we cast out all these all these Reed's things and bring it to the Word of God and look at this verse 60 when you really cast something down you're ready the next time to do the right thing you're not ready you're not gonna fall to that thing again you're gonna do the right thing in other words you can't wait to fight that battle you're gonna cast that demon down praise God hallelujah first that's what verse 6 says and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled praise God I bet when I first got saved by the atom he would come up and offer me chewing tobacco you know we used to go like this we spit like this to make this noise when I first got saved I was I was gonna wait for people to come up and do that to me hey you still chew it and I'd say no I got rid of that God delivered me for that I couldn't wait to have revenge against that spirit Jesse used to want to do this skin you look oh no sir God gave me victory over that how could I turn back to those demons I'm a victor praise God so see if we really have something doubt we got to be ready the next time to be defeated right that's a real repentance the next time I come across that TV show turn it down right for me the next time I come across that sports video don't watch it I'm ready to say oh this man this man that I used to be a good athlete he spilled the devil you know I don't have time to live said I'm gonna bring that in obedience to the Word of God right so in the morning what's up pops up about sports turn it down that's for me cast out that bless you love say men and love the Lord with all your hearts man down history okay that's closed by the grace of the Lord today now let the church I had a whole lot of quotes I had a whole lot of quotes there's a big long quote about taking the promised land I won the read that you get into the legal rights are so much more romances confessing your healing before it happens is actually pushing up it because it pushing up the hittites the Gibeonites that's part of the battle and we'll be able get in the warfare Wednesday night Lord willing by God's grace but he shows you how to get the victory and many times it's by speaking the word which we've been dealing with that a lot lately you know with overcoming fear speaking the word God's been showing me more on that and just you know bring it the past in my life you know so more more of those things giving examples about how we possess the land and how we have legal rights you know like the United States Army how we're supposed to be trained to fight like the US Army faith will act on the Word of God every time faith isn't passive you know if a the acts on the word of what I'm sorry what did I do forgive me this is yeah I wanted that remains that faith will act every time so another state that's ready to take that sword and kill that parasite right away it's ready to act it's ready to take it down when we're really filled with faith as you can see I got a whole lot more I can probably scroll oh I got a whole lotta I could appreciate it but I hope that was it helped to you know the lord bless you let's close the word prayer here I think we'll just close with that how many would say lord help me this week to cast out all my enemies how many would say that Heavenly Father we love you today Lord I preached myself tired and I feel good about that I've given up myself I poured out my soul as the Bible said David poured out his soul and Jesus poured out his soul unto death Lord I haven't done that but I poured out my heart Lord God to your people the people I love the people that you sent me to the people bored of this area lore that are to be overcomers in this land this natural man but Lord seeing that we have a spiritual land to take over father I poured out these these burdens all my heart these true the Lord and I pray you to give us a victory over these when the days ahead in the years ahead if you should tear it dear God give us the victory help us be more than conquerors in Lord you know each and every battle that we might face there might be the love of money one time sake might then come back and try to bring a complex you might bring Cardinal - and pride you know Lord to make us think we're better than somebody or something like that or in each case of pray Lord send your Holy Spirit to us Lord to remind us that we can have courage Lord God we can actually strike and be very courageous for you're with us wherever we go to your God and you'll give us the Word of God to overcome in that hour I'm trusting it in Lord Jesus and trusting in your grace and mercy you brought me this far and nor you're gonna finish the work you started in my life along with these Saints are going to finish what you started according to Philippians 1:6 thank you that you're the God who finishes what he starts Lord God messed up for their attentiveness Lord they're pulling on the word Lord their ability to press through nor the flesh and feed upon the word of God I pray you this message to be a continued lesson to our church and if you should call me other churches perhaps to help other churches as well nor God as you have done that numerous times did it be your will Lord Kanha just be like this is such a inspired thought Lord it could be used to help others dear God we love you Lord God and we go Lord now in the fear of your name loving your name we go meet into your word life Joshua knowing that we'll get victory over all these temptations over all these spirits Lord if we just stay inside the Word of God help us to meditate upon the promises Lauren then thou shalt be a good success you said in our God will be successful message believers Christians if we just meditate upon our Commission or God meditate upon the promises were called to Granite Lord let us have spiritual success in this hour in Jesus Christ in church said god
