[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I'm gonna be I'm trying to be mindful the time here tonight by God's grace so I'm going to set a timer here let's go out a few portions of Scripture I want to continue on the kingdom of heaven by God's grace let's start in Matthew 21 33 [Music] we're making our way through the parables by the grace of the Lord 16 of them that I could find and today I would like to look at the wicked husbandmen and the king's son if we have time we'll look at the ten virgins as well a little more we preach on that a few weeks ago but it was kind of unplanned for so I do have more I like to preach on that by God's grace so Matthew 21 33 praise God 21 33 now for the sake of time let's go down and let's well it's our 33 most of us will remember this as we read it Matthew 21 33 here another parable there was a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedge it round about and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to the husbandmen and went into a far country and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen and that they might receive the fruits of it and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another again he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewise but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will reverence my son but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance verse 39 they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him verse 40 when the Lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons jesus saith on them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore I say to you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken I notice you either fall on the stone or the stone falls on you but on whom said shall fall it will grind him into powder so which one do we want we want to be falling on the stone we don't want the stone to fall on us like in Daniels vision the stone comes out of heaven right and smashes the image at the feet we want to fall on the Lord verse 45 and when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables they perceived that he spake of them and when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a profit let's have one more word of Prayer here bow our heads and let's ask the Lord and minister here tonight Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord we're just a little a number but Lord it never matters because when the angels of God are present Lord we know they bring your presence Lord God and father you promised to be where two or three are there's nowhere else we'd rather be than in your house dear God so we thank you Lord for this opportunity to take your word now break it to your people and I pray Lord let the Holy Spirit minister to every heart reveal your word as you so often do dear God feed your people or this is a table where the saints of God are fed Lord by the spread out Word of God and father we love you we exalt you in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous being seated praise God now that just reminds me a few Sundays ago when I preached on the Kingdom of Heaven on a Sunday morning I'm sorry I preached on the gifts of God I was mentioning how in the parable member how in the parable of the pounds the the wicked servant had the cloth remember that and he wrapped the pound in the cloth and he brought the cloth to Jesus and Jesus was very upset and I'll just like to share this just because it was true and it was a little testimony of how the Lord speaks a few days before that one of the sisters in the church had a dream about somebody coming to put a cloth on the table in front of her and she stood up took the cloth off and threw it down and I just said preach it that morning so she had a few days then I come and preach it and church was that shows it shows God's trying to speak to us the table represents what God's place where God's children to eat and so when someone kind tries to cover that over and someone tries to cover it over with a man and made idea what do we got to do we got to take that I'd man-made idea and cast it down in the name of Jesus amen so we know that happens here tonight to ever the word is preached and hearts are hungry the word discerns the thoughts intents of the heart praise God now let's look at the wicked husbandmen tonight by God's grace and then Lord willing we'll have time for the king's son King son kind of goes with last week's ones we looked at I do have a few quotes Lydia I'm sorry not quotes rather but just the visuals to kind of keep us on track if you want to switch over there the wicked husbandmen the the I say like this you know the the the symbols are very obvious in this parable it's a beautiful picture here of Christ and the Jews and Gentiles so on my little outline there you know we preach on the endtime conditions here the parables and now you know tonight we look at the wicked husbandmen we looked at the great supper we in fact we ended with the great supper last week and there's a great correlation both of these deal with the Jew and Gentile in the great supper remember the rich man just invites all the Evite's his people close to him burst they turn him down which we know was the Jew and then he goes out into the streets and he invites the the lamed the lame halt in the blind and we saw how the scripture says that Jesus when he would minister that the publicans and the sinners that all of the Pharisees would get upset but he said he said those that are sick need a physician amen so the lowest of the low so the ones next next to the rich man here that got their first invitation represent the Pharisees Sadducees the men that should have received it that were closest to the temple of God but the low the lower Jews or the the least esteemed Jews those were the ones that were out in the streets and when when they came in the sermon said well we brought in as many as we could he said okay he said fine go out to the highways and hedges praise God and bring them in that my house may be filled praise the Lord and so that represent the Gentiles for the Gentiles were afar off Paul says remember that so the great supper was a parable or the Jew and the Gentile and now the wicked husbandmen is the same it shows how although many of the Jews reject it not all but many of them did the Jews gladly received the kingdom of God and will bring forth fruit unto God in their season praise God how many know we're in the season of harvest time it's Laodicea it's the last church age amen it is harvest time this is the age of harvest praise God and what's Uniting time the tares are being bound together rogram plainly says in the church age book that's the season we're in uniting time binding their binding together world economical councils but we've got to bind together to the Word of God amen and so see here we are in the wicked husbandmen and we see that this is a parable now don't forget this - I'll make sure I want to say this hear the word kingdom means Dominion or rule right so the kingdom of the revelation of the kingdom of heaven is the revelation of God's rule in the hearts of his people praise God because Jesus said the kingdom of God doesn't come with observation he said the kingdom of God is within you so the revelation of the mystery of the kingdom of heaven is God having dominion over his people's lives and he does it through the baptism of the Holy Spirit amen and then through that power through that that indwelling presence God says in 2nd Corinthians 6 he said this is what's different from the Old Testament he says come out from among them and then he says I will be your God he said I walk in you amen I'll talk through you I'll live in you and I'll be your God amen that's the beauty of the New Testament the beauty of the New Testament is God's permanent dwelling place in the Tabernacles or temples of the people of God amen hallelujah that's God's kingdom is Dominion in the lives and in the souls of the believers praise God so see when we have when we know the meanings of all sixteen of these parables then we have a complete understanding of God's Dominion or rule in the life of the New Testament Christian praise God and it also shows how it shows you or individual roll men we looked at the stewardship yeah it shows your individual role there's four I'm sorry three parables that show your responsibility my responsibility to be good stewards in the kingdom of heaven praise God mine oh it's so important through these revelations we see our individual role plus we see the kingdoms enemies praise God as we saw God always unmasks the enemies and we saw it we saw with the grain of mustardseed right we saw how that Antichrist comes in like a very small lie but it grows into something great we saw it last week with the leaven right Satan comes in while the evil woman the Roman Catholic Church mixes her eleven and three measures of meal father son Holy Ghost right my and see how he comes in we you know we're we're privileged in the mysteries of the kingdom we're privileged to see our role our responsibility our stewardship but also how sin enters amen and then we're also able to see how the Spirit of God enters amen I don't know which will get to lower wedding next week there's five parables just about salvation so this is how the kingdom of God gets started in your life praise God it gets started through these parables and then there's course the other parables about the Holy Ghost that show how God's Spirit takes full Dominion praise the Lord and how it represents the born-again experience hallelujah now so let's go back here and let's look at that wicked husbandmen briefly as far as the chapter I've been riding on this I got it done but this is the shortest section because it's so obvious the the symbols are so so clear that it doesn't take a lot of proof to kind of back it up so it takes less scripture now in this parable we read it to you God offers he offers the vineyard to the Jews but they turn it down right but then he gives it to the Gentiles who will bring forth fruit unto God now Jesus interprets this in verse 43 Mathew 21:43 because they start to get a little bit of common sense they started looking a discernment and they say Jesus talking about us were the ones that are gonna kill him they're gonna kill the Sun and they get a little bit of discernment and Jesus said did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes right can you imagine you're gonna build a house but then you reject the cornerstone like that what kind of what kind of destruction would would would you expect like you could only expect destruction to not have a cornerstone a real solid piece that's going to hold everything together my like you're just you're wasting your time you reject the cornerstone the most important piece the piece you got to take and spend the most time on to make sure it's perfectly level it's perfectly solid it's good son the good foundation the rock and yet they reject the very cornerstone he had signs wonders miracles he cast out Devils he healed the sick he healed every manner of sickness they should they they knew they should have accepted him right they knew Nicodemus said we know your teacher sent from God they knew he was the cornerstone but he said let his blood be upon us in our hands and our children for every generation because they didn't want to change their denomination amen my oh but you and I we left all denomination to have the cornerstone Amen what we wanted we want the stone Amen hallelujah but see interprets it verse 43 therefore say I unto you kinda like last week remember last week with the great supper Jesus said it's my supper remember that the man's a tall one day will sit in the kingdom of God and eat and Jesus said listen it's my supper the invitations out right now boy he said you know don't talk about the future recognize that right now praise God don't miss what God's doing right now I'm the same for us we always look for the rapture we always look you know to the marriage supper or the Millennium but let's not get our eyes too far there let's see what God's doing right now let's not miss what God is trying to do in our lives right now praise God but in verse 43 interprets a force and he says therefore sad to you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you look at that my Jesus was so Strait wasn't he for a while you give him like little parables about that he'd come around and say listen it's my supper the kingdom was given to you but I'm gonna take it from you look at it mine and these little small groups that he's preaching in here my I love how Jesus you know you he would give him a chance you know to recognize the truth but then he bring it right down to them and they've got to make a decision he said I'll be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on who sever it shall fall it will grind him to powder amen in other words it's like Jesus is our landing place praise God remember the Bible said church don't let this some of you but the Bible said a broken and contrite spirit is those welcome sacrifice in the sight of God that's what he's talking about he's your foundation and you've got to let yourself fall on him praise God in other words you got to let you let yourself at the mercy of God in other words God you just have mercy on my life I'll oh you take all responsibility for me I don't have a thought coming praise God I want your will I just want your perfect will all my life is in your hands I bring myself broken amen remember that scripture I just read this we go to Micah if you got a chance this scripture has always been a blessing to me Obadiah Jonah Micah he's got a scene that song in my head Obadiah Jonah Micah Nahum always I just that's one thing I got at work on Obadiah Jonah Micah Nahum now what have you full beautiful book this is now I gotta find it I think I got a marked out in my Bible yes now go to chapter 6 please Micah chapter 6 just reading it my being blessed this week reading the word and the morning devotions what a blessing it is to hear the word of the Lord now Mike of course is prophesying at a time of where destructions at hand at the time of Isaiah and they're very close to being in high as a kite very close just a few generations away to the judgment falling on Jerusalem and being scattered and taken out of the Holy Land and they're given warning after warning he's another voice of warning well look what he says now I'd like to uh let's actually let's go to verse three all my people what have I done unto thee Micah six three and wherein have I wearied thee look the people are tired with God and God can sense it this is George God can sense when we get weary right but we don't get weird with God we just get weary in the flesh right because in this case they were they were wrong for being with they were just tired of serving God we're not tired of serving God our bodies just get tired serving God right in the midst of sermon because we're attacked on every side especially in the mind but see Israel got weary with just going to church they taught weary with offering sacrifices even though that will see that they they gladly gave a lot he said testify against me other words what have I done - we are you testify against me for I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed me out of the house of the servants and I sent before thee Moses Aaron and Miriam that all encourage our sisters right sisters did you catch that God said but what have I done I've sent you to men and I've sent you a woman Miriam led them in worship did she not as far as the women the tambourine players she led them in dancing so God's remembering or trying to remind those sisters listen I sent you Miriam see he's trying to get him to see it's not all about the men women got important part in this - and wasn't she a prophetess am i right is it was it Miriam a prophetess so not only did she prophesy and foretell things she also danced and worshiped it was a great part of the woman's worship amen see God's got to remind them that listen women you got important part to play as well everybody's got an important part to play amen see verse 5 o my people remember how what Balak king of Moab consulting and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from him unto gilga that ye may know the righteousness of the Lord he's saying don't forget what Balaam and Balak did they sold out the word right for money number six where we shall come before the Lord and by myself before the High God shall I come before him with burnt offerings with calves of a year old verse seven will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams or attend thousands of rivers of oil shall I give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my you see this is what the carnal mind thinks Oh Lord God just wants more of my Rams he wants a thousand Rams or a thousand rivers of oil or he wants me to give my firstborn or give up my body but God is trying to correct them and say you got the wrong attitude you've got a slave's attitude rather than the attitude of love right they got a legalistic attitude instead of a attitude of love now verse eight he has showed the old man what is good and what does the Lord require thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with I God amen see they thought it was just more works more works more works but God's saying this and just get your heart right it's not that you have to do more works just make sure your heart is right in the works that you're doing amen see what does God require God's not ask him for a thousand rams see he's not asking for something that will just physically kill you he's not asking for that he's asking for mercy right adjust and humble heart that's all he's asking for and of course the other Commandments but see they were taking it so far that God was like a legalistic God God just wanted more and more and more but God's asking I'm not asking for all that I'm asking for your heart and then church you know if your hearts in it the works will follow right when you're in love with God is it hard to come to church when you're in love with God never never see it's just when we get discouraged in our minds and we battle in our minds now go to chapter 7 the last chapter I just want to read this because it's encouraging you know God offered a lot of judgment against Israel but he also ends this word from the Prophet with hope hope of the restoration yeah this is 710 BC according to Scofield and Usher's timeline verse 18 who is a God like under thee that part of this iniquity and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retained a--the not his anger forever because he delighteth in mercy church listen you know the devil is always trying to get you to think God is upset with you but look God delights and mercy God delights and forgiving you praise God God delights when you come back and you failed again and just ask for repentance and ask for grace God delights in that praise God if your heart is right God loves when you come to him and say you're sorry he delights in having mercy remember Jesus said how many times you know Peter said how many times should I forgive seventy times seven 490 so think of that 490 times he delights in it you forgiving your brother and how much more God forgiving us if he delights in you for giving your brother five hundred times in a day I think he said or not oh how much more will God delight in mercy on us never I read that this morning I finished Michael this morning that was a beautiful encouragement look at that verse 19 even though Israel's judge listen he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and that will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea the sea of forgetfulness praise God now I will perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham which thou has sworn unto our fathers from the days of old and you can't have Abraham promised to Abraham without the promise B seed because Abraham is connected to his seed because all the blessings extended extend to Abraham and his seed after him praise God because memory the promise was to Abraham your seed shall possess the gates of their enemies amen and Galatians 3 says those who have faith in Christ they are the seed of Abraham hallelujah so see that we see this as a compound prophecy praise God not just a Jews but also spiritual Jews the Gentiles praise God the New Testament church amen we can see that without much you don't need a real spiritual mind to see that if you know Galatians chapter 3 so church be encouraged who's a god like unto our God who delights in mercy amen there is no God like our God amen the Lord Most High hallelujah and what is the required beecher CH but to do justly to do the right thing and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God amen now let's head back to Matthew 21 I just I wasn't actually planning that I thought just kind of came to me so let's go to I just seen how it connected with the message so Jesus interest parable and he declares to the Jews that the kingdom of God is taken from them so now the symbol their obvious the Heavenly Father is the householder the owner of the vineyard or the kingdom of God Israel represents the husbandmen to whom the householder and trusts its fruit too but when the householder sent servants to receive the fruit the husbandmen beat killed and stolen them Jesus says these servants represent the Old Testament prophets God sent to Israel because they rejected them Luke 13:34 says o Jerusalem Jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen death gather her brood under her wings and ye would not how the Lord now how they'll think about that they rejected it but think about us were the ones that are supposed to enjoy coming close to Jesus's bosom amen like john up in his bosom they didn't you know the israel they didn't want to be like the little chicks right that come to the mother hen to get warm but we're the ones who want to be warm under mother hen right we're the ones that want to be warm bye mama amen mama God we know he's Papa God and Mama God always thinking for the bills taking Papa God he saved me he's mama God and Papa God see how God does that amen lastly after all those servants have been killed he sends his son to receive the fruit and this represents the father sending Jesus but the chief priests and Pharisees crucified him and noticed they put him out of the vineyard or without the gate see that of Jerusalem remember in the parable he took him without the the vineyard and that's just like Jesus was taken outside the city of Jerusalem to be crucified alright now the Pharisees and priests can see that Jesus is likening them to the wicked husbandmen and then he quotes psalms 118 22 and 23 which talk about them rejecting the Cornerstone oh my there's force the New Testament that called Jesus the cornerstone praise God acts 4:11 romans 9 33 ephesians 2:20 and first Peter 2:7 they all call Jesus the stone and now that they call us the living stones praise God so we're a stone we're a solid Christian praise God we've got in other words we've got building properties God can build upon our lives amen god we're a part of the building of god our ministries are building something for the kingdom of god the bible calls it a dwelling place the Church of Jesus Christ is the dwelling place and the habitation of the Holy Spirit amen hallelujah praise God yeah see Paul echoes this Paul echoes Jesus's sentence against Israel in acts 28:28 he said be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of God is set under the Gentiles and that they will hear it I was at my wife and I were just talking about some of the some of the the wickedness around the world you know but we were just I was just thanking the Lord lord thank you that my eyes can see amen thank you Lord that I can see the truth of the word of God amen because so many can't they can see a lot of it but they can't see the mysteries of God they can't see the rapture mystery right mine they can't see the wheat and the tares they they can't see a lot of these mysteries but blessed are your eyes for they see hallelujah amen now this parable again ends like that with a great warning and then the Jews of course are very upset and we know that Jesus says they're the ones that are gonna reject the kingdom of heaven and is going to go to another nation it's gonna go to the Gentiles praise God all right now that one's done I'm gonna be done with that one let's go to the king's son so go to Matthew 22 the next chapter see some of these are pretty obvious to see and you can see how they clearly deal with the Jew and Gentile can't you see that it's clear how these deal with the Jew and Gentile so within the the 16 mysteries of the kingdom of heaven Jesus is giving more support within there to show and prove to everyone this transition from Jew over to Gentile oh my the Bible said it was the cross haha my the cross broke down the middle wall perdition against between the Jew and Gentile the cross did that the blood of Jesus was so powerful what blood have you ever seen that tears down walls amen blood that shed that's all it takes was the blood to be shed and then the wall was torn down between Jew and Gentile it was broken down and it broke up all division and it brought unity we're all brothers and sisters amen by the blood of Jesus Christ we're all one family of God the family of the kingdom amen oh what a glorious truth that is hallelujah Matthew 22 verse 1 my I told you I try to be mindful the time here I was gonna try to preach 45 minutes I think I can do it by God's grace I only got 15 left I've already preached 1/2 hour can you believe that I just can't believe how fast it goes but you know the kids are in school now I know you know kids are in school and I've been getting up extra early to do everything too so I want to be mindful the time especially during the school year now Matthew 22 1 2 14 now this is very similar to the parable that we did earlier parmi of the king's son I'm sorry oh not that one of the great supper yeah this is very similar to the great supper so the king son is very similar to the great supper because you have an invitation to come to a feasts but this one doesn't give any any detail after that last invitation comes out remember it just says watch and pray remember that it just it just kind of ends that way but in the king son it's different it actually shows you know it shows the Kings the king or the Father come into the the wedding ceremony here the wedding feast and he sees a man without a robe on so that'll be familiar to the children but I want to read the whole parable here to show how it's similar and show how it's different so Matthew 22 1 and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said the kingdom of heaven is like on a certain King which made a marriage now that's what's different as well remember the other one was just a rich man who made a feast well now this parable is a father who is putting a feast on for his son and send forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden saying tell that I'm sorry tell them which are bidden behold I prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the Renmin took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their City then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage so those servants went into the highways and gathered together oh as many as they found both good and bad and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in I look at here's the king coming in to see the guests right before the wedding so this is why I've said before I believe right before the rapture the Holy Ghost is going to come down the church and it's gonna remove all the foolish version or in this case this might be a Judas because of what happens to him he gets cast where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth so this kind of looks like a Judas upon a deeper examination and I say that church I say that because I've studied it out and all the weeping and gnashing scriptures reveal or I'm sorry relate to the lake of fire ok I know it sounds like it could be the tribulation it very well could be and I could I could accept that too but if you just look up weeping and gnashing it's always related to the Tribulation Period ok or lake of fire I'm sorry lake of fire so it's related to Lake of Fire how to read a couple of scriptures here to show it now verse 11 when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he say that a friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the King to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him in outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen alright let's go through some of the symbols here so the revelation here is that the Jews are first invited but most of them reject it but the Gentiles respond to God's invitation for the rapture and are appropriately clothed in the wedding garment of the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God amen the Jews turned it down right most of them not all but most of them turned it down so this King represents the Heavenly Father who's preparing a wedding for his son Jesus Christ and the the marriage represents the marriage supper of the lamb taught in Revelation 19 verse 9 the supper represents the weddings a reception of Jesus and his bride the New Testament church which takes a place immediately after Jesus raptures away his bride before the Tribulation Period those that were bidden with the first imitation that would not come are Israel because they rejected their own Messiah the king servants who carried the invitations were slain by those who would not attend the marriage they represent the prophets that we read about in the previous parable Christ spoke of that as well he said he sent them all the prophets and they stoned them they slew them and kill them now like this this is something that was fresh to me too the king sends his armies to destroy the city right and what does that represent it represents the burning of Jerusalem by the emperor Titus in AD 17 that beautiful just to see now what it was sad that it happened but it it's beautiful to see it Jesus for telling Titus is coming in many ways but here through a parable as the city was burped that was in verse 7 the Bible said he burned up their city so Jesus was for telling them listen because you rejected me I'm gonna send Titus and Titus is gonna burn this city and burn the walls burn the temple right now see the king sends out one last invitation to the furthest extensive his kingdom to the highways the Bible says yes verse 9 go therefore into the highways and so this represents of course both good and bad guests coming so that his wedding is fully attended and again this represents the Gentiles the invitation of the Gentiles the Bible says in Ephesians 2:17 I already mentioned it but they were a far off from the promises of God so see Jesus has to send his servants out to the highways afar off the outer extents of the kingdom and bring them in that's you and I children that's all of us here tonight were the ones that were afar off we were far from the kingdom of God right we were far from knowing about God's righteousness but God is mercy blind to the Jews that he might take a Gentile bride glory Paul Barnabas declare this to Israel in acts 1346 then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the Word of God should first have been preached or spoken unto you but seeing that you put it from you and judge listen judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life see brother like brother man said God is trying to you know people that go to hell they're gonna push their way to hell right they're gonna judge themselves God really don't even have to judge them really because they have already judged themselves unworthy they judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life because they turn down an invitation to the most delicious suffer you could ever be invited to amen they turn it down for what for these little measly excuses merchandise farm family right marriage and pleasures of this world they turn down the greatest event of their life they turn it down for a little foolish things of the world my goodness and so he says you judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gens house now that's right because the Jews were unworthy of everlasting life just as the king called them not worthy in verse 8 of the wedding member of the Bible said that mercy he says but they were not worthy just like Paul and Barnabas said you judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life so see Jesus calls you worthy when you surrender your full freemore agency when you give your free more agency over to God then God calls you worthy because he's such a gentleman like I heard today that was such a powerful thing I never meant I never heard that before the rich young ruler turns away from Jesus and Jesus brother rain never goes up and says no no I'll give you another chance come on back Jesus just lets him go because he's got it he gives them the dignity he gives them the respect to make their own decision he's not going to force anything my brother man said God's not going to force anybody to do anything that's why you're free more agency your surrender of your free more agency to Jesus Christ is your victory amen because you submit your free more agency to your faith the faith of God and the Bible said faith is our victory amen hallelujah faith is the victory see you receiving the revelation of God and acting upon it that's right because remember all the revelation is is the will of God but medicine faith is a revelation of the will of God well Cain had a revelation then because Cain knew what God wanted but he didn't obey it he didn't surrender right his free more agency to the revelation of God glory amen hallelujah he God showed him the perfect will of God he turned it down he said well then sins gonna be right down to your door when you try to soon as you try to go out the door your of your home the spirits are gonna be right there to just you're and you're gonna accept them they're gonna jump on you're gonna attack you right and you're gonna be overcome and you're gonna be a vagabond see now what does it show it shows we got to have a right life in our homes see cuz he said sin lies at the door we got to have pure hearts when we come out at home amen you gotta have a pure heart when you get on to your bed in the morning right you got to pray or read your Bible until you have a pure heart cuz sin lies at the door praise God oh my thank the Lord now the climax of the parable though is in the last few verses 11 to 14 and this is why it's different this is why the king son is different than the other one the great supper the great supper just talks about three invitations going out remember that three invitations to the ones close by and then the streets and then the highways hedges but this one's different that deals with Jew and Gentile so does this one but this one gets into the baptism of Holy Ghost for the Gentile sea oh my that's good I never never seen it like that mine that's good praise God so not only does it go Jew and Gentile well then it even brings it to our day right then the last day right before the wedding the Holy Spirit's going to come down a powerfully I believe that's the latter rain amen that's part of the third pulling then when the King steps down amongst his church and he starts looking say look your brother raised got the white garment on praise God sister Beatrice look she dressed in white hallelujah but see she but but see she's gonna find some of these make believers amongst us like he's found in the last few years right and they might have signs miracles and wonders they might be among us they might have a some kind of a testimony but they're not born again and Jesus gonna say where's the baptism of Holy Ghost in your life they can't say anything speechless nothing to say no in other words they don't overcome by the word of their testimony they have no testimony why because they're not under the blood of the lamb they never really repented their sins they never really had an experience with God oh my thank God when we can cry out it cry it out at the altar amen when we can feel like we Bend in God's presence and we know we passed from death unto life amen when we know for the right we remember what it was like when we felt Jesus wash away all of our sins how the area and then we continue to live a life free from sin hallelujah oh and not just that but then receive the power the wedding garment of the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh thank the Lord thank you Jesus sees the Kings angry he's angry he said what do you mean you're amongst these Holy Ghost field Saints and you're not born again he's in other words he's saying the only way to get in here is to get the baptism Holy Ghost but the man said he found some way to sneak in maybe kind of in a window or maybe he snuck past the guys that maybe there's such a big rush you know the rush of the last few Saints coming in I don't know around the world now around the world maybe kind of suck his way in there we don't know how he got in but the King's angry see you know he should have looked around saying man all these people are born again I need to get born again and he didn't get born again he had every chance oh my can you bring a gene that church he had every chance while sitting there talking you know they're all talking he had every chance looking man these people had the Holy Ghost and I don't he had every chance just to say you know what forgive me I'm gonna go and get the the robe on yeah I snuck in here Lord I want the robe forgive me he had every chance to Humble himself because everybody around him is all born again oh my god help us to see if other people are born again god help us to humble ourselves to say I want to be more than a church member amen I want what he's got what she's got but you're not gonna get it from them like the other parable says about the ten virgins you got to get it from Christ amen we got to go in Jesus Christ ourselves you got to meet Jesus Christ in your in your chair or you got to meet him at the altar or you got to meet him in the basement you know by a dog kind of like brother Samuel told me where he got the Holy Ghost you got to meet him somewhere I praise God you got to meet Jesus he's the one that gives you the new garment amen he gets so mad and he sends him out to where weeping and gnashing is why was he so angry because the Bible says kings or rulers provide change of clothes as presents for their honored guests right just like remember Joseph gave his brothers to change a garment but Benjamin got five to remember that see it's it is part of the glory of the rich man to give his friends new clothes right like William gave us those new clothes that was nice of him that was a great expression of respect and love turning down a wedding garment for a king's marriage would be the highest form of disrespect especially from a man who had on some filthy garments from out in the highways this man wasn't walking on you know the pearly gates gonna say he wasn't walking the pearly gates and streets of gold this man was out in the highways and hedges he stepping on you know dung and he's all dirty out there dusty and he had every chance to get his feet wash to get washed and put on a wedding garment and it's total disrespect to try to come into a king's ceremony for a son in the can I say like this to try to come in to the marriage supper in your filthy rags amen in other words there's my 45 minutes give me ha this is hard give me five minutes here my wife's gonna remind me out in the man to which I wonder too I want you to honey I don't know where everybody out myself this is AB it's a busy time of year not every time years like this but the being here is always the hardest from August to October the hardest cuz all the changes and all the great cards and everything like that just it's just more stressful C so what is he doing here he's turning down the Grace and presence of the king even Esther knew hundreds of years before even after noon you can't come before a king in your filthiness the king the King makes away for you to be clean amen even she knew that a woman knew that and here's a man who's trying to come in the presence of a holy God li king in his own righteous and Jesus said you can't come to heaven by your deeds or your righteousness it's filthy rags you got to get washed by the Sun a man you know what I mean right by Jesus ma but he used the offer of garments and being washing clean and it was available as free it was freely given anyone could have got it so it shows that this man whose dirty without the garment he didn't he did disdain that he didn't respect the king like he should have he was he liked being around the Holy Ghost filled saints he liked to see them with the Holy Ghost but he himself I don't need all that I'm good enough I go to church I pay my ties you know I don't commit adultery I don't lie don't murder but see he had II had no respect for the King he didn't have respect for the King the king was freely offering it oh man we got to have respect for Jesus Christ don't we oh it's so true see the wedding garment as children need to know that that's why I'm one of the reason I'm preaching this the wedding garter children represents the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's also seen church I forgot that that's also seen in Gideon's life Gideon before he went to battle you remember he had to kill all of his I'm sorry he had to cut down all of his dad's groves all the abominations of a dad's house and then he got a name change and he got new clothes it's three steps there was three steps I preached on that years ago it's been a long time but even he had to get new clothes right before and number the prodigal son he came back and what they did when he came back on the Pigpen they gave him a ring they gave new clothes amen represent born-again you're fully in position you got the clothes on your you're clothed with power amen I know you're cold with power close with the ring and the and the shoes and the sandals praise God oh yes see it's a gift the whole ego is a gift the garment wedding garment is a gift and as to all them as many as the Lord our God shall call see Paul not children don't miss this one children don't miss this one Haven and Karras don't miss this Paul says the batch of the Holy Ghost is close to the Bible says put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh see that now that's Romans 13:14 I'm not gonna pull it up but Paul says put him on hey put it on Jesus Christ put him on and Jesus said go up he said until you're and dude and that word means clothes go up there to the upper room and wait till you get the clothes of power amen wait till your life is clothed with power so you can overcome the gates of Hell hallelujah amen and then Jesus says it again in Revelation three four the Sardis church Jesus says you in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy hey hey man see this represents the clothes represents the baptism of the Holy Ghost Moran said wedding garments represent eternal life and Paul says the bat Zilla ghost is Christ in you the hope of glory because remember brother Hamm said that when the member under the fifth seal the Jews were given the the white robes right and sees mother and says what does white robe represents except eternal life because eternal life is something the Holy Ghost filled Christian has right now first John 5:13 says that these things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have not will have you have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God amen see when you have the clothes of the bachelors all ghosts you have eternal life God's life is in you you have the power to live a life pleasing to God so this is where I say this the guest without the wedding garment he responds to the preaching about the end time so see he's a message follower he's a message follower cause it's at the end time right before the marriage so he but he fails to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost himself now to me I write in the book it's like Judas Iscariot because he's cast in the darkness where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth teeth which represents cast into hell according to four scriptures and they are matthew 8:12 Matthew 24:15 Matthew 2530 and Luke 13:28 all them say weeping and gnashing of teeth with the lake of fire let's read one of them since we're there Matthew twenty five thirty since we're there just so you know I looked this up church I wanted to be sure weeping and gnashing of teeth always represents the lake of fire Matthew 2530 this is the parable of the white throne not parable it's a story the white throne judgment yeah okay I'm sorry this is a parable of the talents yeah and Cassie the unprofitable servant into outer darkness and there should be weeping and gnashing of teeth I'm sorry that doesn't prove it let's go to Matthew 24 since we're there 15 I'm trying to show a pattern 24:15 know I wrote the wrong one there I see 24:15 that's about the abomination of desolation I'm sorry well I got a typo let me write that down I gotta fix that okay go to matthew 8:12 then let's try to try that one matthew 8:12 pardon me i need to fix that one yes here it is yes let's actually let's read - and I say to you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the chair of the kingdom should be cast out into outer darkness there should be weeping and gnashing of teeth all right so we see that there the Jews here are cast out into outer darkness with weeping and gnashing of teeth because they've turned down the kingdom now to me that's got to be the lake of fire but let's read another Luke 13:28 Luke 13:28 see they're out of the kingdom Luke 13:28 all right sorry about that oh yeah I'm sorry blistery 27 - yeah so he's speaking of workers of iniquity this is why I believe it's a Judas type of person but he shall say I tell you know you not for once you are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity now you know workers of iniquity do not make it to heaven those are not foolish virgins for there because foolish versions are versions to the word verse 28 there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham Isaac and Kingdom and and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust out see that that's Judgment Day they're gonna see Abraham Isaac Jacob in the kingdom of God and then cast out so I'm trying to prove by the scripture I got to fix that one I don't know where the other one is off to go find it but all the weeping and gnashing of teeth all deal with the lake of fire and the white throne judgment hope you can see that by God's grace workers of iniquity okay I'm almost done here okay so these garment rejecting worshipers they see the life changing power of God on others but never experience it themselves because Isaiah 64 verse 6 says but we are all as an unclean thing and our righteousnesses are as filthy rags this man's trying to go in the rapture on his own his own righteousness but you cannot trust church we cannot trust in our own righteous let's stand to our feet because I got to stop you and I cannot trust in our own righteousness Christ is freely offering his righteousness in exchange for admission of our sins sin Corinthians 5:21 declares for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him alright how many believe that tonight by God's grace amen praise God alright so I think I went 50 minutes I want that's the lake of fire okay maokai here once you come here let's examine our hearts and lives the Bible said examine yourselves so make sure you're in the faith tonight praise God let's make sure we got the right with the right garments on tonight that we don't come and try to be just a church member by our own righteousness how am i trusting in the blood of Christ tonight amen let's have word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your word tonight Lord God these two simple parables of the wicked husband and Lord and the king's son we thank you for them Lord God we know they're true they give us great revelations dear God the first one shows us that the kingdom is given to us and we've got to bring forth fruit amen god help us to bring forth fruit the Jews have turned it down we've seen Gentiles bring forth much fruit but here we are in the last age we look at our lives or help us in order
