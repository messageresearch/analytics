the seven seals and the seven thunders i just want to preach a few more things on this and then lord willing to get back to gideon or whatever series the lord directs us to so revelation chapter 8 verse 1. as we start the service i just want to tell our home church not so much the live streamers unless the visitors but the home church i'm going to stop the sermon at the end to share just a little personal uh story i want to share but if our home church is listening you know i'll record it on my phone and i can just share it later if you like to listen to it kind of deals with you know just the pull of the hour kind of deals with uh the timing and the coming of the lord and uh you know numerous message ministers are saying the raptures any day now they've been saying that for a month now and that's the way numerous churches have kind of carried themselves and so i just want to address some of those things and share some of those things at the end of the service so our home church you know you're happy to you're free to contact me after service if you like but i'm going to stop the live stream a little shorter just meditating on it last night i thought well i'd like to address it tonight and maybe end the service with a few thoughts on that how i just felt the holy spirit put a burden on my heart so revelation chapter 8 verse 1. revelation 8 verse 1. let's read verse 1 together revelation 8 verse 1. let's read this psalm 3 1 2 3 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour now let me read just on you'll see the context so the context is after the seventh seal judgment gets ready to strike that's why i believe the seventh seal is the day and hour of the rapture because right after the rapture what happens grace is over for the gentiles and now the first half of the 70th week of daniel the first three and a half years of torment starts now it's a time of peace between it's a time of peace between rome and israel they're going to make a seven year covenant the bible says that in daniel 9 27. but it's also a time where the prophets are going to torment the earth it's not going to rain for three and a half years it seems like from the scripture but the real wrath of god is saved for the second half of the tribulation the real wrath of god is saved for that but look at verse two and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and then and and to them were given seven trumpets when after the seven seals opened that would make sense after the rapture after grace is over then we're getting ready for judgment verse three and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer upon the prayers i'm sorry offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angel's hand and the angel took the sensor and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and earthquake and an earthquake so one specific earthquake could that be the los angeles earth earthquake possibly but there's another one mentioned later on in revelation that's called the greatest earthquake of all time i think that would be the los angeles one but of course i could be wrong yeah california yes sir yeah that's what it looks like by god's grace because we we could not think of a worse earthquake than that right where a whole piece of a continent falls off into the ocean i don't know what could be worse than that so it seems like that would be after the rapture but again we don't have the say the lord on that we just have thus saith lord it's gonna happen uh in verse six and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound now look at the first the first angel verse seven the first angel sounded and there followed what hail and fire mingled with blood now what does that look like hail with blood we've all seen hail but this is hail with fire and blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of the trees right get a picture get a picture in your mind of earth look at all the green now a third of that is destroyed a third was burned up and all green grass was burnt up all green grass so you don't want to be here when the trumpet sounds when these trumpets sound we want to be gone when the last trumpet to the gentile sounds see there's a trumpet to the gentiles but then there are seven trumpets of god pouring out his wrath upon the earth may god has a blessing to read his word you may be seated here so i want to take one more service here and look at the seven seals and the seven thunders i appreciate the good feedback i was trying to ask people last week was that helpful and hopefully it was uh by god's grace i just want to just briefly again review this so you can switch over here i just want to show those those charts again that make it very simple so you can see every seal had three forms to it each seal had three parts to it so i want my kids to grow up lord willing if the lord tarries i want all the other children to grow up and understand these things so there's no questions about it did you notice how brother brian came in here and said it's good to ask questions you guys catch that on sunday i thought well that's the holy spirit right there because we're always like ask me any question right every sunday night ask me any question right because he he knows the value of that there's there's a real there's a real uh injury you give to the church when you say no questions because that creates fear uh anxiety uncertainty but when you have the liberty to answer it and ask any question that's where the spirit of the lord is because god's not afraid of your questions god's god's infinite he knows all things and although we don't have all the answers we should at least have all the honesty the bible says we should have all honesty so just briefly uh i'm going through this real quick here remember not uh the revelations of the seven seals and the church ages were thus saith the lord but not every word was thus saith the lord we saw that plain last week and each each seal has has three forms that have to be fulfilled i just want to show that again but plainly says it in this paragraph paragraph 147 and 148. he said there's a symbol form there's a reality form and then there's a revelation form as well when it's revealed so there's three forms to it and i just want to show this again the first seal has a symbol reality revelation each one's a little different the symbol is when john saw in a.d 90 or 500 everybody has a different date on that the reality form was different it's when the the the the white horse rider road that spirit of antichrist as the in deception wrote at that time then the spirit of antichrist and the second seal wrote as a murderer in the roman catholic church and then the fourth uh the black horse rider during the dark ages capturing the wealth of the world right through indulgences and crusades and the capturing of art and gold and all those things that was from 1095 to 1906 and now that pale horse rider is writing today spiritual death okay now the revelation form came on on the thunder the thunder the voice of god gave the revelation the first seal on march 18th second seal thundered out march 19th the third seal thundered out march 20th the fourth seal thundered out march 21st the fifth seal thundered out march 22nd 63 the sixth seal thundered out uh march 23rd and the seventh seal thundered out march 24th 1963 and then the fifth sixth and seventh seals their reality forms are all future tense right these two are right after the rapture and the seventh is the rapture it is the rapture okay so hope that's again uh helpful i think church the more you see it the more you'll you'll understand it better and i'm gonna kind of close the service with this thought about time is the greatest vindicator of all things time will vindicate who was right and who was wrong and now we have what 56 years since brother ram's been off the scene so now we have plenty of time to see what was what was really inspired the lord what was his human thoughts what did he have what was he just kind of probing at you know like he even said he even said some of his sermons we're just i'm just i'm just presuming this like sirs is this the end time they said he said i've never preached a sermon like this this is just my guess i'm just trying to understand these visions okay now of course brother ram gave us all the mysteries you know the bible defined mysteries the godhead water baptism uh mystery of iniquity all 12 of them in the book there right all 12 of them so we have those revelations but there are certain things there's many things brother ram said on tape that we don't quite understand so time is the greatest vindicator of all those things all right now again to give you a visual of the the 2000 years of church history the symbol forms were given around 80 90. the reality form have been taken place the whole time the rowdy forms of those first four seals are going on right now uh actually we're in the fourth the three have already passed the revelation form of what they meant though that came in 1963. so i'll probably be you know over the years lord willing if the lord tarries we'll just be reviewing this to try to understand it better as the children go up they shouldn't have any questions about the seals i don't want them to have any questions about the seals or the thunders they should understand it's already been fulfilled and we just got to grow and receive more revelation from the holy spirit praise god brother graham said pray for revelation more than anything else hallelujah so that's what we do we pray for more revelation so there's the symbol form john got the visions on the aleppos the reality form was the actual years that the antichrist spirit was battling the certain anointing of the holy spirit and then the revelation form was in 1963 when brother branham received the revelations from the holy spirit now uh let's skip ahead here i'm going to skip past that go to the thunder's quotes so brother ram said in revelation 10 1-7 is history it's past that promise is already fulfilled so in revelation 10 when the mighty angel come down that was jesus christ in the holy spirit form or in the form of angels right because angels bring the presence of god that picture that we got out there the cloud that's the seven angels praise god come down clothed in a cloud praise god and then the mystery of god was revealed to brother branham and and now it's eaten by us and we're we're eating it today and we're taking it out uh we're taking out as far as we can go praise god we're just letting at this point really we're letting the internet do it right we don't know many missionaries going out right now but at this point we're letting the internet take the gospel praise god until some more missionaries rise up and can go overseas again praise god we never know when that'll start back up but we're waiting for it i'm ready for it praise god i'm ready to support one whenever they're ready to go praise god so that's history revelation 10 1 to 7 is history so that means revelation 8 or 10 8 through 11 is happening right now that's our responsibility right now to eat the book and prophesy again amen now brother brahm said they asked brother brown were the thunders revealed he said or he said were the are the thunders not yet known to us he said no they were already they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about so to brother abraham in this quote the thunders was something of the past it's what the the holy spirit already gave us in the seals and then the church age book brother i read this over at least a couple of times he said i got a quote on that and he said the first job of malachi 4 is to turn our hearts to the fathers the second job is to reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals praise god all right now we looked at the bible teaching on seven thunders now i've got another one i want to go to so this one's not up here but turn your bibles to psalm 29 please psalm 29 and if you haven't listened to the seven uh seven seals lately uh brother austin and lean i would really encourage you to do that i'm so glad some of the first sermons i've ever listened to to brother branham were some were those sermons they're some of the most highly anointed and revelated sermons because you get all the symbols you get the symbols of the seven eyes you get the symbols of the rainbow around the throne uh the 24 elders the symbols of the horse riders and the the the four cherubim there uh it's just beautiful it's really important get a lot of good church history too so i really encourage you to read that now what's interesting about psalm 29 is that there are seven voices of the lord or seven thunders now i can't at this point i'm just presuming i can't see how these are linked to the seven seals but i'm just showing you it's psalm 29 verse 1 psalm 29 verse 1. if you want to read it you don't have to but if you want to follow along verse 1 says give unto the lord o ye mighty give unto the lord glory and strength give unto the lord the glory do unto his name worship the lord in the beauty of holiness see the enemy's going to tell you you know your worship is just it's just legalism that he's going to tell you all you sisters when you dress like that you brothers when you dress like that when you stay away from evil that's just that's just legalism there's no god doesn't god's not pleased with that but the bible says worship god it's beautiful unto god amen sister is your dress beautifully and it glorifies god when your brothers dress modestly that glorifies god any holy living is beautiful in god's sight praise god so we got to tell the devil to be quiet get behind me satan when you choose to obey god's word and holiness god sees it as a beautiful thing praise god verse 3. now here it is here's the first voice the voice of the lord is upon the waters now waters represent multitudes of people the glory of god thundereth the lord is upon many waters so it repeats itself now notice there's seven voices here it looks like seven thunders okay now again i can't see the correlation between the seven seals but but uh perhaps somebody else can and they can email me and let me know verse four the voice of the lord is powerful the voice of the lord is full of majesty so there's three voices there's three thunders right there verse 5 the voice of the lord breaketh the cedars takes down woods yea the lord breaketh the cedars of lebanon that's the fourth voice verse six he maketh them also to skip like a calf look at that cedar skip like a calf cedar trees large massive trees skipping like calves that's how powerful god is amen he says lebanon and syrian like a young unicorn verse seven the voice of the lord divideth the flames of fire so god's voice separates fire flames that's the fifth thunder uh number eight the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness the lord shaketh the wilderness of kadesh that's the sixth thunder and nine and the voice lord maketh the hinds to calves that the voice of god causes these pregnant animals to bring forth their little ones and discovereth the forest and in his temple doth everyone speak of his glory praise god so the voice of god causes all the saints in the temple of god to praise the lord and to speak of god's name amen hallelujah that's what the voice of god does amen hallelujah you might as well finish the chapter because it's a short chapter verse 10 the lord stood up upon the flood yea the lord sitteth king forever amen who's your king our king is jesus amen the bible calls him king of saints hallelujah so if you have a need in your life just go straight to the king praise god come boldly before the king hallelujah find grace to help in the time of need verse 11 the lord will give strength unto his people amen how many strength tonight praise god he's here to give us strength amen the lord will bless his people with peace amen keep praying for peace in ukraine keep praying for these things we don't know how much time we got praise god but god gives strength and god gives peace amen we need to be the ones praying for it hallelujah now so there you go i just thought i'd share that with you i've always had that for years and just laying there i'm waiting for inspiration on those seven voices seven thunders the bible says the voice of god thundereth amen now i'd like to uh skip ahead here these are the quotes i ended with last time remember brother brahm said you cannot add to the word at one time brother brown thought there were seals on the backside of the book according to revelation chapter five but then brother braham said i learned he said it wasn't that he said because there can't be anything that we need that's outside the bible everything we have need of is already in the bible praise god so brother ram could grow in revelation i just think that's a beautiful example if brother graham could grow in revelation how about us we should be able to come to church and learn learn something praise god we should be able to come and read we should be able to read our bibles and learn something new praise god get a fresh understanding a fresh revelation on the word of god hallelujah he says those things and i'm going to move on here but abraham said all of it he said you can't add anything to it or take anything from the bible it's all revealed in there and the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was those seven thunders so you're talking about the seven thunders the seven seals opened up what the thunders was all about he said that's what it was see it's still in the word let's all say in the word ready in the word it's still in the word praise god the meaning of the thunders is in the word it's the seven uh it's the seven revelations of the seven seals praise god he said you can't get out of that word it won't leave that word and god's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right there with the word blinding some and open the eyes of the others it'll always do that now i want to begin here for part two so just a very that was a very short uh review and hopefully everybody's gonna get up to on that now i just want to read this now it was interesting on uh march 19th which was a couple weeks ago the jeffersonville church got done listening to all the seals i thought that's interesting because i was going to preach on the seals right after that i didn't even realize it so i went back and see what their leadership said the day before they listened to that sermon and and uh the blue or the the the the black words there in the white tho those are just the words of the leadership at branham tabernacle uh the blue ones are my comments and the red ones are the things they said that i that are totally wrong okay so i preached to you the meaning of the seven thunders right and the seven seals now let's see what jeffersonville says about it let's see what they say and i just preached you all those quotes on rapturing faith a few weeks ago remember that i took you through every quote it's a two-hour sermon but you sat through it and god bless you and i hope the revelation's in your heart now amen uh i just preached you all those rapturing faith quotes now let's see what they say now this can be important for that end statement i'm gonna make at the end because a lot of preachers are on the message are saying the same thing jeffersonville's saying and i find that really strange if you are saying the same thing that that movement's saying about the prophetic things and all these spiritually revealed things i think there's something wrong with that because they are they are idolaters exalting brother branham equal with god and equal with the bible if not higher so that's what i want to say at the end so bear with me here i feel kind of led of the holy spirit to do this tonight i'm feeling very bold here tonight by god's grace strangely strangely just as strangely so here's what uh the the the leadership ends their blog post with this right right this was the this is the sunday i preached on the rapturing faith the very same and i didn't even know it i didn't even know it so the jeffersonville says it's this simple the mystery through those seven thunders will give the bride rapturing faith but i disagree i believe latter reign gives rapturing faith i believe we've already heard what the seven thunders said through the revelations god gave us now look they say only god through his seventh angel messenger will reveal those seven thunders i believe they already are revealed so jeffersonville is waiting for the thunders to be revealed but we believe they already are revealed praise god so see now what is that now if i'm right then that means there's millions of people following jeffersonville that are waiting for something to happen and it's already happened the prophecies already come and fulfillment and they missed it that's if i'm right now see where i'm putting myself i could be wrong yes sir that's how the rapture is going to be yeah that's what he was saying and everybody's going to be expecting it's already happened yes beautiful yep same thing with john the baptist yep john the baptist came he came six months of preaching died and they're like who they most people miss it even jesus disciples missed it and jesus had to come back and say who was he he was prophet he said more than a prophet he was the messenger of the covenant praise god they missed it yes very good brother very good now see so look the the movement that worships brother brown says we're still waiting for the thunders i say we already heard it praise god according to whose quotes brother branham and they're the ones that say and they believe brother rams quotes it shows they don't hallelujah amen if you want the seven thunders to be revealed to you to give you rapturing rapturing in faith there's no other way to receive that revelation but to get it from god's only vindicated voice for our day not from me not from your local pastor which is true you can't get it from me you get it from the holy ghost but it's through the fifo ministry hallelujah not evangelist or teacher but from god's now look at this god's pastor to the world by pressing play where did brother branham ever say i'm the pastor to the world with thus saith the lord where do you ever say that they asked brother brown i could show you plainly am are you the only one to preach brother branham and he said no he said i'd be an awful candidate for that he said i'm just one pebble on the beach now he was a major prophet no doubt about it but he's saying it's not just me it's all the men of god who are called by the holy spirit need to preach the word of god amen he said we need more of them is what he said amen yeah billy graham yeah he had a good part on justification now that's as far as he went brother he only went to the first step just so you know he only went to first base with god he didn't go to second base of god oh yeah he was a yeah he does he was a mighty preacher of salvation but that's as far as he went he never got into the sanctification holy ghost or gifts of the spirit never got into that yeah but he's godly man godly man he's the one i was telling you he he ran a mile every day to keep himself healthy and then he never went on a trip without another man everywhere he went in every hotel room because he knew the enemy would try to bring a woman into there to try to make a scandal on him real godly man that's a real godly thing he would never meet with the woman alone see that's a good godly thing to do he had some revelation some revelation not enough but he had some so see church brother ram never said he was the pastor to the world and brother ram never said for preachers to sit down the bible never says that so seats an attack on the fivefold ministry the very same sunday i was preaching rapture and faith hallelujah see they're saying preachers sit down shut up and press play that's that's not right if we go back to the bible if jesus says the same yesterday and forever the holy spirit would say my servant brother abraham is dead so joshua you go forward amen you go forward and preach the word of god you possess the land you take the people in to the baptism of the holy ghost amen hallelujah that's what he'd say because he's the same yesterday today and forever now he said uh the leadership says come here all the mysteries revealed brother i'm never said this receive rapturing faith brother brahm said rapturing faith is given just before uh the rapture in the church age book and fill your lamp with oil now you could get the holy ghost at any service if if there's real holy ghost filled people there oh and that's one thing i want to share with you yes uh brother brian asked me brother jesse was there anything i said you disagree with i just said one thing so i'm gonna share it with you and i love brother brian he preached some tremendous messages i said the only thing i disagree with i said uh he brother o'brien said how an amish man could have the baptism holy ghost and i said i don't think so unless he's in the message i said i just disagree with that you remember when he was telling his testimony he said the amish man had the holy ghost he said don't talk to me about politics only talk to me about god i don't know if you remember that or not i said well that's the only thing i disagree with brother i believe you got to be if you have the holy ghost you'll come out of amish churches and come to a message church that's what i believe because that's how it was in the bible the ephesians couldn't get the holy ghost until paul came and prayed for them praise god oh we had a good question about that the other a couple weeks ago too because i believe i see in the bible the life of the holy ghost only flows through the body that's what i see in the bible now like i said i also believe god could send a muslim i met a former muslim who saw a vision of jesus and got saved but then what'd he do he said he got the holy ghost he went to a message church that's that brother i was telling you he was the brother when i was preaching guy under brother austin he would slap the wall and say that's solid brother he said preach it that's solid brother he'd preach it like that i said yeah that is silent amen appreciate that brother but the reason he would do that was because he was he was a muslim he hated god all he knew was allah he was stoned with marijuana and drunk sitting on a couch watching tv he said he turned his head to the left he felt a holy presence come in the room it was jesus christ and a vision floating he said instantly the high left him the drunk left him he fell on his face and wept for hours he said and then he found the nearest church and that was a message church so that's what he'll say yeah that's solid so i said amen amen so a man that saw jesus said my soul my preaching was solid and then brother brahm prayed for sister humes she was healed and said she said you preached just like brother brahma i said amen i've got two witnesses amen one that saw jesus a vision and one that hurt brother branham amen hallelujah thank god amen that's what we need we need the real holy spirit to preach to us hallelujah so see church this is wrong it's so close but it's wrong so far away they use some of the same words some of the same thoughts but it's so far away and when i hear preachers agree with them something's wrong with that that's my personal opinion because brother man said when you got the holy ghost you got a little buzzer inside of you and something goes off something's not right with that i've been watching it here now here's what brother ham said in the fourth seal now look at my note down here out of the 51 there's 51 seven thunder's quotes there's only one that's thus saith the lord this is the one but notice brother ram is not interpreting the meaning of it he just says it has to come it's thus saith the lord so let's read it he said no he's talking about how any revelation has to come with the rest of the word that's the way the church ages and the seals and all the rest of it and when anybody thinks that he has those seven thunders if it don't compare with the rest of the word there's something wrong here see it's got to come thus saith the lord for this is the book this is the revelation of jesus christ in its entirety so i just want to say that plainly church there's no seven thunders quote that's thus saith the lord saying what it is but there's two quotes for brother brahman says it's the revelations already given to us in the seven seals now the biggest seven thunder mistake was joseph coleman's movement out of new york in the 70s 80s and 90s and 2000s and he died in 2012. he said he said the seven thunders were these right here he said these were the seven thunders and he was wrong he was wrong those are not seven thunders the seven thunders are the revelations and the seven seals and those are not the seven seals that's the statue of perfect man totally different but he deceived millions of people with that lie but see brother branham says it's got to be in the word see now that that is in the word but that's not about the seven seals that has nothing to do with the seals there's eight steps there there's only seven seals and the church said there's eight eight there's seven steps of sanctification or seven anointings and then you get the eighth eighth is eternity praise god and the holy ghost is eternal life amen in the soul now jeffersonville uses this quote to make those to make that blog post but it's before brother branham had the understanding about the seals on the back side of the book so this is uh right at the beginning of the seals the first seal also it's before the two times he said the thunders were already revealed in the seven seals so jeffersonville put this in there to try to convince people they're right this quote says and then there's coming forth seven thunders mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and i believe that through those seven thunders will reveal the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it so see this is the quote they used to try to say we need to we need the revelation of the seven thunders we need it we need it but a year and three months after this brother ram said it's already revealed and then the church age book he said it's already been given to us so see see how the if if a pre if it's if he's not a real preacher he'll use a quote and deceive church people say like this they're looking for seven thunders to speak but it's already spoken praise god they're listening out there for something that's not going to come praise god amen and they're calling our move of real preachers and living and saying with the word they're calling they call our move demas they call our move make believers now look at that they call the real word make believers and demons when that's what they're doing praise god how are they going to hear the revelation they won't even budge they cannot be corrected how how can they even be saved i don't know it's up to god it's up to god i'm not the judge god is a judge but how can you go against the word of god like that it's all in god's hands i hope they're saved but i doubt with all my heart that they're born again because when you've got the holy ghost it guides you into all truth praise god and brother like program said you that when that prophet comes which he was talking about his own ministry he won't take one thing away from what paul said amen we need people that believe what paul said amen and they're they're taking away what paul said they're taken away from paul's gospel by exalting brother branham and taking away the preachers and limiting the preachers they're taken away from paul but paul said your curse to change one word of it praise god amen cursed and you're preaching another jesus he said jesus would never say sit down and press play no he'd say go up there and i'm anoint you to preach to my people praise god that's what he would say because that's what the bible says amen now i want to read this here this is the main rapturing faith quote that that i use to understand rapturing faith and i skipped it over when i preach it because you've heard it so many times but i'm going to read it again tonight now austin hasn't heard it so much but everybody else has heard it i'ma read again church age book chapter 10 last chapter what about the true seed of god it will happen just as we've said the people of god are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age brother brandon's ministry in her the true church will be the fullness of pentecost for for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the lord amen so where church where are we hoping to go we're hoping and we're trusting and we're trusting god is going to bring us back to the day of pentecost we're going back to that praise god hallelujah where the whole church where the whole bride has that same experience that they had on the day of pentecost where they can all stand there and say this is that that joel prophesied of amen what you see out of my life what you see in the lives of our brothers and sisters this is what joel prophesied amen the former and latter rain we we see it as the finishing of the great commission praise god a great powerful anointing of the holy ghost to bring revival to our hearts church we all need revival in our minds praise god but before the rapture everybody that's in the bride is going to have that revival in their soul and their mind praise god thus saith the lord according to what how do we know the bride is going to have another day of pentecost because joel 2 23-26 be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god free hath given you the former rain now church do you remember what former rain means anybody remember say it out loud anyone remember teaching all right give her two claps yeah kind of like us kind of like a sunday night here former means teaching god has given you a teaching reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain the teaching rain and the latter rain the harvest rain in the first month now that doesn't mean like the first month of the year like january it means as it did at first so in other words we're gonna get uh the latter rain the holy ghost anointing just like they did on the day of pentecost hallelujah and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and i'll restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer were my great army which i sent among you and ye shall eat them plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that had dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed that's why i don't care who hears my sermons that's why i just let them go out there right put out the videos because that's what jesus did now there's personal things i'm waiting on which is that's why i keep those things secret i'm waiting for more revelation i'm watching i'm watching at some point i will i was praying about it last night as i was going to bed at some point i may put out a video about that to expose some of these lies right but i'm just waiting on it because i'm not a prophet that's why our teachings are our preachings from the word of god our testimonies that's why we put them out there because it's real it's a reality praise god there's nothing to be ashamed of we've studied ourselves to prove them to god we've searched the scriptures amen we know in whom we have believed amen hallelujah god now it says god is going to restore the lutheran age did not restore the church it started reformation the western age did not restore the pentecost agent not restore but god has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it's the restoration god will take the church right back to pentecost of the beginning amen that's where we're going brother open up when we open up our bible read acts chapter 2 that's where we're going praise god amen we're going to a people that will pray and get in one accord and then the holy spirit will come down we've had it a couple of times the holy ghost sweep through this church amen hallelujah but before the rapture it's coming back to that it has to come back to the very conditions where we can say this is that that joel spoke of it's thus saith the lord this is the latter rain when we see dead ones raised back we're going to say that and we start seeing dead people that were saints walk around revealing themselves and their brand new bodies we'll be saying this is the latter rain praise god amen if by god's grace we live to see it because brother graham said it could be 50 years 100 years he said no man knows the day of the hour now notice in verse 25 it tells why we need a restoration the locust cankerworm caterpillar palmer did you know that brothers these three are just the same four stages of the same insect so this is the caterpillar it's the these are the locust stages and that that that locus represents the same horse riders they're the same thing it's just different symbols for the same evil spirit okay so there's four horse riders the first four the white the red the black and the pale those are four four phases of the same antichrist spirit well the bible already foretold it in joel chapter two and it's also in chapter one those same four stages of the antichrist spirit it's already been foretold amen that means our victory has already been foretold as well praise god amen through the line the ox the man the flying eagle our victory has already been prophesied we've got a promise we will overcome praise god hallelujah the locust cankerworm uh kinder worm caterpillar and palmer have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem now we are told that all these insects are the one and the same in different stages that is right they are the antichrist spirit manifested in organization uh think of the catholic church right freemasons right jesuits that's right oh did i tell you that i haven't told this one well i told you guys a while ago i haven't told austin brother tim humes now he's left the message but before he left the message he told me he was driving uh he said a man joined his church and he was really friendly really nice guy he just started believing everything brother branham said and one day brother they got in the car together to go to aaron and the brother said why don't you change some of that holy ghost preaching we don't need all that screaming shouting speaking in tongues you don't need that and brother tim said a voice told him and said ask this man if he's a jesuit he said are you a jesuit now he'd already been there a year right he'd been buddied up to him he looked over and said stop the car i'm getting out he stopped the car my brother tim drove away yeah that's a testimony so see that that's what we're talking about jesuits they infiltrate and they try to influence they're trying to influence the people bringing the bringing the word of god now what's interesting is that he fell away from the message that's interesting but i pray for the brother i love the brother i preached for him twice you know i'd help him in any way i could i sent him a remember that letter we sent out in january uh remember you guys did the letters for us i sent him one i never heard back that's okay it's all in god's time it's up to god it's his choice everyone's got to make their choice i'm choosing my way with the lord's despise for you praise god this message is the word of god hallelujah and denomination and false doctrine through the ages and that poor little root and stock is going to be restored god isn't going to plant a new church but it's going to bring his original planting back to the original seed bless you he's doing it as stated by verse 23 by the teaching or former reign next will come the harvest reign or rapturing faith and the church said so see that's why church that's why i lean on this look he gave us two thus saith the lord he just repeats it thus saith the lord and then two paragraphs later he tells us what is rapturing faith it's harvest rain so the last rain that matures the wheat is the latter rain the last pouring out the holy ghost matures the seed and we experience pentecost all of us all the bride members experience experience our experience just like they did on the day of pentecost amen oh my can you imagine brother austin and cecilia seeing fire over people's heads we might see it who knows we might feel wind come rushing through here praise god hallelujah praise god we might see the dead rays hallelujah amen we might just have a church full of people speaking in times amen hallelujah of course they didn't understand that what they were saying right in most cases i would imagine unless there's an interpretation to come but see that that's why we that's why we stay with god's word every night you know we brother man says you're going to see it in little measures but he said it's really going to get poured out the harvest reign at the time of the squeeze now that's not thus saith the lord but that's that was his guess but this is thus saith the lord this is thus saith the lord or at least it's right around thus saith the lord acts 2 i'm sorry joel 2 23-26 is thus saith the lord that is god is going to bring the bride back to the fullness of pentecost it's the saint the lord praise god amen hallelujah ah one of these days all these sermons i preached it's all it's all worth it and it already is but it's gonna be all worth it praise god if we live to see that ladder rain amen hallelujah then there was gonna know why i was screaming and shouting for all these years preaching and losing my voice and spitting and all these things that's why because we're waiting for god's promise to be fulfilled praise god and we have the truth we have the revelation it's going to happen at some point praise god whether our generation or the next or next it's going to happen because this thus says the lord it's going to happen amen and it's either thus saith the lord or brother and was wrong well look at brother man's bible teaching it was with the word he said he said rome uh i put it on the podcast that i don't know if you heard this our second podcast we put out this week i put on the podcast brother brandon said rome is the mother of harlot and the protestants are the daughters thus saith the lord amen and message preachers have left the message the last few years and said no rome's not the mother harlot she's just a nice church and there's all good there's many good people in there there might be good people in there but the system is cankered it's eaten up from the roots it's perverted praise god it's a cage full of unclean and hateful birds amen and all of god's people must come out of there praise god hallelujah so who are you going to stand with these people that don't have any word or vindication or brother ram vindication bible teaching and thus saith the lord hallelujah i'm standing with god's prophet hallelujah so see brother adam even said now now church remember i remember that sunday i preached on rapturing faith that's why i hang on this one the most because there's a thus like the lord right right in front of it and brother man makes rapturing faith future tense he doesn't make it past tense he makes it future tense praise god and the very last sermon brother brandon preached i believe it was leadership or communion if i'm not yeah communion brother man makes a statement we're going to return to the times of ananias and sapphira in other words we're looking for rapturing faith we're looking for the book of acts and the pentecost of the hearts of the pentecostal fathers to be restored amen you imagine imagine that church walk into the church and your sins will get called out if you walk in there walking here sinning praise god that's he said brother man said that's what we're coming back to amen but i'm glad you know when we have sit in here i'm glad we can speak to those devils and they leave i'm glad about that i'm glad they got to leave anyway by god's grace hallelujah like i was talking about that critical spirit with brother brian god used me and god used brother ryan to tell that critical spirit leave this church in jesus christ's name amen the holy spirit moved out to leaven and we become a new lump praise god amen now anybody think of this i was listening to a sermon this week anybody think of the former rain as doctrine give ear oh ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth the words of my mouth my doctrine shall drop as the what rain and the word former means teaching doctrine reign that's why i believe brother graham's ministry was a was a very good anointing of teaching ministry it was teaching us the mysteries of god it was teaching us the doctrine and then this last anointing the latter reign will give us that rapturing faith hallelujah amen hallelujah praise god now what they're going to say about that you know church that's what i'm saying doctrine has become like a bad word in messenger churches because of all the false teachers over the last 56 years but that don't mean doctrine is wrong it means false doctrine is wrong it means somebody needs to pray and get the holy ghost and be born again and teach true doctrine praise god because that's what the bible says amen remember paul said teach no other doctrine than what i've delivered unto you praise god and then he said keep it without spot unrebukable until the day of the coming of jesus christ amen hallelujah now let me do these quotes and then i'll try to close up here i'm going to skip to slide 78 here i'm just looking at my time there now this is review from six years ago i doubt anybody remember all these quotes can anybody think anybody think they remember all of them and i don't need to preach them okay that's what i thought because i couldn't remember them either now i found it most helpful these are quotes about now the seventh seal being the rapture quotes about the seventh seal is the rapture now some people say some preachers say and i disagree some preachers say revelation 10 1-7 was the seventh seal i don't agree with that there's a few quotes that make it sound like that i don't agree with that i believe the seventh seal is the literal day and hour of the rapture of the bride of jesus christ there's a few quotes people misunderstand but see church i'll say like this we're a minority if we believe this way if we believe the way we believe we're a minority but that's what jesus's church always was a minority so i found it most helpful to start at the end of brother ramsey's ministry and then go back all the quotes of the seventh seal go back to when he preached the seventh seal i found it it's very easy to follow so here's the first one i believe the seven seals a day and the hour of the coming of jesus christ or the rapture so in this quote brother answered the last seal will be the coming of the lord this is broken cisterns i'm just going to skip down here he says talk about the rapture he quotes the rapture right here then he says for the trump of god that last trumpet the sixth one just sounded he's talking about the sixth seal and that last trumpet like the last seal will be the coming of the lord it shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise first just resting until that time so see the last seal is like the coming of the lord the coming of the lord all right next one okay now you know shout voice trump trump is the last trump to the gentiles next quote because the seventh seal there was silence no one knew that well he said what was it that was the minute or hour that christ would come as he revealed it unto us so brother adam says the seven seals been revealed to us what the revelation form of it not the reality form the revelation of it praise god we know what it is it's the day and hour the rapture so the seventh seal was the minute or hour that christ would come as he revealed it to us now he says the seventh seal hasn't opened yet you know that's his coming so see hasn't opened yet that means we haven't experienced the rapture yet because he just said he's revealed it to us right i can go this is the same sermon this is the same sermon in the same sermon he says he hasn't opened it yet and then he says he already revealed it to us in the same sermon so see you gotta really have a discernment of the holy spirit at the same time now as soon as this church the bride is drawn together she's taken up and that mystery of the seventh seal or the seventh seal the mystery of going rapture so some are confused brother man said he revealed to us yet but he also said it hasn't opened yet the confusion leaves when you understand there's three forms to each seal including the seventh seal look at the yellow the reality form hasn't opened yet but the revelation form has and here's i just took this one column see i just took the seven seal which was the seventh thunder the symbol form there's really no symbol other than silence in heaven that's there's really no symbols for the seventh seal there's no real symbols but we know the symbol they're silence that's the only thing that they say the reality is future the day of the hour the ramp said it hasn't opened up the revelation he said what is it it's the rapture coming as he revealed it to us now church does that help by god's grace that's just as plain as i can make it and i've got numerous emails this week saying your teachings are just so easy to understand thank you for putting him out there he said god bless you for that see i knew i was one of the holy spirit to do that i knew it i just there's there are certain things that god does in your life and you just can't get away from it you just follow the leadership of the holy spirit you pray brother austin pray read your bible fast give alms and god's going to lead you praise god you're just going to be a surrender to him he's going to lead you to bless many people so what is the rapture this is the rapture but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only that's the rapture scripture here's another one the seven is always the mystery watch that seven that's the finish that was the coming of the lord heaven was quiet silent nobody moved because jesus said not even an angel of heaven knows when i'll return i don't even know it myself what time the father has put in his mind god alone knows it the spirit said i don't know it then it wasn't revealed when the seventh trumpet sounded or the seventh angel a seal was open there was silence in the heavens see it wasn't given away what would take place see the day and the hour when the seventh seal opened none of the details were told because god's keeping that on his mind but i'll tell you like this church listen and i know you are but i'm just saying it because i'm in that i'm in the habit of preaching now brother braham said the holy spirit said pick up my pen and write and what he said was going to happen right before the squeeze he said america would change its laws to force the bride to stop preaching that's why i tell people that's why i put out that video in the 14 signs of the end times that's what that's what i'm watching i'm watching the purple curtain when i watch the u.s government and their laws i'm watching the purple curtain because it's rome satanic rome in the u.s the beast out of the land all these people are all these preachers are saying oh there's no more thing there's no other signs left before the rapture what about that pick up your pen statement brother random said but man said it was the holy spirit that told him that see again people at church i say like this i think it's pride people they just they're so prideful they think they know everything and they say i believe everything brother ram said and then they ignored the things brother bram said because pride can't be corrected that's exactly right brother can't be correct that's what brian preached to on sunday they wouldn't be washed it will not accept correction they will not be beaten and pressured and they won't go through the fires of tribulation and pressure just daily life that's right yeah most that's the spirit of pride a demon will do that if you won't confess it very good again remember he hid the seventh seal from us he wouldn't do it when the angel stood day by day telling it and he wouldn't do it on that one he said this there was silence in heaven no one knew it it was the coming of the lord so why is there silence in heaven i'm just going to skip to this brother brother now this is just so you know this is why some people disagree with me but i'm using a quote three years before the seals where brother brahm talked about there was silence in heaven he says the bible says the heavens was empty for a space half an hour where is this big fellow god then uh see he's in christ's shore so in other words when the seventh seal opens there's silence in heaven for the space to have half hour brother brown looks in that says why is heaven silent because that big fella come down to meet his bride in the air amen i believe that big fella come down to meet his wife amen hallelujah so heaven's quiet because the big guy left and he come down to earth to meet christ or to meet the bride in the air now i know i'm using a quote three years before but it's the only one that lines up with all the other quotes and the scripture because the bible said the angels cease not day and night saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty why would they stop why would they stop praising god because he left to rapture the bride christ the mystery of god revealed god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open now here look he says it open now remember i showed you the other quote he said it wasn't open now he says it's open there was silence jesus when he was on the earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself see how the seventh seal is the day and hour god has kept this all to himself it's a secret same quote that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space half hour seven thunders out of their voices john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come when he will come it's a good thing that he does it amen hallelujah church i was just going to say can i get amen from everybody are you just thinking about these things and that's good that's good too it's good to be silent brother said god's in silence too same same sermon now the coming of the lord is in a mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's coming see and so is all the mysteries of god waiting for this last day and he's already been completed then he reveals and shows what he's done oh my he never gave his mystery in full which is the day in the hour there was silence in heaven at the time of the rapture he never revealed when he would come the day and the hour skipping ahead okay i'm going to skip ahead one more time here i'm going to slide i'm almost done i want to say a few things 137. you bear with me everybody take a deep breath can we all right now i want you to see how brother man finishes the seventh seal i'm just gonna read a few quotes i just want you to see how humble and how simple brother random is at the end of this sermon i'll tell you you want to talk about a confusing sermon when i first time i heard this i was totally confused but man talks about all these dreams and all these visions and all this getting the king's sword i'm like what does this have to do with the rapture and he tells us they're all signs to let you know the rapture's closed that's what it's all about amen all these dreams all these signs all these experiences to let you know he was god's prophet and that the coming of the lord is at hand in church that's 56 years ago now brother adam just got done talking about all these dreams all these visions and look what he says now i'm hoping and trusting you people realize i'm trying to put all this grace all these testimonies on jesus christ who's the author of all of it look what he goes on to say may you always bear that in mind be a gem in the crown of who jesus christ paul said you're jewels gems of his crown we want to be gems of the crown of jesus christ we don't ever want to put a man in it and look what jeffersonville's doing they say can't not your pastor not anybody just brother brandon just brother brown just brother bran just brother they're putting a man in it and we thank god for the man but they're making brother brahm the whole source of everything they're making him equal to jesus christ he says you forget he said you don't never want to put a man in it you forget anything about me i'm your brother a sinner saved by grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth and i ain't seen that to be humble oh brother jesse he's just saying that to be humble he just said i'm not saying it to be humble that's facts there's nothing to me not one sound thing in me at all and the church said what's he talking about see he he knows the battles believers go through yes your soul never sins but you sin all day in here and here and the church said all day we sin mind battles and everything but at the end of the day we got to say god forgive me and lord take me through the refiners fire amen hallelujah wash me with the fuller soap and remind me that my soul cannot sin hallelujah amen but the grace of god has let my poor dimming eyes look beyond the current of time and see those things yonder and i come back now you won't remember let me exhort you again don't say thank you to anybody at all don't think don't say thinking some minister or something some mortal man because there's nothing good about him because there's not i don't care who he is there's nothing good to any man there's no great man among us yet i can show you many quotes i've saved now on my videos on my phone where all the all these famous preachers are talking about how great they are how they're generals how they're gonna have a special place in heaven next to each other away from everybody else brotherham said let's not ever do that we're no great one don't make one greater than the other not a thing at all to do no sir we're just all human beings don't try to interpret other things don't try to do anything more than just live a re live a close life giving praise and honor to jesus christ everybody understand that now love him with all your heart do you do it oh glory okay all right that's what i'm going to talk about next now so brother man brings us all down and he shows all these thus state of the lords what he say don't try just just live a close life to jesus christ give praise and honor to jesus christ and love jesus christ with all your heart doesn't that sound familiar jesus they asked him what's the greatest commandment love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strength god bless the live streamers now home church people let me know if you want
