========================================

reason characters in the Bible that are tied together it's just it's just beautiful to see how God works this and I'm sure God will speak to us here tonight how many believe the Bibles thou saith the Lord praise God praise God I certainly believe that I believe it's a infallible book I believe it's an eternal book praise God I believe there's so much we're missing that God will have all eternity to show us even more of his love and his grace praise God laying right here on the pages of course as the brides or as the bridegroom's wife many times we can read between the lines praise God and get some wonderful Revelations of God's love to us so this is part 10 colossian the book of Colossians we'll start Colossians chapter 4. we finished with verse 4 last Wednesday if I wasn't mistaken that's what God has done he's given us a door of utterance there in Amish Country our prayers that God will make the mystery of Christ manifest in our lives praise God appear to the saints that Jesus Christ is in our lives we'll start with verse five let's just read verse five and six here by God's grace now have you be seated Colossians 4 verse 5. let's read verses uh I'm sorry what did I say I meant five and six let's read verses five and six together forgive me five and six let's begin on three one two three walk in wisdom toward them that are without Redeeming the time let your speech be always with Grace season with salt that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man now let's bow our heads one more time here if you have any on your heart let's make a note into God uplifted hand or a

Lord God we pray your holy spirit will speak to each and every person Lord God Lord You're the only preacher Lord God help me to yield to you Lord God and may you hear through each one of us God may we be able to take some things away from this message that we can directly apply to our lives tonight and tomorrow Lord let's not be hearers of the word but let us be doers of the word we pray Lord God I know you help us do that Lord as your bride we want to grow in Grace and knowledge in you Lord God we want to be diligent Lord God make our calling election sure and father we know there will be an entrance made to us in the Kingdom of your dear son the Lord Jesus Christ so father God we thank you for this night anoint me anoint each person Lord Here For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so let's look to uh the Lord here from the book of Colossians and like I said I'll tie a few important stories together as you may you may have already known here by the grace of God I'm just checking any text sometimes I get text during the song service okay all right so let's look at part 10 here and we may finish tonight like I said we may we'll see how far we go by God's grace so chapter one we had Paul's greeting his prayer for the Saints that's the prayer I prayed over the Amish community down there that they would be complete in all the will of God then we see Jesus Christ Supreme deity we see the power of Jesus cross now this will come in to play later I'm sorry yeah I have quotes today sorry about that um in other words I want you to notice how does he address a church that's mostly Gentile there are some Jews here I want you to notice how does Paul write to mostly gentiles it's not something to consider as we come to the close of this book here you'll see why in just a moment here so he greets them prays for them he focuses on the Supreme deed of Christ remember as creator of all things all things were made by him and for him praise God and the Bible said the fullness of the godhead dwelt in him bodily amen and then we saw the mystery of Christ in us then he ends chapter one with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a mystery hid from ages church I don't know about you but I'm glad I live in the age when this is revealed praise God I appreciate the Old Testament Saints but they were lacking power that we have right and thank God God can spare our lives from some of the scars that they had to go through but remember it's all God's choice we're not better we're just chosen for this time right but I just want to thank God that I could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost on this side hallelujah praise God just to save my life from shame and despair and uh and just disgrace by the grace of God now of course all my sins are disgraced but uh the major sins we'd say like you know Moses's murder Abraham or David's murder adultery uh you know you get into some of these uh Old Testament Saints and some of the testimonies they had you know of course they were wonderful Saints as well but I'm thankful for the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what I'm trying to say chapter two we looked at the treasures all the treasures of God are in Christ the godhead and then we saw there's three areas they had to overcome and this I say church this fits our church more than maybe other letters Paul wrote think about that you know the galatian church there's all legalism legalism legalism Jews getting back in right you must be circumcised that doesn't deal with us right we're not bound Jewish teachers coming in or trying to get us back to the law but we are battling enticing words right as we saw with other churches you know people falling away or you know leaving the truth you know enticing they're enticing words right they're tempting they sound uh they sound sane they sound legitimate right but it's not taking in the full truth of God's word right and then overcome philosophies now it depends which you know depends which uh kind of depends what what uh kind of family you're in whether you learn about philosophy growing up or not you know so some people might be affected by that if you're a reader you know if you were raised in a in a educated family we'd say you might battle that or Jewish legalism again that's not really us uh it's not really impacting us but it does impact the Amish community because they are they were so legal it was similar to like a legalism that the Jews would have where they controlled your closed colors you know your horse colors whether you can have electricity in the house or outside the house or wherever you can have it you know it was just so much legalism man-made Creeds well you're only holy if you do this you're only holy if you do exactly what I say and it was it was it was the like Jesus said it's the Gentiles lording over the people right so they live under fear rather than freedom praise God the only one we got to fear is Jesus right fear fear of God it's fear but in the fear of God is also happiness amen praise God but you know you've gotten illegalism when you fear the man you feel you fear of your pastor more than God we're supposed to love one another respect one another but the only one word to fear is God right fear of the Lord but see that's how denominations start that's how even Cults are right they fear the man a cult will fear the man more than God really because they think that man is God's image to them on this earth right uh and then you know here's something where we may battle you know mysticism you know people say well I had a dream or I saw a vision or I talk to angels you know what happens in the message you know people I had a dream of brother Brandon well that doesn't matter how does it line up with the word of God you know I've had a dream about brother random too but you know you know we can't take everything as thus saith the Lord we got to take everything back to the word we've got to wait on the Lord and then we'll renew our strength that we wait upon the Lord praise God just wait on it I'll pray about it those are four great words I'll pray about it and whenever God answers that it takes all the pressure off you right you say I'll pray about it I'm just waiting on God takes all the pressure off we don't have an answer yet it's not up to me it's up to God it takes all the pressure off you amen trusting in God and I remember asceticism but chapter four is where we're at now you know uh the we look at the Believers I'm sorry chapter three no we're not on this we already passed this the Believers focus on the Heavenly Kingdom set your affection on things above and the specifics we need to mortify in Christian Living now this is important because this was mostly a gentile Church and Gentiles were given over to fleshly lusts right and so they would need a longer section on gotta crucify this got to die to this don't do because it was commonplace did you know Church in Rome it was commonplace for men to have boys that they would have by their side with them all the time and those were the boys they abused in very very awful ways they were just they would just be with them all the time and everybody knew it and they would have open you know brothels I mean even way more way more than what we have here it was just a common thing for men to walk in and walk out and just common thing for women like like Solomon said the women was standing in the corners and the streets you know it was just common now there's certain parts of that you know you get down to Akron but this was much more commonplace it was an extremely Wicked place so for Paul to come around and say that's you got to be crucified of that that was a real High Calling praise God but that's what they needed because they were Gentiles right they weren't Jews a lot of these or some Jews but they were mostly gentiles and then we saw how Christianity is best expressed in the home amen hope your home life has been pretty good and since we pre-shown that by God's grace or I should say better she'll be better by God's grace now here we are with chapter four uh we started on verse five and six uh he gives instructions to the Masters remember because you have a master over you and then he requests he requests prayer and he gives admonition for prayer so he encourages them you need to pray and also pray for us and then he ends the book by greeting all these individuals and he gives us farewell so we'll kind of see uh we'll see how this uh plays out here by God's grace so verse 5 walk in wisdom toward them that are without Redeeming the time so church we got a daily ask God for wisdom for interacting with sinners and this will protect your time you know how many times have we seen people come into our church and then some friend who's not a Christian will draw them away we just seen it actually recently right uh wisdom though would cause people to make a to make the best decisions so they make the best use of their time so in this case in our church people that come into our church should choose to spend more time with us because we're the people that's going to build up their faith right if somebody new comes in here and but they spend their most time at the Catholic Church well who's going to influence them more now we can't force anybody but we sure can invite people right so we get the wisdom of God be careful who we're spending our time with because he says redeem the time make the most of your time make sure your time is serving you and not you serving the time right I'm just a slave to this situation no you need to rule over that situation and bring it into subjection to God's word amen don't waste your time you don't want to live your life with regrets well I wasted a whole year on that you know I've had different people tell me over the years well one one person in particular a real saying of God but he was telling me like people would come into his life and seem act like they're interested in the message but then they would just you know take up all their time on the phone complain cause problems and he realized later this person the devil's just anointing this person to steal my time he didn't have time with his family like he wanted to or time with God and he just saw the pattern it happened once well it happened again with a different person then this person come back and see what wisdom would tell you protect your time if you're going to complain I don't have time to talk to you right Church the Bible said Mark then that caused divisions you know if they won't repent you've gotta you have to redeem your time you only got one Life Church I only got one opportunity to serve God and to make the most of my time especially I have to be careful how how much time I give to people outside of the church all right now we saw a couple years ago there was a family in our church and every time they would have their natural family come in they would miss church well that's a perfect example that was not wisdom they skipped Church to spend time with their natural family that's not wisdom that's folly right now I'm being a little rebuking here but it's the Holy Spirit Church it's not me really it's the Holy Spirit that's what the word of God says it's an awful testimony to say I'm a Christian and then in front of your family deny the word of God right we've got to redeem the time make the most of your time especially be wise how you act around those without those out in the world so he ends this letter by telling these Gentiles who they used to give all their time to lustful desires Pleasures all these things he said make the most of your time don't waste your time be especially careful with people that are not in the message right or not a real believer in Jesus Christ be careful how much time you spend with them because if you're not careful it'll make you waste your time praise God now just let me give you an idea about the definition of wisdom so we got to use we have to use Broad and full intelligence we have to look for the sages advice we gotta look for the we gotta look for the best advice we got to walk in the best advice we can get walk in wisdom especially with the Sinners out in the world look for the best advice from where from the word of God right here buy back your time sorry my pen fell there happens sometimes I'll put in my pocket walking wisdom walking the skill and your management of your affairs right walking wisdom walk in devout and proper Prudence in intercourse with men not Disciples of Christ so be very careful they're not Disciples of Christ how much time we're spending with them because really they are they're not your friends because when push comes to shove and you want to tell them about Jesus they're going to listen to you and when you're hurt you're struggling who's going to help you out probably your Christian family is going to help you out right that's what I've seen at least in my life right look for knowledge and practice of requisites for Godly and upright living walk in Godly living walk in upright living another definition is supreme intelligence walk in the Supreme intelligence of the Holy Spirit I like that the wisdom of God as evidence informing and executing councils so walk in God's wisdom look for the best advice possible amen now remember this should remind us of the book of wisdom get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake or not and she shall preserve thee how many want to last a long time serving God get wisdom it'll preserve you right I preached a few weeks ago and God preserves the Saints right what preserves God's Saints God's wisdom does the best advice the most skillful advice how to live your life love wisdom and she shall keep thee so if you love her she'll love you she'll hug you right back you hold on to her she'll hold on to you praise God wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom with all thy getting get understanding exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to honor when thou Dost Embrace her now who doesn't want to be honored praise God who doesn't want the Lord to say Well done Lena well done Austin well done sister Hua sisters there you know we could go through everybody here tonight we've got a small church I could I could do that but you understand I could I use all of you every now and then God honors those who embrace the wisdom of God and she shall give to thine head an ornament of Grace remember we're talking about being crowned with the right thing crying with God's loving kindness and mercy a Crown of Glory she shall deliver to you so if you hold on to her if you hold on to her she'll hold on to you and then she'll bring you a crown God's wisdom let's not waste our time if any of you lack wisdom how do I get it brother Jess let him ask of God that give it to all men liberally you know Church many times they answered our problems it's just more prayer I'll say that again many times Church the answer to all of our problems is just talking to God about it because he gives it out freely really gives it up and he uprighteth or not I'm sorry and that wisdom uprighteth not and it shall be given him but we've got to ask in faith nothing wavering see that's where it's hard because right you were pressured we got to make a decision or maybe I'm on a time commitment here but we got to wait on God and not doubt God's going to bring the answer I just got to keep trusting God keep waiting on God for he that waverth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed I don't I don't know what to do I don't know what to do with the situation I don't know do yes you do wait on God hallelujah that's what you need to do amen and the Bible said You shall seek me and buy me when you search for me with all your heart so we've got to ask God for wisdom but then we got to go seek it out too okay just well I'm going to say a prayer at church or I'm going to come up for prayer or I'm going to need her at the altar and then walk away and forget about God you got to see God about it praise God we want to walk in wisdom if we want to redeem the time if you want the principal thing we got to invest time into getting it praise God Hallelujah verse 6. let your speech be always with Grace which is good will sweetness charm Mercy season which is Savory or prepare prepare with salt now if anybody knows about spices it's the sisters in here right sisters could give us a good lesson on this natural to spiritual so our speech has to be seasoned with salt that you may know how you ought to answer every man in other words a sister when she makes a meal she knows I want it to taste like this so I've got a season now I got to put this and this and I gotta marinade that's all I really know about cooking right there that's on I can't tell you anything else sprinkle I don't know flip it over I don't know roast it Grill it that's about all I got I'm out that's all I got but you know what you want to you what you want to taste like so you make preparations to get it there same thing with your words you know you're going to come into contact with the person you're going to have this discussion you've got to season it with salt amen you got to make it Savory you got to prepare the scriptures amen hallelujah got to prepare the word of God now there are times where Jesus says don't prepare what you're going to say that's when you're brought before the judges and the magistrates and they're going to kill us or put us in court if they ever do Jesus says in those cases don't prepare anything he said the father will tell you what to say in that hour praise God but for other times when we're interacting with people he says always have sweetness Mercy charm goodness right have your words seasoned with Mercy you know what you know what really drives people away when message people get really judgmental right and they just rebuke them right to their face right you know it's just it just kind of turns people it turns a lot of people away right there's a reason you know when Austin come back I treat them in a certain way right because I know how I was treated when I came to the message I was treated with a lot of love and grace I wasn't treated by a legalistic you've got to believe this and you got to do this and fear this you know fear yeah I wasn't I was I was showing the love of Christ so we get meet new people in here I try to do the same thing I try to say I try to season my words with a lot of Mercy in it right because God has been merciful to me praise God who hasn't God been merciful to see when you when you prepare the right words when you when you season the food the right way you you know you're going to get the right results so when you prepare the words you study the word you memorize the word Senator said oh now you know how you can give an answer to every man and I just found this if I just stay studying all the time listening to quotes and talking to Brothers emailing about the Bible pretty soon I'll use those in a conversation like in a day or two it never fails it never fails I'm just talking about something pretty soon comes up just talking about that the other day praise God word and due season how pleasant it is hallelujah a word in due season how the right one you need it praise God in other words just keep set your affection on things of God right seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be what added unto you get everything else put God first put seasoning on your words you're going to get some good you're gonna get a good result from that praise God just like we get some good suppers from Acacia and Mommy whoever's cooking Emma's been doing a good job there season it right the right way see every person needs a specific answer relative to their past experience right they're past their upbringing like with the Jews and Gentiles we'll get that in just a moment so see we gotta just like food is prepared we've got to ask God to prepare us for answers how we ought to answer people praise God now here's what Paul says though I be free from all men yet I made myself a servant unto all that I might gain the more you know you know how you win souls you know how we need can win souls becoming a sermon to more people so we just seen him with the Amish right I I had to sacrifice some time we have to sacrifice time away from my family I gotta sacrifice time away from the church I become a servant to them and by God's grace some Souls get baptized praise God we've got to become servants to all and unto the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews and to them that are under the law as under the law that I might gain them that are under the law now he's not saying he's going to sin but he's going to take the mindset and he could how would a a Jew have to deal with this with this truth about Christianity from how he was raised what would his natural response be and what could I say that could help them understand the truth from their perspective for people that live holy people that sacrifice all the time constantly sacrifice and say daily prayers so much legalism what could I say to them to get them to see the freedom of the Holy Spirit the liberty of the Holy Spirit or like many of us not all of us but many of us were raised in Heathen atmospheres what can I say to get them to forsake the pleasure of the world and see that the greatest pleasure is Jesus Christ and become more diligent and dedicated and consecrated see we're trying to find the middle of the road here by God's grace not Jewish legalism but also not foolishness and wasting time we want to redeem the time praise God because the days are evil remember I said last week I thought it was a blessing I thought it was a Holy Spirit you do nothing for salvation but after that you got a lot to do after you get saved praise God die every day Hallelujah seek God first amen hallelujah show diligence every day serve God with all your heart soul mind and strength give God everything you've got praise God make it a sacrifice of praise make your life a free will offering Hallelujah to them that are without the law as without law not being or sorry being not without law to God but under the law to Christ that I might gain them that art without law see look he's still under the law of Christ see the holy spirit is the law remember the law of the spirit if you obey the Holy Spirit he anoints you if you disobey he you you grieve him and his anointing leaves you the mind right that's the law but if you repent and honesty real quick then he'll come right back to you praise God Hallelujah he's merciful praise God he's faithful praise God he he renews our minds day by day Hallelujah if that's the law of the Holy Spirit people say I'm not under the law well I beg your pardon the Bible said I'm under the law of Christ and Romans 8 says I'm under the law of the spirit praise God there's always a law there's laws everywhere there's laws of gravity there's laws of everything thermodynamics I don't know anything about those but there's laws everywhere I praise God I used to when I was in college but I forgot it all verse 22 to the week became Maya's week that I might gain the week and I'm I have made all things to all men that I might by all means save some I like this how Paul says I'm all things to all men so think about that how could I uh how could God use me to help a a Jew how could God use me to help a ranked sinner how could God use me to help the Amish I never thought that would be me to be honest with you how could God use me to help uh message Believers in a tape Church I'm trying to help him right now actually making videos for him how could God use me to uh to help the prostitute off the street or the wealthy CEO that comes into the restaurant Escape their sin how could God use me to do that praise God you can become all things to all men all you got to do is prepare the right words amen season them with God's Saul Hallelujah store up the word of God in your heart and God will give you the words to say in that season praise God so see look let's compare Paul's letter to the Hebrews to this letter to the Colossians real quick here if we can now this is hard to read but this is from the Bible project now they got some strange Doctrine so I'm not saying they're all good they're not the nice thing is there's no ads on YouTube that's what I like about it okay so the main idea of Hebrews uh chapter one and two talks about Jesus the angels and the Torah chapter three and fours on Moses in the promised land chapter five six and seven is on priests in Melchizedek do you see a lot of this there's a lot of Jewish Jewish content showing how the Old Testament connects to the New Testament right chapters 8 9-10 sacrifice and Covenant chapters 11 12 and 13. uh God's word hope for a new creation Jesus is the Eternal priest and there's lots of warnings about you must be steadfast or else you could fall away there's warnings you must keep the faith until the end right you must receive the you must press on towards the end of your faith people can crucify the son of God afresh how much more sower punishment will they have to those that just do despite the spirit of Grace and put Jesus Christ to an open shame why because the Jews know better they've been taught these things their whole life they're raised according to scripture the Shema Hebrews 6 4-6 now the book of Colossians though which we just went through chapters one and two is on the exalted Messiah then we get into Paul's sufferings and chapter two uh the pressure is to turn away all the Temptations right the mysticism the polytheism of the Jewish legalism as we just I just put it in a word form earlier and then we must live a resurrected life and then uh the conclusion what a different letter it is compared to the Hebrews see Paul could become all things to all men you need a lesson on the Old Testament types Paul Paul Was Your Man he could tear it up on all the types of the Old Testament he'd wear you out with all the types Moses and Joseph and Mo and he and Aaron and all these Miriam I can take all the types praise God but he could also relate to the Gentile so you got to be really careful with these things that are in the Gentile world uncleanness and sins and sexual or immorality all these things you really got to watch out for that so he was able to craft his message to the right person that's that's what I'm praying for you know each time I go down to the Amish Lord give me a word that would set the legal is free Lord use me to show the freedom of the Holy Spirit the joy that it brings but also a balance because at some point we got to have some order we can't be so anti uh anti-order that we just have no order and well then we'll let the women preach or whatever you got to have an order praise God you've got to have some type of order but see the first thought might be well we're free and others now there's no more order there's no more but God's the author of order he's not the author of confusion it never ceases to amaze me we can have the same format for service we can pray before service then we can sing songs then we can do song specials then we can preach and then we can sing and pray and God's spirit will fall almost every time after service amen because God likes art or praise God or we don't have to do that and God's spirit can still fall but but we we choose to have order because we can see it in the word of God hallelujah just so you know I'm not open to changing the order I'm not open to that I'm sure I'm not close to that I'll be happy to change order somebody feels led to the Lord but that's what it means it's a leading of the Lord now that's a challenge now who's going to stand up and say I got the leading the Lord because most time everybody sits back and what does brother Jesse feel led to do well thank you I appreciate that I'm not always perfect you know and as the I'm the local Elder right so everybody expects me to have the lenient Lord and by God's grace I'm doing the best I can to follow in you Lord praise God like I felt led to have the Napoleon Services was that a leading the Lord I believe so each time he said these guest ministers come in and it speaks right to our lives that was just God's leading God's grace God's love to us God's mercy so see the book of Hebrews is directed mainly to Jews so Paul became as a Jew to the Jews the focus was on Jesus is fulfilling the many Old Testament types there's numerous warnings about losing salvation since they knew better but the Colossians focuses on Jesus deity and wrong creation overcoming their specific spiritual Temptations and how to live for Christ by mortifying the Flesh of desires there's more assurance and less warnings in this book right so different group different crafting different message right you see it in brother random sermons all the time sometimes he's preaching a Four Square Church and he won't ball he won't ball out women preachers in that church ever noticed that or he'll be in a group of businessmen and who really ball out businessmen you know he'll just bring and he'll try to he'll try to craft the or uh craft the message write to what a businessman Investments and everything and honest deals with the with business he'll just he'll just uh you know craft that message just exactly to what they need he'll cater that message right to what they need or if he's at the Pentecostal people who bring down you gotta grow your hair out and wash the makeup off your face you know there's he can just we just have to believe he was led by the Holy Spirit to preach what the people needed praise God that's what we have to find we have to find how can I become how can you and I become all things to all men so I'll just use you know whoa and Zero's example their mom's really hurting so we can pray Lord how can they be all things to all people how God how can I be a vessel to someone who's hurting after they lost a spouse that's real that's real Christianity right there praise God can I how can I be that or you got a really awful boss or something like that really vulgar boss how can I be all things to all men I don't want to partake in his sin or her sins or his but I'm around them all day Lord season my words with some salt or whatever you'd pour on there whatever you'd scoop on there trying to imagine what the people cook with whatever that comes by prayer that comes by reading the word of God Lord give me the word to say to this person and everybody just said this was thus saith the Lord right okay okay everybody still believes that okay again praise God so do I yeah for the second pencil pen there really good dropping dance verse seven all my statement look at this look how Paul was such an open book all my state shall take us declare unto you the Colossians who is a beloved brother and a faithful Minister and fellow servant Lord so Paul is going to send a preacher he's in prison he's going to send a preacher and tell the Colossians all about his life maybe his financial condition his health his recent sermons he's been preaching from Jim because he gets visitors right he can preach to them Paul says all my state in other words my life is an open book tell them how in other words share with them how a prophet of God serves God in prison see that's what I love about brother Ram's tapes we get to see all brother Rams state is that right Church you can see the great anointed services and then the Humble House services okay good to see the questions and answers with his home Church you know and also brother but other sermons brothers getting translated overseas and you hear the translations whole different different message different sermon totally different message to them all my state he says I like this Paul was an open Ministry now I just thought this too you know sometimes I'm a little nervous about churches that don't put their services online not all the time but I've noticed in a few cases some that don't put their services online all the time I get a little concerned about that what are you trying to hide right in a lot of cases people do hide things now let me balance that out sometimes I don't put all of our sermons on because I have to call out some specific things right you have to give some specific details but there's a reason sometimes people don't let all their state known look at Brother Bear look at all those tapes he let out church and it's from beginning to end prayer line and everything that's pretty honest that's pretty that's pretty transparent right Joe Biden said I'm going to be the most transparent president well of course he hasn't been but but look at the Christian he's so transparent I'm telling you I'll tell you guys all about me that's why I like doing this questions answers I'll tell you my honest opinion because I want to tell everybody in front of everybody I don't want to have this well this is just for amen and who over here and this just for Austin Lena over here well it's just for Emma here I like it now sometimes there are personal things we got to talk about but in most cases I want I want the truth to go out to everybody praise God like brother man said he said make sure you talk about other people as if they were standing right there right so that's why I like this openness I like this transparency I like the transparency about that you can ask me any question I'm in the hot seat right there you can ask me any question boy it sure does get hot sometimes verse eight and nine whom I've sent unto you for the same purpose so tickiest was set for that same purpose that he might know your estate and comfort your hearts so look at this a Christian prophet and a local church that they're ministering to they want to share how they're doing right now Church you and I both know sometimes we don't have enough time all the time and we were I'll say like this we rarely have enough time to really talk about how we're doing how was your week sister I hope you're good brother how was your week oh it's real good bye guys no that's me but do we do we really get to know the all the estate that we have sometimes not all the time that's why there's nice times where we really get to sit down and get some fellowship those are some really wonderful times and I know we don't have time every service to do that but look at the prophet of God he says tell them all about my life tell them about my Ministry everything tell them all my state but I want to hear all their state too because we can Comfort one another well brother Austin I didn't know you were struggling with that thanks for sharing that let me encourage you with this brother remember Austin say brother Jess I didn't know you were struggling with that let me pray for you can I pray for you brother Jesse I just heard brother man I just heard a scripture here this might be encouragement to you see there's going to be these special times when we get to really share what we're going through and that's when we can Comfort one another so what's the opposite of comfort discomfort so that's why Paul did this so the people would not be discomforted am I the only one going through this and I don't like this I feel like I'm backslinger I feel like I feel like uh God's So Far Away Paul wanted them to be comforted Comfort your hearts having a discomfort heart is an awful condition to be in so again we see look at the power of Fellowship look at the power Fellowship it takes away your discomforts oh I know brother so-and-so is praying for me thank God my wife prayed for me or my husband prayed for me oh I appreciate that that's such a blessing amen now see also Paul was not hiding anything like a lot of churches do or a lot of Christians they hide things he didn't he didn't say well tell them half of my estate what's going on he said tell them all the things going on that's all the things that you see does every church have good and bad or does or not every church has good and bad even your pastor makes mistakes dude yes yes all the time all the time every church has good and bad right but Paul said go ahead and share all the estate now think about if if Paul were to let's go over to the book of Timothy now Paul would have had to share the estate of Timothy he said oh our brother Timothy he's sick all the time could somebody pray for him he's drinking he's drinking wine for a stomach's sake but just just let him know he's sick all the time he gets he's often sick Paul why don't you just speak the word of God because I'm not led to do that yet right just tell just tell it like it is right tell it like it is that's kind of what Ben the rod was dealing with there was really inspiring you know every church has problems the thing we don't want to do is let Satan isolate us sounds like a sermon right there isolation we don't want to be isolated but Paul said go ahead and tell them all my state that I'm in now here's a beautiful uh story that gets tied in with colossi who's read the book of Philemon lately okay so he now he starts naming some names right tikius and now he goes with onesimus so onesimus lives in colossi who's onesimus he's the runaway slave from Philemon right so Tiki has shared all the things about Paul's estate wanted to learn the state of Colossians Paul wanted them comforted and now onesimus now look Paul calls onesimus he's that faithful brother and beloved brother who's one of you look at these words a faithful beloved man but Church did you know before this he was a runaway slave everybody know that he wasn't so faithful before Church some of us aren't always faithful all the time right but look how Paul builds him up look how Paul points out the good aspects of onesimus he could have said yeah that former backslider of Vanessa missing he costs filemon all these thousand dollars hundreds of thousands I don't know ten thousand Maybe go to the book of felima let's go there I got a couple verses up here it's right after Titus after Timothy Thessalonians Timothy Titus then Philemon so anessimist was philemon's runaway slave who got saved under Paul's Ministry so he ran away he was a sinner ran away from Philemon Philemon was a wealthy man in colossae he was wealthy enough to have servants or slaves this is interesting that Paul was writing about Masters treat your slaves the right way because there were some rich Christians in the colossi church they're rich enough to have slaves see so there was four churches there was rich churches right more wealthy churches more poor churches God has a variety and notice the book of Philemon so he's writing in verses one through three to the church in their house now let's go down to uh verse 10. Philemon only one chapter verse 10. I beseech thee for my son onesimus whom I begotten my bonds oh let's stop right there son this is a sinner who's run away but Paul lets him know now I was able to preach to him and he became a son of God hallelujah praise God so Paul uh there it is Paul became all things to all men Paul became The Giver of the word and due season to a runaway slave a sinner God gave Paul think about that God gave him the words to save a soul of a runaway Fugitive a law breaker but because Paul fellowship with Jesus so much amen God gave him that words that were seasoned with salt praise God able to win his soul oh it's beautiful while he was in his bonds while he was in prison he won a soul praise God which in time passed was to the unprofitable because he ran away but now profitable to thee and to me whom I have sent again thou therefore receive him that is mine own bowels so with just like we receive onesimus back into the church just like it was my own heart like it was me love him like you love me that's quite a thing quite a thing who's ever been but don't raise your hands but who's ever been betrayed here for we'd say thousands of dollars how easily could you trust that person again invite them back into church yes son come on in brother you stole 30 grand off me come on in yes come on let me let me treat you as as a brother like everybody else it'd be hard wouldn't it let's be honest okay be difficult runaway slave a lot you know lost all that money lost my investment verse 13 whom I would have retained with me that is thy stead he might administered unto me and the bonds of the Gospel so he was ministering to Paul but without thy mind would I do nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou should receive him forever so he left for a little bit so he could come back for the rest of his life is that something that's her sometimes you got to leave where you were to have an experience with God and then come back to where you were right verse 16 not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved don't look at him as a slave anymore runaway slave look him at his a loved brother the one who betrayed Philemon your your faithful brother in the church the rich brother in the church especially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and the Lord if thou count me therefore a partner receive him as myself so we see this runaway slave like you would receive me How would how how would you act if brother random came in here if he was still alive and he preached for us today how would you act well I think I would be like sir I think I'd be really really sincere I don't think I'd be playing in my pockets or two of my nails that's a good one oh I don't think I'd be acting be carnal I think I'd be on just the very most reverent Hallelujah yeah we have a guest Minister coming here you know how we Act that's okay that's why there's different times and seasons for everything but Paul says receive this runaway slate this young convert receive him like you receive a prophet that's something that is something give him the honor give him the love you give a preacher a minister who's the Christian you admire most don't say it but maybe it's brother Brooks or brother cam or sister so-and-so brother so and so think of the honor think of the honor the respect you give to them then Paul says give this same respect to a new Christian who's betrayed the family in the church now they've got to have the fruits of repentance first which onesimus did he was willing to stay there and be a servant to a prisoner Paul like that's my whole job my whole life has just help this prisoner in the jail you know that Swiss is like I'll do that but Paul's like no go back to the home Church make this right Hallelujah these are some beautiful words here verse 18. if he hath wrong thee or o the ought put that on mine account there was a cost for runaway slaves right there was imprisonments there was fines Paul said if he costs you anything by running away if you missed out on having that uh his his Services as indentured servant or whatever slave whatever he was if you missed out on whatever that terms the service are put that money on my account and I'll pay that off now I'm not a business I'm not an owner where I I know how much an employee makes but think about if you knew how much an employee makes and that employee suddenly vanishes how much money is that going to take how much money is that going to cost a person or the company Paul said put all that on my account I'll pay for it he must have been a pretty good Tent Maker right he must have some money save he was in jail I don't know how I could make money in jail maybe had some savings somewhere he said put that on my account verse 9 19. I Paul have written it with my own hand I'll repay it think about that his brother's got a big debt but I'll pay it off I'll be I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides so now Paul goes into the spiritual I'll gladly pay his natural because you owe me your soul spiritually that's what he's saying in other words you wouldn't be saved unless God sent me to preach the gospel to you isn't that something you forgive this brother his natural debt because you owe me a greater than that isn't that some persuasion right there Boys Everybody thinking in here real deep huh Paul doesn't use this language very often but here he says you owe me your very life maybe I don't know if he saved his life naturally but one thing's for sure if he preached the gospel he saved his soul isn't that something look at the depths of this verse 20. yay brother let me have joy of thee in the Lord refresh my bowels in the Lord in other words make me happy refresh my heart by forgiving this brother who you know basically Did You Wrong do it for me look at that church do it for me forgive him because you want to refresh me now that's eternal life right there that's eternal life my goodness verse 21 now how did Paul feel about philemon's ability to forgive having confidence in thy obedience I run into thee knowing that thou will also do more than I say I know you do more than that because you love me that's that's a lot church that is a lot hmm you know what they really wanted verse 22 is what he really wanted but with all prepare me also a lodging for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given even unto you so really Philemon really just wanted to see the prophet again if only we could have the prophet visit us he could Lodge with us oh if I could just hug Paul one more time if I could just hear one of his all-night sermons one more time one of those late Wednesday night services one more time praise God Hallelujah this is beautiful this is profound forgive him the natural debt because you owe me spiritual debt Church let's not go around pointing fingers at other people like you owe me you owe me that's not why I'm preaching this I'm preaching the show the level of forgiveness that Paul required or Paul asked for in this church and to look at the spiritual blessings as more important than the natural blessings praise God I could say something here about magazine I've actually left over there Glory let's finish this chapter or finish this book here aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluted to you now aristarchus must have been he shared Paul's imprisonment so he must have been a preacher who was arrested and Marcus sister son to Barnabas touching whom he receive Commandments if he come unto you receive him so he's greeting aristarchus and then Marcus now Marcus this is the same John Mark that Paul once refused to travel with do you know that there's a young man this this Mark gentleman Paul said I'm not even traveling with him right and Barnabas said why not you should let's he's going with us Paul's like no Pharmacy's like yeah no well then fine we're going Separate Ways two holy ghost film men two holy ghost film men couldn't agree on who to travel with did God stop moving amongst their Ministries did God stop blessing their Ministries no God kept blessing them answering their prayers Miracles Hallelujah the love of God the word of God the Holy Spirit kept flowing church sometimes our differences are are there's a purpose behind our differences so we can go accomplish different things God's called us to do or sometimes you're not going to agree with people but that's how God wants it to be so God can use you over here and use somebody else over there let's read to acts 15 36 we got time tonight we got 1536 I preached a message on this over in Albion years ago 1536-41 and some days after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go and visit our brother in every city where we would have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do let's go visit the brothers and see how they're doing verse 37 and Barnabas determined to take with them John whose surname was Mark this is the Marcus here but Paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them from pampilia and went not with them to the work so Mark had already made this decision before he didn't go work with them previously and Paul remembered oh he didn't go with us the last time so I'm not taking him with me this time he turned down my offer last time I'm not taking him this time verse 39 and the contention was so sharp between them that they just departed asunder one from the other so Barnabas took Mark and sailed into Cyprus and Paul chose Silas and we all know what happened to Paul and Silas right they got locked up and at midnight they start praising God and God lose their chains praise God did God leave them no God continue to bless Barnabas he has a great history of serving Jesus I think he died as a martyr as well but God allowed this sharp contention sharp contention well I just don't see eye to eye with brother so and so that's okay sometimes that happens God kept doing Supernatural works so we can agree to disagree as long as we do it love and kindness but it's going to be awful Sharp you might say some sharp words of somebody Hallelujah but it's got to be done in love Paul chose Silas and departed and being recommended by the Brethren unto the grace of God and we can now see uh that Paul says receive John Mark so now we can see the wounds have been healed the trust look at that the trust has been restored church have you ever lost trust with somebody it's very hard to get it back right Paul's like I do not trust this man but now by this time I think this was his second or third mission missionary journey now he's like greet Marcus John Mark and receive him because last time he gave you Commandments receive mark receive him it's not well just avoid Mark don't let him participate in the service don't let him preach you know he's received mark now now now he's helpful to me for the ministry and Jesus which is called Justice who are of the circumcision now these are Jews that Paul is sending the greetings these only are my fellow workers under the kingdom of God which have been a comfort to me so Paul this all these names tikius and all the different names here onesimus he says these are my fellow workers and they've been a comfort to me now George let's make sure our lives are comforting people's lives in the church let's not be a discomfort to each other here let's be a comfort to everybody here praise God let me God use me so I can be a help to other people that I can make life easier for them by the grace of God I'm going to be a comfort to them because that's what Paul says the reason I'm listening these names these guys have been my helpers these guys have stood with me these guys have been my comfort you know this to be true like brother man said there's just special people in your life that you can get comfort from not everybody gives you comfort when you fellowship with them right hahaha my brother said you want to be nice to all people but then you got some special people I appreciate that in the Philippians series there we got to show love and we just got to trust that God will help us all to grow and Trust for one another praise God so Paul names them and they're noticed there's not many names that's the effect of preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ you get rejected so much you don't have a whole lot of people around you that's right you know we've had numerous people visit us years ago that if I would have been a tape Church they would have stayed here and come to our church but they left because I wouldn't play the tapes I'm glad they left but you know there's this pressure there's different people like there's pressure to cater to certain people but we got to stand on the word of God there's just those rejections going to happen just be prepared for that you stand on the word you're going to be rejected but Jesus is going to receive you praise God Amen rejected on Earth but not rejected in heaven in heaven you're accepting the Beloved praise God ah hallelujah amen oh apple fresh doesn't that sound familiar from part one epipherals who's one of you epperfist was the one who started this church in colossae a servant of Christ he salutes you always laboring fervent for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God that's why I was praying that earlier for Napoleon and Albion because epifirst was constantly praying that the Saints would be mature lacking nothing spiritually and all their supplies would be liberally met and filled to the top we preach it on Sunday I don't want a half cup full I want a cup that runs over amen how many want that by God's grace you want to come to church half full or a quarter full no I wanted to fill up praise God I want God's spirit fill my heart and mind amen oh praise God hallelujah I don't want to be a half cup Christian or a one ounce Christian or something like that on my cup overflowing praise God Hallelujah and Paul says I bear record of that for Frisk he's got a great Zeal for the Saints and colossi for them in laodicea and also them in hieropolis which was phrygia that's the hieropolis was one of the cities of phrygio one of the provinces of phrygia I could never say that right and now look he was such a zealous prayer Warrior he was willing to pray for and the prophet said this guy has a burden to pray amen Hallelujah may God give us a burden to pray for others praise God we everybody knew whoever first prayed for it was those three churches that was his prayer constantly praying constantly praying constantly praying help us to pray constantly for somebody by God 's Spirit can't pray for everybody right I can't pray for everybody I can't help everybody but I can pray for somebody I can pray to the walls come down amen amen thank God Amen Luke the Beloved Physician and demons greet you now Luke was a gentile physician who wrote the book of Acts and the Gospel of Luke he was also the strongest concordance called him an evangelist too but Demas later deserted Paul for the world now Church look at this Paul never told the Colossians he was going to fall away right here because Paul didn't know he was going to fall away the church said neither did Brother Branham know who's going to fall away a lot of people around brother Brown were finding out fell away bad from the faith and so people are making oh look they all fell away so brother man must be a bad person no if that's the case then Paul was a bad person Paul didn't say well greet demons but you all guys watch his life okay he didn't say that he said great Paul give my greeting I'm sorry give my greetings to Demas Paul didn't know he's going to fall away but yet he fell away he loved the present World more and he loves Paul's gospel remember Church 70 preachers left Jesus Christ God In the Flesh if 70 left Jesus there are I mean a lot a lot of people are going to leave me praise God because I'm I'm way less than Jesus way less wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait less infinitely less and so look people even left Paul despite the Miracles the Bible writing the prophecies all these gifts he spoke in tongues more than all of them hello and they still left him thank God all the children of God will be saved all that the father has given me will come unto me praise God oh it's beautiful he says salute the brother which are in laodicea and nymphis and the church which is in their house history says Nimbus was a wealthy zealous Christian from laodicea Hallelujah and he had a church in this house and when this epistle this Colossians epistle is read unto you cause of that also be read in the church and laodiceans and that you likewise read the epistle from laodicea look Church they had preachers Paul told them to preach but they also read Paul's letters same thing today right we read Paul's letters and we still got preachers Hallelujah right same thing it's not it's not pressed play and sit down that's that's not what Paul said Paul said read my letters because they're the word of God and then preach he said be instant in season and out of season praise God Amen and say to archipus take heed to the ministry which thou has received in the Lord that thou fulfill it now notice he calls out this man's name in front of everybody this was read to the laodiceans this is read in the Colossians archipus who is archipus we don't know but he had such an important Ministry that Paul calls him out and says everybody encourage him make sure he doesn't quit on his ministry take heed to it now we're all human so Satan's all going to try to attack us in our Ministries that we have because listen everybody's got a ministry here if you don't think you do you have been reading the Bible lately everybody's got a Ministry we're all supposed to come with a Psalm a proverb right a word a testimony all these things we're supposed to come to the house of God with the anointing of God on us and the church said amen praise God so what Ministry does Jesus want you to fulfill tonight does any of us are any of us slipping in anything in any area is Paul the prophet makes us bold claim tell octopus take heed don't neglect your ministry he calls him out imagine that your name gets called out tell brother so-and-so tell brother Jesse take heed to your ministry make sure you fulfill it well that means he was struggling with fulfillment right take he that you fulfill it in other words whatever you start you better finish it praise God if God LED you to start something or finish it Hallelujah I've been kind of sharp tonight it's the Holy Spirit though Holy Spirit now strong concordance says this letter to the laosceans was the same as the book of Ephesians which that makes sense because we never found the letter to the laodiceans it makes sense which I've already preached the entire book of Ephesians to our church here and here's the closing scripture let's stand to our feet musicians can come Malachi's not here but that's okay he'll get here soon Lydia can play for us go ahead there's America perfect time everybody you're Redeeming the time sir what a way to end the letter the salutation by the hand of me Paul remember my bonds remember I'm a prisoner now I don't think he's saying oh remember me because I'm such a poor person I believe he's not seeking sympathy he's reminding them remember the cost to following Jesus Christ someday it might get you in jail for sure it's going to get you rejected by friends and family for sure like many of us have experienced remember this gospel has sent me to prison I'm a prisoner because of the Gospel of Jesus Christ don't forget that would that motivate you to finish your ministry you're not locked up in a prison like Paul Paul says tell archipus don't forget your ministry fulfill what God has called you to do what a warning what a warning if God's called you to do something let's finish it by God's grace this also shows his authenticity as a real possible real Apostles real preachers are hated of the world right when they really find out what you what you preach they hate you like Lydia Malachi had a piano teacher and sweet sweet woman I thought this woman loved us and everything as soon as she found out I preached about makeup and short hair never treated me good again boy I became the enemy you were like that and I got Bible four I got Bible verses for it I became I went from the happy the best guy I went to the I went to the enemy real quick I'm not coming over anymore I'm not training up them in piano anymore you won't see me again I hope I see you in heaven that's all I can say by the grace of God you really when you stand for the word of God you'll be rejected but Jesus Christ will always accept you praise God his last words Grace be with you how many want God's Own unmerited favor that's what I want with me I want God's favor with me how many believe it's with you by God's grace more than ever before I know like I said when Simon's here I know God loves me now I may have to suffer of course we have to suffer more as we get older but at this point in my life I could say without a shadow of a doubt God truly loves me his grace and favor has shined upon my life I hope you can say the same by the grace of God there's that prayer Warrior there oh teach me the word of God and then I'm gonna go have a prayer meeting for the Saints in deploy we will have a prayer meeting for the Saints in Albion a man is a prayer Warrior let's have desire to pray for some people tonight by God's grace we'll end with prayer let's bow our heads here tonight Hallelujah Paul said I know this man has a fervent desire to pray he's zealous to pray just pray that just pray that I can pray to the walls come down it's healing all around before we pray is there any other special needs maybe is the word of gods and Ministries anyone have a special prayer they'd like to pray for you oh they are okay gotcha okay but pray God will give you a door of others anybody else Hallelujah I'm just going to pray off his prayer list here let's bow our heads here and we can have the seals [Music] tonight Lord now but we need those we need shouting thank you [Music] teaching messages [Music] fathers we started tonight help us to redeem the time here [Music] it was manage our affairs Lord we pray for Nature's request for our prayer be gone father God give her an opportunity [Music] I appreciate that desire foreign [Music]
