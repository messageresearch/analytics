prayer requests in announcements I got a couple testimonies to by God's grace I think you'll like this one here let me do the first one of course you like all of them but this is one from our sister Tanya I said okay I said amen will pray for you soon on Sunday 10 minutes before service at 4 p.m. so 350 I sent that and then she said today before taking a nap I put on one of my healing CDs because it was about 4 p.m. when I figured the church would be starting to make there would be starting to make this short for the first time 4 days when I woke up my eyes felt normal praise the Lord I appreciate that amen praise God appreciate that testimony then my friend whose dad has came out of that coma said he's doing good and spirits are really high by God's grace so very thankful to God for that also I got an email a couple of email testimonies this one's from a woman in Scotland she said I emailed you a long time ago saying I was not gonna cut my hair and she said I kept my word I've not cut my hair and she said I just want to tell you that I haven't cut my hair he said hopefully God will be pleased about that i daughter God's very pleased with that she said I'm so glad to have access to the internet because I don't think I'd be likely to hear the truth about God's Word without she had some questions for me so let me ask my wife I don't know the answers to all these but that was really encouraging just to hear back on that so we thank the Lord for that any other testimonies anyone has to share for this week sister Connie amen all right well praise the Lord O Lord that is well right he's he safe thank ya thank the Lord very thankful for that any other testimonies Haven you have testimony oh yeah [Music] [Applause] another answer you prayed that the horses would be at the fair yesterday and they were there so thank God for that amen praise the Lord and she got so excited she said God just answered my prayer that was really sweet so God does hear our prayers amen he answers in his own time in season and we're thankful that he hears even the little children praise God and we're all little children in God's sight - amen Sabby that's it for testimonies so let's do a free prayer request here my wife just said please pray for the people in the Carolinas as hurricane Florence lands soon so I have numerous co-workers that have children or relatives in the Carolinas oh I'd appreciate your prayers for that by God's grace I do believe that's it any other prayer requests here tonight David okay thank you tomorrow's Benjamin's birthday so I'm gonna make sure I send

press their way out to the house of God may speak to us minister to us Jesus Christ's name Amen amen praise God does anybody have a song special like to share okay I just want to offer he said buddy does have its own special praise God earth all right well let's worship the Lord here we were working on a few songs or practicing a few just the regular ones were practicing I seen before the throne of God above I can't go real high on this one so I'm not gonna try that this time let's seem that by God's grace before the throne of God before the deep part Satan tempts me to despair tells me [Music] [Music] just satisfied with rice my Savior my God my Savior [Music] [Music] thank you Jesus in Christ my hope is gone in the world he is mine for win the precious blood here and this is the power of Christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] tonight by the grace of the Lord I'd like to look back again at biblical numerology tonight and preach on this by the grace of God I really never finished part I'm sorry the number six so this will actually be part six of the series and will probably finish number six and begin looking at number seven and if the Lord is willing let me get you a starting spot we'll just start in Genesis 4 verse 17 let's start there [Music] there's nowhere I'd rather be than in the house of God tonight amen I know the angels of God are here I know Christ is here by his promise and so I'm looking forward to who God will deliver our amen so Genesis 4:17 I'm gonna start with the number six here and and this is just a just a starting spot but this is where polygamy starts it starts in the sixth generation of Cain's descendants the sixth one so this is a type of fallen man so let's read Genesis 4:17 just a moment while I get there and I hope you're seeing numbers in your life you know and I forgot to tell about that one remember I told you about the five five five on my when we got our van fixed so I forgot to tell you that was actually a free service I didn't have to pay one cent for all that work so not only was it on time and just when we needed it to come to church and go on our little vacation air the vacation was free now I like that but all the work was free by God's grace so triple grace or perfect grace and I just thought I forgot no I forgot to tell you that so I want to make sure I told you that because it was all under warranty so everything that was broken was fixed for free so anyway he's just interesting to see the numbers of God here Genesis 4:17 if you're there say Amen we'll try to read for down to 20 I'm sorry 17 rather down to 23 and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch did that striking Cain how to Enoch first before Adam had to Enoch so it sounds it seems like the personation Satan trying to impersonate and use that name doesn't that name mean dedicated is that right I thought it means dedicated or devoted I'll look that up isn't that something the serpent seed named his son Enoch verse 18 so that's the second generation and Enoch was born I'm sorry and unto Enoch was born irad and irad begat me who Jael and may who GL began with thews Al and Mithu CL begat lamech and Lamech took unto Him two wives and the name of the one was Adah and the name of the other was Zilla and ADA bear jaybo he was the father such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle and his brother's name was Jubal and he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ and Zilla she also bear two ball cane an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron and the sister of tubal-cain was Naamah and lame exceda's wives Adah and Zillah hear my voice he wives of Lamech hearken unto my speech rive slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt amen let's just have one more word of Prayer Fein they have a need on your heart just making known unto God here as we pray Heavenly Father we just come to you again tonight thank you for the songs that we sing or thank you that we can worship and come back to the heart of worship we just want to sing to bless your heart Lord father not to to punch a time clock and say well we went to church but the Lord should actually step outside of time and and get into heavenly places and to commune with our Heavenly Father Oh God we love you tonight we know you're here your angels are here god help us to entertain angels Lord God help us to worship you tonight and give you all the glory and hear your word in Jesus Christ state and the church said Amen god bless your being seated praise the Lord so like look at this year again tonight part six and we look at number six and seven seven is such a massive number there's over 800 sevens in the entire Bible so I haven't I just went through revelation on number seven there's 56 sevens in Revelation I just made it through those and Malachi again switch over when you're ready buddy for the slides so I've got a lot to study and do on Saturday on number seven and just trying to scratch the surface a little bit look at number seven but we'll look at number six or willing tonight finish six and then we'll go to number seven now remember couples that of course beast was made on the sixth day and you know be the beasts was the one who tempted Eve the serpent who Satan entered into the serpent and caused the serpent to fall as well and then of course fallen a man as we see how men men fell sin came through man but it also represents the anointed man and that's the kind of man that you and I want to be praise God under the anointing of the Holy Spirit in fact that's when we're actually truly human is when we're anointed by the Holy Spirit and we'll see tonight that six measures man's time as well and also measurements so remember brother Branham said six is the man's day course man's day seven is his day of redemption that's from Revelation chapter five so here's how time and matter is measured in sixes a foot equals twelve inches or two sixes we see also this 2 and 6 with the ephod stones on the high priests with shewbread two stacks of six and the stairs of solomon's temple there are six stairs and there's six lines on this side six lines on this side so we see it's it's a number God uses often and of course the common measurements allow for increments of six you have you know of course six inches 12 inches 18 24 36 or 30 36 and then of course 36 is 6 squared but there's all kinds of sixes in measurements time of course has 24 hours there's there's six or six fours or four sixes rather and then of course day and night each having twelve hours which can be divided into two groups of six as well and of course there's 12 months which is six times two as far as two groups of six so isn't it interesting God uses sixes with measurements and time very interesting and then of course time you know has hours have 60 minutes which is six times ten and then minutes are into 60 seconds which are six times ten again so there's all these sixes to remind man of time and brother man have said every time you hear a siren he says it's a reminder that death is coming for man right every time you see a gray hair on your head it's a reminder that you have a meeting and raba have said it's a me reminder that you have a meeting with the Almighty God and the thing to do is take that reminder not feel bad like oh I'm getting older oh I'm feeling but to take that and say Lord let me redeem the time help me to be ready I want to be ready to meet you at any time amen so that's why God gives us these sixes of man and men remember that men's time is temporal men's time is fleeting and we measure our our time and lives in sixes because six is the number of man now let's look at a few more as we saw with fallen man polygamy started in the sixth generation said Cain Enoch IRAD me who Jael Mathu ZL and Lamech and then he course took two wives and then had sons with both wives I don't know if you remember this but this was a good good for me a faith I'm sorry Ethel ayah a Hammond Jezebel's daughter reigned six years before Josh ascended to the throne amen and brother Branham liking that unto the Roman Catholic Church in the church age book remember when we preached on that I don't know if you remember we preached on that but he likened unto that under six the six church ages but in the seventh the mystery of God is finished it's restored right and the word is brought to its proper place and I think you and I know that the rapture is going to take place in the seven church age is that right Amen so we thank God for that so it's a type there of how the in the seventh church age the rulership changes right Christ finds is is his place here in the church and the church is raptured in the seventh church age Amen now look at this one let's go to our Bibles let's go to Nehemiah chapter 2 I never saw this before I preached the whole series on Esther Nehemiah and Ezra I preached through all those sermons all those scriptures numerous sermons I think did 18 sermons on that series and I still got it if you want I think I put it on that computer over there if you want all the sermons well let's go to Nehemiah just to read some of these they face six opposition's when they were building the temple so Ezra Nehemiah Esther as Renea Maya sir right before job all right so Nehemiah 2:10 will read these here just to kind of give us a glimpse now Church and I just want to say this if they could have such courage while building a natural wall how much courage should we have building a spiritual wall praise God program said that God is turning a corner right brother branham said that it takes it takes a man who knows how to turn a corner it takes a prophet to turn a corner and do a new thing and we're gonna know get a new thing in this channel send us proud to do a new thing not just all the old reformer reformer reformer but it's prophet amen and God has done a new thing and so let's take courage from these scriptures here and I think you will as you we read him here so Nehemiah 2:10 sorry it's just taken me a while to get there this is their first opposition now remember Nehemiah was after zerubabbel had already come back this was years after a zoo rule came back in fact there was there was a 16 year gap between zerubabbel they built for a couple a little while and then that the the government forced them shut him down for 16 years and then God anointed Zechariah and Haggai to prophesy and the Bible said the prophecy lifted the spirits of the people it's like the two prophets preaching them resurrected their faith and that was a foreshadowing of the two prophets in revelation 11 Amen that their prophecy will give life to the church and bring life back and what man has destroyed God will raise up again and he does it through prophecy that's why when we preach you know many times I know I read those same prophecies you know Joel - about the latter rain you know many times you'll hear me read those again church why am i reading them again I'm reading them again because I know God has always brought life to the church through reading the prophecy and recognizing your day in its message amen at some time somebody's going to catch that revelation of the latter rain and the bride is going to be satisfied with the bread satisfied with the corn the why and the oil and they'll not be ashamed at some point when reading those scriptures somebody's going to catch that revelation and they're going to fulfill the scriptures for the latter rain amen and so we want to fall under the anointing of the prophecy of this day praise God just as they fell under their anointing we want to fall under the anointing for our day that's why prophecy is so important the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy amen Nehemiah 2:10 when Sam bout the horror night and told by the servant an ammonite heard of it agree them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel so first the enemies are grieved so the very fact that they hear Oh what there's message believers coming back and they're trying to restore boundaries they're trying to separate you know sinners from from from the holy places of Jerusalem it grieve them that's what I want my testimony be I want my testimony to grieve Satan the trouble is you know we get in the flesh and we grieve the wrong we read the Holy Spirit we don't want to grieve him we want to grieve the devil hey I live in a victorious life by adding more to the church we're adding more of our strength to the church we want to grieve the devil we don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit we want to please the Holy Spirit now after their greed after they get grieved they decide okay we'll just go confront them face-to-face and we'll start laughing in their face and mocking them I'm sorry laughing and scorning them and despising them to their face so - 19 - 19 when sambel the night and told by the server and the ammonite and gchem the arabian heard laughter scorn and despises and so what is this thing that you do will you rebel against the king then answer die them instead of them the God of heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build but you have no portion all right no memorial in Jerusalem I like nehemiah's revelation don't you people can laugh in his face and say oh you're just a worthless bunch of Jews you're never gonna do anything for God huh you're ridiculous you're funny and he doesn't look at himself he doesn't look at the circumstances he look where the promise of God came from amen he knew that God had already noted a King Cyrus to bring back Giroux Bible and Ezra he knew that he was living and he knew God had already started this work so if God was able to start something supernaturally God was able to finish it hallelujah and church God has already started something supernaturally because a brother branham came now we actually have what can be a book of Acts Church because now we have little message churches all over the world so if God started this movement the message he's surely going to finish it amen so we need not be discouraged and remember that God in heaven started this move that God of heaven restored this Bible the god of heaven sent us a prophet so we must fall in the line with the prophecy of this day and do our part and let the holy spirit build up a wall between us in the world amen so we can dwell in security what does the wall represent a wall represents security it represents separation and that's what the Holy Spirit's doing it's building up a separation between us in the world every day we should see our lives being more separate from the things of the world amen that because that's the that's the prophecy of the hour remember there was three people that came to finish this guru Bible Ezra and Nehemiah it was completed in threes amen right Luther Wesley Branham is completed in threes God is going to have this wall built up and God is going to fully get this bride ready and and we know God is going to do it it's prophecy and we see the type brother Branham even typed his ministry with that of of Nehemiah and Zerubbabel that's in the message of grace if one listen to that I can't remember that so I'm not gonna I'm gonna stop I can't remember all the ties but look they're laughing huh you're one of those mess you believe william branham was a prophet that's hilarious and he said the god of heavens started this and we don't need your help at all he said God's gonna prosper this church amen God started this church God's the one that started 12 years ago he's gonna prosper laughs if you will abandon if you one mark make fun of if you want God's gonna prosperous because we're not looking for natural prosperity we're looking for spiritual prosperity we're looking to be more like Jesus Christ not like the world glory look at chapter four verse one see the world's looking for spiritual prosperity and numbers and big buildings and money and all kinds of things brother Branham said let me tell you my poor blind friend God does not save the world by money he saves it through the blood of Jesus Christ he sounds us to that this weekend the seals I think goes this last week I was listen to the fourth seal this morning but I'm trying to get the seals under in my mind again and get them all stirred up again but he says my poor blind friend it's not about money we should say oh we just had money more money we could do something we need to have more of a contact with God we just need to be more faithful to God more in love with God more worship more obedience to God and then God will do in our lives all that he's determined to do in our lives hallelujah for one now first they grieve then they laugh and now they're mocking with wrath and Ignatian so starting to get a little more serious this is fall man attacking the anointed Jews but it came to pass that when San Mao heard that we build the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews now they're not laughing now they're mocking them well making fun and he spake before his brother in the army of Samaria and said what do these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves with a sacrifice where they make an end in the day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned Naoto by the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall here o our God for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity amen now look all these questions was what God was going to do the questions were what do the of will they fortify themselves yes they were gonna fortify themselves but they're mocking oh you think you're gonna protect yourself yes God was gonna help them be protected will they sacrifice yes they're gonna get back to sacrificing amen will they make an end of the day yes will they revive the stones yes it was a revival praise God and they said over Fox go up they'll break down the wall and a stone wall see even a little Fox even a little of the Bob said little foxes spoil the vine right so they said oh just a little thing I'll knock that down now there's some truth in that in the spiritual a little Fox will knock down your wall but they're mocking the natural wall oh if a fox jumps on that wall the whole wall is gonna fall down all the stone all the mortar all that it's just there there its shoddy masonry work you know it's really it's really not good masonry work and they're just mocking it but the spiritual type is true if we don't keep little lying little stealing little dishonesty little little Envy little jealousy a little green little fear little us if we don't keep those little things out of our lives it'll tear down our defenses we've got to keep the little foxes from spoiling the sweet tenderness that we feel toward Jesus don't you have to come to church and you feel like it's just all new again the tenderness of worship the little foxes will spoil that tenderness of worship a little sin that comes in will hinder that tender relationship we have with God I think at verse 7 8 now this now it's going beyond laughing now it's a it's about time to fight by verse 7 but it came to pass that when Sam Batlin told by and the Arabians and the ammonites and the ash Knights heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped that they were very rough and conspired all of them together or together to come and fight against Jerusalem and they hinder it nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God and set a watch against them day and night because of them amen so now it's gone from there just grieved they're laughing now it's then mocking and now it's we are gonna fight you we're gonna physically hurt you and what did this drive them to do it drove them to prayer what should all of our trials new church it should drive us to pray drive us to it should drive us to fight off the devil in prayer amen hallelujah but see it gets more and more serious all the time now to spare time we're just going to read these now they have a conference to meet together they invite Nehemiah to conference in Nehemiah says I'm not gathering with you anywhere and then lastly then Samuel hires some other friends of Nehemiah and says let's have a meeting at the house of God and this is just like Satan transforming himself into an angel of light look how look how it's slick Satan is first he starts off a little bit of laughing now it's physical and now he's like well let's let's go meet in the church and let's see if I can talk them out of it in the house of God the house of God is where we have the most shrank praise God we should have no compromising in the pulpit no compromising in the pew and then the Satan nothing of Satan can stand before a Church of the Living God that's walking in the Holy Spirit amen that's an invincible army but he's like God maybe I get them to to compromise in the church and as long as we confess our sins as long as we pull on the Word of God as long as we worship the Holy Spirit we can expect there to be no compromise in this church amen hallelujah without what's Satan's tactic maybe I can just get one more trick and I could try to trick him in the house of God oh my that's why we said on Sunday that's why we take everything back to the word because we know groups now that don't take everything back to the word and where do they get to see they get to see right in the house of God preachers will preach something and it's wrong right in the house of God so you got to be very careful to say with all the truth of God amen now let's go to the New Testament there's some there's some fallen men and the New Testament six times Jesus was charged with having a devil in the New Testament the first time by the scribes he hath Beelzebub and by the Prince of Devil's cast as out he devils after the people were amazed and started saying is not this the son of David so the people who start come it's updated its rise up and say oh he's Beelzebub because they don't want him being as as Ally a leader of Israel we'd say then in John 7:20 the people in the temple say thou hast a devil after he discerns the desires to kill him mocking him saying this man never learned so they're mocking him this man never learned so jesus discerns and said you want to kill me they said you've got a devil so jesus discerns him and they realize it and the devil says you've got a devil that's that's the devil's last that's his last escape to call the real believer a devil the last thing he could do other than his physically hurt Jesus he just call him a devil the devil calling God the devil so be careful who we call a devil right and also watch who people call a devil that's why we don't call our friends Devils right unless we know for sure there's a devil on them because the devil is the one who calls other people Devils interesting John well after Jesus told them they cannot hear God's words because they were not of God so again Jesus says you're not of God because you can't hear the message of the hour and he says you're of the devil the devil calling God of the devil trying to deceive the people in John 8 52 they say now we know that that was the devil after Jesus said if a man keep my saying he shall never see death amen Jesus says my word has the power if you keep my word you'll have eternal life as they say now we know you've got a devil saying that you have eternal life and then Jesus was preaching on the Good Shepherd and how no man can take his life from him but he would lay it down he says he this man hath a devil and he's crazy he's gonna nobody can take this man's life nobody can kill this man this man's crazy he's got a devil and the sixth and final time is when Jesus casts out a dumb spear and the people wondered and they said he casts out the devils by Beelzebub by six times they say he had a devil that's the Fallen man can buddy see that amen now six times they asked him for a sign and I got one overlap actually have seven in here so one overlap so bear with me in Matthew 12 38 after jesus healed a blind and dumb man jesus said an eat they asked him for a sign the Pharisees asked and scribes asked for a sign he said an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after side and there's to be no sign giving it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas he just healed a blind man and he gave the man the building to talk he was blind and deaf Jesus did a double miracle and they say give us some more sign what greater sign could he give he said fine I'm not gonna give me any sign I'll give you the sign of my resurrection though if this ain't enough for you I'll raise from the dead hallelujah see because they they just they were just playing with him well it was just like Pilate Oh give me a sign show me a sign maybe I'll do a miracle but the man said God don't come for nobody this blind man that wanted to be he must had a deep desire he must have wanted to be healed he must have believed that God could heal he must have had a deep calling for divine healing but all the other people just want to make a cloud out of God but that man really believes so that man really got healed by God amen Jesus truly sends his faith and a beat unto him according to his faith in God's Word amen so that's a fall man give me a sign and he'd already give him a blind and deaf man saw and talked and heard the pharisees sadducees again he said oh you hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you can discern the signs of the times he said give us give us a sign he says you can understand the weather but you can't understand the spiritual weather the disciples had three requests in mark 24 and brother Branham teaches on this in the I believe it's the sixth seal if I'm not mistaken it's either the six or questions and answers I think it's the sixth seal they asked three questions even his disciples asked him for sign so don't feel bad Church if you ask God for signs getting ask God for signs God gave the signs he said when shall these things be done when one stone is not left upon another that's when Titus came brother Branham said when all the stones the temple would not be stacked one upon another that was Titus about 40 years later what shall be the sign of that coming that was where Jesus said there'll be two in a field one will be taken two in a bed during the grinding mill one will be taken one will be left that was a sign of the coming of the rapture and the sign of the end of the world were the other side the end of the world Armageddon when Jesus would come back amen and that'd be the end of man's day then they enter into the Lord's Day praise God now here's the overlapping one I think yeah the others tempting in Sodom a sign from heaven now I love this one let's go to mark 8:11 this is beautiful I just I love to see Jesus's emotions don't you Mark 8:11 this is beautiful in church it makes us encouraged because he was human he was fully human just like you and I are for you fully human on a night like tonight you might sigh deeply in your spirit to Luke 8 11 12 Luke 8:11 I'm sorry no it's the mark 8 11 12 I'm sorry forgive me I went - Luke - sorry mark 8 11 12 mark 8 11 12 and the Pharisees came forth and began to question him seeking a sign from heaven tempting him and he sighed deeply in his spear and said why does this generation seek after a sign very nice any of there shall no sign be given unto this generation don't you love that even Jesus got tired of their questions even Jesus got little frustration this generation is asking for a sign I'm not giving one right I heard brother Graham say yes sir doesn't seem to the 3rd Exodus and program was talking about that the picture of the cloud and he said he was going to take that picture to all those scientists in Arizona and brotherman said no the Holy Spirit said no they're just gonna laugh at it don't give your pearls don't cast your pearls before swine amen he said the ask the Lord the Holy Spirit told him no don't take it they're just gonna laugh on it in that striking and so yo we would think Oh everybody needs to hear everybody well I guess not everybody does somehow God has already worked on their heart or maybe they crossed the line between mercy and judgment who knows but God said don't take it down there just like Jesus said let the blind lead the blind now if you've got a leaning to go get soap so help some a witness somebody of course you go do it I'm not giving you a license not to witness what I'm saying is we've got to follow the leadership with the Holy Spirit and at least brother Branham asked Lord you want me to take you to them at least he asked we need to ask to Lord want me to take it to my neighbor amen can we take the message to my friend when we take the message to my mother father my my family we need to ask God God do you want me to take it there and then we need to hear his voice as well amen I like that he sighed deeply it's just like when Jesus rejoice in spirit I thank you Lord that you hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them unto babes amen we might get sad thing Oh God hasn't revealed to them but Jesus like thank you no hard rejoicing thank you Lord that's given to the babes those who humble themselves t just hardcore sometimes we think everybody's as humble as us and we're not trying to be proud like that but the reality of it is if we repent of our sins it shows we have a measure of humility amen and church said but Jesus rejoice thank you God it's not given to the wise and prudent and here deeply sighing why does this generation seek after sigh I'm not gonna give them one all right I love this one this is John 2:18 they asked Jesus for a sign how are you taking this this rope and whipping us out of the temple he says well he said I'm gonna give you a sign in three days this temple be destroyed in three days I'll raise it up that's my sign that will be the sign that I had the authority to clean out the church amen I like this one the people again in John 6:30 they say show us the sign he said for the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven and gives life unto the world I am the sign because I'm the bread of God I've come down to earth and I'm gonna give life to the people amen they asked six times for a sign fallen man asked for signs and sometimes Jesus gave them sometimes he didn't praise God but we know he gave the greatest sign the greatest sign was his resurrection praise God hallelujah now these let's read these six times people bore witness to Jesus innocent before he died Theo is fallen man fallen man had to give a witness all humanity had to witness the sinner had to witness the religious man had to witness right they all had to witness that Jesus was innocent all the world has to say that he's innocent now isn't it striking Pilate and Herod and Judas all say he's innocent they go to hell we don't know what happened here but this thief got saved so see anybody can say Jesus was innocent but you've got to accept Jesus say God I'm the guilty one you died for me you died for me and now you forgive me by your blood and I accept it I want to be with you in heaven right I want to live my life in such a way that I can meet with you in heaven amen it takes that kind of faith we don't know what happened the Roman centurion he said truly this man was the son of God he was an innocent man praise God yeah we know Pilate Herod were lost program talks about the blue water remember when Pilate died there was blue water where he died and it rushes out I guess every year I know I haven't seen any evidence on that but that's what he said he said he'd read that in a book one time that that blue water rushed out when he when he drowned it came out every year as a witness that he should not have crucified the Lord now six times they bore witness of his innocence actually let's just skip those because I don't if I don't get started on seven I don't think I'm gonna finish on Sunday because it's so big brother branham said there were six over comers in John the Baptist day and he also said there are six over comers and every day why would he say 6 because 6 is the number of anointed man I'll read you the quote here in a minute brother Branham said Joseph and Mary were overcomers Zacharias and Elizabeth were overcomers and Simeon and Anna in the temple were over comers notice in John the Baptist time program said there was found six that had overcome all ages they had over comers and John time they had six that was Joseph and Mary Zacharias and Elizabeth Simeon an end a man and a woman a man a woman a man and woman see type of Christ the church Christ the church Christ the church Christ the church so the Bible names those six the give us a type of The Anointed men and woman and The Anointed spouse the husband and wife Jesus Christ and his bride amen hallelujah he said notice it starts from the natural men now look at this this is a great type Joseph the natural man what was he a carpenter then the priest so went from a carpenter to a priest which was a minister in the house Lord Zacharias and from that simeon a prophet and a prophetess see that's the type of justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost that's deeper than I can explain I can't I can't explain that but it goes the cow is so beautiful natural to priests to prophet amen he said don't you see it perfectly cynics overcome all the pressing they offer their sacrifice and everything but these were elected they overcame amen beautiful all right now I've only found one meaning for seven so far and that's completion I've only found one meaning so if I find more I'll let you know but I've only found one completion everything's in threes there's the there are three is a perfect number five is a number of gray seven completion twelve worship twenty-four or 40s temptation 50s a Jubilee the very word Pentecost means Jubilee or 50 now God in his numerals he's perfect in his numerals he's perfect in his word he's perfect in his action he's perfect and everything because he's a perfect God amen spoken word the original seat now the Old Testament I'm sorry has 607 sevens or eights I'm sorry I said eight hundred it was 607 so I want to try to go over those on Saturday before I preach Sunday Lord willing now I just thought I'd do a couple just came up to my mind and I was reading a little bit Joshua's army marched around Jericho seven times on the seventh day with seven priests bearing seven trumpets of ram horns going before the ark lots of sevens and remember this is interesting because it contained a shout and a trump because he said shout on the seventh day at the sound of the Trump so all's we need is a voice shout voice Trump so it's interesting it seems like it's a tie of the rapture but I'm not for sure because it doesn't say literal voice in there but it's interesting all those sevens and then it has a shout and a trump 7,000 men did not bother need to bail in the days of Elijah name and the leper had to dip seven times in the Jordan River to be cleansed amen now there's 53 hits on seven this is in oh yeah I didn't get to these yet there's 53 hits in the New Testament I'm sorry yeah I think the New Testament I'm sorry got little mixed up there now every I have to remember to add to the list that the sixes and sevens go well because there were six waterpots Jesus changed but Christ was the seventh water pot the woman at the well had six husband Jesus was her real true husband and there were six barley sheaves given from Boaz to Ruth but Christ was the real Boaz amen all right now let's go through the book of Revelation and I think I'm finished with this by God's grace alright so remember it's the book of Revelation or the book of completion it's the finishing up of the entire Bible there are seven angels to seven churches there are seven candlesticks there are seven spirits of God are seven lamps before the throne of God there are seven stars in the hand of Christ they're seven seals around the book that are loose there are seven thunders that utter on the earth when the book is open there are seven angels holding seven trumpets in the tribulation there are seven angels having the seven last plagues in Revelation 15 and 21 there's seven golden vials full of the wrath of God given to the seven angels by the four beasts isn't that interesting the four beasts that representing the four anointings for the Gentile dispensation they handed over the seven golden vials it's interesting like perhaps they they they were there they were the anointing that it took to bring up all these prayers and they bring all these vials over there to the seven angels so interesting it seems like it's connected somehow the the the two prophets minister for forty-two months which is six sevens six sevens the Ministry of two profits 7,000 men are killed by an earthquake during the second whoa immediately after the sixth and final rapture of revelation 1113 of course we love this one the seventh angel finishes the mystery of God in Revelation 10 seven Amen the completion by the seventh angel praise the Lord Christ the bloody lamb has seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth let's read that from Revelation 5:6 I think opening mix that one up here Revelation 5:6 okay yeah that was right I was thinking the one that was full of eyes that was the beast in heaven right yeah that was the Beast never were full of eyes but Christ had seven eyes verse six and I beheld lo in the midst of the throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth praise God's that's right I thought I'd mix that up I thought Jesus was full of eyes but no that's the that's the four cherubims in heaven alright thank you now in Revelation 1 I'm gonna jump back up to revelation 1 there's the Sevenfold glory of Christ person and I preached this a couple years ago so I'll just show you the picture here the Bible said he had the face as the countenance of the son this represents the power of righteousness or light in his face he had the hair of white hair which represents a crown of wisdom and this is all from the church age book he had eyes of fire which are angry eyes that see the motives of hearts because remember this is Jesus a Sevenfold glory when he returns on the Lord's Day so this is him how he looks when he's riding the white horse coming down for the Battle of Armageddon his voice is mighty waters which his multitudes of voices rogram said speaking out condemnation against all the ungodly and sinners his feet are like a furnace of fire because he has untempered judgment crushing all his enemies under his feet amen he's crushing all the enemies under his feet aren't you glad though that the Bible says now that Satan will like Christ will bruise Satan shortly under your feet amen I like some furnace a hot fire or feet myself wouldn't you I like my feet to have that fire too I want to put Satan under my feet amen it's the fires of judgment God has judged that already and it's under my feet and I'm living above that temptation I'm living above that trial amen crushing all enemies under on the feet hallelujah and of course the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God but a man who said that judges everyone and judges everything hallelujah because as no no respecter persons and the stars represent the messengers in his loving care and power the Sevenfold glory of Christ person on the Lord's Day and that beautiful oh my high praise thorn thank God now let's keep going here in the book of Revelation I think I'm almost done here I didn't read as much as I normally do if it's a little shorter that might be good because I'm actually exhausted this week I could use a little rest here but I'm trying to get press through and preach as hard as I can now the Sevenfold worship this is something I never saw before or just read this of Christ by the voice of the many angels round about the throne so they're the angels worship him twice in Revelation 5 and revelation 7 and they say he's worthy to receive power in Revelation 5 he also says power in revelation 7 all these angels he says riches but he actually in Chapter 7 he says Thanksgiving or might and he says wisdom and wisdom is again repeated so five things are repeated interesting not sure why then they says strength which strength would be your Thanksgiving and might below honor both say honor both say glory and both say blessing unto our God for ever and ever amen and that beautiful God lets the Angels give out seven blessings to God right some of the Angels the chair the beasts say holy holy holy but the angels are the regular angels we'd say they cry out a seven full worship of God the Bible said they fall down and worship and say power riches wisdom strength honor glory and blessing I think we need to praise God some more don't see who Amen we just sing a few songs and you know worship the Lord I think it's good to get coffee and worship don't you and give God a Sevenfold worship hey man hey thank you Jesus glory glory glory glory glory glory glory amen all these blessings and these are from holy perfect creatures too that are not even under the blood but were under the blood we know what grace is we ought to give them a seven for worship as well hallelujah let's say power to say power Eddie power let's say riches let's say wisdom let's say strength let's say honor let's say glory and let's shout blessing blessing amen hallelujah if angels can do that what about you and I oh thank you Jesus I love that they're not limited just glory and then they can they leave Church they got so much glory stored up in them they just give seven fold worship a complete worship to God Almighty amen they don't do it one time they do it twice and no doubt they do it all throughout eternity I like that God is God is wanting us to see this is what complete worship is oh lord thank you for your power in my life you saved me from the power of darkness I used to be under the power of darkness lord thank you for the spiritual riches you've given me and all so natural we have a lot of natural riches rightness in this country thank you for the wisdom you've given to me not to walk in foolishness but to walk in wisdom I'm not a fool I know what the Holy Ghost is I know what the Holy Ghost telling me to do I follow the Holy Ghost now you're walking to wisdom thank you Lord for the strength you give me to fight another day you deserve all the honor all the glory and all the blessings bless you bless you Jesus I know you're all honor to Jesus this is true worship from perfect angels in heaven oh what a worship service that's going to be to have in church and now with that then the 24 angels they fall down and they throw their crowns down at the feet of Jesus Oh mine the Sevenfold blessing all this worship of the worthy king the worthy lamb oh I'm looking forward to be a part of that praise God amen I'm closing with this I think I only got two or three more it's gonna be one of my shorter sermons - lets go or let's just really just finish up here this is striking Balaam requested a Balak after after he already once said I can't curse Israel Balak says well let's go change location that's how carnal this man was maybe we're too close to Israel maybe we need to move somewhere else and maybe I can curse Israel from some other place that's how carnal he was he thought maybe maybe this is its kind of people today well I just can't worship God in this place I need to go someplace else well I just can't pray in my closet or I just can't seem to pray at church that's nonsense you can contact God anywhere you want amen but you need a humble heart you need to confess your sin and you need a pure heart of sincere worship before God but this guy thought oh it's just something I can just maybe I can go somewhere else and curse Israel that's how carnal he was so bailet now look how carnal Balaam is baylin's like well give me seven sacrifice to the bullocks seven Rams seven altars now he should have known once you can't curse God here you can't curse I'm sorry you can't curse Israel here you can't curse Israel there why I didn't know that but what was he he was money hungry that's what he was the Bible said the wages of unrighteousness so see it with all those dollar bills flashing before him he thought well I guess we can try it I guess we can give it a try to try to curse God's people and then he realized he was so Baxter than even that say he didn't realize you can't curse God's people and church they can't curse us either how can you curse what God is blessed how can you curse what God's already saved amen how can you curse what God's already anointed amen how many know he did of God austenite to this week praise God I needed I have five sermons to preach this week so I was a Monday night I was praying for my sermon for yesterday morning at the middle school and just came to me I was on vision and I was listening lord I really need a minute I don't really have a thought for tomorrow morning I got thirty middle schoolers coming to preach to I don't have a thought and the Lord just dropped a little thought down and he said Judas as I said Paul kept his eyes on the vision despite being whipped and Jesus kept his eyes on the vision so much so that even Peter tried to talk about him out of it he said get behind me Satan and then the scripture said he set his face as a stone towards Jerusalem and the Bible said that the meetings didn't go well the Bible says this because his face was set toward Jerusalem and the disciples got mad and said these meetings aren't as good this revivals not really happening do you want us to call fire down from heaven and Jesus says you don't know what spirits you're of you want to judge these people he said and it was it was showing us that Jesus was so focused on Calvary that he was starting to not give as much attention to the meetings because he had one goal in mind he had to do the Father's will church listen we can't do everything can we we can't do everything but we must do what God is anointing us to do praise God we must find the season of our lives the season were in and do what God has called us to do and so I preached that and a brother come up every said mine he said God was speaking to me on both levels he called me up today to tell me again that really spoke to me it spoke to me on different levels we've got to keep our eyes on the vision so both Balaam and Judas got their eyes off the vision of the word and put it on money how sad is that now what's striking Church is 400 years later remember David sacrificed every six steps we saw that we saw that last week I think Wednesday night I preached out at my house every six steps David would stop and sacrifice and this is what he sacrificed he did the same exact sacrifice as Balaam did so see God as God loves a7 right God loves seven God love and look I say like this God loves a complete sacrifice from you and I God likes when we come to church and we don't give half of our effort we give all of our effort he likes the seven which for us doesn't mean well I think we got to sing seven songs it doesn't mean that we've got to completely yield ourselves to the holy spirit right pray with all of our hearts sing with all of our hearts worship say Amen with all of our hearts be fully into it give him a complete sacrifice and he's well pleased with a complete sacrifice Oh glory but see Balaam knew that's how you get to God you got to give a complete sacrifice and remember God spoke to him and said don't you can't curse him he said can I go up can I go can I go with Balak he said fine just go but you're only gonna say what I tell you to say so Satan that Satan's imitation of seven because behind all of that Balaam had the heart to teach them fornication and 24,000 died because he taught him to fornicate so behind all that that's her brother barren tells us he said Moses was the real one and Balaam was the impersonator and he tried to copy him he said Balaam was right a hundred percent fundamentally now what does that tell us about the message in this our people are gonna be fundamentally right preaching water baptism the Godhead they're not gonna believe in three persons that's how close they're gonna be they're gonna be so fundamentally close but where's the pillar of fire Amen hallelujah we must have the pillar of fire with us amen because we must have the power the pillar of fire we must have that because that's what Moses had amen we must have more than just the anointing where Balaam had we've got to have God's presence with us how many want his presence oh it's always been in humility it's always in sincerity praise God it's not as it's not pride that brings God's power its sincerity that brings God's power if we can just be more sincere if we can just give a complete sacrifice unto God amen so seven represents his complete sacrifice unto God now isn't this striking this about blew me out of my seat I was setting last night and saw what no word I don't remember reading that Satan has come as a red dragon he tries to devour the Christ child in Revelation 12 remember the woman with the crown with twelve stars which represented Israel and how many has it Satan have seven sad in Satan takes on a seven to try to impersonate God in that just like the devil he's so so trying to be like God that he appears as a dragon with seven heads with seven Crown's on them obviously those crowns won't last right those crowns will get cast down and thoughts of those are false crowns but we know Jesus has the real crown praise God he's got the real crown he's got the real authority Satan just trying to person him I'll give myself seven Crown's I'll be the complete King I'll be the complete Dragon the complete power but it's all impersonation he's imitating the true Christ the Beast out of the sea has seven heads and the scarlet coloured Beast so is it's the same beast has seven heads in revelation 17 whom the mother harlot row representing seven mountains on which the woman sat so seven heads on that scarlet coloured Beast representing the seven mountains there it is again Rome trying to personate the New Jerusalem right that's exactly right representing seven mountains on which the woman said now seven kings in Revelation 1710 but the Beast is the eight now this is gonna be a number we can use in the for the eight here's Satan impersonating the eighth now I don't know what this seven kings represents in revelation 17 there are seven kings but the beast is the eight and he comes out of the seventh some people have said it's the seventh Pope after you know one of the other popes I'm not sure I'm not kind of that but one thing's for sure that beast or the Antichrist comes out of that seventh king and he's the 8th King so I'm not sure how that works out but that's what the scripture says and I'm done let's stand to our feet by God's grace I'm at the close right there that's one of my shortest sermons in a long time not as short as Sunday night but pretty short how many know God's perfect in sevens praise God hallelujah I think the one that speaks to us the most is the worship with a complete heart to worship with completion to give God praise to give God a complete worship by God's grace man I come here so let's just do that let's worship the Lord here with the complete worship let's give him
