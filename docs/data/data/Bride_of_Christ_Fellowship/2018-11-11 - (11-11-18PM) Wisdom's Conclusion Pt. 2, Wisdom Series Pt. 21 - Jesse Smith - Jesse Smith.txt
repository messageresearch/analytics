here tonight by God's grace oh don't you love that my what a beautiful verse there you'll never never leave me yet nor yet forsake me here while I live by faith and do his blessed will praise God he's a wall of fire about me praise God Amy let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 12 I think tonight we'll be able to finish this book we preach through the whole book so very strengthened by the Word of God praise the Lord let's go to verse leave us verse 7 here I'll see you by God's grace we just like to call this again wisdoms conclusion we like to keep with that same thought about the grace of Lord tonight actually verse 9 so please ask these 12 verse 9 you know there's so much to learn isn't there for pilgrims like us we're just Pilgrims and strangers this world is not our home how many know that there's so much to learn you know Solomon said you can learn from the ant you can learn the Kony's the rock dwellers you can learn from every little thing jesus said remember Lot's wife we can remember so many things in here in Ecclesiastes we've been learning from a man who had the greatest wisdom to that point but then for sook it for cares of the world and I think if there's ever time we need to forsake things of the world it's now in Laodicea don't you think so where God has given us so much wisdom through the message of the hour this is a great time to forsake all the things of the world and live righteously and godly in this present world the last words we'd say the last written words here of a dying man who started off on fire for the Lord we'd say but then back slid because of lusts my let's go to verse chap I'm sorry chapter 12 verse 9 so this morning we ended with verse 8 we did please ask he's 12 1 to 8 this morning let's read verse 9 and moreover because the preacher was why's he still taught the people knowledge yea he gave good heat and sought out and set in order many proverbs the preacher thought I'm sorry the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written was upright even words of truth the words of the wise are as goads and as nails fastened by the Masters of Assemblies which are given from one Shepherd and further by these my son be admonished of of making many books there is no end the much study I'm sorry and much study is a weariness of the flesh let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether be evil let's have a word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known into the Lord and let's pray here tonight in God's presence Heavenly Father were grateful Lord for your promises you promise to never leave us or forsake us Lord we're happy to sing your songs Lord and we know Lord you're the lily of the valley dear God you're the bright and Morning Star you're the fairest of ten thousand to our souls Lord just breathing the name of Jesus makes our souls happy dear God we're happy to be here tonight happy to sing to the name of Jesus what a friend we have in you Lord God thank you for being our friend Lord and father help us to just keep all your word and Lord serve you and please you Lord and be a faithful friend to you thank you for your eternal friendship your faithfulness Lord God your constant companionship Lord in this life as we said Lord we're pilgrims and strangers give us wisdom Lord on this earthly journey tonight Lord as we we aim to finish out this book Lord I pray God you bless us in your divine presence with your wisdom in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen god bless you didn't see the praise the Lord now remember the word Ecclesiastes means the preacher so this book has been written from the perspective of a preacher let me set my timer so don't wear myself out here and of course we know this was solomon's book probably one of his last books because we find him at the end of his life here we find him he's tried everything remember we preached earlier in this series he tried the five W's and I can't remember them now but you know women and wine and wealth and I can't remember the last 200 words mailman's wisdom was one of them I can't remember the other one but he had tried everything he'd you know he'd left God he backs it on God and he said I'll just try to get mirth I'll just try to get happiness through any of these means and he found out it was all vanity it was all temporary in other words it wasn't going to last and here he comes down to his final words and he as we began this chapter remember the creator in the days of your youth because there if you if you get old there's going to be days where your body starts breaking down your backs gonna Bend like a bow Sothis there's all this morning your eyes are the windows of your eyes are gonna close the windows of your ears are gonna close it's gonna get hard to hear and there's gonna be all these hardships physically that come upon you so Solomon says remember God's spiritually you be strong spiritually so when your physical body goes out your spirit is ready to meet God amen and that's what we want we want our spirits to be ready to meet God we want to be at peace with God we want to be in love with God we want to be pleasing to God that's what we desire amen and so let's look at verse 9 and 10 here we already read it for our text but I just want to just say it mention a few things about it these are the author's parting exhortations verse 9 and moreover because the preacher was why's he still taught the people knowledge yeah he gave good heat and sought out and set in order many proverbs so see even at the end of his life he got to the point where he was still still trying to give people wise things and words of wisdom look at verse 10 the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written was upright even words of truth and God bless a man and God blessed a woman that wants to find the truth praise God there's so much lies out there you can find on your phone or on the internet or something like that there's so many lies out there there's so many things you can seek after but this preacher was seeking out acceptable words what would be good to tell the people what would help the people and that's why we administer as we study and pray what's going to help the people and there's one thing that's going to help you that's the truth of God's word amen the true words of God has it helped you today I hope it has helped you today by God's grace the words of truth acceptable words is what's gonna help you tonight now look at 1st Kings 432 maybe if Lily can just pull it up there because we want to stay in Ecclesiastes first Kings 432 this was a man who was fully given over he was just uh we would say inspired of God to collect all these words and all these proverbs all these words of wisdom look at the Bible said he spake 3,000 proverbs and his songs were a thousand and five he imagined he gets the end of his life and it seems like at the end of life here as it says the preacher was he still taught the people knowledge so even though he back slid all these years and no we know he served Israel forty years but after a couple decades there he began to fall away he must have come back at the end and he was still seeking out wise words and he still wanted to teach the people the knowledge about God and we know as a total he came up with about three thousand proverbs amen which was good for the people and his songs were a thousand five so this man knew the wisdom of God and I'll say like this he knew how to worship praise God Amen aren't you glad that we have the Word of God and that we have the wisdom of God and we can sing and worship God with wisdom today praise God amen because remember Solomon was great but we have to make sure we said it last Sunday we have to make sure we don't exalt him too high he was wisest of his day but then Jesus a thousand years later comes and says that John the Baptist is even greater than Solomon there's no wolf there's no man born among women that's greater than John the Baptist amen because he didn't just talk about the word or get inspired he actually held the Word of God he baptized the Word of God he pointed the people he said behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world amen he got to hold the word point to the word and see the Holy Spirit descend like a dove and so there was no man greater and he was and we know he was so great because look at the consecrated life that he lived amen for thirty years he was not well most of those I think handsome he was nine he went out there so for twenty-one years he was out in the wilderness away from denominations away from women which Solomon couldn't keep away from which on the Baptist kept away from it he chose to live with scorpions and serpents and and camels and he chose to live out there because he was so consecrated to God amen hallelujah talk about wisdom to see though it becomes it becomes this no matter how much in numerals no matter how many written proverbs you can write down no matter how many details you can memorize or or how many scriptures you can collect or how many message books you can collect it shows it's not about the number of about what you know it's a what's been lived out in what's been applied to your heart cuz Solomon had 3000 but those 3,000 weren't enough to keep him away from those 1000 women you understand numbers so it's not about how much revelation you have it's about what you do with what you've got praise God amen that's what we're saying it's not about and don't get me wrong Church it is so powerful to read your Bible read the message books and listen to brother Branham which I've been enjoying this week I'm halfway through Christ of the mystery of God revealed it's a four hour sermon I'm just going through it real slow I've been listening to it all week yesterday I spent a couple hours on it spend about an hour on this morning just listening and oh it just raises your faith you know it's such a blessing so I don't we're not going to diminish from that because member Paul with the Holy Ghost tells the preachers give yourself to read and give yourself wholly to reading and exhortation and study that the people might see your gains they might see your gift improve unto God so we got to balance that out later in this chapter but it see it's not so much about what we know it's about what we really believe praise God that's exactly right so see 3,000 proverbs aren't enough to save somebody from a thousand women if you're not fully devoted to the Word of God in other words if you won't crucify the lust of the flesh if you won't croute if you won't die out daily as Paul said if you won't die out daily this message isn't going to be powerful in your life unless you apply it to your life amen that's exactly right so see what good is 3000 with words of wisdom without a surrendered heart to Christ amen how many want a surrendered heart to God that's what it all boils down to brother Branham said those theologians the days of Jesus they had the Bible memorized course they had the mission of memorized to unfortunately which was it Matt they're man-made interpretation of the law so they added a book to the Bible right they added on to the Bible and the Bible says if you add to the Bible you add plagues to your life so they had all that knowledge and they stood there watching Jesus do these and Jesus would discern their hearts and they get upset well here comes a prostitute woman a woman at the well Jesus discerns our heart one time and it sets her soul afire amen she runs into the town and tells them look he told me all the things that I've ever done isn't this the Messiah to see it's not how much you know it's about what you really believe and accept and put to application in your life praise God see she could actually be honest with herself yes I have done this with these men I have been filthy but I can recognize God's presence and it's a reality and I know I'm never going back to that I'm gonna go testify to the people and tell them and it will actually have an effect on people's lives amen hallelujah thank God for the power in the gospel it's still doing that today praise God a man is still doing that today I don't I don't know the caller hice high school mentor he's a father one of my friends and he called me up and last week and he just said Jesse I just want to tell you how proud I am of you he said I don't even know how you're doing what you're doing you you work a full-time job you Pastor and then you preach and you do all these things you make the YouTube videos he said I don't even know how you doing I said I said friend I said it's all by the grace of God it's only by Paul said if he said my labor more than all of you it wasn't me laboring but it was Christ in me it was the grace of God that was in me the grace of God has done this and everything we do people can look at our lives and see my there's been a great change I'm so glad that God showed me that people are watching my life we don't hear from them from years but they're watching our lives they're hearing about our lives our lives speak volumes our lives are casting out the bread upon the waters and that bread will return unto us amen hallelujah oh it's such a privilege to be a Christian how many of you say amen to that our lives are speaking loud if we can even speak and that's what we want real Christian character speaks louder than a sermon amen glory so see it's it's good to seek out words but it's better to live what you have first rather than trying to have the most revelation the most scriptures on this topic you know we used to do that when we first cover the message see who could get you know John and I and differ we see how many scriptures we could get on topic which was fine but that's not the number of scriptures that you have it's the number it's the amount of obedience in your heart to the word it's good to want to have a foolproof you know completely true doctrine oh that's good that's good but we need a surrendered heart to love Jesus and and do whatever his spear would ask us to do amen now let's go to verse 11 that's kind of like the first thought there these are is these are Solomon's last exhortation he's got to come down to the end of his life he's tried everything see member he saw God twice seeing God twice was enough to keep him from of those all those women see that that all approved us right there Lord let my let my anchor not being experiences or maybe just spiritual gifts but let it be in my remember I love for you praise God let me have a love for you that no matter what experiences I have I thank God for those experiences but let my heart be surrendered so much so on a daily basis that I'll never back side and fall away from your presence Amen thank God I thank God for experiences but I know my life has to tally up to the Word of God every single day if I take a day off that's a day I lost and now I got to repent and get it right back to God amen if not it's going to keep falling further and further away like the snowball down the hill we don't want that effect we don't want that effect is as far as sin we want to grow closer and stronger the Bible said the light shines more unto a perfect day praise God a life that's more holy on a life that's more like Christ amen verse 11 now I want to bring verse 11 is quite full brother Ram said numerous things about this so this is a quite a jam-packed scripture with some different thoughts in here so I'm going to take a little bit time I imagine this scripture will have the most on it in this little short message here all right verse 11 the words of the wise are as goads he's come down to the end of his life and as nails fastened by the Masters of assemblies is anything about this sound particularly comfort right now nails wise words are like nails does anyone think of a nail and think oh that's comforting that's sweet and soft and kind well maybe but I don't know what nails you got cuz I know the nails in my house are pretty sharp I've stepped on a nail when I was younger I'd get a tetanus shot cuz I stepped on nail went right through my shoe right into my foot I think I was about 9 or 10 years old that was not very comforting the Bible says the words of why so Solomon knew this and then of his life wise words when preached to us are going to be sharp like nails and as nails they're fastened by the Masters of assembly which are given from one Shepherd now church you know there's only one Shepherd and it's not me I'm a shepherd but I'm not one Shepherd there's only one Shepherd and that's Jesus Christ the chief shepherd but there are masters masters of assembly somebody look at a little bit of background here now according to the background Solomon is using a pastoral metaphor this is how he closes out his life here he says wise warriors will be like a goad and if you ever seen a goad it's like a stick with a sharp point on one end now there's different shapes I've seen them online there's different shapes of goats kind of like Shepherd staffs and the nails or points are inserted at the end of the sticks you have a big stick and they stick a nail at the end of it there they drill a hole and that's got this nail sticking out of the end now this is the scripture and the Bible actually backs it up in 1st Samuel 13 21 it said yet they had a file for the Mattocks which are weapons and for the Coulter's and for the hooks and for the axes and to sharpen the goads can you pull out their Lydia first Samuel 13 21 so he says wise words are as goads so you could have a go you could have a stick now here Israel was going out to fight and so when they're going out to fight the Philistines that the sharpen their guns so a gold was a stick of course to keep animals in line and the shepherd animals so you could have a goat and it could have a sharp nail or dull nail now which one does God always have God has a sharp sharp nail the Bible said the Word of God is what dull no that's how we get we get dull right God's Word is sharp and sharper than any double-edged sword and it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart when God speaks to us church we should expect something sharp from God something and I don't have to be loud like I'm getting loud because I'm getting excited but they don't have to be loud it can just be something that just shakes you right there as you're reading your Bible in the morning or you're going to bed it just kind of shakes you up there I never thought about that but anytime the Word of God comes Solomon says the words of wise are like goats now see Israel to sharpen there's God don't ever have to sharpen his it's perpetual sharp it's continually sharp God can't get a better more sharper word God can't get a better word or you know an improved message know God's Word is always sharp it's always on time and always cut right down to the core of your being amen it always speak right to your soul how many thank God for that oh praise God amen now so see this is a go now look this is the same word in acts 26 14 Lydia / pull this up here let me know that Paul was a real good chef or a real good sheep Paul stood on like a sheep going to slaughter all the day long but there's a time he wasn't such a good shepherd sheep rather there's a time that Paul kicks against the goads right how many could say Amen that you're you're a sheep but there was a time when you were kicking against the goads I've always been a sheep I've never been a go I don't know about you but I've never been a goat I've always been a sheep I just didn't understand I was a sheep praise God I never got changed from a goat to a sheep I have a lorries been a sheep but for a while I just needed a lot of pricks from the goat and the church said you were never a goat because whatever you were whenever si was in that was in you at the beginning it's always been in you praise God hey man you've always been a sheep you've always been a child of God you just didn't know it amen but now you know it Amen and this is what God was doing the paw all these years Paul was putting Christians you know in prison and he was trying to get them to blaspheme Jesus and say y'all you say you don't believe in Jesus the Bible says that I mean that and when they were off onto the earth I heard a voice speaking unto me saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecutest thou me it's hard for you to kick against these bricks amen it's hard Paul now look what the word means it means an iron goad for urging on oxen horses or other beasts of burden hence the proverb the kids kick against the goat to offer vain and perilous ruin is a ruinous existence in other words Paul was just vainly kicking against it when he would take people off when he would take Christians to church he was just kicking against the goads he was fighting a losing battle and I'm so glad when we were sinners we were fighting a losing battle Satan was not going to get the victory over us Amen God was going to deliver us we were kicking against the pricks Jesus was gonna was going to keep chasing us and correcting us until we finally surrendered to Jesus amen that's what the Bible says he was kicking against the pricks of the one Shepherd hallelujah oh I'm so thankful for that Paul kicked against the goad you and I kicked against the go-to but God was merciful to us aren't you glad first mercy aren't you glad he had to go there to get you straightened out to get you to finally repent finally surrender finally shot stop trying to impress the world or impress our friends aren't you glad you had that prick there to cut you and to Humble you and to bring you into obedience I'm so glad he did it for me praise God amen the Bible said that these goats pierced I'm sorry Solomon says that goats pierce deeply into your mind so when you hear a wittle word of wisdom from the Holy Spirit it will pierce into your mind if your mind is able to receive it wise words are inspired words so when you hear a wise word it should encourage you it's just strengthened you to action because wisdom is not a passive thing wisdom is an active thing wisdom doesn't hold back on God wisdom moves the Bible said wisdom hath builded her house how many understand what I'm talking about when you receive the wisdom of God you start building you start going to work you start doing what God has instructed you to do wisdom is an action word we're acting out the will of God yes that's exactly right and now one one commentator says the Bible says they're fastened there as nails fastened and so one commentator says they're fastened in the memory like nails now that's a-that's that's one that's one interpretation they have there that there's fastened so the Word of God when the Word of God gives you instruction and it's the wisdom of God it should be fastened in our mind we should remember time search if we come here long enough we should remember times when it seemed like God was speaking directly to us because it was just fast and in your heart God just spoke something he knew you needed it maybe when brother Joe was here brother Ben deraad was here but maybe God just spoke something so personal to you it should be fast and it was so sharp it was like it was fast or fastened in your mind and you'll always remember that and you'll always thank God for that do you think saw we know I'll say like this we know saw never Paul never forgot when God smoked him on the road to emmaus because decades later he tells King Agrippa all about it amen he said I was on the road he said that the light struck me down and said saw saw and he's testifying and and it was such a powerful testimony that he said Saul you almost persuade persuade me to be a Christian and he said I wish you were like me except for these bonds I wish you had the Holy Ghost like me I wish you love Jesus Christ like me except you weren't in prison like I Oh what a tender heart Paul had he wanted to see even the king agrippa repent and serve God and though those words of wisdom never left him they stayed with him praise God let me this reminds me it's go to acts 20 I believe this reminds me some of those nails fastened in the memory of song it's actually actually acts 26 this is before Agrippa that's right yeah Amen this is ad 62 let's see what the year was let's see what butcher says about this when Saul got converted okay so apparently Saul got converted in 8035 my and almost thirty years later he still remembers those words fastened in his heart hallelujah Church honestly we should remember when we were saved like it was yesterday if God really spoke a word of wisdom if we really got a heavenly touch it should be so fastened on our mind that we could instantly testify about it to anybody in the congregation ah thirty years later he still can't get away from when the Holy Ghost spoke to him Dave man I hope you're feeling good like I am praise God oh mercy thirty years later look what he said verse 16 26 16 but lies and stand upon thy feet for I've appeared only for this purpose to make the administer and the witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things in which I will appear unto thee so if someone has pawpaw what's the purpose of God for your life he could say the Holy Spirit told me the Holy Spirit told me I'm gonna be a minister and a witness how many here know that you're supposed to be a witness as well because when the Holy Ghost fell the Bible said they were witnesses unto Judea and Jerusalem and all the uttermost parts of the earth hallelujah Church all's we've got to be is a witness to our children we've got to be a witness on the job we just got a witness and say well they might not work for them but Jesus work for me praise God you just gotta be a witness I don't know about the other guy don't know why they made these decisions but I know when I cried out to God God answered my prayer you just got to be a witness we just need the grace of God to witness the power of God he said be a minister and a witness this is your your whole purpose in life to be a servant preaching and then to be a witness of the power of God and then he says I'm gonna show you more things when I appear unto you is that what that says and of those things in which I will appear unto thee how many right there right now you you're looking to see what God wants you do in the future is anybody right there see how you're gonna be a minister and a witness and of all the things that I'm gonna show you that's my desire that's what I'm looking for right now Lord what's the next step brother Ram was always was often thinking about that what's the next step what is that what's the next leadership of the Holy Spirit and so see that that means we just can't coast we've got to be constantly listening to the voice of the Holy Spirit to wait for him to appear unto us again oh oh that's my prayer God appear to me again show yourself to me again so I can hear your word thank you Jesus Oh glory look at this delivering me from the people see gods of God deliverance he delivered me from all those sinners I used to hang out all those friends I used to hang out with what Jesus do he delivered me from them they were trying to kill me Jesus was trying to save me praise God and from the Gentiles and under whom now I send thee look at this verse 18 to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by the faith that is in me what a powerful testimony is this what you feel Church I hope you feel this I hope your eyes have been opened has the eye salve of God been rubbed all over your eyes can you see what's actually can you see what's happening in this world our eyes should be open and we should be turned we should be leaving the things of darkness and we should be in the power of light and we should be in the power of God not the power of Satan this is why Jesus appeared to him and he was kicking against that can you imagine an animal kicking against it all those years he was kicking I don't want to do that I can't no Jesus can't be the Messiah he's kicking against it he's kicking against it and Jesus finally says why are you kicking against the pricks it's it's vain it's impossible you're not gonna win if you wrestle against God so instead of fighting God why don't you surrender to God hey man and if we're wrestling about the will of God in our lives let's not wrestle let's surrender Church many times you probably seen with other people and maybe your life too many times when we struggle with the will of God many times is because we already know what we're supposed to do we're just not doing it we know what we're supposed to do but we're just don't we just don't we're a little stubborn and we just don't want to do what God's called us to do and the church said most of time we already know but see we're just kicking against it and it's useless to do it it's useless to waste your time hurting yourself getting chasing by God it's it's worthless to do that it'd be better just to humble yourself and obey amen praise God it's hard for you to kick against the pricks I'm so glad that people can see I'm under the power of God and I'm not on the power of Satan anymore I thank God that people call me up 20 years later and say you're really serving the Lord amen that's what I want I want the life of Christ to flow through me I want to shine his light deep into the night praise God amen now look at this so we get two ideas from the scripture two more wise Warriors are going to pierce your heart and mind because on the day of Pentecost Peter preached a five-minute sermon and three thousand people said our hearts are pricked 9 I'm looking at all you church people worship that's what we need we need worship that me gets people pricked amen we know honey Dupree sermons that'll prick people's hearts amen he preached a five-minute sermon after seeing people dancing the spirit of speaking tongues and praise the Lord and said well let me at this he says this is that which Joel prophesied of all she did was say this is a fulfillment this day that scripture from Joel is fulfilled that 800 year old scripture is happening right now we're prophesying we're speaking the Word of God and 3,000 people got convicted nah I want a part of that baptize me in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen that's what the power of the gospel does it pricks the hearts and the day of Pentecost 3,000 hearts were pricked so they must have been kicking against the goads they must have been kicking all that time because our hearts are pricked aah I'm paying this this word is to serve my heart remember the Word of God is sharp piercing and this divides asunder the soul from spirit right so in other words wisdom is supposed to break conviction to you conviction wisdom is supposed to be fastened in your memory and I know like it's like this wisdom will Pradas along and keep us on the straight and narrow but is it comfortable church to be prodded along by one Shepherd with a big sharp goat on the end of a stick is that comfortable never never I can never find an animal that liked to be proud of the law did you ever find one Liddy's ever seen an animal it likes to be beaten and abuse any horses that like to be bitten no I didn't think so no animal likes it they don't like the pain but the Bible says here Solomon realized many times humans are stubborn right because we got part of us that's a beast right this fleshly man's a beast he's the enemy against God amen you've got a party that's a beast and then the soul man which is divine but many times in our mind we said of living from the soul we live from the flesh and so God has two products alone poke us and get us thrown getting obedience it has to pierce us so we'll walk obedient to the Holy Spirit brother madam call gospel protoplasm spanking he calls it a spiritual smack that's true promise alone though one Shepherds got a Protestant long you know it actually be more wise if you did this brother Jesse you know what actually it's foolish to keep doing this what you're doing sister it'd be more wise if you just did this and the Lord will just prod you and cut you along like that you should have done the wise thing and you feel oh you feel cut that's right I should have let me understand what I'm talking about this is what this is what Solomon learns so I wonder how many times when he would take I wonder when he took this let's just say the 25th wife or the Jose I wonder if he felt got a little proud from the Lord like okay you're you have enough wives now let's say 31 you've got enough wives for each day of the month I wondered at what time was he prodded that's enough it's enough I wonder how many of his counselors came and said now Solomon you know what Deuteronomy says a man that has many wives he's gonna have a lot of trouble and I wonder if those words were just like prods that he just kept I don't care what you say I'm the king I've got all this money I can do whatever I want same thing for us we know God's truth we know what the word says but there's just something stubborn about us and so God has to Pradas God leads his dear children on some through the waters some through the floods all great all through great trials but all through the blood it'll all work out God's not going to get he's not gonna cast you away like we're talking about lunch with brother Jason God's not gonna cast us away but he may have to purify us a little more he may have to take us through some fires of purification some prods of Correction this is what he learns at the end after 40 years of ministry we'll say like that 40 years of leading Israel these are his final words this is how God corrects his people so wisdom from one shepherd that's the holy spirit I'm just a minor shepherd but I have to answer to the chief shepherd Jesus Christ off to answer for this sermon tonight off to answer for this morning's message that's why I want to make sure it lines up with the Word of God with what the prophets said about the Word of God I want it all to dovetail together because I wanted to be acceptable in the sight of my shepherd look her brother have says about rod and staff and a member of gold was like a staff and the Bible says thy rod and thy staff they comfort me so this is not speaking of the flesh this is speaking of the soul when you get a sharp cutting word a gold stuck to you it makes you feel comforted not in your flesh not in your mind but in your soul because you know God really does care about me he cares about me enough to cut me and hurt me and pierce me because I know he loves me Churchill never feels good to it never feels good to fail in front of people all the church knows I made this mistake oh and see if we're not careful we'll let that we'll let that be just a natural cut and it'll be guilt and shame that's why a lot of people stopped coming to church they just get ashamed I know one person that you particularly to come to our church once they stop coming for church for a while they're like well I can never go back because one of the people gonna think about me when I get back and I told them on the email I said the people are gonna rejoice when you come back that's what they're gonna think praise God they're gonna think you got touched by the Holy Spirit and God's giving you're available but they still don't come back because Satan is so pierce them in their minds instead of excited instead of accepting the piercing of the soul from the word they accept Satan's piercing and Saint makes him feel bad like it's your father they'll never love you in fact that's why I brother I don't think brother Austin would mind me Sharon that's why Alston actually we left the church he's he said he felt bad Satan was telling him that he was too much of a burden on us and it was it was his fault that people were leaving the church and and I said no and he started crying see that whole time he was letting Satan poke him instead of receiving what God was trying to tell him that's true that's what he told me he's crying he said I thought that's why and I told him I said the people that left the church disagree with me on doctrine or they just got tired of you know you know whatever the hardships were but it's nothing you did but Satan had so convinced him now Church I know I think I know why because when you stop coming to church you stop hearing the voice of God when you stop praying at home when you stop reading your Bible at home when you stop fellowshiping with Saints Satan gets you all isolated he gets you away from everybody and he just gets you in that corner and just whispers oh you're the reason everybody's having a hard it's your fault and he gets you too you know isolated in the room he isolates you and he lies to you you turn your back when you don't come to church you abandon the church you're all you're all over here by yourself it's so selfish to not come to church it's one of the most selfish things you can do and not come to church because you abandon the believers the believers need to be strengthened by you you need to encourage the Bible says encourage and a five people here help people here when you don't come to church you know edify anybody except Satan is that right and that's what caused our brother to stop coming for a year and a half and then he came back for one service and he he said I haven't felt like this way I pray with him he repented now he was leaving off the Arizona and he said I haven't felt like this since I left he said I've had one day of joy since I left the church and that really made me feel sad but it also made me feel grateful think about how happy I've been this whole time and then we're coming it just just by being the house of God you're happy you're joyful you got a positive outlook on life you see that there's hope maybe not for Masse's but there's hope for the elect amen there's hope for the pre nests and the ones who really love God there's hope for anyone that will serve Jesus Christ anyone that fears God there's hope for them praise God how did I get there praise the Lord I'm not sure Oh Graham said what did David say though I walk through the valley shout death I'll fear no evil for not with me he said walk with him now he will walk with you in the valley anybody going through a valley right now but Graham said he will walk with you in the valley of the shadow of death not death but the shadow of it where it's like death is looming or destruction is looming he'll walk with you in the valley of the shadow of death it seems like death is just a just a adore adore adore adore lay it seems like death is so close but yet he said I'll walk with you this close I will always be with you in other words I'm a faithful Shepherd I won't leave you in hard times I'll encourage you in hard times I'll strengthen you in hard times I'll fulfill your request in hard times I will Menace you minister to you in hard times I'll never leave you alone because you're my sheep amen and I know all my sheep my name ha ha oh yeah praise God and he knows all the numbers the hairs on our sheep coats I'll say like that he knows each hair of wool I don't know if wolves got hair or not I know each of those pieces of hair will the wool from the hairs I know each one on my all my sheep thy rod and thy staff they comfort me but I have said the correction of the Lord they comfort me they let me know that God is with me cuz he corrects me from all my wrongs praise God how do you know God's with you brother Jesse how did by the RAM know God was with him because when he lied the Holy Spirit was there to correct his lie praise the Lord when he when he went with ministers in South Africa how do you know God was with him because God said you did it wrong and you're gonna suffer for it but I'm still with you amen how do you know God's with you because he corrects you when you're wrong he keeps prodding you you need to do this now of course he don't do it like that that's just me but well I know he didn't Solomon like that because the Bible said God was angry with song if you imagine God he was angry I told you not to take those wives I told you to stay true to me I told you not to build idols and altars God was anger Osama I don't want God to be angry with me Church I just want a little pride can you say Amen I know what pride after pride why don't you do this why don't you do I just want a little pride yes Lord yes yes Lord yes yes yes sir yes sir forgive me Lord I don't want to walk in the or disobedience I want to walk in obedience to the Lord I just give me a little give me a little pride how do you know he loves you because he corrects you from all your wrongs brother Graham said but Ram said maybe he's trying to correct you tonight maybe he's trying to correct us tonight why don't you let the rod and staff come for you the rod is the hard preaching gospel but it's a comfort to let me know that God speaks to me when that type of Gospels being preached to correct me he loved me he wants me to come walk with him now and then I'll he will walk with me in that hour see Bill Graham says that Jesus prods us Jesus corrects us so that wool with him so then he can walk with us so what does it show as long as we're serving God we're walking with Christ but when when we get a little bit unruly disobedient he tries the Pradas they come back over here come back over here and finally after enough prods it's okay and now we can walk back with him again and the church said prod me Lord correct me then I'll walk back with you so that you'll walk with me amen praise God just want to walk with them I just want to walk with the Lord Jesus brother Graham said the staff the rod and thy staff program said the staff is the word of this hour he says he said what did he do he said by the Shepherd's staff not a textbook not a theologians idea but a shepherd staff not a denominational prayer book be careful what prayer books you get be careful what books you read is that right look especially look if it came from someone who goes to not denomination because it's going to kill you it's poison food that right Shepherd's ride rod guiding his sheep making the way clear as they went towards the promised land what a beautiful thing it is today of his today shepherd's staff guiding his sheep to the promised land by passing theology and everything else for this world and denominations opening up the way improving his word to be the truth the Shepherd's staff going ahead so what's the Shepherd staff the revealed word of this hour amen he said did you notice the same shepherd's staff that was guiding the Sheep you believe that he certainly did God the Sheep he delivered them out of Egypt with the staff in Moses his hand we could say much more about it so each shepherd each prophet deliverer had a staff had a rod that delivered the people and so it is today God has a rod that delivers his people that's his word I don't know if you ever heard this this was kind of shocking to me in 1961 before brother Han preached the ever-present water from the rock he said be with us today and give us words of wisdom as Solomon once said in the cleese the asses he actually quotes the scripture that we would be wise Miller's that we'd be the Shepherd's of this assembly he says so now that mine let's read that verse again increases 12:11 brother branham said the words of the wise he said Lord let my words be wise to build this assembly as shepherds of the assembly please ask these twelve eleven the words of the wise are as goads and his nails fastened by the Masters of the assembly which are given from one Shepherd so now Bertram's Frank said Lord give me these words that I might he says the preachers are like the Masters of the Assemblies the Shepherd gives them the goes and their to fasten that right they're supposed to to prod aunt and preach to the people the words of God that it fastens in their mind amen that's why I hope church like I said I've said it many times before that's why I hope when you leave their service something was fastened to your mind but you can't forget it my God spoke to me last night God spoke to me yesterday morning God wrote that in other words God wrote something upon the fleshly tables of my heart God was prodding me God was trying to push me along no that's the wrong way go this way oh my remember wisdom always builds the wisdom of God sometimes has to cut you right but when it cuts you it's actually building you up like Reno's muscles right when you when you lift heavy weights it breaks the muscle but then because it breaks it rips it actually builds it up stronger we know that and that's what the Word of God does it cut you and cut you but then the Holy Spirit comes and builds it up and makes it stronger for God amen wisdom hath build in her house the Bible says every woman every wise woman build with her house proverb says again through wisdom is a house builded by understanding is it is established so we see wisdom build the house of God wisdom will build your house wisdom will build your testimony we've got to let wisdom do it we've got to obey the wisdom we can't kick against the pricks we've got to obey with the Holy Spirit saying that's right verse 12 let's go to these asses twelve twelve I told you there was a lot in that verse there's a lot in there there's a lot more to like I could hide all those quotes from white had to be Shepherds mother and goes through all the shepherds all the prophets were shepherds you could tie all that into there God was leading them with Shepherds that had goats and those words that they preached would always prod the people long prod them move them correct them to stay with the Word of God please ask these twelve twelve was trying to finish this here I already preached 45 minutes I told myself I'd try to preach forty-five so a little bit longer and further by these my son be admonished of making many books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh now the word admonish means warned so the Bible says be warned so some of his last words he said be warned making books of making many books there is no end so see our goal in life shouldn't just meet up to make books in and try to try to increase knowledge right it's not about the number of books it's about the quality of books praise God because I think there's one book outside of this book there's one book that's meant the world to me and that's the church age book I've read a lot of books but that one has been the most inspiring and because of that book I understand this book a lot better and I get and I apply what I've learned as the points of this book I'll apply that to my life and I've been blessed because of it in my family in the church in my personal life in my finances everything I've read in there my spiritual life it's all pointed this book that's been one book that's been great for me it's been war it's worn me Church you'll never feel like you've read enough books so it's not about what I need to read more different books you need to choose the right books in which to read because reading is I shared on Wednesday reading and writing is your meditation time David said I'm going to meditate upon your word in the bed how many read in bed I always try to write right before bed I try to write out a little bit about my goals for the next day and I've realized that's meditation time that's time I get to focus that's time I get to cast on anything that results itself against God I get to forget about that and I get to get my mind on the Word of God so see it's not about like I need to read more different books it's not so much about all the number of books it's about reading the most important books that's exactly right because if you try do that it'll be weary weariness to your flesh I've had a good friend over the years and this friend is all of it is easy he's been all about the number of resources and the number of books he wants to read and I found by watching different people's lives that are like that they think by the number of resources they accumulate they're going to be wiser but I've actually seen the opposite the more different number of resources they read because as you read more there's less people that actually believe the message a lot of those authors don't believe in the baptism of the holy ghost so they'll give you license to do things that the Bible says you shouldn't do and I've seen the people that are chasing numbers and and and try to increase their number of resources are drawn away from the truth of the word of God so be careful which authors you read and be careful how many books you are reading by authors that don't believe the message of the hour don't get me wrong every now and then you can do a good book where where you know maybe the authors Pentecostal or even Baptist or something I've read numerous Baptist books but what I never spend a lot of time in them I just glean out as I read quickly through it I glean out what's true is that oh my brother Branham preached this or I never saw that let me see what brother Branham said about it and I find it gives me greater revelation in the message but I don't spend more time on books outside the message I more time up books in the message praise God like right now we're at FF Bosworth will he follow brother branham for a while I read the Perry green book the church age book you know we got to stay with our minds upon those authors who've written the Word of God that had a really word based experience praise God that knew Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever amen they knew him in the power of the Resurrection amen but remember as Paul told Timothy you should preachers should give themselves to study to prayer to meditation to reading the Bible says that I'm supposed to give myself constantly to reading but reading the right things it is only when you're and some of you know this too if you've been to college you read all those books and you don't feel any smarter I have to read in the Hall of the assigned reading you don't feel any bit smarter than when you started because it's weariness that's the same thing there's really no power in it I'll tell you if you read the Bible long enough pretty soon the Holy Spirit is going to come strike you it's gonna inspire something that's you read because this is a Living Word this is a sharp word amen the Holy Spirit comes too quick in this world amen but reading my educational books I'm like did somebody give me some inspiration I've read all this before I already know this this isn't even interesting much studying of that is weariness to the flesh but studying of this is life amen studying this is life because the Holy Spirit inspires this to our hearts so that that scripture needs to be balanced he's not saying don't read your Bible brother Jason that's not what he's saying or sister Karen slow down your reading of the Bible Lydia stop reading the Bible your your flesh is getting tired no your flesh getting tired because you need to go to bed or maybe you didn't sleep enough last night but when you read you should read eternal inspired words so see all these words got to be balanced out because Paul says by the Holy Spirit give yourself to reading let's just read that real quick it's 1st Timothy 3 I believe or second Timothy three let me check yeah I think it's uh first Timothy yeah first Timothy four yeah sorry okay look at verse thirteen until I come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine neglect not the gift that's in thee so see Paul says when you read the Word of God it actually increases your gift how many know you got to get from God if you've got a gift of God into anything you need to read the Word of God and let that word strengthen and build up your gift and the church said everybody here should have a spiritual gift if you're a believer no ramesses every believer has a spiritual gift so we need to give ourselves if we don't read the Word of God we neglect the gifts in our life I know this is for preachers but it has to apply to everybody else verse fifteen meditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them now notice he doesn't echo Solomon's words and we'll help you if you give yourself to too much reading brother bang or brother Jesse if you give herself to us reading it'll be weirdness to your flesh she doesn't say that though Solomon is talking about something else he's not talking about the Word of God he's talking about worldly wisdom or like finance books like we all know at some point we all like to read well how can I do it better than finance you start reading some of those you get too many you know too many ideas remember this books got enough wisdom about finances right here or parenting you know pretty soon you get all these books in all my or marriage all these books well let's come back to this book amen I appreciate that glean out of there would always come back to this one right here he said holy give herself wholly to reading and I think that I property may appear to all take heed unto thyself and the doctrine continuing them for doing this thou shalt both save thyself and then then hear me I want to be saved and I know you want to be saved and we're going to be saved by preaching God's true doctrine God's true word and thank God for the goads that prick us that are fastened in our mind so remember the wisdom of God praise God well I got two amens on that hallelujah yeah I know it's not it's not easy to Amen when you're getting pricked when you're getting goads jammed in your back that's not easy but that's God's Way to lead his children along when we don't obey that's God's Way wise words are like goads but member to your soul it's a comfort well thank God it shows God's with me still he's not gonna let me be a Judas and just go out there and sell him out and all these things he's gonna bring me back to the fold praise God amen all right let me try to find a place to close here verse 13 please a sees 12 13 now Wednesday Lord willing will preach on that first part of Christ the mystery of God revealed I've just been feeling led to go there someone too finished numerology I'm still at number 7 in numerology I'm still at chapter 7 and the book of Revelation I got all these series I'm still in chapter 4 in Ephesians I got all these series but I'm just trusting God to help me to finish him as the Lord would lead me praise God I just love the Word of God I there's so many topics I want to preach on it's just hard to decide any times so I got to pray and get the prodding from the Holy Spirit twelve thirteen let's finish this here so let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter what is wisdoms conclusion fear God and keep his commands for this is the whole duty of man duty means totality in the Hebrew this is the totality of your purpose on earth is to keep God's command it's very simple to understand what God is ones from us God wants obedience from us he wants us to manifest his life on this earth and that only happens through obedience to the Word of God so the conclusion from an old back slit in the disobedient king who lusted after women and I died it was an eye doctor and he's now starting to come back right before he dies his conclusion is fear God keep his commands so what do you think he's saying I wish I would have kept his commands when I had when I was younger and I had all that strength I wish I would have kept his commands look at verse 14 for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil let me read you these last few things brother Bram said about fearing God brother man said even in our polluted condition today how many know your flesh is polluted how many know you've got serpent seed running through your natural blood then the church said remember all the bloodlines came together and Noah's day how remember that that's why you hate your flesh so much how can I act like a devil it's not you it's the flesh you've got seven seed running through these maze how come I'm so happy some days for Jesus in other days I don't even feel like doing it like last night I had such a good day of study I woke up in my flesh didn't wanna do nothing I'm like what's wrong with me why do I feel like a backslidden serpent seed or something like that tried to get my closet and praying pretty soon after prayer I come out of it I read okay it's just this flesh it's just this serpent nature thank god I've got a big nature on the inside amen thank God because the dumb nature cleans out from the inside out as we saying when I feel like what's wrong what's wrong with me why am i so lazy why do I feel so back stir them today I just need that dove nature to flow out and clean from the inside out so I realize what I really am the nature of God praise God even in our polluted condition today man was made to serve God that's his full duty on the earth here the great wisest man summoned all the rest of them speaking in classes he said let's hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his commands this is the full duty of and he said that's the full duty of man he says an animal there's nothing in an animal to give him a soul an animal doesn't have a soul but man has a soul and therefore that soul is a part of God oh and the church said your soul is a part of God God's a spirit your soul is a spirit be that soul came from God amen the Bible says your soul must be quickened it must be made alive praise the Lord by the Holy Spirit and even in it's fallen state yet it's the most greatest species of all the species on the earth is the man and then get him in connection with his maker he becomes a super man when you get in connection with the holy spirit you become a super man or woman hallelujah do you feel like a super woman tonight you feel like a super man tonight when you're in contact with your maker but the Baron says you'll feel like a Superman or superwoman I'll yeah hey man I feel connected to the holy spirit tonight I hope you need to praise God he says he becomes the Super Man almost because he's a son of God he becomes acquainted with this maker with the creator of all things and then when that man they're acquainted with his maker becomes a part of his maker he becomes back into fellowship with his maker every divine word becomes a living reality to him and he believes it that's how you know you're a super woman tonight or Superman how do I know I'm a super woman because every word brother Jesse's preaching from the Bible it's a living reality to me it's not a dead letter it's not a religion it's not begging you to be like a religious Catholic or routine Catholic or something like that it's pretty it's prodding you on to believe the word and know that everything that God says is true amen it's a reality it's not a game it's not a play we're not pretending Christian and the enemy tonight it's a reality and the proof will be tomorrow when when the troubles come if you clean to the word or not it'll show if it's a reality or not amen Oh hallelujah so tomorrow when that little seven-year-old in my class gets the demon spirit arm and tries to make fun of me and rebuke me in front of everybody I'll have the grace of God to answer that person usually it's a boy usually have a chance to answer that boy back really sweetly and say no I'm sorry you're disrespecting me but I'll be happy to correct you instead of getting mad and angry and making that child feel bad which they you know they try to embarrass me and all kinds of things like you know how kids are these days they try to speak evil against adults and they think they know everything see tomorrow when that spirit rises up if I really received this word and I know the Holy Spirit will remind me I said this tomorrow because that's how he is that's she's he's showing that he loves me when he corrects me he's showing me that he's still with me and he loves me then the power of the sharp go this sharp word is coming it'll correct me tomorrow to remind me it'll prick me tomorrow that's right I've got to use humility I don't have overcome evil with evil I overcome evil with good and I will manifest the reality of Christ's presence in my life I'll manifest it to someone that may not deserve it but will manifest it by the power of His grace amen so you're a superwoman if
