========================================

word of encouragement today uh there's so many things that are happening in our lives right now and within the framework of the world within the framework of the religious system and I'm sure that most of us are understanding the time in the seasons that we're in um and I want to say uh this which I'm sure most of us realize that is later than what you think I believe that we are about to embrace the translation and those who are predestined to do so will do so and I'm trusting that each and every one of us here this morning are one of them and uh because I'm glad to be one of them uh we we have received the message of Malachi 4 that has given back to us our identity of where we came from and where we going and I am so grateful for that uh in the name of the Lord Jesus amen as we stand we we also want to give honor to uh uh Pastor Jesse uh Smith and his family and the church family we thank you for having us here again uh Jesse reminded me it's been just a year ago and it feels like it's been 10 years ago uh but uh nevertheless we are grateful to be among you and we always Lay Love Your Way of worship uh we love the songs that you sing uh they are also meaningful and I love that uh as we stand let us turn to Romans 8:22 I want to give honor to my wife and and those who are with me my grandchildren and my my son Joseph and his daughter and the rest we appreciate you being here by the grace of God Romans 8:22 uh which is a familiar scripture we're going to give you all the voice that I have uh and whatever God gives us amen so we thank God for that uh it makes me uh feel pretty good actually Romans 8:22 through 23 for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruit of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the Redemption to Wi the Redemption of our body amen amen and um we're going to ask that you turn with us to Revelations 10 8-1 Hallelujah and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little the book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings but there will come but there will come a time soon when this will be just I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm just uh reading two things together and let me read that 10th verse again and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly belly was bitter let's pray our gracious father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord we ask oh God today that your that you have preeminence here this morning I pray father God that you touch the weary flesh Lord God may we give you all everything our body our soul our spirit to you Lord is you're worthy oh God of all praise of all worship and Lord we ask oh God that we in your name Jesus Christ binding every uh spirit of of a system or religion or anything uh because he whom the son is set free is free indeed and I pray that the people will understand they have Liberty oh God to worship God to in any form of fashion that that pleases God and Father today we thankful to know that we are H are free people born free to stay free and we we love you for that Lord in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle this message this is who we are and often times you know we we we're we're we're in a uh how can I say a time where everybody uh wants to uh basically have an identity everybody wants rights and and all that kind of a thing but uh we realize by the grace of God that this age that we're living is is the most confusing age ever it is the darkest of all ages uh it is the wicked uh the wickedest of all ages and we know that Satan rules Amen in this age but in the midst of all of this Darkness God is doing something uh we know that we have been chosen in this day to be a certain kind of people but we ourselves we can't make ourselves a certain kind and we understand that the only reason why we're different is that because God before the foundation of the world planted a seed within us and that seed was his seed and he within himself determined what time that seed would come to life uh we know by the grace of God that none none of us stumbled into this age this age was predestined by God and we have been brought here for a purpose we have been born for this purpose uh you know we look at things and we think how difficult they are but when you have it's like for a gift that God gives you you know like a gift of singing or a gift of playing uh uh the gift is there it always was there because every gift of every good and perfect gift come from God and the Bible tells us that God gives us these gifts without repentance so the gift is there but if you don't cultivate the gift nobody will ever know it you see what I'm saying because I have a gift to play in Piana or I have a gift of singing if I don't get on that piano and start working with the gift nobody would ever know it or if I don't ever would ever would never sing amen uh nobody would ever know that I have a gift of singing out this morning you may not think so either but nevertheless amen God has given us all gifts and and these gifts that are within us the greatest gift that God has given to us is himself but if you don't work it if you don't use it nobody will ever know he's in in you is that right and sometimes God has to bring trials and tribulation upon us to wake up the gift that's in US yes sir CU as human beings we have this thing about being dotory or lazy and sometime God has to put the pressure to us to manifest himself in us no no we we we we we Within ourselves we can't uh fathom the mind of God but it it's wonderful when you can see little portions of the things that God has done and and and understand it's the way he he he does or do things when I read the Bible I see the mind of God I see it's a a magnificent mind that even even my little peanut brain can't even comprehend but I see God working in so many ways and from Genesis to Revelation I see the grace of God Amen even during the time of the law I could still see the grace of God now we're here and and and one of the things that reason why I'm I'm I'm preaching this particular message because I realize that this is a time that every True Believer needs to be encouraged you say oh it's time is hard my God what are you talking about this is nothing compared to what we're getting ready to face and the Bible said when you see that day approaching look up because your Redemption draw nine see that's the we must learn how to refocus our thoughts even when we get sick we think oh God why I mean what are you talking about all things work together for the good of them that love God when you find yourself thinking negative you got to refocus and you got to realize that God is working something even though you can't see it you may not be able to understand it but it's still working toward your good Hallelujah yes sir I believe that we are the true manifestations of the sons of God is that right the whole the Bible said the whole creation groans and wait for the manifestation of the sons of God now when will the sons of God be made manifest if you're not the Sons and Daughters of God when will it happen Hallelujah and we see that the time is running out they're ready to push the button y'all know what I'm saying everybody in the world all nations are are are are anointed with the spirit of destruction that's the anointing that there are Anointed with destroy everything that God has created Hallelujah and you must understand you a part of what God created so the anointing on this world is to destroy you that's right Hallelujah see the devil don't care about houses and lands and all of those things he's concerned about the seed of God right he's the one that hates you Hallelujah more than you can imagine but you see God has already predestinated us he's already determined our end am and the Bible tells us that we have an expected in we know what to look for Hallelujah Satan cannot stop what God has already determine Hallelujah in the scriptures of the Bible lies victory for every believer but a lot of time people don't know how to work with the Bible because we're not spiritual we look at the Bible as if those stories are historical stories and they are history but they're they're not just history because it is the word and Jesus Christ says I'm the same yesterday today and forever it's history when you can't take what to what took place yesterday and bring it to your day Hallelujah well how do you do that brother Brooks you got to realize that every character that that that that stands for God represents you and we become that character right oh come on somebody because you got to realize even as the prophet of God says Moses was Christ Joshua was Christ all the great leaders was Christ Hallelujah my question is then who are you Hallelujah you are the Christ of the day and if you're the Christ of the day you're still the Christ of yesterday oh my God you see I have learned to step into the book I preached that years ago because sometimes trials hit you and you think okay where am I in the book I'm in there amen I'm in there you are in there right from Genesis to Revelation you're in there and so you must understand you must find the place where you are in the word and I'm going tell you something when you find your place you find that you will be able to see your end your Victory and what God has determined for you Hallelujah we are those amen though we be the seed of God we are those who needed salvation and Redemption Hallelujah we are those who needed healing we are are the leaders that that led the massive and we are the leaders that led the few he said what do you mean because if Christ if we were in Christ before the foundation of the world wherever Christ is that's where we are oh Lord have mercy it's true anyhow I'm not asking you to comprehend it with your brain I'm asking you to hear it with your heart amen amen see your brain can't go beyond what it is but your heart is where the seat of the Throne of God is and God in your heart can give you a revelation that you are the word oh my God not just a different word God has placed you in the greatest of all ages the darkest of all ages but we are the generation that will not see death we are the generation that will defeat Satan oh come on somebody we're the generation that would take a Rapture Hallelujah and those who take a Rapture are the only ones that will be able to take a Rapture why because you came from God and you go back to God only those who descended will be able to ascend hallelujah amen amen if you don't pull holler I'm going to run out of Voice Hallelujah listen we are those who were caught in in sin and adultery and we are those who were delivered and set free Hallelujah you say well what do you mean brother Brook see when I see that woman and all of us all of us you say well brother Brooks you know I came from a family that was just Thoroughbred well I'mma tell you you don't know that you have no idea what you're talking about yes sir because history is not written in that way right most history that we know of is nothing but man-made lies the only history that is certain is what the Bible speaks of amen hallelujah oh it's the truth you see what brother Bru what are you talking about my my point is this when we we we we the devil knows what he was doing and the whole time excuse me he's trying to stop the the the the multiplication of the word of God or the replenishing of the word remember this now because in the New Jerusalem in the new world there are no babies no no no sister no woman gets pregnant matter of fact the new world is a implanting it's a it's a transporting everybody from Heaven everybody that's been redeemed we come back and we feel the Earth you understand me and we come back in our glorified bodies just the way it was supposed to be in the beginning we're not something that just happened this thing has been ftuned amen it has been purposed for us to understand listen you would never love God the way you do or the way you would if it had not been for this Dimension amen God being perfect how else can he show you how much he loves you you had to have the negative stuff in your life the hardships the pain the rejection all of those things the failures you had to have those things you had to have that to learn what evil was if you got to heaven and you never knew what evil was right good is that right that's why Jesus asked he said listen there was two one was forgiven little and one was forgiven much he said which one of the two would love me the most you see those of us who have come in this those of us who have come in this layer the see and age Hallelujah we've seen evil like the age before us has never seen and to be delivered out of this age that's why we will love him the most Hallelujah glory to God let me move on Hallelujah listen when the Lord opened the seals and he took to that Angel take the book yes and We Know by the grace of God there was a angel from heaven and an angel on Earth and that Earthly Angel was Malachi 4 and he took that book and he ate it and then he took that book and then that same commission was given to usj you got to eat the whole book it's not just just just like like I heard a brother say it's not just chewing it you got to swallow it Hallelujah it must become a part of you y you understand me why because you understand the message is the a word that transform and creates amen y'all understand me in other words the bread behind behind the the Shina in the shakina glory behind that final veil was was the same bread but the anointing of the bread behind the veil was a bread of creation it it literally had the purpose of transforming and changing a dead Rod into life y'all understand me so if you eating this message and you're not being changed something is wrong that's right Hallelujah like I told my church we come to church for change I don't come to see you I come to see him I come to be in that shakina Glory that when I leave out of here the word has changed me Hallelujah and when you come to the B when you come to church and the preacher is preaching if you receive that word under the anointing you will leave out here a different person Hallelujah glory to God right let me say it you see I I say this and I've been saying it a lot because I find out in message we have a tendency of repenting oh we we know how to say I'm sorry but learning how to surrender what we're sorry from or sorry of is a different story you hear what I'm saying you know that's what people oh I'm repented yes that's good but after you repented there's another step you got to surrender yall understand me people say oh oh my God I want the Holy Ghost I repent repent that's good but you'll never get it until you surrender hallelujah what you talking about surrender everything everything everything everything that's dear to you must go everything mother father sister brother whatever your house your horse your cow your dog everything yes sir sir you must be willing to give it up as though you'll never see it again y'all hear me you must die and rock in order to live oh it's the truth anyhow you see what brother was what are you saying because God don't need none of you y'all hear me he doesn't need any of us what he only need is your house that's right your body being the temple of God he needs somebody who will be willing to give him all and not consider themselves right this is why Paul says I have to Die daily amen I can't say oh I'mma die today and live tomor no every day this old man wants to live and you must surrender everything Hallelujah you know I'm so how can I say pressing it is really a press the Bible said we are Epistles written in our hearts known in rid of all men in other words when people see us they will they're supposed this is Who We Are we we we you know you might be a fireman you might be a a lawyer you might be a dentist but your your your your your your main purpose uh is to be Sons and Daughters of God you understand me I mean Jesus was a carpenter but his main purpose was to be the Son of God yall understand me and at some point he left the carpentry oh come on somebody in order that the that the god of Heaven and Earth would be made manifest in him Hallelujah Peter and was a fisherman but their main objective when God called them they had to drop their Nets and follow him youall understand me it doesn't mean you got to quit your job but I'm trying to tell you Jesus must have first place Hallelujah he must be the number one one this is who we are we're the only word age that that where we make God number one is that right let me tell you like this we are the only one in this adulterous age that has one husband oh y'all got quiet on that one Jesus is our husband hallelujah we're faithful to him we only serve him Hallelujah and we must be manifested declared like like I said those Christians of old they didn't have a a necklace a big Cross or something on their back I'm a Christian no the Bible said they were called Christians at Antioch their lives declared who they were no you don't want nobody says well you know what I didn't know that he was a Christian that's a terrible test testimony yes sir I didn't know she was a Christian that's a terrible testimony if any testimony you would desire somebody said wait a minute hold up I know that man is a Christian right you know when people see you are a Christian nobody can gossip about you without rebuttal that's right y'all understand me somebody said hold up now you you saying that brother did that or that's I don't believe you cuz I know that brother that sister is a Christian y'all understand me so let's move on by the grace of God see we are in this thing brother brand and I'mma tell you something the saddest part about the message that I see is everybody's becoming so formal everybody's becoming you know systematic we come to church we sing Our songs you know and and we don't celebrate Jesus but the early Church Celebrate Jesus with healings and deliverances and all of those things you know the Supernatural is what they and they indulged themselves in and they had it amen I mean come on to tell you the truth I mean even if you go to Azu Street back to where the fire fell again Amen in this last day among the Pentecostal people you know we had people say hey remember brother bandam talks about the one sister who had cancer and and and and and and her neighbor uh lived uh was going to this uh this uh this little church down the street you know uh in the alley or wherever it was and and she found out that her neighbor had cancer and she says come on and go down here with me because we believe in Divine Healing and she had a son that was a theologian and he comes home and he finds that she's well and she said well praise the Lord you know God healed me she said Mama what's wrong with you you talking like that you're talking like those people down there he said well in my school we learned that Mark 16 is is not inspired she said well praise the Lord hallelujah mama what's wrong with you if God Can Heal Me by the uninspired scripture what can he do with the inspired scripture you see what I'm saying so we know by God's grace that that church had something going on Hallelujah and listen we supposed to be further up the road it it's not all in the preacher's lap it's all of us if we have the liquor fires we say that we have amen Demons of Affliction should flee from this building Hallelujah I preach the same way at my church but the truth of the matter is we got too much of us still living that's right you understand me listen brother Brown in the M this Feast of the trumpets he said but there will come a time soon when this will be just a fond memory that is right now what we had last night I don't know about you but I'm still feeling good he said these times will be taken away from us so therefore we must do all that we know how to do to make this every minute count y'all understand me don't be afraid to shout in the street dance in the street say hallelujah in the street praise the Lord in the street witness this message in the street don't be ashamed of it this is Who We Are this is who we are you love the Lord the Bible according to Isaiah 54:15 And1 17 I don't want to go too long but I'm trying to get somewhere but they shall excuse me starting with the 15th verse but they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever Shall Gather GA against thee shall fall for thy sake behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the Coes in the fire and bringeth forth an instrument for his work and have created the waster to destroy this is what I'm saying now he's telling you I did I've done all of this basically your enemy I've created everything about this whole world I created right amen I mean Satan may have deformed this and deform that but it all started with when God said let there be y'all understand me I mean Lucifer amen who we think is so great he's nothing can I say it like this before Lucifer was I am and you were there whether you can remember it or not if you are part of God no I don't remember it but I believe it amen right it's like my son you know who say well I don't know about was I there yes you were there cuz if you wasn't there you wouldn't be here right so we look at this thing and you say well what do you mean now God is telling you everything all these evil thing is that right the Bible said I created good and I created evil that's the Bible but this comes to us and he says no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn who shall lay any charge to God's elect now I don't know about you but this excites me because I realize we are coming under the pressure maybe you haven't been keeping up with the news but everything is turning against Christianity you're the evil now and that thing those things that are evil that's the good you understand me hell is blending into Earth that's exactly what it is you you want to you say what in the world why that look look like that or look like that is because it is the inspiration coming from hell right brother right and now you're the Oddball you're the one that looks out of order to this world sir y'all know what I'm saying look at our sisters don't ever be ashamed of what you look like Hallelujah you're the one you are we are who we are and we are expressing what God's will is for this hour power no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper this is what the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord hallelujah so what are you talking about I have no righteousness outside of the righteousness of God hallelujah I got the quote but I'm I'm read I'm going to say it like like I'm SP I'm inspired to say it you know brother Bram said it like this he said when when when the priest or a sinner came to the priest right to to for for his sins to be forgiven he brought a lamb am he said the priest examined the lamb not the man the man had nothing to do with it amen he examined the lamb hle come on somebody oh and if the lamb was found perfect the man was set free I don't know about you but they examine my lamb did they examine your lamb my lamb is Jesus Christ they led him from one H H place to another judgment Hall the Judgment Hall the Judgment Hall pilot said I find no fault Hallelujah it was never about you Hallelujah it was all about him y'all understand me so he became our sin that we might become his righteousness we didn't have to work for the righteousness the righteousness was in the lamb oh my God hallelujah we were were we were before Lucifer we were with him hidden within him the great Elohim in Jesus Christ in you and in me and like I said just a spoon F full would do it right that's what the prophet God said he said he said a spoonful of ocean is like the whole ocean everything that's in the Spoonful is in the ocean all I need is just a little bit right think about this now am excuse me I thought that when you get the Holy Ghost you say fill me with the Holy Ghost I thought God had to put a whole picture of himself in Me Feel Me Lord and brother Rand said like this it's just the head of a needle that little space is that all God look like a drop you know how you do the essential oils just a drop just a drop of God in you changes and transform your whole entire life think about it God the Creator in you amen creates recreates you amen hallelujah destroys the old man and creates a new man and that's why the Bible said put on the new man Hallelujah yes Jesus we love the Lord no weapon formed against us understand that our Warfare is not carnal Hallelujah I know y'all know these things but I'm just bringing something to refresh your mind I'm just trying to refresh you because sometimes during the battle we forget we just forget that's right and so I'm just trying to refresh you I'm not trying to bring nothing deep I'm just trying to bring something refreshing Hallelujah see listen turn with me to Proverbs 8 Hallelujah you love the Lord now we know how we know Elohim the self-existing one he created time he created space and then he stepped into it but he's all that in all uh he there's nothing really can contain him and and even though he in Christ was the fullness of the godhead God was still God y'all understand me cuz God is a spirit and when we saw Jesus Christ we saw the Flesh of God you understand me so but but it still didn't limit him matter of fact as as the prophet said that Jesus healed nobody did y'all know that that's right he never healed a man Hallelujah that's right because he himself said I can do nothing except the father show me yall understand me so if we can understand that concept we'll understand God in us he was a man yet he was God hallelujah and though we be men if God is in us yet we are God Amen I didn't say the God but we are children of God just as as much as the others were children and daughters and sons of God Servants of God only because of the Christ only because of the anointing and often time we fail to see that because we look at our flesh your flesh is perverted yes sir your flesh is a lie every time you look in the mirror you looking at a lie right because your real self that's not you amen you see all this flaw that's not you that's a lie he there's no flaws in heaven there's no flaw in the you the real you no sir this is a mess sir you might think this is the best looking mess but I'm telling you it's still a mess Hallelujah when you listen let's read the 22nd verse the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old now that's you you said well oh that's Jesus well that's you he possessed you now you might not want to accept that but brother B said you were in him which whichever way you want to put it that's right you were in him so he possessed blessed you you were in him before anything started you were there see eternal life is not something that has a beginning or ending either you were with him or you were not and when God gives you eternal life he's just giving you something that you had already Hallelujah this life is a life of beginning and ending but his life had no beginning it had no ending Hallelujah that's why I sang last night I got eternal life oh yes I got eternal life death can't stop me because I have eternal life so do you who's afraid of death in here if you truly got the Holy Ghost you're not afraid of death you might be you might have a little bit of funny feelings on how you die but you're not afraid of death you understand me Hallelujah he said I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning orever the Earth was Now understand everything brother Bram said has to come back to the word where do you think he was getting this stuff from Hallelujah and everything the angel showed him had to come back to the word hallelujah when there was no depth I was brought forth when there was no fountain abounding with water now you say that was the Loos and if it was the Loos where were you you were in you said well brother I don't know about that well let me say it like this that's why brother vand talks about the two sons and daughters of God we have the ability to create is that right and the only Creator there is is God go amen while as yet he had not made the earth now you see brother why are you saying this because when that squeeze come when that pressure come these are the things you got to remember then at that time who you are because remember the test and trials of Samson made him forget who he was Hallelujah but after a while when everything had gotten so dark his eyes were put out everything the mockery and everything else then all of a sudden something came back to him that he once served The God Who was the destroyer of the Philistines y'all understand mey and all he had to do is cry out oh Lord once more Hallelujah in sincerity he cried out oh Lord once more and he finished his purpose amen you said what you mean to tell me that God's purpose was Philistine for for Samson be blind and Samson yes God had to put Samson right among the Philistines in order to kill so many you mean to tell me God have put me in a bad position yes yes sir yeah you we always want to blame the devil no God he's doing what he's giving you a testimony he's giving you a testimony Hallelujah yes I I remember when when cancer struck me my brother said out of all the people marking me out of all the people you got cancer a few years later his wife was streaking with cancer she's delivered now but I often think about how he approached me how he said that and then when I showed him how God has delivered me even the doctors just recently I got a perfect health yeah no no sign or anything so what what I'm trying to say and I I'm I'm boasting on Jesus not me my my thing is this amen sometimes Satan don't want me to tell say you talk about it too much I can't talk about it enough right Hallelujah you got to know what I had to go through in my my mind in my spirit Hallelujah to understand when you get Victory how can you stop talking about it hallelujah it's like a soldier who's got a scar that he got on the in the wall and that scar seems say oh what's that scar about oh you in for a big story now right amen because he's got that scar because he was fighting for our freedom oh my God and let me tell you like this when people get into a place you don't understand God put you there but God expects you to come out I believe that the Bible said with every Temptation God has made a way of Escape every one of them every one of them and I believe that Hallelujah and the Bible said many are the Affliction of the righteous and God delivered them out of out of them Hallelujah let me hurry up now before the foundation was settled before the heels was I brought forth while as yet not made the Earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the Dust of the world when he prepared the heaven I was there when he set a compass upon the face of the dep you said well what do you mean brother you must become that eye see how we get all nervous you and the word must become one you and the word must become one you and the word must become one before the separation of Adam and Eve they were one showing that in the beginning the bride and the groom were one husband and wife one God male and female one oh Lord help me Jesus see see that's just where I'm at I you know uh 1 Peter 2:9 this is who we are when I see God working in the Old Testament and I see how God used a man by the name of of Joshua and how they walked around Jericho in obedience and a lot of time we see uh the the the Israelites are Marching around Jericho and we don't see the stress we don't see the pain we don't see the weariness of the people uh but that wasn't easy and to March around seven times yes sir it wasn't a little city it was a big city right we couldn't even Mark March around uh acarine without getting tired you understand me so you got to understand these people were tired but they were obedient now think about it even on the SE the the the last round they had to work walk seven times around six times however you want to put it but can you imagine they were in no condition to fight and often time that's how God puts us when we are weak that's when he's strong he takes us to that place where there is no substance in us to fight with and then he comes on the scene and becomes our battle a y'all understand so you and I must this is who we are but we said Lord Use Me Lord understand what you're asking for when you say God I want to be used by you you better understand God can use you for whatever he wants to use you far and you must be prepared to be used but how you going to be prepared if the if the enemy comes in and you don't know it's still God behind the enemy what do you mean every devil has to get permission to fight you amen that's right Satan can't say well I'm going to do this to so and so and so no sir it has to be God's permission y'all know what I'm saying and none of us have ever even gone through what job went through that's what I Tred to

just can't I feel real good and and I have to be careful because I'm a longwind preacher so I don't mean to be I just get caught up you know in the rising of the sun brother B said it like this he said blessed are thou see son of Jonas Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it Upon This Rock I build my church the gates of hell can't Prevail against it and I give unto thee the keys whatever you bind on Earth I bind in heaven and what thou loose on Earth that the Divine that and that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh it if it was flesh in the day by the son of the groom is fleshed today by the bride whatsoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whatsoever sin you retain to them they are retained y'all understand me in other words we are a chosen generation we are a free Nation we are generation of the Resurrection how believe that hallelujah hallelujah I've been resurrected Hallelujah yes sir and right now I'm waiting on my body change Hallelujah you say well what do you mean right now I'm sitting in Heavenly places Hallelujah are you set in the Heavenly places say no I'm sitting right here and a in in in in aine no you're not yes you are but no you're not if you in Christ you are setting in Heavenly places amen hallelujah if you are in Christ you have have a theophany yes sir and your theophany

theophany your theophany knows all things Hallelujah in one of these old days we going to step right into it that's not the Finish though the Finish is when the glorified steps on down when we step into that glorified body Hallelujah but listen you look at these things and you say well Brothers what are you trying to say we must be different we can't help but to be different Hallelujah uh uhh let me hurry I got a uh listen what the prophet of God says he said remember brother the message is supposed to shake the nation or shake the church don't you look for some great something to come down all corridors the message of God will be exactly to the elected Church these signs and wonders will never be done before the world they'll not surpr supposed to be so sometime we think oh my but you see what God is doing he's trying to get us to believe amen the world has already showed us they don't believe but we are to believe what the word of God says signs and wonders are supposed to be an everyday life for us is that right oh my we don't have to worry I'm almost done yes we look at this thing look what he says don't look at yourself but look at your sacrifice God don't look at you he look at your sacrifice which is Christ don't look at yourself I'm not worthy you're not worthy nobody's worthy but he is the one right that's what the angel said they couldn't find nobody worthy nobody Moses Elijah Jeremiah you name it nobody was worthy to open the book of the looser seals thereof it took God Christ the lamb Hallelujah nobody and that's what the devil say well you look at you and and I'm telling you it's the truth I came up in an Apostolic Church like I said and you had to do this this this this this and the least mistake you made you thought you were going to hell right we were the closest thing to the Catholic church because if we made a a mistake we had to go confess to the the bishop that ain't even the word y'all hear what I'm saying sir but whenever you find such laws you see all kinds of corruption oh is the truth all laws all the law will do is Manifest your sins because nobody can do it amen that's why I don't like the most self-righteous Spirits you know self-righteous I'm better than than you in the message Hallelujah wait a minute cuz if you need the blood to to to to to to redeem you I need the blood too yes sir right so two P's in the same part but that you know you look at these people these pH let me go on let me go on anyway I I never made it but I'm looking to what he done that's where I'm trusting what he's done he's my S y'all better hear what I'm saying cuz when the squeeze come when that pressure come we going to see how much how many how many mistakes you're going to make and the devil will truly say you ain't even Rapture Ready but Rapture Ready doesn't mean you won't mistake make mistakes Rapture Ready it means if you whether or not you got God on the inside the Holy Ghost the Resurrection on the inside if the resurrection is the ins inside it will show up on the outside you understand me Hallelujah you know I that's the way I see it he never looked at you that's why even now when you make mistakes it ain't you he hear the blood it's through the blood you hidden under the blood yeah oh my God how else would you be perfect yes how else would you be perfect perfect you know when it come down to Perfection we don't even pray enough you say oh brother I pray I pray he and the Bible said pray without season you know what I'm saying there's nothing we can glory in nothing we ought to be grateful that God chose us and so when the Trials come I'm telling you I'm telling you yes we whatever you make wrong make right but at the end of the day we became his righteousness he became our sins let me finish it and this is it he says listen there where where I'm trusting what he done He's My Sacrifice I'm not worthy of healing no sir Lord I ought to have died long ago ought never been born but I live I got I got eternal life I'm going to heaven why because he's done it for me he was the one he took my place I was knock knee crosseyed in every kind of condition but he took my place spiritually speaking I was twisted up and all messed up but he took my place wait a minute the prophet is speaking like this he made me a perfect Son of God a perfect daughter of God his sacrifice did it not mine I had nothing to do with it I was born all out of shape anyhow but I don't trust in what what I've done I trust in what he's done and and what was that's what it was y'all understand me that's Abraham and his seed so you and I understand people how can I say it we we I'm going close is how can I say it uh we have to fight for our joy there's no reason why we should ever be sad and the reason why he brings sadness I mean you know when trials sickness you know what I'm trying to say but I mean just sad because you don't even know why you're sad y'all know you know you ever woke up you wake up like that you feel so sad don't even know why you're sad and instead of rebuking that thing and getting some joy in it you go out throughout the day I don't know why I'm depressed that's the devil and you and I must learn how to battle those things when that thing come I like no sir if I got to put some music on brother I'm gonna put me some music if I got to dance in my house by myself that's what I'm going to do I'm not GNA allow you to control me throughout the day cuz this day is the day that the Lord has made and let us rejoice and be glad in it that's it well they don't treat me right come on somebody they don't treat they never treat Jesus right this world ain't going to treat you right you know and I know they look at you at the cash register discern you a Christian and then treat you bad they do they do the same in restaurants right they look at you like oh she must be a Christian have you waiting all night somebody else come in and they take their order y'all May y'all never had that happen I have I mean they could discern just like you can discern their Devils they can discern you a Christian and so what I'm trying to say is even so I I had this lady this morning I spoke to her and she rolling her eyes at me and I said 'I going to praise the Lord anyhow I told her that this morning I said Thank You Jesus right there in the kitchen I said Thank You Jesus I'm going to praise the Lord anyhow and then later on her husband get up and say how you doing sir I said I'm doing fine it is what it is sometime you got to take them devils and you got to hit them back and how do you hear them that praise God they can't stand it they can't stand it when they done treated you bad and then you come out of your mouth thank you Jesus y'all know I know y'all think I'm crazy but maybe I am but my point is this and I'm closing I thought the word would go in a different manner but God knows the way my my thought is this be who you are if God has called you to be the word be the word that means you got to be different and ain't nothing wrong with being different when you know you're right right and if God called me precious I'm going to be precious if God called me great I'm going to be great if God said that in me dwells uh the omnipotent power of God that's exactly right and whenever he calls for it I want him to use it amen amen yes I pray for sick sick no doubt our pastors prayed for sick people and they get well then sometime you pray pray for people and they don't but it ain't your fault God just say lay hands on the sick they shall recover it's up to them to have faith Hallelujah sometime your faith connects and they instantly heal and sometimes it's down the road they heal Hallelujah but never think that your prayer was weak your prayer is never weak as long as you pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen am never I don't care what the circumstances may be let's stand if if that's what Paul says if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved he said I have one I have a building waiting for me a body that's been made by God I just can't imagine how it's going to be but I know the Bible said the suffering of this world cannot be compared we're right on the brink of a miracle I'm looking forward to it Whatever May Come Let It Come who knows I might never make it back this way but at least I'm leaving you something to be remember that brother Brook said remember who you are don't let the devil take take take it away from you and I'm telling you God promised you something and he keeps all his promises he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you I will always that's my that's my quote that's my favorite scripture cuz when you don't feel like he's there he's there right and I'm so grateful uh to to uh uh for to Lord toward the lord for being who he is and amen you love the Lord Amazing Grace will always be my soul a praise for it was great that brought my Liberty I'll never know just how he came to love me so he looked beyond my fall and saw my KN I shall forever lift my eyes to [Music] calary to you the cross where Jesus died [Music] [Music] my my beyond my [Music] and I shall forever I shall for your lips my eyes hey to the Cross where [Music] J oh how my gra yes sir yes sir yes sir [Music] the name of [Music] Jesus the name I love don't you love him this morning don't you love this [Music] morning the name of Jesus oh
