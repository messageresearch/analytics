we're coming here again to thank you for that and to receive for your correction and your truth and your joy your peace we're too large for all you've done take tonight Lord bless the preaching my world Lord minister to every heart that's our visitors more that's the home church Lord god I just pray Lord your spirits like to open up to the book of Matthew chapter 18 I think Lord willing we might finish the the kingdom of heaven series here tonight it's been a wonderful series that's been it's been great to preach on new subjects you know I've never preached on before and see the revelation behind them and that gives us overwhelming power because the gates of Hell cannot prevail against Revelation praise God so let's take our scriptures here Matthew 18:21 so in Lord winning tonight we'll look at two the last two parables on the kingdom of heaven the myrrh the unmerciful servant and the laborers in the vineyard so Matthew 18:21 for their say Amen verse 21 then came Peter to him and said Lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times jesus saith unto him I say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain King which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto Him which owed him ten thousand talents but for as much as he had not to pay his LORD commanded him to be sold and his wife and his children all that he had in payment to be made the servant therefore fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay thee all then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow-servants which owed him a hundred Pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou ow'st us and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and I would pay thee all and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their Lord all that was done then his Lord after that he had called him said unto Him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desirest me shoulda snow I'm sorry should us not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant even I as I had pity on thee and his Lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him let's all read verse 35 together ready one two three so likewise shall my Heavenly Father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses amen God busting zarina's word may be seated praise God quite a sobering parable how many could say amen to that quite a serious sobering thought here Lydia I do have a few slides here by God's grace quite a serious thought and we want to just look at these like we said we're about two more by the grace of the Lord I just prepared a few quotes to go along with the the scriptures here we'll look at tonight and then Lord willing we'll be moving on to the next series or finishing the other series let me say a little timer here so I can control myself all right the kingdom of heaven I believe this is part 14 if I'm not mistaken by God's grace and our text was the unmerciful servant but like I said we'll probably get to both of them we've looked at the sixteen parables and we've seen how we got to be stewards faithful stewards and even tonight you can see the scripture how again Jesus is mentioning stewardship because he said every servant must give an account so we're all gonna have to go through the decades of our lives you know when we stand before Jesus and give an account of what we did and I'm thankful to say that I give my I want to give my days I want to give my weeks months I want to give my decades I want to give my life time to Christ praise God I want that to be the account that I give praise God and so the talents the pounds and the four grounds they're all show stewardship and time conditions we've seen the wheat and the tares and the net cast in the sea Jesus specifically says those are for the end time conditions praise God Jew and Gentile we looked at those recently the wicked husbandmen and the great supper shows how Christ went to the Jews first and then the Gentile and we looked at sin how sin is like a little small mustard seed but grows into something great for the RAM said that was the false church and then the leaven hid in three measures it's no doubt the Roman Catholic Church with her trinity dogma and then the Holy Ghost in the rapture the king's son the ten virgins and the seed cast into the ground Sunday night we looked at the treasure in the field and the pearl of great price so Lord willing tonight we'll look at the labors in the vineyard and the unmerciful servant all right now I want to preach on this and I have a few quotes on forgiveness now a lot of this will be review but one thing we want to remember church is that even the most seasoned of Christians always need to keep a tender heart because at any time Satan will try to get a foothold through what we call a complex the Bible calls it strongholds praise God in 2nd Corinthians chapter 6 but no matter how seasoned you are whether you're just a brand-new Christian and the message or you've been in the message 10 years I'm coming up on 20 here pretty soon by God's grace but no matter how long you've been in the word Satan always has a way to get in he always prevents he's always allowed to have one punch at you and so as we serve the Lord we got to make sure our hearts stay humble and we're quick to forgive praise God and that's why we know of course Jesus had forgiveness in the daily prayer the Lord's Prayer amen now in this parable we we see Christ stressing the necessity of forgiveness it's an absolute necessity and Jesus gives this parable in response to Peters question about how often he should forgive his brother Peter tries to be spiritual like we would be and say well perhaps seven times you know sevens the number of completion right but Jesus says no 70 times that praise God or in other words an unlimited number of times praise God so in the parable the certain king represents the Heavenly Father who compassionately and freely forgives a servant that owes him one sorry ten thousand talents now remember we looked at the other parables remember we looked at this parable and the talents a tale of gold was almost a million dollars about 700 thousand dollars right the town of silver was much less but the town of gold was almost a million dollars so if you had ten thousand times a million I'm not even sure how big that would be praise God probably getting to the billions if not trillions so in other words if this if this if these are ten thousand talents of gold we're talking about an insurmountable amount of debt praise God and so that shows that our sin debt is great in God's sight none of us could ever dream of undoing the wickedness we've done praise God we can never undo it you know the the reason is because as soon as we would make up for little things then that same day we would do it some more praise God and then to make up for that I think of a man you know men often battle you know with lust of the mind right think of the adulteries men might have in their minds now or women now women today it affects women as well you know with adulteries and everything like that can you imagine having to undo that you know just undo that and then what about lying what about seeing what about murdering and just wanting people to have the Vengeance of God upon them the Bible says you can be have a you know the Bible says that there they have a wrath against people without a cause sometimes people get so jealous they'll get wrathful and they don't even really have a cause for that person - nothing against them but they're just jealousy right they're just jealous and so think about the insurmountable debts that could be built up and as soon as we get it paid off we fall back into it amen so in other words this is an uninterruptible debt we can never do we've done such damage against the holiness of God and in this parable the forgiven servant healy begs for God to forgive him and God does but then he comes around to a man that owes him just we'd say a hundred talents or one percent of the debt he was given and this shows how how unfair humans are they love to be forgiven they love grace but they don't like to give grace right we love to receive grace Oh God forgive me Oh God thank you Lord we rejoice in the grace but then we have a hard time forgiving others and extending the same grace to them and that's the human nature that we got to battle and we want someone to repay us right away we demand it no you can't make a mistake you've got to make it right right now but we want God to give us time to make it right oh god I can't make it right today give me grace to make it right next week and God will God is merciful praise God God's very merciful but then we in our sin our human humanity and our sin nature that is within us we want we expect people to make everything right instantly now it manifests often with us when we know with with denominations we expect denominations and sometimes we look down at the pond denominations if they don't believe the word insulate our friends or family if they don't believe it instantly we look down upon them but we've got to learn to have compassion upon them praise God we've got to learn to have patience praise the Lord now the fellow servant begs for patience but the first servant refuses and has him cast into prison when the King hears the injustice the first servant is brought before him in Wrath and declares him as wicked so church let's understand what God is saying God is saying it's wicked for us to enjoy mercy but not give mercy that's a wicked thing it's not just well it's my weakness that I battle it's not just that it's actually a deeper thing it's a deeper selfishness where Jesus calls it wickedness when we can't extend the same grace to others who might sin against us and so the King gives him torment until the ten thousand talent debt is paid which of course represents a sentence in the lake of fire right because the to pay that would take years and lifetimes and upon lifetimes so it represents the lake of fire sorry I'm still even though I got this coffin I'm doing better than last week amen now Jesus says so likewise shall the heavenly father do also unto you if you from your hearts forgive not every one of his brother their trespasses okay so we see it's got to come from the heart now in this case the heart means the emotions praise God so your heart your emotions because the Bible said when you're saved you have a new heart because when you're first saved you're not born again in the soul yet you just got a new heart or you got new emotions toward God before you had a stony heart away from the things of God but when you get saved it's like all of a sudden you come soft towards Jesus amen and you're given a new heart well we have to have a new heart towards those who sin against us say Amen and he says you must do it from your heart praise God so brother Branham says that you know he says it in the message desperation he said if you've got a temper he said you got to pray and ask God to soften your temper right so prayer so it's in prayer that we'll learn to forgive from our hearts and I've seen it recently you know recently I was talking about that there was two people in particular I was having trouble forgiving so I went in my prayer closets for about a week and I just said their names Lord I forgive so-and-so I forgive so-and-so and I didn't feel it right away but eventually I started feeling it and I feel it tonight I feel that I've forgiven them although they've sinned against me and maybe they never even ever you know today those two have never even come and said sorry to me but that's okay I told him about it but if they don't have the grace to come and apologize face-to-face that's okay well one thing I know is that Jesus freely forgave me so I can freely forgive them and I've learned to do it from the heart praise God it's got to be from the heart it's good you have to feel it amen now this parable is only found in Matthew never find it in any other book of the Gospels but Jesus is found with the same kind of principle in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5 I'm sorry Matthew 6:14 and 15 during his fight and also during the final week of his life in mark 11 so we see these same principles where Jesus and both of them will say if you can't forgive others if you can't forgive others then the Heavenly Father can't forgive you we know there's multiple witnesses of this so we would say it's a major thing to be able to forgive your mieze it's not a minor thing because as Jesus says your salvation hinges upon this new heart if you can't forgive someone as sin against you then you're not really even saved praise God because Jesus says if you can't forgive them from your hearts then he says then you will not be forgiven of the Heavenly Father so see forgiveness is at the very hinge of salvation it's part of that new heart experience now don't get me wrong some people been hurt so badly the Bible says a wounded spirit who can bear especially with sexual abuse and verbal abuse and physical abuse all these kind of abuses especially when someone's an innocent victim that the abuse is so deep and the person may have a heart for Christ and so if they truly are saved then they really forgiven the person but the the the issue is that they've been hurt in their human spirit their human spirit has been wounded but a man said you get scarred in your human spirit it's a scar and so it's very hard to bear and you can be a genuine Christian genuinely saved but yet in your mind it doesn't feel like you've forgiven them like we've been dealing with a little counseling in the church recently and we've come up to some of these issues and the person no doubt is saved no but but the pain is so deep that it takes years and years and years to deal with those kind of pain because it is so deep and it's marked upon the human spirit praise God so I want to make sure we say that that that some pains are so deep it you you forgive the person but you live with the pain many times for decades if not your whole life you know I mean some examples like brother branham okay you know when he tells his life story and he tells about his first wife and child dying he'll start crying because he he connects that to his mistake of not going out to the Pentecostals right away and so he feels the guilt for that and so he'll cry and has to deal with that right had to deal with that and so we see one clear example there and yet God could give him grace to kind of deal with that right but the pain of that will probably never go away in this case in that case he has to forgive himself praise God and that's the one where Satan gets a lot of people especially the message they can forgive other people but the Satan will give them such a guilt trip they can't forgive themselves and that's a heavy weight to bear with the manes true church as as human as we are as fallible as we are many times in a shameful as we are the truth remains the same the Bible says cast your cares upon the Lord for he cares for you praise God Paul had to live with that pain his whole life member of holding the coat of Stephen the first martyr he had to live with that pain his whole life but he didn't let it get him down he let it motivate him to work more for Jesus amen the Bible says when we sin the Bible said when we obey we're supposed to take vengeance upon the devil and so that's what we've got to do if it's our mistaken if it's our guilt we've got to use the vengeance the holy vengeance of God and say Lord I know you forgive me of that I'm gonna use that as motivation I'll never do that again and I'll work more for the kingdom of God it'll be the grace of God working with me amen see that's where Satan will attack us because he puts a guilt trip on us we're like it was our fault somebody didn't get saved or it's our fault we didn't witness or it's our fault this happened to our children or it's our fault now some of these things may be true but the reality of it is we got to be like Paul if we confess our sin we've got to let the past stay in the past we got to forget the things in the past and forward toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus that's got to become a reality to us where we stopped looking or stop letting Satan let us look in the rearview mirror we got to say God forgive me if you need to go back and make something right with somebody do it and I don't care if it's 30 years down the road do it and so you could have some peace in your heart and move on with God and say in your heart that I know I've cast this burden onto the Lord I told you that one time the one of the biggest condemnation is I had as a Christian was that when I was a teenager I went up to my cousin and I said well I kind of made fun of him because his parents got a divorce because my parents had not been divorced you know my cousin was picking on my mom me and my friend and I said what and I said so it's evil words I said well at least I have a dad that's what I said to him it was really awful I never should have said it and he immediately dropped his head he was way much bigger than me he immediately dropped his head and walked off in the cornfield I didn't see him you know he he just hid out there and I became a Christian later years down the road I'm talking maybe five years down the road and I never got over that and so one day I was at a football game my brother's football game and I was a Christian I was like this is the moment the Holy Spirit brought it back to me this is the moment you can make it right and so I did I pulled him out of the stands I said hey can I talk to you real quick and he's like oh no never even forget about it forget about it he said it's okay I forgive you that you know I didn't think anything of it but I know in my heart I felt better and then I know he started treating me better after that and that was a great weight that could be lifted off my shoulders because of my own sin my own filthiness and I confess it and that's just one example where when you have the opportunity to do right let's do right amen well you got the opportunity so there's so there's no chance for regret regrets later on when Satan's trying to give us mine battles because you know he's gonna give you mine battles amen but you gotta cast down those mind battles and you got to win the greatest battle ever fought amen hallelujah praise God so Christ wants us to understand all sins committed against us by others pale in comparison to the sins we commit against God right that's what this parable teaches that what a hundred talents is just one percent of the ten thousand talents that the guy owed praise God I can't forgive somebody one percent of the hundred or one percent of what I was forgiven I can't even give one percent oh come on we ought to be able to forgive now some of them will be harder some of them will take longer but the Bible says with God all things are possible amen with man it's impossible but with God all things are possible amen hallelujah they're all possible hallelujah so we got to believe that we got to confess that we got to devote some time to prayer for these things amen see too many times we leave these things on the shelf and we just become a punching bag - Satan can I get amen say we just let Satan beat us up week after week month after month year after year but church we can do something about it we can go to the Lord in prayer and we don't have to be a slave to Gil look be a slave to shame or to fear or bitterness we don't to be a slave to any of that because we have a kind Heavenly Father who mercifully and faithfully forgives if we confess our sins he lets us walk right back in the light amen and we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of all unrighteousness amen praise God now forgiveness is so important Jesus put it in the daily prayer of the Lord's Prayer it's the model prayer in Matthew 6:12 and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors now here's what struck me here's what the Holy Spirit put on my heart as I study this we are supposed to look at ourselves as sin debtors in other words I owe a debt I'm a debtor right because every day says pray this so we wake up we should say mine I've done wrong against God I owe God an apology now see now once we've asked God sorry then we can be free from that but every day it's built into the Lord's model prayer not that we just recite it religiously like Catholic or something like that but there's nothing wrong with reciting the prayer if you want to pray that to God wrong with that brother Bram does it on tape numerous times but the point is God tells us to humbly possess a debtor's mindset so we forgive those indebted to us see it's easier to forgive other people that have sinned against us if we got the mindset that I owe somebody - right if you're constantly thinking my eye oh I gotta make this Ryder I owe the Lord my if we got the right attitude not not the guilt like Satan puts on an extra kill but just the reality right the reality that everyday Jesus says pray this forgive us our debt Lord I'm indebted to you there's something healthy about that can I get an amen to the head there's something healthy about waking up in the morning say my forgive me my debts Lord I'm indebted to you I owe you my life amen I owe you my energy I owe you my praise I owe you my strength I owe you my soul aim ahead I do I owe you everything praise God I'm indebted to the Heavenly Father see that's the reality it's a God designed debtors mindset and this produces not guilt but it produces gratitude and mercy rather than hopelessness see it produces thankfulness that's why we pray it right forgive us our debts Lord as I forgive those who sinned against me that produces confidence in God that God I know because you've forgiven me I can forgive others praise God see it produces this debtors mindset but not a negative don't leave here you know beating your that Satan beat you up but just the reality of it like that's why brother RAM say we can't pray up he said we just can't prep every day we got to pray up every hour he says see that's why he would say that because we got to realize he would say we got to check up every hour see so that's the that's the reality Lord am i pleasing you right brother Ram says when you become a Christian you don't get rid of pressure he said you add pressure he said because you constantly wonder am i serving the Lord or not am i pleasing to Jesus there's something healthy about that I'll say like this that brings humility when you're constantly wondering am i pleasing your Lord have I made a mistake have I missed the mark when you're wondering that now you can't let Satan take it too far but it's healthy to examine yourself to check up on yourself and make sure you're serving God in the right spirit that's a healthiness or else why would Jesus put it in the prayer every day say lord help me to forgive others as I'm indebted to you forgive me my debts see that keeps us humble right each day I owe a sin debt either I was prideful I thought I was better than somebody or I was lustful I want covetous I wanted something that shouldn't wanted I was mean right spiteful angry bitter see every day I do something that causes me a debt in the sight of God I gotta say God forgive my debts and I'll forgive other people amen every day it's not you know easy to teach us to pray so it's every day we take this mindset of I'm a sin debtor now in our flesh right because the Bible says the soul doesn't sin amen right remember first John that beautiful book about love and eternal life the Bible says the soul doesn't sin so your your nature doesn't sin but it's in your mind and your humanity where you sin so to recognize Lord I'm in debt because of that I made a choice in my mind I didn't go down and ask the soul first I didn't pray about it before I said that and the church said see that's why we're guilty because we're the ones are giving free more agency we can check in first and pray first and ask God first should I say this or not and we fall short of God's glory and so Jesus makes it a part of the daily prayer he wants us to always remember how much we're forgiven so we can extend that same forgiveness to others and Jesus promised I love this in the beyond sees Matthew 5:7 blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy brother Graham says it too it's better to err on the side of mercy right then judgment err on the side of Mercy because blessed are the merciful for they shall be shown mercy praise God so this parable we can clearly see the power of forgiveness now I wanted to show this with the stature of managers of the court I found today of course I preached it before but this is from statue River man now 60 let's add the Bible said it brotherly kindness now that's a good one right here the six and then the seventh alright adding brotherly kindness all right when you get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter so see when you've got brotherly kindness the the the character trait of Christ in your life when God has added that to you now you can put yourself in somebody else's shoes and you can stop being so selfish stop thinking about yourself and you can see someone else's perspective well I can see how that would hurt my wife's feelings I can see how that would hurt my husband's feelings seekers you can put yourself in somebody else's shoes right he said my brother sinned against me said Peters I forgive him seven times a day really kindness now you see I'm sorry no he said Jesus seven times seventy see brotherly kindness now you see if a brother's all out of tune don't be impatient with him see no sir be kind to him go anyhow just a simple thought there but remember on the sad forever man brotherly kindness is the last step before charity so that proves Jesus will not give somebody the Holy Ghost until they've got brotherly kindness until they can treat the rest of his body the right way praise God he's not gonna put the CEO or the cap on that person so he's not gonna quicken that soul with the baptism he's not gonna seal that soul until that person is gonna treat others the way they want to be treated forgiveness just common forgiveness we say where we say uncommon forgiveness because Christians aren't very common these days so an unusual Holi style forgiveness from real Christians praise God amen see kingdom citizens right in the kingdom of heaven Kingdom citizens keep their hearts or grounds free from every life-sucking root of bitterness see bitterness just sucks the life right out of a Christian it tries to spring up in their hearts the Bible says but through prayer Christian's daily wean their hearts and cast their cares upon the Lord putting away all bitterness let's go to a scripture briefly let's go to Ephesians 4:31 and 32 I might as well just use my Bible app here it's just love a little bit faster to Ephesians 4:31 hope everybody couldn't see it to let all bitterness see all not some of it all of it see make sure all the bitterness towards that person is gone all of it so that when you see a picture of them you'll try to smile now try now in the intense ones God don't expect you to smile like that if it's super intense and you've been hurt but you have to forgive them all the way and Church the thing to do is just say it with your lips say it with your lips and then God will make your body and your mind obey your confession right he's the high priests of your profession we've got to start professing it and then God will bring it to reality let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice see all of it now why would Paul say all if it wasn't possible see it's possible Church is possible Amen it's possible to put all of it away and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you now that just stirred my mind here I forgot about this let me pull something up real quick let's watch this video real quick here's a man who really had forgiveness [Music] sorry so this is about brother mike.mccluskey he goes to brother kam Church he was shot he was a sinner he was shot in the back by a cop on purpose and he won the he won the court date and he couldn't forgive the cop until Simon introduced the message to him and then he heard his father-in-law preach on forgiveness and then he forgave the man in tears and weaping and you're gonna see it right here this is a real example of forgiveness and I told brother miking this numerous times I said brother I believe on the day of judgment you will be one of the examples of true forgiveness in other words Jesus will use Mike and that time he'll raise up by that wheelchair cuz right now he's still paralyzed in a wheelchair I believe at that time he's gonna rise them he'll have a new body praise God and he may get that before the rapture amen hallelujah he was once an angry man he talks about that he was so upset at that cop he hated that cop amen praise God that beautiful that's a real modern-day example that brother went to many denominational churches and he can never understand forgiveness until he came to the message hey hi there yeah that's right and then he heard his father-in-law preach on true repentance and forgiveness and that caused him to go to that man and forgive that police officer and then he did that in front of everybody that was after Simon done so many Bible studies he received baptism serpents eat everything and then he come to the message church he was faithful and then he received it and I believe God will use that man on the day of judgment against all those who said I couldn't forgive somebody shot me somebody they took my ability to walk and God will raise up that man and say but he forgave by the power of Jesus Christ love and he's still in a wheelchair he's been in wheelchair since the 2009 or 2008 he's still in a wheelchair and he's forgiven that man and so see that's the power of God's love praise God see Christians put away all bitterness and they do it for Christ's sake and did you notice he said that person deserves it praise God each person deserves to be forgiven see because you are giving you because we were all given a hundred percent amen so so if God's forgiving us a hundred percent then we should be able to forgive somebody one percent right they deserve it because we've been forgiven of so much we they deserve to be given a tiny amount even if it's taken your ability to walk away from you see that proves me really glad the power of this message he couldn't find it in any other Church he couldn't find it anywhere else but when he come to this word it was like it was unveiled it became a revelation hey I didn't praise God it's a reality of it amen see that's the power of this word holds because it's the true Word of God the true revelation of what the Bible teaches freely forgiven and I got his whole testimonies gonna watch it's on our church YouTube channel it's about 30 minutes long it's a beautiful testimony God and I even put on there I even put on there the video of the actual moment he got shot he had his hands up like that and that the cop did it on purpose and he was going to get all kinds of jail time he was gonna get like 10 or 20 years but Mike just forgave him totally he just forgave him totally not that mandates our one day of jail time for purposely shooting a man in the back that's the power of God's forgiveness my now let's go the the last parable I hope that's a blessing let's go the last one Matthew 20 verse 1 Matthew 20 verse 1 now this is a very familiar parable probably to most of us its verses 1 to 16 so this is the parable of the laborers in the vineyard and most of us I'm just gonna we're not gonna read all this but I'll reference a few of the scriptures now the revelation of this parable is that eternal life is the reward God gives to all who labor in his kingdom that's a revelation no matter what the circumstances God gives eternal life to all of them now this parable magnifies God's equity or his fairness because he gives each of his servants a just reward for their labor Isaiah describes God as a just God and Savior I believe God's fair amen he is isaiah 45:21 says that he's a just God and Savior he's wholly fair our God fairly deals with mankind in every age and he's seeking Labor's in his kingdom Paul says the same thing he says is there unrighteousness with God god forbid amen in other words God is never gonna mistreat you he's never gonna mistreat me we can trust God he's fair he the Bible said every temptation is common unto man we're not the only ones that have gone through this somebody else has tasted this bitter cup if we're tasting a bitter cup praise God somebody else has gone through the same similar thing and much harder probably than we have and we can't feel sorry for ourselves we got to remember that God is just and fair and there's a rewarder of all those who diligently seek Him amen that's right so Jesus in the parable is the householder he hires Labor's for his vineyard at the first hour of the day and he agrees on their wages and then he goes out the third hour the sixth hour and the ninth hour and then he makes one last hire at the 11th hour so it looks like it's for calls now to me I'm not certain on this because I don't have a quote on this but I believe those four representing the four anointings of the church ages the lion the Ox the man the Eagle because mode RAM does say we are the 11th hour workers he doesn't say that he said the bride the end time bride is the 11th hour workers praise God and he says that because World War one ended in the 11th month in the 11th hour so remember that's what program says we are the 11th hour workers and we have the Eagle anointing amen so that's what I believe now everyone at the conclusion of the day the 12th hour the labors come to Jesus for payment the last laborers are paid first receiving a penny when the first hour workers are paid the same amount they murmur against the householder but are rebuked because God's initial contract agreement was kept the householder even says hey I'm lawful he said I'm good he says he's good remember Jesus said there's none good but God so this householder has to represent God because he says don't you know I'm good can I do with can I do with my money what I want to do with my money who are we to tell god what to do with his money who are we to tell god what to do with the vineyard right he can do whatever he wants he's God but the reality was he kept his word he kept this contract God always keeps his word amen the main lesson church is that some Christians labor longer than others and go through much more difficult circumstances yet eternal life is a reward for all faithful Labor's the first our workers work 12 hours how many worked a 12-hour day before I've done it a couple times I don't like it very much it's not very fun so some of them work 12 hours and had to work through the hottest heat of the day but yet the eleventh hours you and I live with our workers we do one simple little hour and the Sun setting and the temperatures decreasing at his lowest god help us and yet they both get the same reward praise God they all get the same reward they'll get a penny now I preach this a few years ago I'm sorry a few weeks ago in passing but let's compare this here let's compare the workers let's compare them for the amount of time they worked let's compare Stephen the first martyr mention him earlier and john the divine the Revelator history says Stephen was stoned in a t-34 when he was 29 years old 29 where were you at 29 really Glenn yeah were you saved yet no I I got saved at what 19 I got saved in nineteen so okay two years after that Wow Wow two two years my goodness hallelujah praise the Lord this month two years Amen hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus Alleluia amen glory my so Stephen was 29 when he died for Christ but during his one-year the Bible said he was empowered the Bible said he was full of faith and power and he did great wonders and miracles amongst the people oh my he so he had a one good hour of work amen he worked really hard now he must get the same reward that John got because history said John died in a hundred ad at 94 years old yet they're both born again on the day of Pentecost they both received the same Holy Ghost but one man worked one year another one worked 66 years they both endured the heat of persecution right while laboring for the householder but they'll both receive eternal life because God is just and the payment is good because the good one promised them the same payment amen Laurie John labored sixty-five years longer than Stephen but the Bible said the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delights in his way amen God delighted in Stephens life I know it sounds hard for us to understand that but he delighted in Stephens life and we know that brother man said Jesus stood up from the throne and gave us standing salute when Stephen entered into that glorious place hey man because the Bible said he seated on the right hand but when Stephen came to heaven Jesus stood up and gave a salute amen in the presence of a faithful martyr a great reward that he had he received but Jesus ordered Stephen steps tonight 29 don't you know God ordered brother Branham to die at 56 years old don't you know he ordered him to die in a car accident that God wasn't surprised by that and although people make fun of it let him make fun of it because it's not us who chooses the way we go it's God who chooses the way we go it's God and see the reality of it us no matter how brother man died people stumble out that my mum friends someone like that he kind of laughed and made fun of it may God have mercy on that man but the reality of it is he died as a Christian and he died without any shame or sin on his life no matter how he died he died right in great standing before the Son of God amen he died driving back to preach some meetings amen he didn't die just barely save like a thief on the cross although thank God he was saved we appreciate this salvation but but he died with the reward amen he died with the legacy of Eliezer going to go preach to Rebekah praise God amen he died he said I want to close the bride in the righteousness of Christ were a men he died by giving the bra the clothes that she had to put on for the rapture amen faithful witness amen no matter how he passed this dimension we don't we look at that we look at the fruits of their lives and did they labor faithfully for the kingdom of God I say he did amen hallelujah people can criticize whatever they want but the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord see the householder plainly states he said I can do my own will with my own workers because I'm good he's gonna treat you good huh as God treated you good Church hallelujah has the assignment God given you is it too hard for you or can you deal with it I can deal with it Bray's God it's not too hot it's not too long it's not too hard amen we just got one hour to labor for Christ and it's not even the hottest time it's not even the the biggest time of persecution that was in the beginning right that's why they'd have that line anointing to battle and with boldness against the heat of persecution right and then of course we know the Ox age where they died they freely gave their lives away right see he says I'm good God is fair he's a Heavenly Father's Fair with a plan for every life God has different assignments for believers and today the spiritual conditions around the world are they date they're different all around the world did you know there's an article from Newsweek a few years ago that said Christianity is our quota it says is facing genocide in the Middle East we got it easy over here we're at the it feels like it's the end of the day but there's Christians that feel like they're in the heat of the day right now especially in the Middle East it's that many Christians in the Middle Eastern are facing genocide anti-christian persecution is increasing and it's severity is intensifying making Christians the most persecuted a religious group in the world amen my army so it's it's even though it seems like it's not so hot here it's not but it is hot in other places around in the world and we got to remember to pray for those Saints no matter the circumstances God desires faithful service in the hour in which we're working and listen Church you know and I know it the conditions are not going to get better they're going to get worse the Bible says the love will decrease and the converts will decrease Matthew 24:12 because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold sin destroys love and sin is only going to increase so love is gonna get smaller and smaller smaller if anybody ever sees love in this world it ought to be in you and I I had a guy tell me on on Tuesday said I felt the love of God in your life he said the room felt were filled with filled love because of what you did that's what he told me and I'm not bragging I'm just saying we got it we ought to be living epistles amen people should feel the love of God in our lives sin destroys love but Jesus had got us a short in the days so that some people are saved in Matthew 24:22 and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh say for but for the elects sake those days are shortened so there's going to be less love there's mean less converts but we've still got to work and labor no matter the conditions of the day we got to be faithful and we got to work until we hear the bell to go home amen hallelujah praise God amen despite what you know Pentecostals say they're saying this worldwide revival and a great harvest of souls scripture says the opposite they and I saw that prophesy again that last year that woman made a prophecy and said there's gonna be billions and billions of souls save with the anointing of what Radames ministry I don't see how that's scriptural because Jesus has to shorten the days that some might be saved they can say what they want but scripture says when sin abounds love is destroyed love gets worse there's less love and John says all nations will be deceived and will cooperate with the false church the mother harlot who we learned about recently when we preached on revelation 17 and 18 right the Roman Catholic Church all nations are gonna be deceived not some all nations and the final scripture that he says Matthew 20 verse 16 so shall the last be first and the first last for many will be called but few chosen other scripture has always puzzled me because of this in the rapture the first ones that died are the first ones that are raised in the rapture right because the dead in Christ rise first right so this must be speaking of something else this must be speaking of the awards the rewards at the at the throne of Christ which we see in 1st Corinthians 3 the Bible said every man must stand before the judgment seat of Christ not the white throne judgment but the judgment where rewards are given out to the bride so it has to be that because the rapture is the first ones that die are the first ones resurrected and bromances more blessed to be in that group he says I think he says that to encourage the Saints that have died you know the ones that have had loved ones that died he encourages them he said it's more blessed to be in that group he says I just heard it this week so this this the last shall be first the first last it must be Christ assurance that God will determine the order of rewards not us so God is going to honor the last first and the first last he calls many to service but he's chosen a select few to a higher more honorable works based upon his foreknowledge God's choosing is always right so I imagine that I don't know if this is right but it just what it seems like if this parable is right it would seem like the Laodicean bride will come up for rewards first although she only worked one hour because the last shall be first and the first shall be last now I can't say that for sure but that's what it looks like by the scripture because the rapture doesn't look like that the first that died our resurrected first so it must be something that God wants us to show God wants us God wants to show us that no matter how long your assignment was God is going to reward you if you're faithful to your service amen no matter how long how hard it was God rewards faithful servants amen and we cannot exalt others above of other ones because we're all in this by the grace of God and many of us don't choose right we don't choose our path God has chosen our past God has given us a calling if we had our choice we'd all be prophets won't we brother brother brother glad won't we because we'd all want to foretell the future we'd all want to know what's gonna happen if we aren't but see God we didn't got it let us choose our gifts God chose our gifts and also you gotta do is be faithful with the assignment God gave us and thank God for it now in closing I want to say this let me read a few quotes I'm preaching 50 minutes I'm trying to be less than an hour so maybe I'll finish fast now he says brother I heard it earlier this week I was listening how can I overcome 63 beautiful message beautiful miss they asked my brother ham well what church do you belong to I don't belong what denomination you belong to I said none I said well what do you belong to I said a kingdom a kingdom what do you belong to well Bride of Christ fellowship what denomination the kingdom of God but it's not a denomination a kingdom by one spirit we're all baptized into that kingdom because jesus said the kingdom of God is within you by one spirit all in this kingdom jesus said pray my kingdom come thy will be done on earth as in heaven now he stood one day before mount transfiguration said bear to you that some shall stand here and not taste death till that they see the kingdom come in power it was for shadows we've been taught the Mount of Transfiguration he's talking about the rapture that's what they saw him out Transfiguration they saw a foreshadowing of the rapture and 144,000 now a new quote no I'm sorry the Bible said the kingdom of God is within you so this in this kingdom people that professes that this is not their home this is not our home we're looking for the coming of the king set up the kingdom amen praise God thank you lord now here's another quote look on Hollywood look at these little girls lay now here in the parks and the boys wallowing around over these things and things like that even seen in choirs and the Elvis Presley's and so forth that we have today it's a disgrace to the name of America to what our forefathers fought and bled and died for but the hours come that every Kingdom has to give away because there's a kingdom of God that's established in the human heart by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the presence of Jesus Christ and Christ will come to his bride and set up a kingdom here on earth that will never be diminished how do you get in this kingdom you're born into it how do you know it you just keep how would you belong in the kingdom and disagree with the king amen how do you know you're born again you believe and live every word of the kingdom praise God that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost someone who keeps all the Word of God see he says it here how would you belong in a kingdom and disagree with the king see and the king is the word a king is the word amen you can't disagree with the word and be a part of this kingdom in the beginning was the word towards with God the Word was God the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever now a new quote now the Queen of England might ask you a favor she might take something from you she you know so so much the president he might ask you two things that you didn't want to do he might ask you for treasures you didn't want to give up which would mean nothing just to him but Jesus is bringing something to you when he knocks he's bringing a pardon forgiveness hey don't turn it down for as it was tried in the courts here so will it be in the kingdom of heaven so just as courts are done in on earth so other courts in heaven be if he knocked and brought the pardon and you turn it down and die in your sins you'll perish though you had the honor of sitting in a meeting like this though you had the honor of attending the revival or your church how many leave it's the honor to come to church that's what he said right there it's an honor to come to a meeting or come to notice not just any church but your church see everybody needs a your church and heard a pastor your pastor preach a gospel message and the church said see everybody needs their own home church and their own pastor and that was what I didn't get to sister Naomi and Beatrice on one Sunday one of the winds that blow through our church is that somehow they have that people have some revelation where you don't need a home church anymore because we're all one big church now it's a shame they didn't let brother branham know that right they should have let brother Brad know that because well Ram the whole time says you need your church and your pastor he didn't say I'm your pastor he never said I'll always be your pastor in fact brother Brad said there come a time when I won't be your pastor anymore see and you had the audience that yes I was there maybe it was hard to tell when all you could say I heard the singing I enjoyed it I heard the testimonies it was real but you turned down God's forgiveness see we got that we got to be forgiving we got to accept the blood of Jesus Christ now let's say into our feet here let me read these because I just want to close with that thought it's kind of a thought I just didn't get to on Sunday like I said the winds blowing through this church and amongst some of the brothers that oh you don't need to have a pastor you don't need a home church that's a bunch of that's a bunch of lies you got to have it it's scriptural remember the by I don't have time for all the scriptures but Jesus looked at the multitudes and the Bible said he had compassion because they had no Shepherds so he said pray pray that I'll send four Shepherds out there Jesus gets sad when people don't have a home church because they just wander around like a like a sheep run around there and the devil's like a wolf gonna eat him up right and when you ever see a sheep wander from one flock to the other doesn't happen very much does it see and the Bible said ordain elders in every city so in the Bible days every city had a church and a pastor and then Timothy gives the requirements in 1st Timothy 3 I'm sorry Paul gives it to Timothy elders got to be the husband of one wife or they got to rule their house well and they got to preach the word they got to be hospitable they can't be partakers of wine right all the qualifications God said a man that's gonna rule the house of God he's got to rule his house the right way first and remember we read it on Sunday the Bible said some of you say I'm a palm apostle I'm sorry I'm Apollo's but Paul said God has given a preacher to every man so God has given a pastor to every man or woman if they'll just look for it praise God the Bible said every man it's given to every man before I read this Hebrews 13:7 these are some of my faithful scriptures I go to if people try to say oh you know have to have a home church well look what the Bible says and now we know that well also we know Ephesians 4 about pastors they have a port enroll Hebrews 13:7 remember them which have the rule over you see who has spoken unto you the Word of God whose faith follow considering that and to their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so God puts men as examples not lords but as examples over the flock and Bible said obey them when they preach God's Word right the trouble is they a lot of people a lot of pastors give a commands but they're not in the word that's the trouble now go down to verse 17 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account see the preachers have to give account of the people that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you so I'd like I told you before I got to give an account of this church and the souls that came to my church I will give an account for that and I want to do it with joy I want to do it with happiness I don't want to do with grief the Bible says I don't wanna be sad when Jesus asked me well how did this family do her how did this individual do I don't want to be grief and sad I want to be joyful and say they believed your word Lord they live by they fed on every word of God that was preached amen look what says after the seals I mind you and now tomorrow Sunday and there will be Sunday school the churches the reason we have our service afternoon on Sunday is so we won't interrupt any service at all brother Ram never interrupted the local home church services he always had his services between the morning and evening so he wouldn't interrupt the local pastors that's how much a prophet respected the pastor's we don't see that today with a lot of people they want to take all the people from the pastor's we believe every Christian ought to have a home church that they go to every Christian ought to meet somewhere with believers and wherever you meet that's the church the brother man believed in staying home no he said he said don't stay at home in the Christ the mystery of God revealed praise God now there are situations where like we talked about in Sunday you could if there's no good churches around you and they're all in the sin you might stay home and livestream right you might say home a new tape services we said that if there's not a real if there's a church that's full of demons you don't want to go to that church now look what you said if I lived here I would belong to one of these churches here well yeah people are saying today oh you don't need a home church we're all just a part of the same church well we are one sense by the blood but not by the flesh by the flesh we all need a home Church I belong to one of these churches here not all of them see that's what they're trying to say today to our sisters are our faithful home church people here they're trying to say we're all in the same church no we're not by the blood we are but not by the flesh these pastors here that's cooperate and represents why I they're here sitting up on the platform to be seen of all the people that they endorsed what's going on they believe in this type of ministry divine healing the baptism Holy Ghost and so forth they are here giving witness to it they was the one who invited me to come here that may be the ministry Lord has given me might help their congregation now that's a real pastor that's looking out for all the spiritual benefits that he can of everything God is doing that he's trying his best to help the church to move on for God I certainly take off my hat and admiration for a pastor like that and these men had to do that under difficult to see the heat of the day right the heat of the day laborers in the vineyard it's difficult form you can leave that to be true they had to do it under difficult I certainly am grateful for such great men of God who's willing to take their place and their post of duty upon their convictions and God ever blessed them he says I'm sure they'll do you good the pastor's if you're estranged here find out where these brothers have their churches where they're at visit them tomorrow without special services and there's ministers here that'll be speaking at different churches as it's been announced so be at them tomorrow now people got saved in 1960 he said may they find a good home a good church home and there remain faithful how long to the posted it until death shall set them free from this earthly course the brother bramble even staying at home or not having a home church no he didn't but then believed in having a home church until death sets you free amen but like these and and I'm not saying this for any reason I know we've talked about the I'm not I didn't bring this for you guys I'm bringing it because of the winds blowing through this church so just know that I know you guys are in a special situation we've talked about we talked on the phone about it they're doing the right thing they're doing the right thing I'm talking about spirits that have blown to this church I'm trying to say you don't need a home Church you don't need a pastor you do need one you got to have one that's what the program taught and he never changed it praise God and even if people try to change the day just say you're wrong I disagree and do it with love all right Malachi come on up here by God's grace there I had four more quotes let me just put this one up well mother bear said I have to answer for the church he says he said you have to answer for a church you have to answer for your family maybe just for yourself see I've got to answer I've got to give an account did I preach the word first if I did thank God for that and then the second thing did you receive the word I got a preach it you got to receive I got a live it - I got a live it before I preached it actually cuz I'm a hypocrite if I'm preaching to them I'm not living it praise God right but these are just the quotes I've been sharing with some of the saints but man said any man that's more the Spirit of God loves to go to church better than he loves to eat his meat but man said if you love God you'd be at church aha he said the Spirit of God will run you straight to the church every time the door opens for fellowship it'll run you to church every time the doors open he said don't stay home if God's in your heart you can't hardly wait for the doors to open out yonder to get in there to fellowship with your brothers if you don't it's time you got to praying amen show me where he ever changed it he never changed it Amen because that's the apostolic pattern alright I'll better stop there I've already gone my hour here thank you for your patience church can we say praise the Lord praise the Lord the kingdom of God is within you and when you got the kingdom of God in you you will obey the words of the king praise God you won't disagree you might you know like I say we might have some hardships you know if we've been hurt you know and might have a time feeling to forgive others but we do forgive them from our hearts because you want God to forgive us hallelujah Jesus [Music] we want to hope the people caught it tonight [Music] understand [Music] you want to live it and agree with them [Music] thank you for the kingdom of God that's within our hearts give us soft tender hearts Lord with no roots of bitterness Lord God then our hearts be weeded afresh tonight Lord there's a that's grown up out of our lives [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] here those broken spirits give them [Music] or we just come again [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the Lord's Prayer together can we let's go to verse Matthew 6:9 after this manner therefore pray our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name [Music] he was our dance [Music] [Music] [Music] my life and my soul [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's a privilege to live every day of our lives it's a privilege to crucify the selfish and to cast out all these mind battles and temptations of the lust of the
