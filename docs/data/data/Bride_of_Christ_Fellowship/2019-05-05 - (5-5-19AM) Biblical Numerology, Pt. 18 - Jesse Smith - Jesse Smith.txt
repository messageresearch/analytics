song as if it shine on me Lord on me like me Lord Sai me laughs a lie from the lighthouse Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] like to go to Leviticus here like to go back to the book I'm sorry the numerology series and so the video is 25 we never finished the Jubilee so I'd like to finish the Jubilee by God's grace so Leviticus 25 verse 29 I just want look at about about three scriptures here 25 29 Leviticus chapter 25 verse 29 and we looked at last time at the how the Jubilee operated on the fiftieth year every every slave could go free as a type of Christ freeing us from our sins and our slavery and and then I've just felt led to go with the thought of restoring and how that's one thing we can restore because we pulled out of here out of verse 28 we pulled out of here how a man he can restore his own his own property he can restore it he can go buy it back and the only time the Bible says for us to restore anything is our time we must use our time for the glory of God so I felt led to go that way not today we'll look at a little different thought and it's so church the neck they thought today is that we don't organize and die spiritually so that's the thought that's connected to Jubilee because you're either gonna go free and redeem the time or you're gonna die spiritually we don't want to die spiritually we want to be free amen or we don't want to die we want to live Leviticus 25 29 and if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year may he redeem it and if it be not redeemed within the space of a year then the house that is in the walled city shall be established forever to him that bought it through his generations it shall not go out in the Jubilee look at that that just struck me you only have a certain amount of time to restore that and if not it's shut off forever and that's should remind us of the quote where brother Graham said there's a line between God's mercy and God's judgment we each have a certain little there's only a certain time you have to get that fire back to get that will to restore back what you were you lost because jesus said if you don't he said then those Devils will come back with seven more right and it'll be worse off than it was at the beginning so there's just a short there's a little time period that they had now verse 31 let's read verse 31 together on three one two three the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed and shout oh how in the Jubilee may God as blessings read his word you may be seated and just so you know I'm taking this from brother Rams thoughts and the message returned in Jubilee 1962 that he preached in Louisiana so I just want to give that kind of disclaimer that I didn't get these thoughts from myself I got them from God's prophet you know so Lydia do have some quotes here I like to look at today it's good to be in house Lord with everybody good to see the Saints today missed you last week but it seemed like everybody had a really good time in the Lord so very thankful for that we had a good time there and I was able to share a little bit about on Wednesday but just got the witness and try to share the light of God with so strangers and then some family members so it's very thankful for that so let's look here to the Word of God we're looking at part 18 and then we're looking at the Jubilee again we're looking at 50 and 50 is the Jubilee or Pentecost we looked at that about two weeks ago and I want to start with the other 50s I found in scripture as well just to kind of finish that thought of 50 because after this will go on I think the next number is 60 and then for that the next number biblically is 66 because there's 66 books of the Bible and then 70 then 75 and I think a hundred after that I'm just kind of going over my memory of the numbers then you get to 120 in 120 the upper room and you keep going and there's all kinds of numbers there that God shows but let's look at 50 here Genesis has 50 chapters and that's the gene chapter of the original chapter right of the Bible so it has 50 and 50 represents write a new beginning so see God began his word with 50 chapters very fitting the width of Noah's Ark was 50 cubits now and Noah's Ark you have three different numbers you have a 300 long you have a 30 tall and then you have 50 wide now 50 of courses in this case is jubilee deliverance didn't the difference come through the ark and didn't have to have a certain height of character 30 Jesus's ministry sovereignty was 30 years old now 300 is linked to deliverance - because getting to have 300 soldiers and they be the Midianites with 300 so these numbers all mean something I don't claim to know all these but it's interesting if you compare them to the scripture what you'll find but we see 50 is in Noah's Ark 50 cubits wide and now also notice next 50 years old was the age limit for priests working in the tabernacle so once you got to 50 you could finish your 50th year and then you no more work after that so that was the limit for workers also interesting I heard us on a on a witnessing video this week I was looking at you know how straight I was looking at Street Preachers and I really appreciate the faith of street preachers I told my wife of God terry's I want to go to this little school of theirs a school where you can learn the street priest now I would never you know organize but I like to learn some of their thoughts and how they how they overcome because maybe somebody I'd like to do that we've gone out a couple times and witness to people maybe four or five times went into parks by the Brooks and I had different places and and did some good witnessing I like to do that sometime because I really feel like it's a necessary thing to do and I just maybe sometime if God would lead me I'd like to do that but a man who laid with a virgin without betrothing her in courtship or promising her courtship had to marry her and pay fifty shekels of silver so fifty was a price for it to her father this would be can now this would be consensual fornication because the scripture would say if they be found now if you read though verses 22 to 27 earlier in the chapter you'll find that God you know some sinners will say you know a man was allowed to rape a woman no a man never was allowed to rape a woman God would never put up with that this is speaking of consensual fornication because they were found they be found together this woman would not be screaming or trying to get away at something she just consented to maybe they both got caught in a moment of passion and we're definitely walking in flesh but rape is condemned by stoning in Deuteronomy 22 verses 22 to 27 and just the man was stoned if the woman was crying out right if she was in a city or crying out but if she wasn't then they both were stoned and so God which would have been just fornication right just been playing fornication so we see God never puts up with sin it's it goes against God nature God hates sin God loves righteousness and so any fool I'd not say that atheists because that's what I mean by fool I'm not name column but Bible calls them fools any eighth is that would say oh the Bible says it's okay to to rape it's not it's not in the scripture and you just have to go back to the word and ask God for an understanding of his word amen so but her price though if he wanted to marry her I'm sorry the man took her but didn't go through the courtship process was fifty shekels of silver now this is interesting too David bought a threshing floor and oxen for fifty shekels of silver to build an altar to God after his sin and numbering the people you remember that if you read second Samuel the whole chapters about it Satan tricks David to number the people now it's interesting church there's a time and season a number of the people because Moses was told to number the people and they came out of history of Egypt right God told him number and God wrote a whole book on it called numbers but David is condemned for it because it was a thing of pride it was a thing of arrogance but Moses's was for records he was all for records to be able to show the lineage all the way up to Christ amen to see God and God was proving to Israel that no matter where you are I'm with you I'll never forsake you whether you're in your homeland free or if you're you're in bondage in Egypt I'll never forsake you I'll be with you I'll even multiply you in your slavery amen but a great promise of God oh how God loves us amen now after this offering though the pledge was made from Israel and but I love how David didn't have attributes like Abraham the man tried to give the threshing floor to Dave and oh just take it it's for the king and David said no I've got to pay a price for this if I if if God has called me to sacrifice it's not a sacrifice if they're if there's no pain involved if there's no loss involved right if somebody gives you a hundred dollars then you give it to the man on the street really you know like real quick like that or something like that that may not be a sacrifice that's between you and God but you see if it's if something's given then you quickly give it away is it really a sacrifice but when we when we labor for something and when we really understand and work for something and then sacrifice well I really could have used that hundred dollars or $100 was my last hundred dollars in my bank account now you're getting the sacrifice and you know where you're you don't know where your next hundred is coming from now like you got you know I got fifty thousand bank account somebody gave me ten hundred bucks on us I think thank you I'll give it to the widow you know it's not like that but David said I've got to sacrifice I have to know the pain of this to help me understand the pain that I caused Israel Church I think it was well over forty thousand people died because of his sin and numbering the people look what pride will do now we always we always preach on Aiken sixteen people died because Aiken but what about David what about David innocent Jew isn't Israelites Jews forty thousand died and plague and pestilence because of his pride lifted himself look what a great man of God I am now I can't explain why I got allowed that to happen I can't maybe those people were already in sin and weren't repenting as well I may because God works everything for his glory I don't understand that but one thing's for sure is that it was wrong of David to get lifted up and we've got to make sure we don't get lifted up as well but the price to pay was fifty interesting fifty and Abraham member he said well I need a cave and the the the men of Machpelah said you can have our cake just have it Great Father faith you know you're at your patriarch just have it and Abraham said no I'm gonna pay for it I'm not gonna let people say that man made me rich I want people to say that god bless me that's what we want to say today all of our testimonies it wasn't a men that did this for me or was it Jose that made me this or that but God did this for me although we appreciate amen and Jose's work or any blessing you get from a saint here I appreciate you know all of our sisters for all their blessings but we don't want it to be a man getting glory we want God to get all the glory so fifty somehow fifty is connected here now I think we're getting now back to yeah let's get back to the Jubilee now and this was ready to preach two weeks ago I never got to it because the other message took took up the whole time demon the time so this was ready to go two weeks ago I just added a few things here so in this thought of Jubilee that you can go free it wasn't just for everybody right like we saw like like we saw last time you know the the gospel trumpet sounds and you've got to respond to that you've actually got to leave your hoe or your rake behind if someone wants to remain enslaved to sin they can remain enslaved us in God's not gonna force anybody to serve Him right and so even with even with the great news of Jubilee humanity still has a choice to make you and I still have a choice to make how many can say amen to that God still gives us a choice in fact if I can just find that message yeah it's upon some quotes yesterday from leadership 1965 I don't have up here but I found Mother Ram saying this and I wrote it a copied and pasted it real quick here Bertram's talking about Elvis how he had a gift that God gave him he says see you don't want to do what Elvis did it's a talent God gave you and you've got to choose who and where you're going to use that talent for God or whether you're going to use it for the devil program said each he said see you have to choose what you're going to do now how many know the footsteps of the righteous sir order the Lord they are but that's our order based upon what he knows you're already going to choose he's not going to force you to go to heaven if you don't want to go to heaven he's not gonna force you to go to hell you don't want to go to hell right but I said each one of us has to make a choice and it's confronted to us but we're all confronted with this one thing what are we going to do about eternal life we're going to live here after or not that we have to come to Jesus to get that the opportunity of choosing that's one thing God gave us he force nothing on us did I read that again never he catch yet he don't force nothing on us brother Branham says he didn't force you to come to church today thank God that means you got the victory amen if you really came because you love God that means you got the victory I wanted to come Satan didn't drive me here and even God did it amen but it's God gave me that choice and God no God sees I want to be in his house he don't force nothing on us he just let us make our own choice so you have to not be forced but just make your own choice hallelujah so see and now I'm going back to that message I preached last year Christ and Mister God revealed I just preached four or five sermons off brother Graham's message and I want to read this again but Graham said he had to let put man on free more agency to fall so that he might be a savior to display what's in him his attribute of a savior all right no I think I misplaced my thought here let me see how getting on the right order he says he could not do it as great Jehovah covered all space and time he had to become a man he took kinship with the man that was lost to become man God made flesh amen he says but when he put man on partnership with him he said he had to let you get lost in other words he had to let you be a slave during the time of the Jubilee before the Jubilee he said you understand he had to let them sin put them on free more agency he could not make them sin and remain God and then punished them for something he made them do so I'm bringing out the free more agency thought again and tying it into the Jubilee everybody had the free choice you can either go free or you can remain a slave program says that about God he put men on partnership with him and let men act as a free more agent the same thing he's got you on today you act any way you want to you're a free moral agent so therefore if he put the first like that he has to put the second like that and put every one like that or he acted wrong in the first place hallelujah he said again he said God never just said well I'll choose this one I'll choose that one nobody he knew by his he could predestinate because he's infinite and so being infinite he knowed everything he knowed the end and could tell the beginning from the end because God knew what you'd choose he had to give you a free more agency or else you could stand there and say no you forced me to disbelieve God so you can't send me to hell because you forced me to do it no God will say I gave you free more agency because I knew what you would choose I ordained these things that happen here's here's how he's got his great remote control and he rewinds it back their lives he hears when the message came to you you turned it down you could have accepted it and look look here here's someone that you're Jessie received it but you turn it down amen I don't know yeah everyone had the same for you more ages that you and then you could hear fast-forward here a year later you could have received it they're here 10 years later see God gives us all these opportunities because of his love and he's waiting for you and I had to respond now he knows if you respond but I say let's respond with more love all the time to him let's go deeper with the things of God because that's where we're we're getting with this thought right here we've got to choose to go deeper in the things of the Lord and I know you want to because that's why you're here amen hallelujah let me get this here now let's look at this thought Jubilee and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city then he may redeem it within a whole year after it's sold within a full year he may redeem it so a man let's let's say the house of Levi you know in the Levite city it's walled in if he owns a house in there but you know he got came on hard times maybe his his crop wasn't good that well of course Levi didn't have crops so let's use let's use somebody else let's use a Manasseh Manasseh and it's for a good that year oh my I need to sell my little apartment there so I can pay off this other bill well once he sold that house in the Wold place he had one year to buy back the Bible said but verse 30 if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is walled in the walled city shall be established forever to him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go on the Jubilee so because it's walled in he says he's got one year if you don't pull it out and I'm sorry you don't we buy it back you're losing it because it's walled in all right now the next verse but the house of the villages was have no raw round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country that they may redeemed be redeemed and they shall go out in the Jubilee all right so if it was if your property was in a walled place you got one year to get that back because it's walled in it's it's private property I imagine but out there in the fields well you could leave it for you know forty-eight forty-nine years well that fiftieth year you get it back right you get it back but not inside of the walled city you can't get that back inside a wall denomination amen you see where everyone's going with this he said did you notice as you read it when you go home if you haven't then if a man brought property in the side of a walled city then he had one year to redeem it back if he sold it and if he did not redeem that back that property if it was inside of a wall I had to stay there they could not go free in the Jubilee it was bound to stay there they were over the wall they never heard that Jubilee the trumpet sounding they sounded the trumpet and it could not go free so a wall represented that that the sound of that trumpet would not get to them that wall represented the seperation between hearing God's Word and no longer hearing God's Word right and that's what the common slave represented with the all's in the ears right from Leviticus and Exodus before they even got there God said you tell though those Israelites if they don't want to go free that's fine they got to be taken down to the doorposts of the temple and they got to have an earring place in their ear so people can see right away are you a slave or are you free amen that's how God marks people today by the word that you're listening by the ministry you're setting under shows whether you're a slave to sin or whether you're free in the righteousness of Christ right it's seen in your hearing well I remember really feeding on these denominational things that I'm really feeding on this and oh brother man was not a prophet it shows you're marked in the ear hey man whether you're feeding on the word of the hour and the truth of God's Word and you're hearing the things of God and it shows you're free in Christ Jesus that's right and once it was sealed through the ear there was you can there's no more freedom you couldn't hear so this wall represents the same thing that's all and the ear represents right it represents the same thing one was on property and then one was on the physical body like I was even wrote in my book when you saw a Jewish woman you could tell right away if it was woman or man or if it was free or not the hair would be long on the woman uncut she'd have woman garments women had women's women's roles now all the way down to the ground they often dragged on the ground man kind of just went like to the the shin and that's proven me and all the almanacs in history women's garments were all the way down to the ground and that men had bigger belts or girdles because they had to carry their money purse there and their swords so the men had this big huge girdle whereas women didn't either he had a real narrow girdle or just had no girdle at all and there were special styles like I don't know the styles but let's say the women's were were more colorful styles of garments so you could tell right away maybe he was more plain so man you could tell right away a man had short hair of course he had a beard right man had a beard women didn't have a beard and then you could tell by looking at the ears so God had all these outward differences to show which gender they were God made it obvious because God's not the author of confusion right but the ears showed whether you were free or not whether you could hear the gospel trumpet or you couldn't Amen he says I'm so afraid that one of the things that we had in the beginning how the old-timers preach against organizing themselves together we turned around and done the very thing back fathers fought so hard to come out of and the walled city I'm afraid that too many of us today too many of our Pentecostal people has got walled into some denomination some organization somewhere and we'll never hear the sound of the jubilee and never come back to the inheritance so brother Aaron said that wall must have kind of hindered the noise of the trumpet so they couldn't hear it anymore right and so my dad says that wall represents building a wall between God's truth and man's idea so true worship and false worship amen now a couple of weeks ago I preached on the purpose series part 16 I just want to I thought strangely yesterday oh I just preached about walls and I remember cuz the walkers were here that was with my wife I think I had her I had her keys right yeah keys are in our car and I just want to review these real quick Church and I want to say this again brother Branham said you can't leave this service the same way you came you were either gonna build up the wall stronger and keep Satan out or let Satan knock down some of those bricks and for a lot of people especially in denominations or sinners all of God's bricks have been not now there's no more faith virtue and now Satan's build up walls in their lives as well see there's there's two walls you can build it's either a wall of godly character the stature perfect man right or you can do like this a wall of pride the Bible said the rich man's wealth is city and as in a high wall in his own conceit to a high wall of conceit of pride he's been up a wall of pride well look what I can do see how I'm protected from anything that could happen because of all my money because of how smart I am and how many jobs I can get and how good I am at earning money I'm such a wise businessman I'm I'm a sleuth see ya it's just a wall that's built up each day oh I'll get more and more smart look how great I am Omar with all this money that look how great I am but see the the Bible says laziness breaks down the spiritual wall now this is what we got a watch out for many times no not saying that we don't the watch out for pride I've got a battle pride you've got a battle pride but laziness slothful comes by the vineyard of a slothful person and it's all going over a thorn or cares to the world I also cover the face there up and the stone wall was broken down so a lazy Christian life causes your protection or your self-control to be broken down yeah I'm just reviewing real quick because my other bands had two habits or spirits so when you got a bad habit you know it's an evil spirit that's gotten to our life and God help each one of us amen because we're all susceptible we all we're all tempted daily right now either have no rule over his spirit is like a city that's broken down and without walls and that means self-control so rule means self-control so this is the faith virtue knowledge temperance this is the fourth step of the statute perform and if someone's broken down and doesn't have that then they just can't control the they might even go to church they might have been baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ they don't have a temperance then they're a lust Fein right they're a cigarette Fein they're an alcohol Fein and yet they might have been genuinely baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ how many have I seen like that especially Lima we baptize so many young people around 2001 2002 2003 and many of them were baptized and then they went out got drunk or smoked weed I know numerous people that did that so what does it show they might have got faith and knowledge or faith virtue knowledge but definitely by the time they got here they didn't get this and because of that all the other bricks got torn down and one brother in particular I know went to jail because he beat his family yet I saw him get baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ try to serve God was faithful for a few months he got built up but then all knocked down because he failed to go on with God not a god help us Church so see that's part of your building part of your wall of protection is when you get more better habits amen I don't have that habit to do that anymore thank God amen he's not got to protect and we get bad habits it starts breaking that wall down I used to be so on I used to be so dedicated needs to be so disciplined what happened Satan's starting to knocking down your wall you came into a service and you didn't let God build up the wall instead you just heard it like a just like a lecture preaching became a lecture instead of a feeding amen glory this is not a lecture this is a supernatural feast on the things of God's great meat his great meaty feast I'd say his spiritual buffet and we're all carnivores here I hope yeah cuz spiritual meat is discernment between good and evil I'm trying to get you and myself to discern good and evil in our lives and if we do that programs it will be an invincible army which which we have been we've been invincible for all these years that God's out of church here Satan's not destroyed us he's not taking us in the creeds and dogmas we've been invincible not by our power but by the power of the Holy Ghost to let him continually build so we don't get cold on God and we don't start loving the things of the world but he had faith virtue now his patient separates God his brother kindness and then caps it off with charity amen and then he starts planting these seeds him the fruits of the spirit after years grow out and these great grapes of faithfulness and these great grapes of of love and faith are see and share with other people so people can see the fruit of God coming from our lives amen but with many church this happens the wall is broken down they no longer pray in the morning they never confess their sins to their husband or wife or they don't come up for prayer anymore they're brought it's broken down by bad habits but the RAM called it in the message that's ferment he called it a scrap heap of Ministers that have tried to climb this but have fallen off he said there's a scrap heap of Christians and ministers just laying by the side of this gospel highway but then saw one of them try to walk with high heels and what happened she fell off in the scrap heap right because you can't walk it exalt on your stuff like a sex object you can't walk that highway of holiness like that you'll fall off because you're causing brothers or you're calling it causing sinners to lust after you and those are demon lusts and that takes you off the path of righteousness and it put you on the path to hell that's right so mister briefly reviewing Nehemiah had one hand working with the stones the revelation and one hand speaking the Word of God with one hand he's building up the revelations of the law and the other hand he's speaking the word get behind me saying it's written now saith the Lord he puts this revelation upon that and he was working with both hands amen that's a we should be new and constantly building with revelations from every service I'm a witness every sermon I preached by God's grace something fresh comes out amen and you place that revelation on your character oh I can get closer to God here are you closer there and what Satan tries to come and say get behind me devil you're a liar you're brough out of you in Jesus Christ's name according to this word amen so you've got to have both it's a building process and yes we have to build and fight at the same time we don't get any breaks Church right we got to build and fight at the exact same time see the weapons of God pull down strongholds now there is this one case let me add this you can have a wall build up of keeping Satan out but then inside of your wall inside of your land you can build up a complex right his brother man was clearly sealed by the Holy Ghost yeah the stache former man but he build up a complex and almost decided to stop preaching because people want to hear his message and brother have said I had a complex and he said I build it up so even inside of his Holy Ghost character Satan had built up a complex against the people he said they want to hear my preaching well they won't have to I'll just quit preaching that's exactly what Satan wanted all that love how the weapons of God came down what was it he was just driving the car over a man that's how mighty God's weapons are they'll meet you in the church that meet you in the car they'll meet you anywhere they'll meet you on the job God's weapons are active and mighty and can conquer Satan anytime anyplace anywhere amen so God's weapons weren't working on brother branham as he and Billy power driving back from meetings and he finally got victory over that complex no I'm not gonna go out the wilderness and leave God's people I'll go preach them whether they reject me or not whether they accept me because I've got apostolic foundations I've got apostolic gifts amen oh thank you lord so see you can have this great wall but then Satan will try to get you off and he'll try to build up a stronghold of Complex in your life see so the word stronghold is when you got you got your own opinion you you're so opinionated and it's the wrong opinion now I can say the Amen of this - I've had I've had complexes right you've had complexes you think you're right you are so sure you're right the Ramblas were so sure they didn't want to hear his preaching but then there was people all around the world like you and I that had to hear it amen maybe we would love to hear it amen and so brother had to overcome that and get rid of his opinion and let God administer God's opinion to him see and then men Paul rebuked Peter for building again the complex that I use Peter used to have a complex toward Gentiles before he got filled with all the ghosts but then after Satan built that complex up again where he wouldn't even eat he was discriminating against the Gentiles and Paul said for if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor you can have this wall of a statue of man but then still transgress God's commandment by building up a dwelling place for Satan right the Bible said neither give place to the devil and that's in your mind don't give Satan a place in your mind amen no no is this helpful Church I hope it is Peter was building a great complex but see this is how you and I build we pray about things we pray about our complexes we pray about those who persecute us that speak evil things against us we pray for people that we don't see in church right we pray for them we pray for our loved ones that seem like they're never going to be safe we've got to pray and build up our faith in the Holy Ghost right well Satan will make us hopeless well they'll never be saved I'll never get the victory uh-oh that says that's a devil stronghold that's a devil castle and you're landing you got to catch that now by the weapons of God stewey bill our faith pray pray about it have you prayed about it right that's what I want ask myself the Holy Spirit last me have you prayed about have you build up a great protection against Satan have you built that up because remember the Bible says so building it up means to have constant increase so our prayers constantly increase our faith and remember he said I commend you Paul says he's leaving Ephesus and he says the word I commend you to God by the word of His grace which is able to build you up so see you hear the word of God here you take it home and you pray about it and it builds you up the rest of the week amen oh yeah right this word is able to build you up if you receive it and then be prayerful about it Lord you've led the pastor to preach on this so many times or numerous times Lord help help this to be built into my life brother preach to you put a half on job and a year and a half on the corruption I don't know if my long I don't think I heard pre-show Series that long maybe you're not even think so no some of the people got like brother and said they got little impatient with him Wednesday they got little impatient with job on the ash heap BAM you ever gonna get job out off the ash heap and though the Holy Spirit was leading him to get the people in desperation I'm in desperation I'm on the ash heap what hope is there for me and then he preached and he said I know my redeemer liveth amen and brother have said every seer in the church got saved so see there's a purpose for dwelling on something the purposes of set God's people free amen meditate on something dwell on it pray about it until the people's faith did build up and you can receive that promise that's why we take series on these things and we labor on them we go over them again so the people will have it on their minds they'll pray about it at home and they'll go I always say God build my faith up so I can receive this hey man that's right and I remember if believers being built up by God make up a building so you're part of two spiritual building processes right now you are being built up you are being built up and if you're getting built up you're part of God's building of the Bride of Christ hey man I'm a part of two building construction projects right now right usually got to get a permit and thank God on when I got saved I gave God the permit built on my land build my that's right we got a good permission to build on our house or something like that oh well I gave God full permission Billy whatever you want as much construction as you want break it over just build me into a real Christian you have my permission Lord uh-huh thank God I'm glad I gave permission sister Connie to build me up he sure has broken me down sometimes but he sure has built me up as well that Potter's hand we sang about amen call me break me Mommy shake me build me up in the stature of a real Christian okay now we're back so yeah I just wanna throw those this could remind you I thought my so strange the Holy Spirit had me preach on walls Oh three or four times levan said see if you say methodist that's just a blasphemous name he's talking about walled cities remember you have to redeem the walled have to redeem it if not you die you die inside that wall see he said that's just a blasphemous name we can say amen to that but brother let me ask you something what about Pentecost Church this is in November 1962 before the seals were open and notice brother Branham is applying the word to his day right he's not just hammering on Methodists or Baptists he's hammering on the message of his day right it's it's in his day it's in his time period his life time so what about the message churches that's why we've got to take everything brother Branham preaches and apply it to today right it has c.c. brother man was a true prophet he took the word all the old tell you takes the Old Testament scripture Leviticus 25 of all scriptures are 2225 and he applies it to us here applied to them in the Pentecostal age before the message been given the seals right so we do the same thing today so I'm gonna finish this quote so here's what I already showed well Bram said if it's not a born-again experience it's still a blasphemous name patterned after the beginning so if the Baptist's are not trying to push people to be born again now not speaking tongues just be born again they might speak in tongues they might shout they might weep they might rejoice they might scream they might dance whatever you do something's gonna happen if you get the Holy Ghost if you get burned with fire something's gonna happen you're gonna feel it right like on the day of Pentecost they knew something happened there was fire so they run out rejoicing it was noise there was noise it was noised abroad the wonderful works of God they're saying God is that wonderful things and it got noised abroad they knew something happened those people they thought they were drunk right and so if if we are not patterning off a Pentecost it's a blasphemy so if message churches just like Pentecostal just like Lutheran Catholic if we're not trying to get people to be born again then we blast we're just a blasphemous name think about that Bride of Christ fellowship can be a blasphemy to God unless we're trying to get people to be born again the Holy Ghost amen amen that's a whole desire is to see people not just saying we appreciate you know water baptisms not just sanctified but filled with the Holy Ghost amen and now you and I know most people around the message they just get justified hardly holier anybody gets sanctified because if they were sanctified they wouldn't let no evil coming from their eyes right they'd have virtue knowledge temperance patience goddess and that people get so impatient with you that they'll blasting your name or they'll call you a call you a backslider you know when you're trying to stand on the right so they starts it most people start sanctification but don't finish and then how many fewer people actually get born again where the power of God is on their life and people can see it and then you're so dedicated so faithful to Christ people know you're just not like a wonder in the house of God you are a pillar in the house of God amen jesus said if you can overcome I'm gonna make you a pillar in the house of my god amen glory you won't hate going to church you won't be late for church you won't do all these things have you got a job and things we understand right but what I'm saying is that you will be sowing fire for God you'll love God you love everything about God you love his people you'll give to his people you'll foetus people you'll do anything you can because you love God and you love his church so he makes you a pillar they're amen amen never Peter said Peter said if judgment begins I hide the house of God he's not talking about heaven he's talking about a church but how much fewer people will be saved out there how scarce will be some people saved out that don't come to church mercy see they don't know another they don't know fellowship all they know is their Creed they're just settled down like some kind of Lodge like lodges now that's what we don't want to become we don't wanna become a lodge remember Abraham said they're stages to the Antichrist spirit so we should we have a look at our church and look at our lives and say as our church any of these three stages LeBaron says not three different I Christ spirits it's the one Antichrist spirit that works progressively just like God's Spirit works progressively see brother man said the deeds of Nicolaitans the doctrine of balaam teaching the false prophet Jezebel do not constitute three spirits or make three spiritual principles these three are but the various manifestations of the same spirit as it goes from depth to depth now catch this this is we're getting out here to the the main part here that was all warm up everybody feel warm everybody's sweating spiritually feeling good exercise your your faith muscles or exercise your buddy feeling good now I'm starting working out really for sure right here what is it all they had a Christ spirit an organization the various strangers once the clergy separated themselves that's the first thing the preacher separate themselves as more holy than everybody else and the people let him do it see so we can't put all the blame on the preachers because if a preacher separates himself I'm more holy than you then you got to vote them out so you have just as much you and I had just as much responsibility before God as anyone whether a preacher or not right there's just the leaders which means they're more responsibility more accountability on the day of judgment now look look what this Antichrist spirit produces that's why every service is so critical to be in the house of God ritual and ceremony was given an increasing part in worship so when the Antichrist spirit started progressing the preacher separated themselves they're too holy they have all the holiness they're the ones that turn the bread into the body of Christ the wine into the literal blood of Christ no nope and pretty soon it's all the same thing ritual say it's the same routine over and over again that's what the Antichrist spirit does and I'm not going to go much further on that quote but this is the one I would look at remind you again they're with me Satan stars with deeds of the Nicolaitans which program says these are harmless anti word traditions people just get a tradition they just start little traditions that aren't in the Word of God like the example of our RAM gave in those Church ages was with sprinkling babies that was never in the Word of God it was just one of these little small little anti word practices and now for us it might be well you believe God sent a prophet or you've already got the Holy Ghost you're already saved no that's not true anybody can recognize God sent a prophet demons recognize Jesus was the Christ the Messiah [Applause] Judah stood right there Peter said we all believe and assure you're the Christ you're the Messiah Judah saw Judas think of all the miracles Judah saw I was thinking about that this morning think of all the miracles he saw him to calm the sea Judah saw that he saw Jesus here the lepers he saw paralyzed people rise up so church that I'll encourage you if you haven't seen miracles like that yet you still believe blessed are you because jesus said blessed are you if you haven't seen yet you believe and he'd seen so much sister Karen he seen so much down through the years towards the end he's like he said Santa he 'tried let me get this straight if you give me 30 pieces of silver all's I got to do is tell you where Jesus at I can make a few bucks off Jesus I've carried you know a Treasury his Treasury is kind of low you don't have much money in there but I can make a little money on the side but I just compromise on the message a little bit I could I could make a pretty good deal here he'd seen so much supernatural that it became common to him and the church said think can you can you imagine that church he had have seen Lazarus raised from the dead he had to seen that they're all there and yet he still saw this attraction what was more popular what was more exciting in his eyes the preaching of Jesus or money can you can you imagine that and we've got to be careful and see that his anything happens today people will leave Church leaves a message just for a beautiful girl or a handsome guy with white teeth ching and a fancy haircut or money right a high paying job they'll leave the things of God or a bigger house or if you answer your car they'll leave God from that well God is you know these things are the same yesterday today and forever right all these things are the same so he starts by saying all the pre you can only have miracles if brother Jesse's really really anointed that's not true if I come in here and I'm fighting for my spiritual life and I've gone through hell and high water and I try to struggle you if you're anointed you can still go lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover they don't have to come through me Church it comes through any anointed part of the body of Jesus Christ unit you can't think that I can't think that I can't think well if people don't come up here that nothing happened I can't think that I've been guilty of that I'm honest I'll be my mother if they grow up nobody came up for prayer then God didn't move that's not true at all see God can move but see we can't make it a tradition right we can't let little traditions come in we've got to make sure everybody's got the holiness of God on them because the whole point of this is to do what kill them with spiritual death where it's all ritual I've been to a Catholic funeral couple months ago it's all ritual there's nothing spontaneous there's nothing supernatural there's nothing like that going on there's no excitement in there's no faith there's there's no other thing like that but we ought to have faith that God's here and all things are possible but if we let little traditions come in well there's no guest preacher I guess God's not going to move today or brother or sister so-and-so is out so it that's impossible for God to speak in a tongue or it's not we must remember that all things are possible we must look to God we must have expectation we must be built up in faith praying in the Holy Ghost now you see why this is important because Eve all we are Church goes through seasons every church goes through seasons writes that the sister Karen's laughing we I'm laughing too we are every Church goes through seasons are we building up building up our faith expecting God to move more are we getting traditional and ritualistic is the fire growing or is the fire are you trying to fan to get this thing alive come on somebody throws throws throw something in there anything or is it burning and you can feel the wood than the fire of God everybody loves God the glory go God can do great things today oh there yeah and this is the wall brother Rams talking about message churches can be blaspheming the name of God just as much as the Luther I'm not attacking message churches I love I love messenger you know I love them I love the message nothing I love more than the message but they they can be tempted and fall away just like any other Church it's the responsibility of not just the preacher because that that's an antichrist idea well it's all up to the pastor as long as the pastor's study we're gonna have a good service no you gotta study too the man said I can be just as a nought he said I can pray and build up my faith but if I come in there and the people haven't don't have the same anointing he said nothing's gonna happen and I wish I had that quote in front of me cuz I'd show it to you but just kind of came to me as a reminder the man said I can pray and get myself so anointed but if the people don't have the same anointing God's not gonna move thank you lord now what is it advance to after that Balaam was false unity oh where does all the message churches are all the same we're just all the same and the shittiest this member he let them commit fornication so that was oh it's okay to do this it's okay to act like this during courtship or it's okay to do this during marriage and that's okay you know you're not married you can do this you know sexual sins it's okay to marry twice three times four times see this is what it advances to it starts as small but then it gets greater evils greater false doctrine usually it's sexual sin it's not always starts as physical sin but then it gets into sexual because that was a very foreign a that was a fornication feast and then lastly turns into false prophecy people will listen to false prophets seducing spirits and death it ends with spiritual death they've crossed the line they haven't redeemed what was theirs amen they haven't bought it back they haven't redeemed it and we got to be careful now does everyone understand why that's so important because we're they're going to go really gonna go the way of the holy ghost bride and get more on fire for God or Satan's gonna try to cool this church off you know gotta pray you don't got to seek God you have to pull on the word of God but the RAM said that's saying SiC them to the devil you want the devil to be here or you want to get that devil up in the tree I'm gonna get that devil up in the tree so I cut the tree down and killed the devil amen you gotta back arkinson amen get away devil get away get away from us we want to be free we want God to reign in our church our God reigns amen see it's so critical and if we don't do that then Satan's gonna have a place right in the church so C but the RAM uses no no we see the personal walls that we build up but brother Branham is talking about the organizational wall that this represents it's got to be redeemed if it's behind that wall it's got to be redeemed or if not if you don't redeem it then it's gonna be organized organized and cut off let me go through some quotes here these are different quotes not about the Jubilee look brother when you drop down to the end of this life life journey you'll wish you had lived a wholly clean life when you face God be sure to remember that now about your church what you belong to that doesn't mean nothing to God it's what you are in your heart that's right God ain't gonna ask you whether what church you belong to it's what you are in your heart is what God is going to look at so it's what you are in your heart right now he said listen friends don't try to depend and seek sensations instead rely upon realities not sensation shoutings all right I love to shout I've shouted so much my throat hurts but that don't mean nothing speaking in tongues is all right praise the Lord's all right faith for miracles is all right all these things in those feelings sometimes say oh I felt it like a rushing mighty wind another one said I felt fire my soul what that doesn't make it right either way it's what you are after you've received it god bless for the vain good to see you sir hey Lily he said see that's what counts see so you can't pin it to any sensation relevant says that and serves as the endtime the Holy Ghost without sensation you can't make it one sensation you've got to speak in tongues you have got to shout like brother songs or scream like sister so if you don't scream like sisters don't you didn't get it it's not that you can't make it but you but rather later says you got to have a sensation but you can't make it one certain sensation whatever God wants to do when he feels you let God do it amen you'll know it because his spirits over it's running over you you feel so good you just yield to it and it'll take you every you need to go hey the reality of God comes after you say you got it watch the next week after you got it watch the next month after you got it watch the next year after you say you got it that will prove the reality of Jesus Christ in your daily life proves whether you receive them or not [Music] now if you want to speak an unknown tongue I think I'll let you do that but according to scripture you're still nothing until the Holy Spirit comes and I've asked God to speak in tongues and you won't let me so I said okay maybe in the future but see all that would do Church with it would just edify me I see people do it sometimes I mean that's so easy for them how do they do that but then they probably at me and say how do you preach up there like that right it's a gift I just get in the channel I pray fast in the channel and God preaches through me well they pray again the channel God speaks in tongues through them I should get jealous and say man I wish I'm gonna try really hard I just gotta I just got a stutter more pretty soon it'll come no no you got a draw draw nigh to God and God will draw nigh to you he said then after the Holy Spirit comes then you can speak in tongues God will just take the nature that you are and cut it off for you and make you the best servant you can be so after you the Holy Ghost God wants to make you a servant now my service is very easy for 13 years I've served the church whether I'm song leader prep pastor treasurer deacon summer sunday-school superintendent sunday-school teacher you name it I don't have enough fingers for all the roles I do here but that's a I just say that funny not exalt myself but it's just funny to me but I have to be a servant right so if God did fill me with the Holy Ghost my life afterwards proved did I serve God's purpose on this earth because he saved me for purpose he gave me power for a purpose and that's what you and I are say - he gives you power the Holy Ghost for a powerful ministry he might make you preach the gospel he might give you a gift of speaking in tongues he might make you a prophet he might give you spirit of prophecy it's hard telling what he'd do for you I love that or he might do all those things for you but the first thing to do is be sure that by one not sensation by one spirit we're all baptized in that body and then then the gifts come from that body speaking in tongues and everything now that's where I want to get to in the purpose series once I get done with these 14 seasons I want everybody to pray and we'll preach on it and then see God what gifts are my life because whatever gifts are in your life you're accountable for those gifts the gifts and callings of God were already there before you repented because the gifts and callings of God are without repentance and I want you and I to know we need to know what God's called us to do because that's a revelation of the will of God for our lives and I'd like you to tell me what your gift is that I can pray for you too and then you can pray for me praise God think about that let's say your gift is tongues and you you're kind of wondering whether it is and you've seen it opera think about if you devoted 30 minutes a day to praying God use my gift God use my gift God what could happen on Sunday morning after you pray seven days about that all right you got to get the wisdom god bless my bless this gift use this gift anoint me anoint me and you pray seven days up that's what I do for preaching God anoint me I don't you and then here you get to hear the word of God what what could God do if we are all dedicated and focused on doing what God's called us to I think see more of God don't you I do Church I do I'll be loved all my heart now but when this King is how about Uzziah God took place being such a great man and influencing Isaiah and the righteous of course of his kingdom he got to a place he got feeling self secured now this is something I gotta watch out because I've been here 13 years I got to make sure I don't get secured all like nothing could touch me I always be the pastor here huh I don't have to worry so much about what I say I can't get like that that's pride and there's where you make your mistake there's where so many righteous men look at this bite the dust of shame like a surfer about eating dust right but ma'am said preachers will bite the dust of shame so the in other words they'll get they'll fall so low they'll be eating snakes food dust preacher used to be so exhausted so anointed but they make one mistake and they can be bite and dust right down there by Satan disgraced by the dust of defeat is because they begin to feel self secure you begin to think that you have lived so long for Christ no matter what he presents before you you'll take your choice whether you want it or not so God gives you a choice and God says you need to do this but you say it's okay I've been doing this long enough I can go this way I can do this it's okay I've sure got all these years I'm above that I'm a more message I'm more mature mastered believer then brother sister so and so I can do whatever I want that's not the right attitude to have he said you've got to continue to serve God no matter what you was back ten years ago it's what you are right now and the church said what were you 10 years ago something you weren't even saved thank god you're not what you used to be but for those of us have been long around I mean this year be 20 years I was saved you know eight years I've heard the message I got look at my life ten years ago what was my life ten years ago in 2009 well thankfully I can go back and listen what my life was ten years ago because we recorded all the sermons I always tell my stories you know and I've done that I would know some sermons from a few years ago trying to get thoughts about statue for man and I was like wow I was pretty zealous I preached hour forty-five minutes that's right when Karen and Laura started covered they love me they put up with me well not really well they love me but they love God more the reason they the reason they love me is because they love God but see we have to make sure we're not in a worse condition than we were ten years ago if we are if we are in a worse condition pride is entered certainly pride because there's no contention with unless pride the Bible said so when you if you have a contention against God what is it it's pride contention against a brother assistance church it's pride it's always pride my way my way my opinions are right so what kind of Christian were you this week about last night what kind of Christian were you last night because you and I can't live off what we were what are we right now if we don't check up every hour then we're gonna go down the road of cooling off and potentially could have you could fall off the statue of a perfect man that's scriptural Peter fell off he was so high up there ma he was being so good but he fell off right before Jesus he got knocked off all the way down he lost his virtue he couldn't stand up to a woman right a little maid girl at the the high priests house he couldn't have enough virtue to say I believe I know Jesus Christ he did I'm not virtue but Jesus said I prayed for you that your faith fail not amen Jesus one of that is faith get knocked away cuz then he'd be lost but Jesus and I prayed that your foundation will stand even though everything falls off you're wrong you'll have your foundation you're gonna be saved Peter a mad you just got to be humbled a little bit before the Holy Ghost can come right then he got built up with after 40 days of the resurrection for 50 days after the resurrection he got built back up where he could be capped off with the Holy Ghost see God can do a great word really fast uh uh and see Church are we seeking God for more of his spirit because you're either gonna get your either get closer to God or get further away from God today did you see God for today's Ministry of the Holy Ghost did you receive Lord I'm going there and this is a carnivore fest right this is a this is a meal at the house of God and Lord just prepare the meat that I want to feast on all of it help me to have a heart how many be hungry so I can feast on God's Word because 9 out of 10 chances are you woke up and the flesh just like I did how many people woke up in the flesh and didn't you know tired who didn't what we're thinking about God sometimes we do that and you've got to crucify that man right you got to die daily and choose the hunger and thirst for righteousness if not Satan's take some of those bricks away oh he didn't pray he didn't pray this morning about I could yeah he takes his crowbar out that I took away there's their temperance right that's what he does right it's so true and now when they get to church instead of having temperance or self-control I think I want to step out and go buy a burger real quick we're always preaching I'm really hungry you see I've ever gotten a man who smoked a little bit smoked here I have to finish the sermon now that's that's an extreme example but they do it we've had brothers and you know them they used to come here they used to step out and do some of things like that the saying that broke down all these he just tears down the Lord gets a sledgehammer all right 40 pounds there goes your virtue can you raise your hands to God because people looking at me don't want these people looking at me but if you really advert you you don't care who's here you know Christ is here you raise your hands of your creator because you know he gathers over two or three are gathered there I am in the midst of them yes so much virtue you don't care who's around but she got strength to live a godly life but see he's got a couple days go by what happens Satan's like he heat him fortified he didn't put any new bricks down there oh he does like glory to God we said go into Satan here we go oh he's all excited to tear down your wall and it happens either either way what everyday happens either one way or the other either you get more spiritual revelations oh that was glorious preaching day and we've had Aaron come in Aaron's he's young right he's new with us so Aaron will text me sometimes or that was a great chord about you know pastors and the oil line and see what is he doing he's bill he's putting stuff each revelation on there it's getting pretty high in it brother now you really like that right and so he's got a whip to deep noon that but that's I love about new people you can see they're they're they're they're wall building the more they feed on the word the more they come to church the more they pray pretty soon they got a real huh real high wall amen and there ain't no devil getting in there amen but you and I have to make sure we build the wall and fortify it through all the days of our life we've got to redeem that whatever you've lost you've got you better get it back don't let him don't let it go into nomination or hands ah don't let go into the Satan's Antichrist spirit hands you've got to redeem it get it back quick get it back quick remember Jesus told Ephesus you better get your first love back or I'm taking the candlestick out of here I better have said he did all the Holy Ghost preachers were out of there within 20 years after Paul left in acts 20 it wasn't about 20 years and the whole all the Christian population was gone out of Ephesus because they got they got lazy on God they didn't come to see God anymore in church services they just come you know because it's fun ritual you know we do this this is the highlight of our life should be coming to church it should be now let me try to close here just give me a minute let me see how many quotes I got here I want to find a logical or I should say a spirit-filled place to stop I shouldn't say logical oh why is this place to stop I got a couple more here four more okay and I've already preached about hour and ten minutes yeah let me set a timer here I'm gonna go ten more he said the King got the place where he thought himself he got lifted up his probably got in his heart and that's what happens us if you'll pardon this expression that's what happened to our churches throughout the country they're fine people in there some of the best in the world goes to church I think the best in the world goes to church but the thing of it is the organizational system gets lifted up that's what happened to the Methodists that's what happened to the Baptist that's what happened to the Nazarite Nazarene program holiness to the Pentecostal he's talking about his day and I kind of say like this that's what happens the message churches it can happen to us lift it up self-willed not God's will but self will happen that what I want to happen happens at church instead of what does God want to happen self-centered it's all about me it's not about God anymore it's all about what I want to happen pride that you can't they can't tell you nothing brother Jesse he cannot preach I've had people tell me this you don't preach anything new I've had it done tell it to my face you don't say anything new oh this is all old stuff and I'll even say to their face well this was new I never preached that and they'll change the subject you can't tell them nothing when pride gets them you can't they can't learn anymore from you because they're the they're the expert now that's what I love here in Aaron's revelation about the number 17 the bride I'd like to learn from God's people don't you I can learn I want to learn it Jose Abreu oh my a Briggs close to me all the time I'm constantly learning you know I didn't know that but see what some other pride you can't tell nothing they're going to tell you all what it's all about it's a so it's because they become so know-it-all he's ppreciate already I've already heard that it doesn't matter if you've heard it have you applied it right you can hear about your your your the one you're engaged to you can hear about the multi that's fine but have you married them do you know them right that's a rotor Hansen you got an oh Christ now I just hear about Christ you got to know him for yourself see nobody can tell them anything no more see message churches like Ivan I got a man I met a man who tell me who knew brother bread and he's passed on now but he got so cold on God from his own confession he said I've heard it all preached before and he's got so cold on God I've heard of seven thunders I hear the stuff he said I've heard it all and it was just like that they know you can't tell him anything am i building them self around reasoning they build themselves around their Creed and then they do they leave God in the back so what was that man's Crees a new brother branham the Creed is I've heard it all before I know it all so I don't need to pull on God's Word anymore I know it all it's not just who hearing it's not who about who hears the word it's about who lives the word and if you're living the word then life is exciting the Christian life is growing the Christian life is engaging the Christian life makes you want more and more not less and less right more and more I got four more that's what happens to doctors when they get so self-centered they don't need any help from God that's when I don't want what one fool with me thank God for Christian doctors right yes when you leave God or anything you I want you to leave me out see because you must because you must always remember that he got lifted up so many today you take a family of people start going to church and God will heal that little family he'll bless them and give them the Holy Spirit in their life the little children will pray around the table they'll pray before they go to bed let's say in our feet here mother and father will join hands and pray now look this this family starts out praying and serving God together and as long as they continue like that they'll stay a family so what's one of the secrets to being a Christian just faithful dedication sincere prayers in your home just pray for pray to for God to heal the home pray for God to minister in the home but Ram said oh you'll continue a family but the but you let them get the first thing you know they don't have nothing old junk car maybe riding around or maybe walking fine they'll get a good car better home and first thing you know then they want to get to what they the world cause a better class to associate with they move into a different neighborhood and in there they found out they become influenced by the wrong influence see the people you hang around with the people you associate shows what's inside your heart I'm glad to associate with you Church I'm glad I don't associate with other churches it's the church because we all believe the same thing right you must and then he he had this quote by saying you must always stay where the kingdom of God and where the glory of God is pouring out praise God stay where you can be spiritually fed day and night and the first thing you know separation come in the home wilderness and they get lifted up so see church did we feed last night did you read the Bible before you went to bed I hope we do our devotions every night I hope you do too how about this past week were you feeding on the Word of God see when was the last time God's Spirit got poured out on you see we got to stay it's our choice just like with the wall it's your choice redeeming get it back where choose where you want to be you want to be where the presence of God is constantly being pouring out and blessings and repenting and rejuvenating and strengthening and praying and building up and the Holy Ghost do we want to be in that yes but a lot of people want to be out and just in the world and they just don't they want to feed their hungry for worldly things we can't be like that we can't let church be a ritual it's got to be a feast amen it's got to be a rain shower and don't bring it on Brella for this one okay don't try to hide from that you want that anointing all over you you want to be you're gonna be nice and soaked in the in the richness of God's love shine on me rain on me Jesus Holy Spirit rain down that's your power fall on me amen I need strength this week I've got great things coming up I don't want to fall away this week I was no closer to God rained on me Lord go I don't want to be dry I want to be saturated with the love of God now kind amen if you come through the the piano and the guitar I didn't get to where I thought I'd go but tonight Lord willing maybe we'll continue this thought let me see where I was that Alright a couple more I just made that Holy Spirit rain down and I'll close with these lasts here we're back talking about how America is living off he said America's lit they're broke we're printing money that we don't have he said we're living also off a past reputation and then he says that's what the church is doing today not the bride Amen Church we can't live off a brother branham's reputation do we reference him yes so and we do that to raise our faith for right now if God healed his wife God can heal my wife God can heal my husband it's got to be raised for right now we can't live off what other churches did or what our church did ten years ago or 50 years we got a belief or God right now we got to see his power and his love pour out upon us now so we can have a testimony now Uzziah Hezekiah even wrote about Hezekiah this morning they serve God so well but got off right at the end right at the end and here we are right at the end before the rapture and we don't want to fall off and get hungry for the things of the world we want to stay hungry for the things of God how many sermons I have to preach on this as many as the Holy Spirit thinks we need so we can keep this fire burning keep the good atmosphere here keep people hungry to come to church love God and worship God keep building up that wall against Satan amen and not be walled into a organizational demonic Antichrist spirit that wants to put it all I'll just put it on brother Jesse he can do my praying for me I've got to pray for me I'll hadn't really just to do my Bible reading for me I can't read it for you you've got to read it for you you've got a hunger you've got a thirst I've got to do it too and that's the hour that we're living in church people don't want accountability they don't want to be accountable for their gifts but I believe now is the time where the Holy Spirit will help us to be accountable front I wonder maybe some of us have gone for years and haven't used the gifts that God has placed in our lives how many want to be used by God with your gifts you believe you got the Holy Ghost but maybe you just don't know what gifts are in your life the church we will find those by seeking God's face coming to church with expectation pray in your home reading your Bible saying God show me you've given me some talent I've got invest in this show me let's just pray Heavenly Father you saw the hands that were up Lord God there's something that every Christian wants to do and that's the will of God Lord today we've looked at these scriptures we don't want to get walled into a ritual because it's a blasphemous name dear God I don't care what names on the front if we're not seeking more of the Holy Ghost if we're not wanting more of God's book of acts power and Lord we we blaspheme the name of God Lord we don't want to do that in this church I don't care it's not about the number of people here it's about the quality of people here amen the beauty of the church is the character of the people the character that once more of God that wants to be used by God that wants to show the realities of Christ in their life after they get born again [Music] Lord we choose today as the hens are up Lord that you saw we choose today to stay where the presence of God is being poured out day and night we choose the feast on the things of God we choose to be interested in invest in the things of God Almighty I pray for your people in the name of Jesus Christ may you become such a reality in their life but you show them their gifts and their purposes on this earth Lord these series just kind of keep overlapping with numerology Lord and purpose but God I believe it's your will for this time that this church can really get a good hold on our purposes in life [Music] you've just been bringing it back to me more and more and more and showing me all these quotations and scriptures let's
