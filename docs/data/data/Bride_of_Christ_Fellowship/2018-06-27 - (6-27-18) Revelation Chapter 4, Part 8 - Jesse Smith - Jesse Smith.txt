[Music] [Music] praise the Lord Amen let's take a few prayer requests and announcements here by the grace of the Lord okay let's do an ounce monsford by God's grace I don't know if you saw it but there was about 25 postcards returned that were undeliverable to this zip code it was sent to the for for three one two zip code the church's nip code missed minute darden and there's about 25 so it's about two percent out of the twenty five hundred we're not deliverable so they're out there on the prayer request table you can take a take as many as you want pass them out I've only passed one out so far so I meant to pass them more out by God's grace but they're free to pass out so there's they just got that yellow sticker on the back they were I guess there was no one living at that location where they tried to deliver so that's the first announcement a second I believe next Wednesday is July 4th so the children were concerned about fireworks so I may shorten song service a little bit next Wednesday so we can get out a little bit earlier we'll see I for example like they might have fireworks on when or I'm sorry on Tuesday or Thursday I don't know so I know that children care about that it's kind of like Father's Day you know and Mother's Day like I usually cancel second service I'm not gonna cancel service but I'll probably let out a little earlier by God's grace we'll see we'll see how it turns up but I do want to be mindful I know the kids love that it's a special day for them anyways we may end up low early okay I'll be that's the only announcements prayer requests I got numerous prayer requests here brother bender rod asked for prayer requests he traveled out to Trinidad no I'm sorry Africa today Africa I forget which country was it remember what it was anybody remember was it Congo yeah it was a Congo okay thank you I can't remember and then I think his next trip is Trinidad so anyways he asked for prayer so let's pray for brother Ben Simon Randy and Esther are still in Thailand so let's pray for them a third request a woman named I'm sorry say her name I shouldn't say her name but anyway she asked me would you pray that I would overcome wearing earrings and I said yes I'll pray for that so we'll pray for this unspoken I should not have said her name forgive me I said her name but she don't go to this church so this I don't think it's an embarrassment but anyways I got to be careful she wants to overcome earrings so she saw our YouTube videos and she emailed me and she said I want to be in the rapture where you prayed I can get over earrings I said yes we'll pray for that the last one is I just saw this today one of the Supreme Court justices are stepping down let's pray that a judge will be appointed in there that will get rid of abortion because there's how many thousands of lives are taken every day because of the Supreme Court ruling so it's just on my heart to pray that I don't know if it's possible but Christians want to get rid of as much sin as possible remember the Bible said Christians are supposed to sigh and cry for any abominations done murder is absolutely an abomination so it's been a prayer on my heart for years to get rid of abortion since they started it in the 70s or late 60s rather so let's just pray that was just on my heart I don't know if it's possible but I know with God all things are possible so those four requests any other requests this evening by God's grace Haven okay yeah we'll pray for them by God's grace any other prayer request tonight Karis friends okay thank you anyone else either requests sister bub amen praise the Lord unspoken wonderful and by the way brother Adam are you traveling this weekend we could okay I don't know if you're going to Tennessee memory you talked about

faithful so mindful he invites us to come to his heavenly throne so let's just go before him in prayer Heavenly Father God we come reverently again humbly with all the sincerity in our hearts Lord God

desires or God cleanse us now with my precious blood through the blood we can come to your presence O God thank you for that invitation or we come at the right spirit we come by truth Lord by the word

by God's grace and letter you can switch over when you're ready I'll have I'm gonna try to finish it tonight by God's grace I can't promise but I'm going to really try it's just a jam-packed message is full of deep deep truths and a lot of spiritual vitamins by God's grace so let's look at Revelation chapter 4 we'll read verse six seven and eight now I was reminded again today how special this sermon was a brother branham's this was the sermon where the pillar fire came down and made the seven different shadows for the seven different Church ages a three hour and three minutes sermon from the time he took the pulpit to the time they stopped recording it he was there at the standing at the pulpit for three hours and probably longer cuz that a prayer meet what an amazing amazing message man thank God for the Word of God so revelation 4 verse 6 and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystalline in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle let's all read verse eight if we can one two three and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and there were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come let's have one more word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it only to God as we bow our heads Heavenly Father this is your holy word Lord this was a we'd say a red-letter day for your prophet this was a day where you came down and put your own stamp of approval on the church ages Lord God and now into the fourth chapter Lord we thank you Lord God for your grace and mercy Lord it means so much to us to the world they laugh at it they say it never could have happened but Lord we know it could happen because the word has been vindicated to us Oh God the word we received is a perfect word it's a pure word and father the life the Prophet lived in front of us lo God on tape-recorded we know is a true Christian life dear God we thank you Lord for the sweetness of the Holy Spirit we feel tonight we will cherish the old rugged cross we will cherish the blood of Jesus our minds picture each one of us clinging to that cross as blood is poured down that cross and our tears pouring down our eyes in our faces o God we will forever cherish the cross it will be our crown it will be our reward it will be our treasure Oh God it'll be our trophy that old rugged cross Oh God thank you for your son oh God thank you that he came to die for us to redeem us Lord destruction we give you all the glory in this endtime Lord inspire us anoint us with that flying and go noin ting that we heard last week O God that we can fly high above the cares of this world and the things of this world we thank you for in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous be Necedah praise the Lord well I'm gonna try to be mindful the time tonight just like like I said next week you know is July 4th I don't know if everybody heard it but we'll try to be short next week so the kids can see the the fireworks Lord willing we'll try to be a little shorter and so see if you want I can preach longer the next Sunday so if I shorten Wednesday I can just go a little longer wait if that upsets anybody it's ok with me I'm ok you know it's like with Mother's Day and Father's Day you know I'm okay with that but we'll see we'll see how it goes so I listen to the rest of this read through the rest of the sermon this morning as we're us preparing so brother Brandon gives us a little more information on the cherubims and how they guard God's throne so we'll look at these remaining thoughts here and I'll try to be mindful of time by the grace of God so remember again brother Branham cause these four beasts or living creatures rather he calls them throne guards because they're guarding the throne in heaven and we know if there is directions in heaven if there is they would be moving from east to west because that's the same direction they move when they would approach the Holies of Holies and as the Moses or Solomon or even David David had a temporary tabernacle in Jerusalem as well not as great of course as Solomon's but temporary and so bro Graham said guarding this gate he said Cain and Abel came up here to worship so now bro Bram talks about the gate and the how the there was a altar on earth and days of Cain and Abel so it must have been that they guard so when Cain and Abel came to worship there must have been an altar there must have been a throne is that right these cherubims and another thing notice here's another evidence Cain went out Cain went out from the presence of Lord from the gate at the garden so the presence the Lord must have been at the altar and the altar was at the gate and brother madam says glory it's God's dwelling place at his altar now Cain went out from the presence of the Lord from this place you want to put it down it's Genesis 4:16 so remember when Adam and Eve were kicked out there was still a gate and there were still cherubims guarding the gate to the way of the Tree of Life while Cain and Abel must have been when they made their altar they must have approached coming from the east heading west they must have approached the throne of God amen which would have been an altar where there would have been cherubims the program tells us this so this is kind of the most modest picture I could find I'm sorry about the there showing off a little bit of skin there I hope that won't cause any sisters of stumble if so let me know I won't use it next time so here is a skis coming West they're facing the west because they're coming from the east and they're coming in the Friends of God so there must have been the cherubims or maybe at that point perhaps but must've been a gate and must been the Tree of Life brother Branham tells us so we see again another example of there's throne guards guarding the way back to the Tree of Life amen buh-bam tells us that and so next and remember so remember they were in the east they had to go through the eastern gate and they're heading west to the holiest of holies so again adamant I'm sorry Cain and Abel Adam and Eve anyone who was approaching this gate this eastern gate where the cherubims were they would have been coming the same direction it was a place of worship how many glad that you have a place of worship today praise God you don't have to go to a physical Church although we do worship here Church our authors in our heart amen and everywhere we go we can worship Jesus everywhere we go amen you can have an altar on your job altering your home you have an altar and giant eagle you can have an altar wherever you want to list up the Lord amen because it's a it's changed now now it's in the heart of man amen now by medicine Moses take it up into heaven take it up from the earth and having an assault the altar of God is that right each I'm trying to prove my point here y'all you know what I'm trying to do don't you he went through the presence of God he descended and when he descended from the presence of God God told Moses make everything on earth as pattern after heaven is that right now when he did when he made the Ark of the Covenant he put two Chairman's to guard the ark see what it is it was the altar the throne guards so now wrote em says there's two more guards as well the two chairman's he said mold them out of brass and put their wings touching like this because that's exactly what he saw in heaven that's exactly what John saw in heaven these four cherubims on the four sides of the Ark of the throne in heaven they were the guards of the Ark cherubims guards at the mercy seat now I'm not sure why Moses saw only two by the throne but John saw four I don't I looked in some quotes I didn't find the revelation so if you know it tell me after service I like to hear but the main point brother Rams making is that there are throne guards wherever God's throne is there's a guard to the throne that's the point brother bands making here now you remember the Bible said thou shalt make two cherubims of gold beaten work shalt thou make them in the two ends of the mercy seat and make one cherub on one end and the other cherub on the other even the mercy seat how you make the chair bones on the two ends thereof and the cherubim shalt stretch forth their wings on high covering the mercy seat with their wings and their faces shall look one to another toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be and now shall put the mercy seat above upon the ark and in the ark thou shall put the testimony that I shall give thee I love this and there will I meet with thee and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubim which are upon the Ark of the testimony of all things which I give thee in the commandment unto the children of Israel praise God so God was saying I'm going to meet you between the two cherubs amen and again brother am says he has thrown guards now what's interesting is in the holiest there was thrown guards but remember outside the tabernacle the tribes were thrown guards as well that's interesting I don't know what the revelation is behind that but God had two sets of thrown guards he's gonna preach it later and he's gonna share this as well the the the tribes were four guards and then when he got into the holiest of Holies Aaron or the high priests brother Aaron he had throw cards there as well and God said that's the place I'm going to commune with you is under the blood I'm sorry above the blood amen that's where I'll talk with you I'm gonna meet with you in one place and that's where the blood of the Lamb is shipped amen aren't you glad you can worship under the blood of Jesus tonight amen not a natural lamb but as a lamb that was in the Lamb of God in heaven he was natural but now he sits on the throne of God with a glorified body amen hallelujah and there he is sprinkling the blood and there's the guards to the throne where the RAM tells us now he says this now they guard the mercy seat when God is initially kind of glory where was a shiner she kind of glory at the mercy sees that right they guard that Shekinah glory he said woo listen friends then it goes to show that every scallywag can't come there and take of that he says you've got to be prepared before you come into the presence of it let me believe that so just like Aaron here had to be prepared he had to be washed he had to be clothed he had to have the blood the people had to be forgiven that before you had to be prepared he had to go through all the preparations buh-bam says that's how we are with God and so I'm going to extend we're halfway through the year so I'm going to cordially invite everybody to come pray 30 minutes before services because I invited everybody back in January I'm inviting everybody again if you want to come I believe it's the best way for us to be prepared to come into the presence of God let me believe that but it takes a sacrifice it takes time to learn my family's been doing it for eight months now it took a little struggle we got it good for Sunday but I'm still working on it for Wednesday because there's just so much pressure in the week and I've got overcome that and I'm quoting it and I'm quoting that my prayer closet I'm quoting this in my prayer closet I'm returning to my first love that's what I'm quoting I quoted this morning my prayer closet I'm returning and God's going to help me return all the way amen so remember I preached this before but we have three witnesses that we should pray before we hear the preaching or the say at the Lord during the preaching service it's Joshua 6x is 27 and mark 11 let's go through them remember when they when they were surrounding Jericho the Bible said it came to pass when Joshua spoken the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on before the Lord everybody knows that the message the worship comes before the preaching right and they blew with the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant Lord found them but a lot of people don't know this verse 9 and the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets most people don't know that right and the reward came after the ark and the priests going on and blowing with the trumpet so most people know this most people know the priests with the horns went before the ark but a lot of people don't know before the priests the Bible said you had armed men that had armor are you with me church amen that word armor don't forget that word armor because the Bible said we put on the hole and once you have the armor on what do you do oh the whole time you're praying always with all prayer and there's the six pieces I told you remember six is a good number when you're a Christian one two three four five six there are six pieces you put them all on and then someone who's fully armored with the sword of the Spirit and the shield of faith they're ready to pray all the time amen that's what I'm saying there's a witness in the Bible that our men we're ready to fight they have the armor of God on they go before this the singing which is the prayer the prayer before the service which can be done in your home or here but I'm inviting everybody that's thought we can do it here if we want to by God's grace I know if it encourages me when I see people here on their face and praying and crying out to God reading their Bibles before service don't you love that Amen when people are being prepared for thus saith the Lord I think that's beautiful but with something we all got to grow into we got to grow into that now here's the second witness the Bible said and thou shalt command the children of Israel that they bring the pure olive oil beaten for the light to cause the lamp to burn always in the tabernacle of the congregation without the veil which is before the testimony Aaron and his sons shall order from evening to morning before the Lord it shall be a statute forever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel so the lamp only burned if the people brought beaten oil from their homes how many believe that Amen the ministers the priests couldn't do any work they couldn't have any light in the holy place unless the people brought the oil with them to church amen and you Eve I've got to do it my wife's got to do we've all gotta do we've all got to pray before church and bring in anointing with us to church it's scriptural no light from the seven churches let me say this the Holy Ghost light for Laodicea won't shine here unless we bring the oil right because the oils for the light for the candlesticks so the Holy Ghost anointing for the bride of Jesus Christ living in Laodicea they need to bring oil if the priests are going to work with that oil and produce light amen oh it's so true you know it you know it the more times you come prayed up before service the better service is amen hallelujah and then you add fasting with that it gets even better but that's grace but we know we have to be led into that as well now this is a newest one to me and they brought the Colt to Jesus this was on the Sunday before the crucifixion here good no sorry a Palm Sunday and they brought the cult of Jesus and cast their garments on him and he sat on him and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches of the trees and strawed them in the way and they went beef and they that went before and they the followed cried saying Hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord this is just like Jericho you have people worshiping falling down worshiping shouting praising worshiping before the Ark Jesus Christ was the Ark amen and so you have people worshiping before falling down and putting their palms putting their palms on the ground right putting their palms on the ground praying before service are you with me you can see all these types in the Bible though prayer and worship and the palms and the sacrifice always goes before the anointed word all we need to be a church is dedicated to prayer amen and I said this before that's one thing I feel like our church can learn if that if we're not learning anything else which we should be but if we're not that's one thing we should be able to learn is to pray more to pray more before service amen so see we have to be prepared for the prints of the Lord it's all through you know Joshua it's all through it's all through the scripture Moses bring down to Jesus day you always have to have worship and praise and preparation before getting in the presence of God glory now I want to bring this out to you just to encourage us look at byron says how many ever sigh and cry for the abominations done in Akron or your family or your friends he said the sign cry for the abominations that's in the city where mother said where do you see that now suppose I know Naomi's visit other churches lately I spent a while since I visited a church but think about the last time you visit a church did you see anybody sighing and crying for the abominations brother Branham hadn't for a while so he said where do you see that because memorize Eko 9 says it those who are sighing and crying for the dominations are the ones who won't get slayed but RAM said I can show you 10,000 people that speak in tongues and to one ten thousand to one that that's really burdened for sin don't get me wrong we should be burdened for gifts I'm burdened for gifts I'm burdened for more of the Holy Ghost that's part of the reason why I come to pray you know before service but look brother I'm saying here that can't even pray an hour but did you know the Bible said to mark only those who side and cry for the abominations of the city how am I never read it sure that was the Holy Spirit come forth to mark the people and said the destroying angel go forth and destroy everything that doesn't have the mark upon them and the MA of God is the Holy Ghost is the seal of God now I love this now where is them people that's that interested how many people are that interested brother have said to come and pray and sigh and cry for the evil that's done in this nation the evil has done in this city the evil has done in our families so see sometimes Church we just love how the Lord is just directing us back to what's most important what's most important is sighing and crying for the abominations being burdened for sin and asking God to deliver because he that wins Souls is wise that's what the Bible says and that's the point I just want to linger on a little bit you know we and I've seen this before I've gone to special meetings you know and and people are getting saved and baptized but I wonder you know if you go back in a few years I wonder how many of those people that got saved and baptized that the special meetings or the Easter meetings or or whatever meetings a family camps whatever they are I wonder how many of them really haven't experienced with Jesus that they love Jesus so much that they continue to pray before all their services in their home church and because they're so interested in God and when seeing God save somebody who's that interested that's what mother I'm saying here who is that interested that we have to be prepared to come in the presence of God and I preached on this over and over but it's another reminder for us we need we all need reminders can you say Amen we all need reminders but man says I can show you people that jump up and down and cry in the church I can show you people that shout and run all over the building I can show you people that prophesy and it comes to pass I can show you those who speak in tongues and run up and down the buildings and say things that actually interpret and it comes to pass but where is that person that sighs and cries for the abominations that's did in the city where is that burden soul you could turn some new leaves on that see what I mean in that powerful where's the people that are that interested in coming in the presence of God that they'll come in they'll sigh and cry and they'll they'll say god save sinners Oh God just hate the seed like I said earlier abortion abortion just breaks my heart and and homosexuality breaks my heart I just want to see people delivered from that see that's the kind of desire that we all need a men and I believe it's in each one of us but we got a stirred up we got to refresh it by God's grace we got to bring it back to the the surface of our lives because that's what a real Christian desires that's what he's interested in and then when I was talking about gifts in the church and he said then you brethren should be just and the key word I'm looking at here is interested you brethren should be just interested in getting your ministry in the place in the house of God as the pastor isn't getting his because it's just essential that you do it so preparation for church shows how interested we are in it we've got to become more interested in the Word of God we got to be more interested in getting the oil to church bringing the oil getting finding our place what's my position in the church or what can I do in the church that's what we should be very interested in about is if I understand I say all that with love of God in my heart I know I got to just keep repeating it because just the vision number the vision of our church is the restoration of the original church and the original church got together every day they prayed they had miracles they had communion all the time they were always together that's the vision ax2 is the vision of where we're going we're going back to that before we go up that's the prophecy we're going back to that remember that original church will be restored he said it's the saying the Lord but she won't stop there Pentecost because she'll take a rapture after that amen but we the church has got to go back to the beginning and I know it may be a vision I know the rapture may be 10 years off maybe 5 maybe 20 maybe 30 maybe 40 I don't know how many years the rapture is off but I know the vision that we have is to become more like the book of Acts amen and that church that's fully restored we'll take a rapture that's exactly the scripture that's and Bob Arum said thats thus saith the LORD that is I preached on that numerous times so you know that examples of the throne guards so now if other Branham has given us six examples of throne guards the cherubims at the Tree of Life when Adam and Eve got kicked out Cain and Abel at their altars or Thrones it was the same gate where Adam and Eve got kicked out the two cherubs at the ark in the days of Moses and the the Ark of the Covenant the four sets of tribes around the Ark we'll look at that again tonight that's kind of the next thought we're gonna look at the four living creatures that John saw and then the four cherubims that Ezekiel saw so can everybody see this is a true teaching all the way down through the Bible God always protects his word and at the end of this service I believe you understand why he's got to protect his word I'm trusting by the grace of God so but I am reviewed the mercy seat is in the heart now we know the mercy seat is there's a mercy seat in heaven we know that but God wants to work on mercy seats on the hearts of the people in other words God wants to save all this children that's that's the hour we're living in right now our hearts our souls our representations of the throne of God and that's the throne God's working out right now trying to sit upon the throne of every heart of every believer amen but I said now the mercy seat the mercy seats in the heart the seat where the shining forth of his glory and all his children amen the Shekinah glory in the human heart here's the human heart is that right is that the mercy seat how do you come through into that through these different systems through self will self will comes into here and there through there comes out what she kind of glory what is she kind of glory is God's presence and when a man's walking or woman's walking he's reflecting this should kind of glory so one of the goodest thought program again here's the ears there's the Holy Place heading in the holiest of all ways I added this that's that you can tell the words are different the font is different on these all the other ones were you know from the picture I borrowed online but the veil above them keeps saying this veil is yourself will and brother have said this throne is on each one of our hearts and we've got to come through the we got let God come through the veil of our self will we have to let God tear our will right we got to say not my will but thy will be done and then when we say God take all my life and there are the veil of ourselves every and every day we got to keep doing it right we got to do it to forgot to get into the baptism Holy Ghost and every day we got to die daily and haven't be a living sacrifice unto Jesus so by me I'm saying again the veil is self-will if we want to live from here if we want to see Christ more in our lives we've got to make sure this veil is rent and we got to make sure that it's not all well being done but we're doing what Christ wants us to do Laurie just thought I'd review that that's a good thought I love that thought so beau graham says when you really got the veil rent he said you don't go into gambling dens you don't carry on and go out there and deny the word so he thought so see when you've really gone beyond the veil you don't deny the word in your daily life every day in your life you acknowledge the word you do the word you'll read the word that proves the veil this the veil of self-will has been rent and God's will is being done and you're walking in the Shekinah glory of God oh yes he said no matter what people says he's got his heart set on one thing God amen and if he's truly caught of God then Jesus Christ reflects himself through him with the Shekinah glory doing the same things he did back there manifest the same gospel preaching the same word saying we're being made manifest and the same measure was then just like it was at Pentecost it's measured back again oh my oh thank you Jesus amen now brother Aaron breaks in this thought of Israel camp with four throne guards he gets into a more detailed no doubt most of you have heard this before but bear with me I think it gets it gets better I think by God's grace program so once you notice this is beautiful he says oh my let me get over here and skip some minister I can get down to this get your pencils now he says maybe I better make that a little smaller now Israel in their journey when they can't watch us they can't one two three four and he's counting on the blackboard behind him now on the east side I'll put it down east the east side was always Judah the gate Judah Judah was the head of three tribes with the banner on the west side he says was Ephraim three tribes within Efram on the south side was Ruben three tribes and their banner on the north side was Dan Dan with three tribes and three tribes and their banner now here's where the Bible says it in numbers two verse three on the east side was the camp of Judah so this is all scriptural and there's a point I'm going through this I'm not doing this to be smart I'm doing this to show you this is why the Holy Ghost came to put himself on the wall in the seven the seven shadows of the church ages because it was proving brother Branham was a word based prophet that's why I'm doing this so you know whether man was even rushing to try to get through this service but the Holy Ghost was in no rush he knew he was going to come amen now I'll tell you like this the people weren't in any rush or either and I'll show you some quotes on that the people they're like okay they're like preach about man they said one one guy yelled out said preach all day preach all day now off the way if I hear that any time soon I'll have to keep my ears open if I say can I go a few more minutes I want to hear some brother sister shout preach all night brother yes oh my maybe we'll grow into that too on the left side should be the standard of the camp of Ephraim on the south side will be the camp of Reuben this is all scripture huh that's why I'm taking time to show because I want you to know he was a word brace prophet on the standard the camp of Dan shall be on the north side now I love this picture again this is to me the most beautiful picture because I see God looking down of course that's men but God is higher than those men and God is looking down and he's seeing across traveling and he's taking that cross and that cross is symbolizing Redemption wherever that cross goes there's blessing amen just like today wherever the blood of Jesus Christ flows into there's blessings for those people amen and he looks down from heaven and there's my there's my Redemption there's my group of believers there's a little bride there's that little cross and Akron amen where they've got the Ark there they've got the throne there they've got the word there and I've got my angels there as well amen I've got my throne guards guarding the Lord that's being preached accurate amen God always guards his word that's a beautiful picture remember even a man that went to hell Balaam was up there and said all that's beautiful you're beautiful like a unicorn a star arise out of Jacob even a man who went to hell couldn't deny the beauty of God's artistic ability right here to draw a cross in the wilderness only man God is so great amen brother Anderson now what was then dan was the eagle now we got to prove he's by the Bible this is Dan is the only challenging one really to prove by the Bible that Dan represents eagle because when jacob bless him jacob said you're gonna crawl around like a snake i remember that and so a lot like believe the sign attacks brother branham and they say all see you know the Bible said Dan was a snake he's not an eagle but you got to dig a little deeper than that you got to dig a little deeper in the scripture for that and history because every Jewish encyclopedia other thing I looked at two or three today every Jewish encyclopedia I read said that Dan had the standard of an eagle not a serpent you think God's church would have marched around like just just with the serpent now they did watch her on with a serpent on a pole but that represented that sin was already judged and that they were forgiven amen that sin was crucified hallelujah you know sins been crucified amen thanks to the old rugged cross hallelujah amen now I found this online and there's the website it was I thank God for that website because I was really having a hard time finding that Dan representative evil but I like what the Jewish website said in relation to the Eagle being associated with the tribe of Dan we note that Dan means judge that's a good idea right there that's beautiful Jacob said your judge that's not the mother of Dan when she when he was born ember she said God has judged me remember that might have been Leah or Bildad I came right which one us he said God has judged me and given me a son so dan means judge and the symbolism of an eagle is often connected with judgment that is beautiful right there so if you got your Bibles I don't have the scripture here let's turn your I was there let's go to the one in I read a couple today that were pretty easy to understand let's go to Deuteronomy 28 49 we'll try that one it was really easy to understand how an eagle represents judgment Deuteronomy 28 49 so I appreciate the wisdom that's why the Internet can be a blessing I'll tell you it sure can be a curse but it can sure be an awesome blessing as well 28 49 it says this the Bible says it's 28 ports are one page way yeah here it is the Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far from the end of the earth as Swift as the Eagle fly ahthe a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand of course who is he speaking of Babylon amen and God is warning Israel but Moses warning Israel before it even happens you're gonna get in the Promised Land but then you're gonna fall away and then God is gonna send Babylon as a eagle to judge you and then scatter you around all the world some would go down to Babylon some go to Syria some would be spread even further than that all right go to Jeremiah 4:13 now those are the two I thought would be a help to you to see how an eagle represents judgment and the named Dan does mean judge Jeremiah 4:13 all right behold he shall come up as clouds in his chariot shall be as a whirlwind his horses are swifter than Eagles woe unto us for we are spoiled o Jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved amen wow what a beautiful portion of Scripture remember Jeremiah was one of the last prophets that was warning Israel before the northern Earth's are the southern kingdom was completely taken in captivity so you could go through other scriptures but those are the only two I want to hit and so I believe you have enough Bible evidence because you have Genesis 49 Dan's the judge and you have all these scriptures that prove Eagles are associated with judgment I believe you can place Dan's banner as an eagle and the church said but you will not find I challenge you look it up you will not find a scripture that says Dan is a eagle you won't find that but you have to put it together with all the other scriptures then you find it alright next program said Reuben was the man now why was he was the man he was the firstborn of Jacob he was the strength but like water he went up on the couch and defiled my couch in other words he lived with his father's concubine see that's the morals of a human being the animal don't have their morals the lion none of these things has that but the man does run with the next man's wife and so forth just the same thing everything is completed so Reuben represents a man because of his immorality because the but this is where the bible quotes Reuben thou art my firstborn this is Jacob speaking I'm skipping down unstable has water thou shall not Excel because that when is up to thy father's bed then then defiles thou it so he represents man so man isn't so low he would defile his own father's concubine so that's why Reuben represents man Judah represents line this is the easiest one to see joke have said Jacob said Judah is a lion's whelp and then all the Jewish historians say yes Reuben was a man Dan was a eagle and then Judah is a lion so that's their flag is the line it's all through the scripture Ephraim he says is the ox now this is beautiful Moses is speaking about Joseph about Joseph's yeah his yeah his prophecy about him he said his glory the tribe of Joseph rather his glory is like the first thing I was Bullock and his horns are like the horns of unicorns with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim and they are the thousands of Manasseh because who were Joseph's sons Ephraim and Manasseh and so Joseph has a connection to the Bullock right and so his son who got the blessing Manasseh Ephraim Manasseh I'm sorry Ephraim was the oldest right he was doing but Manasseh got the blessing but eat from here was the one that spoken of he was the one that was lead the other three tribes and so there's a connection with Ephraim from the ox or the Bullock it's also called the calf in the New Testament does anybody understand hope you can see that so now we have scripture so you know if you ever talk to anybody about that you can say it's actually it's fully in the Bible you can teach this straight from the Bible so there's you know just like a picture I found on a Jewish web site I liked it you know you have Dan you have Reuben you have Ephraim and you have Judah and they're still like that today the original tribes but BAM said just exactly the tribes of Israel camped around guarding their earthly guards of the right to the ark don't you see it he said mercy see nothing come here anywhere around it without crossing those tribes crossing what the lion crossing the man the intelligence of the man crossing the work horse as an ox or crossing the eagle the swiftness of it see the heaven the earth in between and all around you you see they were guards and above it was the pillar of fire hey boy think about that if Satan won to try to attack the camp of God he's got to get through a lion he's got to get through an ox he's got to get through a man or any enemy you name it though the Canaanites the Philistines you name it to get to God's presence God always protected it with powers and thank god we've got the power of the flying eagle today amen its power and that's the power that's protecting us amen is the Holy Ghost power amen that's right God always protects his word so I'm just adding to the picture so I covered up the man over here just so you can see it again so there's there's Dan the north there's Ephraim the west there's Reuben the south and there's Judah in the east does that help by God's grace it's just simple you know you can find these on you know a Google search and everything like that I just thought it might be handy to see it like that now this is one that the brother from the Philippines he's a real good preacher pastor he's a missionary brother Ron malabo I mean I follow him on Facebook but this is a picture he made I like it you know but it just shows how there's the four anointings those four anointings around the throne I don't know if that's the right picture like I said but there are thundering and lightnings and there's a rainbow round about the throne member because the half has not been told there's the seven candlesticks there's it's four and twenty elders so just another idea showing you that there's a connection between these four different anointings and the throne of God amen now at this point brother man is preaching he says these words he says now brother now here's a brand new one brother listen to this then we'll go anybody ready for a brand new one no it's probably not brand new to you but if you haven't heard in a while it'll feel like new okay and there's a great there's great understanding in this too he says here's a brand new one brother listen to this he says I was sitting the other day and I saw this and I just jumped up and run around and around and around the chair saying glory to glory glory glory around and around he said Charlie Hayek worse than I do up in the woods sometimes sister Nellie if I'd act like that you'd run me out of your house pretty quick he said I just had a glorious time now watch whether it was what the Lord did so the Lord did something and Lord showed him a revelation so the revelation the brand-new revelation that God showed brother Branham was that the book of Acts is a type of the holiest of Holies how many heard that before that's the brand I was a brand new revelation in 1961 I never heard brother had preached it before that so it seems really like it definitely was he said after Pentecost they wrote a book of what acts of the Holy Ghost he's that right what does the Acts start off with the first thing to enter into salvation acts 2:38 here's the last one around what is it they was filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues and Peter stood up and preached them a sermon they said what can we do how are we going to get that and he said acts 2:38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ that Scripture was so important to me when I first heard it I in the old days before we had smartphones I had those little voice recorders member those voice recorder machines you put a little tape in and there was like little plastic tape I was so fired up when I heard acts 2:38 I had my little tape recorder you know my to-do list and I would drive in the car and I'd play it acts 2:38 and Peter saith unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I was just list that over and over and over because it meant so much to me and now I understand why it meant so much to me it was the way to God amen it is still the way to God today it's the only way to God today amen it is the hoist of Holy's for the bride today ha ha hey man I never knew why it meant so much hallelujah but now I know he said now remember God has got some guards for that mercy seat so if ax is the holiest of holies then God has four guards around it he says Matthew on the east Luke Mark and John all their four Gospels vindicate the book of acts to come they guard it anywhere you want to look at it he said just take one he said I got twenty or thirty wrote down here but let's take one on the subject of salvation I'm gonna have time to pray no it's one o'clock now they do have time to pray later so I guess we won't have it unless you want to pray for the sick now program said I just got plenty of time see a brother says take all day I think they started church at 10:30 if I'm not mistaken now the reason I think that is because the Bible believers church why we used to go to brother Tom Browns Church him and he used to go to brother Branham Church they started at 10:30 so I think Branham Tabernacle you should start at 10:30 so let's say they did 10:30 11:30 12:30 1:00 so it's already a two and a half hour service and they were still an hour left to preach this would have been at least a three and a half or four hour service but look the people after two and a half hours they're still crying out take older brother rhythm now what if we were at 9:30 tonight we're at 8:20 right now what if at 9:30 tonight say can I take a few more minutes and you said take all night brother Jess you see I'm just trying to show you like how much they were enjoying the word and that's what we want to do we want to enjoy the word now we don't know where people out we don't want to make people upset but if the Holy Ghost wants to go a little longer we be flexible with that you see but I just want to show you and notice this is the pole for the Christ the word this is so important because later the Holy Ghost shows up not just by somebody feeling it but they saw it they literally saw the Holy Ghost they saw the pillar of fire and this is the kind of attitude they had when he came take all day preach all you what we're just here to hear God's Word I think you know it makes me happy Church because I believe God has taken us back to that as no matter I don't even look at numbers I don't care how small we are no matter but I believe God is going to keep making us love the word so much more that we're going to fall more in love with Christ as time goes on our battles will get harder but God will raise up a standard against it amen because that's the prophecy in the hour and we've got to fulfill the Word of God but RAM said we don't have time to pray but they actually do pray for the sick so by Ram was saying this and now I would look at Scofield this was the revelation I found that the Holy Spirit does represent lion mark does represent ox Luke represents the man and John represents the eagle the Holy Spirit showed me this years ago because I used to study the Scofield Bible so much and then when I heard this sermon I'm like yeah that's right I did read that a few months or whatever it was it was really striking the Holy Ghost revealed this to me now look look what Scofield said now Mathew represents lying because Scofield said the focus of Mathew is on how he's the king of Israel and he came out of that king of Dave his lineage look what Scofield wrote now don't tell me you can't tell me that Rembrandt wasn't a prophet after this after reading this this should be another proof that he was a genuine prophet because this man lived way before a brother random now look what he says he said this connects he's taught you to has a theme of the book of Matthew he said this Matthew's the book of generation of Jesus Christ the Son of David the son of Abraham this connects him at once with two of the most important of the Old Testament covenants the Davidic given a covenant of kingship there's King and the Abrahamic covenant of promise of Jesus Christ in the twofold character than Matthew writes filing the order indicating the first verse he writes first of the king the son of David so this book starts off with showing the Dini ology of the King of Kings the Lord of lords amen but it shows his genealogy back to the king of David amen King David but the prominent character of Christ and Matthew is that of the covenant of King amen look what Scofield says about mark this is beautiful and I I just I was rejoicing over this this is powerful right here but let's get hold on to that in the book of Mark Jesus is seen as the mighty worker rather than the unique teacher he's the Jehovah's servant the branch everywhere the servant character of the Incarnate son is manifest the key verse is mark 10:45 for even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister the characteristic word is straightway because that's a servant's word in other words you do it right now you tell a servant do it right now get on that right you tell your children do it right now immediately do it right now you don't tell you don't tell your husband and wife that honey make me those steak and eggs right now you shouldn't act like that right that's what you that's how you talk to a servant straightway Jesus straightway to their straight way to that now this is the verse this is the idea I love there's no genealogy of Jesus in mark 4 who gives the genealogy of a servant if that ain't inspired Holy Ghost thought I don't know what is amen proving that mark is the Scriptures the the gospel of the ox who cares who is where a servant came from he's just a servant oh my the distinctive character of Christ in mark is set forth in a Philippians sweetie he came in the form of a servant but this lowly emptied himself and became a form of God amen beautiful that's the most inspired one to me I think now look in the Luke Scofield says this in Luke he is the gospel of the human divine one but John is divine human one right the key phrase is the Son of Man so the Son of Man is expressed over and over in the Book of Luke and this book demonstrates how entirely human Jesus was his genealogy is traced to Adam the first human amen and then this this is the only book of the Gospels that shows what he was like as a child the only one because it shows his human side the Amen his infancy and boyhood when he up to twelve years old so Luke is the book of his human side or the man anointing oh my and John represents the ego because the Eagles happen to heavenlies and John starts off with in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God it doesn't stay on the starts by starting in the heavenlies amen where Eagles rule right they ruled the sky hallelujah and this book starts in the heavenlies and shows he's the I am come down to hit from from heaven down to earth he's the incarnation of the Eternal Word the Sun of life honey believe Schofield had some inspiration he sure did now of course he believed in the Trinity so don't don't believe everything he said now let's update this a little bit so Luke is the man the line is Matthew the Ox is Mark and John is the ego did everyone understand that hey brother man said the holiest of holies is the book of Acts does that make sense everybody got that he said that was a brand new one in 1961 brand new one now bro Graham says let's take just one now this subject for salvation and remember the earthly number for the four Gospels so that's these let's see if these four Gospels are deliverers of the Word of God so if there's an attack on on the prends of God if there's an attack on the life of God the throne of God then God has to have protectors all around him he actually does now here's what brother branham preaches program preaches us I just did it my own illustration for you brother branham said let's take the subject of salvation through acts 2:38 that is the life of God how many know that's the life of God brother him said if the disciples had a Creed it was acts 2:38 if it had a credo we believe statement it was acts 2:38 oh they have said that's the only way to salvation is acts 2:38 and he said if that's true then all four Gospels will guard that truth amen and Motum gives us three scriptures now he doesn't go to John but we could go to John and we could show scriptures in John about baptism in the name of Jesus I know we can show scriptures here and we can show scriptures there about Jesus said he that believes in his baptized shall be saved that's right and the scripture here is you know repentance and remission should be preached in his name as a witness to every nation amen how to think of one on John I can't think of one right now but think you understand what I'm saying this Matthew does the book of Matthew protect that salvation comes through acts 2:38 in the book of Acts does it protect it now so Bertram's question is do all four Gospels support or guard the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost through acts 2:38 well the answer is yes that is so see the Gospels do not support a Trinitarian approach to God so see the the Trinitarians put Matthew 28:19 in there but you can't that's not the life of the church the life of the church was the book of Acts Amen brother Branham says it in this sermon - he said the preachers say that you know Acts is the framework and the Gospels are are the real core and bro-down said no but after the Gospels are the framework and the book of Acts is the life of God hey man what's eternity is put act on Matthew 28:19 there but that's not the life the life was in the church but life isn't the church today amen it's still a New Testament church we're under the blood of Jesus Christ amen it is the New Testament so now let's show how brother and improve this brother Brahim said now Matthew 28:19 28:19 he said now that's where you Trinitarian brethren are going and then he reads the scripture he said but here comes around Pentecost and Peter said repent me baptize the name of Jesus he said something's wrong here he says Matthew are you that eastern gate guard so he starts talking to the guards Matthew are you guarding the eastern gate and brother Aaron said how's the gate where's the gate and the Bible said in Matthew 7 Strait is the gate and how is it spelled str AIT Strait means water water is the gate Amen how do you come in repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that unlocks the gates amen so see that's that's what we're saying here that's that scripture right there Strait is the gate narrows the way and it's the strait is the gate strait is the waterway you've got to come through the water and the water that they talked about here was through baptism in jesus christ's name that unlocks the gate to get to acts 2:38 amen hallelujah can you see it now hope it makes sense now but I God's grace in other words every doctrine we hold if we are the true Church of the Living God every doctor we hold can be supported by all the four Gospels in other words everything we believe will not be contradicted in any of the Gospels how many appreciate that God set it up God set it up so the book of Acts was the life the holiest of holies for today is the baptismal ghost and the framework of the guards around it are the four Gospels amen glory so that's what brother Branham teaches us he says so that unlocks the gates when you come through Matthew oh I'm reading Matthew 7 Strait is the gate oh I got to be baptized not sprinkle baptize that will unlock the gate get to the holiest Amen Larry to get to the book of Acts here's another one oh but brother Brandon you got Matthew 28:19 down there on your on your chart but man said that's exactly right but Matthew are you guarding it he said sure I'm the full guard so did you catch that brother branham on the chalkboard drew this he drew baptize them in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost he drew that on the board and said that scripture protects acts 2:38 you and I are not scared of extra Matthew 28:19 that doesn't make me shake in the boots when people say that I say yeah read it the way it says it says baptized in the name there's one name to the father son Holy Ghost it's a guard protecting the fact that everybody was baptized by one name in the book of Acts amen it's guarding it acts up sir Matthew 28:19 guards the truth that we find in the book of Acts glory I know simple but that's the truth and this is the new revelation brother Graham gave out 1961 so see he said now get Matthew 1:18 now I didn't write down Matthew 1:18 but you know it was when Gabriel visited Joseph and told him take a name in his name will be called the Messiah Emmanuel and call his name Jesus amen so you go back there the name of the son is Jesus you have to come by the straight water gate the way of baptism and there's one name to the father son in the name of the son is Jesus there's one name to the father only ghost you get to the book of Acts and they always baptized the name of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus our Lord you put them all together it's one name the Lord Jesus Christ amen they're all protected by the grace of God all the acts scriptures are protected by the Gospels amen aren't you glad Church oh I love that don't you hallelujah we're been said does he garden does Matthew garden or not he said yes it's just this so this is the thought title to that one name fathers a title sons a title Holy Ghost is a title that's what I was telling that brother the at the hospital two weeks ago I said I'm a father son brother teacher pastor I got deacon trustee song leader of all these things I have all these titles but I got one name I signed my check with Jesse Smith they those are all titles and that's the revelation that guards the Prince of God the Prince of God is through the name the Lord Jesus Christ see here it is Matthew's a guard he guards it so Matthew 29:19 doesn't attack us it doesn't defeat us it actually protects us does it make us sad it makes us stronger and that's what I told the same guy - I said there you will not find any other scripture in the book of Acts or in the entire New Testament where anyone ever said father son Holy Ghost in one scripture ever again God gave that Jesus gave that one statement in order to reveal the mystery that there was one name to the father and Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ that's in that that's in Matthew 13 the Bible said he was going to come and reveal mysteries how we know that let's go there real quick we go to Matthew 13 let me find that there was prophecy that said Jesus Christ would reveal mystery and when Jesus said father and Holy Ghost he was revealing a mystery but sure let me pull it up there yeah Matthew 13 11 there it is well I'm sorry no that's not the one let me look again I thought the Bible said Jesus would speak to them in mysteries just a moment here well I'll have to look for that late I can't find that one right now I thought for sure it was prophesied that Jesus would speaking of them in the mysteries let me just look there my real Bible real quick here I was trying to find out on the concordance mystery I thought that was the word now this could be one time I could have to have to follow up with you on this one here I thought for sure said that oh there it is right there merci yeah this Matthew 13 you're right there I'm sorry I got the wrong word I got looking for the wrong word here it is it's Matthew 13 35 forgive me Church I knew it was in there I was get a little nervous there though like I thought it was mr. Matthew 13 35 now this proves it beyond a shadow of doubt look what it says here that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet saying I'll open my mouth in parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world amen the Bible said Jesus would utter secrets that were hidden from the foundation of the world and when he said Peter you baptized in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost ten days later Peter got the revelation that Jesus was the father son Holy Ghost although the Godhead bodily dwelt in Christ they meant all that God was was bought up in Christ and this was the secret that was kept from everyone to the foundation of the world and revealed in Matthew 28:19 matthew 28:9 19 doesn't attack us it helps us it guards us hallelujah well praise God and now programs switches subjects like I told you he didn't show Mark Luke or John with salvation or baptism he only didn't Mathew Branham says now I've got a whole bunch of other for salvation but take these others so he skips salvation and he skips to divine healing let's see if Matthew up here guards it for divine healing now you list all these scriptures now he said now there's John 14:12 John 15:7 he said mark 16 he said see if they're guarding divine healing around the throne of God oh this is beautiful he said let's run a few of them and see if they guard see if guard the right to divine healing the same as they guard the gate for Jesus's name baptism amen to see every every apostolic truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ is protected by Jesus's guards his four Gospels his four throne guards protect everything that was going to continue in the book of Acts it was protected and preached and taught inside the Gospels amen now brother Graham said do you think that God don't put a guard around his work you think God just puts his word out there and doesn't guard it see you see that ox line man eagle it still isn't setting up these gates right here on earth right now so look it's right here on earth right now brother Graham says here's the Gospels the four Gospels and notice everywhere they went they went straight forward they don't contradict one another amen they stay with one another one goes with the shrewdness of a man the other one goes to the swiftest of an eagle the other one's a pastor at the auction one's an evangelist to fly like the evangelists and see the other ones like a pastor though other ones are sturdy the other ones a shrewd see guarded on every side got God guarding this holy ghost gospel believe it brother all right now one time can I just stop a moment one time brother Jose and I were talking some people have taken that quote and they've made these five they made them the five preaching offices but I said I don't know about this but you know some people said this is the apostle because they produce real life they produce new life in different cities the Ox I'm sorry the Ox yeah the Ox would have to be a pastor John would have to be the prophet because remember the highest office I know that offends people but the highest office is actually an apostle it's actually higher than a prophet I know some people don't like that but the Bible said first our apostles because they're scared you're hurting brother Brandon but we're not hurting brother branham you're helping brother Brandon by staying with the word ok now Matthew the King I'm not sure which of those is the king and then the man that must be teacher so that must be evangelist I don't know uh but see I couldn't never figure it out perfectly to make it fit but that's a thought some preachers have said because brother branham he says the axe is like the pastor so there's five of them which there's a fivefold ministry so just a little nugget for you I don't know maybe God will give us more revelation on later but I can see a lot of its rec and see all these true but you know seeing evangelist as a king I'm not sure about that you know I don't know interesting all right so I'm sorry let's stay on this one so for now we're at divine healing so now let's get off the fivefold ministry let's get out and divine healing but a man said the divine healing of the book of Acts is supported by all these scriptures in other words it's guarded by the entire four Gospels if God wants divine healing in the book of Acts he's got a guard it in Matthew Mark Luke and John and he does but man said see that guard sitting at the gate the gospel guard to back up the word of Acts that was wrote now let's go to John 14:12 and see if John's gonna back up and guard the precious things at Pentecost now let me just quote these this is the works he that believeth on me the works that I do should do also so this is the signs wonders and miracles right this is if you abide in me and by to my word ask what you want to be given unto you so more divine healing Matthew 10 that's where Jesus gives the disciples power over every unclean spirit divine healing same thing here power over divine healing these are parallel passages about the Apostles giving power given power by Jesus I don't remember that one mark 11 I don't remember that what I do remember that one that was when Jesus ascended and Jesus said he that believeth in me he said those speaking tongues that lay hands on the sick and they shall recover a head so see every one of the guards protects the Word of God for divine healing aren't you glad and you can turn to any book any book of the Apostles er need any book of the Gospels and you can find encouragement that God is your healer today how many thankful God's your healer just got to turn the Bible and we'll find it now I'm gonna skip that because I've already gone to our so program said see all four guard the book of Acts he says again and again and again now see this program said God's guards will stop the approach to God by the way the Methodist and Baptist Creed's right like a Baptist will say you just got to be baptized in water you already got the Holy Ghost that won't work God doesn't have guards to back that up that won't work because the Bible said you got to repent be baptized and be filled with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah he said boy the South gates guarded by the ox so he he just gives he just reads the scriptures that I showed you now in closing he said every generation must receive the sign of the Resurrection you talk about Jonah's resurrection the days of Jesus they had to receive a resurrection see the sign of the resurrection will be done in a wicked and doctors generation it was done in the book of Acts Jesus raised from the dead coming to Peter James John the Apostles and they did this book of Acts it wasn't the Acts of the Apostles it was the Acts of the Holy Ghost working in the Apostles it's not a man today now I hope never to get this here it's not a man today it's the Holy Ghost working through a man or men see brother Graham doesn't say it's all about me today it's just about the Holy Ghost anointing me and no one else he says no it's through men see that does the work it's not the man the man just the vessel see but the Holy Ghost is the oil that's in the vessel and look what they did look at the signs that they done for Jesus they had to take notice of them because they were ignorant learned Peter and John but that they noticed them that they been with Jesus they done the things that he did how many want to see the sign of the Resurrection more in your life oh I do I want to see more Living Christ in my life well we just got to be more devoted to Christ we got to pray more we got a love of God more read our Bibles more love each other more we've got to be more in love with the word all the time God is gonna bring his bride to that position so see that this doesn't discourage me this has encourages me because this is where God's taking us amen so you see every book in the Bible the four books the four Gospels guard the Pentecostal blessing we every scripture to back up exactly what they said and now the Acts of the Apostles vindicate today with the four Gospels that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever do you love him now he gives one more thought and let's stand to our feet here in a Santa Fe Malek I get that a remote ready for the TV because I'm gonna try to play this now brother Ram starts the prayer line after preaching three hours so if he preached at 11:00 it's our eleven twelve one two it have already been two o'clock in the afternoon brother brings one more thought he says the cherubims they're out here today trying to run people guard them to the throne trying to bring them through the gate back to the Tree of Life again that they might take of this the bread of life and then brother branham applies it to the sick did you know angels are here if you're sick did you know angels are trying to push you to the throne of God did you know that but Ram said in the book of Genesis they were trying to keep them out but brother Han said today the angels of God the anointing of God is trying to push you into his presence oh so what do we need up tonight whenever in need of if it's God's will God's Spirit is here to push us to that it might happen tonight next week next year it don't matter but God is pushing you there and if it's God's will you'll get there amen because that's what they're doing now they're push it's the angel no it's an eagle anointing pushing us I'll say like this lifting us up into heavenly places lifting us up with more faith more healing more deliverance more victory more love a whatever you need up God's Spirit is here to lift us up into that atmosphere and then oh I love a good rain shower amen and then church at the end of this recording three hours and three minutes into this recording after three weeks remember brother Ram preached the last two weeks of December all of the church ages and then he preaches the first week of 1961 about Revelation chapter 4 after three weeks God vindicates the church ages by sending the pillar of fire to back it up so let's listen this let's turn it up all the way maokai can you turn up all the way oops it's are you up all the way thank you sir now this might be mm so be prepared to turn it down now it's going to start off you're not going to hear these words at first you're going to hear a few words before that and then you're going to hear people screaming because they're seeing a pillar of fire so in other words Church this is what it sounds like when the Holy Ghost is in here too and the church said people will be screaming people will be shouting people are rejoicing or crying or glorifying God something's gonna happen to you because God's anointing you amen hey man just encourage us tonight God thought so much of all this Bible based teaching your the four Gospels the throne guards all these things the cherubims God thought so much of it he sent the Holy Ghost to do seven different shadows on the wall amen we know who he served tonight hear this yes it's gonna work tonight you're gonna hear the tape cut off and it's going to pick up right when the Holy Ghost is there okay cut it off right there did you hear everybody screaming like oh they actually saw the light changing colors they actually saw the shading it got brighter and then it made the exact same shapes of the seven moons the seven church ages and the Pete let's hear it again let's hear it again listen to this they're actually seeing it and brother man is all comfortable because he's used to it oh we should be used to the Holy Ghost amen sorry here it is whoo see that you see that so brother BAM he's in a prayer line in the bran tabernacle there's a woman here the lights over her but the reflection is on the wall and people are seeing the reflection of the church ages but the Holy Ghost is actually over the woman and brother rams all under control because he used to see in the pillar fire oh that's how I would it be hey men I'm used to seeing the power of God now he keeps going this is the same quote there's no break here sorry so see that the people cannot see the Holy Ghost over the woman the pillar of fire they could only see the reflection on the wall that's what brother BAM saying and now notice what does the Holy Ghost do when he gets there he starts discerning their hearts don't you love it when God speaks to you in a church service that lets you know that the Holy Ghost is here it's the same Holy Ghost not a different one it's the same Holy Ghost discerning the thoughts intents of our heart I'm not going to play the rest of it because you know it he actually says it there's a man out here along this line it struck him so the light went from her to him he's from Seymour Indiana he's had a stroke if you believe sir god I hear that stroke believe now look he just sees his name and calls him out the Holy Ghost move him oh don't you want the Holy Ghost to move here amen brother Branham said this the next week he said this he said we've had a constant revival on the outpouring of the Holy Ghost he said back at the tavern we've had one at the Tabernacle I had a series of subjects I was telling you on the seven last Church ages finish up last Sunday on the fourth chapter revelations my congregation was about 400 people or 350 something like that while I was speaking and it called the prayer line the speaking of the reflection from the Shekinah glory to the Stars to the sea of glass where the sacrifices was wash you know which represents sinners the water separation and while I was speaking on that then turned to pray for the sick the Ainge Lord came right down before them all went right over and stood in the corner here or there and 300 more people stood there looked at it for 15 minutes screaming and crying and praising God all of them look the first time I ever come like that before our church just come right in and moved right over there and stood there and you just had the privilege to hear it Amen let's get the Lord round of applause amen now I better stop right there it's almost 9 o'clock but the point I want to make behind that as all these truths that we learned about church this is not knowledge this is not just for knowledge this is to show us that God's Word is absolutely true and the message we've heard is thus saith the Lord and we can have confidence that the Holy Ghost Eagle anointing is here for you and I and that anointing is pushing us for more of the anointing are you with me Amen that's about our heads for where to prayer now how you come to the piano here by the grace of God let's just bow our heads as we think about this God is pushing us into his presence Oh God Church I don't know what to have need of tonight but why don't you pray for as we close this service here in prayer just believe with all your heart how many will try to do it believe with all your heart if the Holy Spirit spoke something to your heart tonight or discerned a need or discern the situation we should take that as God backing up his word God's showing his presence here tonight Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight we thank you for the word we thank you that you've indicated this word with one of the most supernatural experience perhaps ever in the last few centuries perhaps 2,000 years of your literal pillar of fire coming down in a church a humble little church it's shining your light upon a corner of the Branham Tavern in a humble church not the biggest church not the tallest Church one of the most humble churches as I've been to Jeffersonville you chose that little place Lord to come and shine your light and Lord may we understand the same is true tonight you've chosen us you've chosen us as mercy seats you've chosen our hearts as Thrones and you want to come and shine your life in our little Tabernacle this evening thank you Lord for your word here tonight Lord you saw the hands that went up I pray you shine on every tabernacle shine in every heart dear God may every person feel your presence and see you pushing them inviting them in to more of your presence O God as your prophet said we want to be prepared for your presence we just not know any condition can come into your presence we've got to be prepared and the preaching prepares us here God so lord I just pray every heart could receive your word for tonight dear God receive a prophet receive an anointing an encouragement you could raise each person up oh God higher than they were when they walked in it hey Jordan would you lift them a little higher tonight Lord God to know that we've got the very holiest of holies the book of Acts protected by all four Gospels our faith is protected by every gospel of Jesus Christ we thank you for that Lord God we feel your presence pushing us to believe to quote the word to stand on the word to trust the word to live the word to obey the word we feel your presence pushing us into that Oh God and we thank you for it oh God oh I know I'm returning to my first love I'm returning to Lord a closer walk with you Lord thank you Lord Jesus I feel the puddle for that Lord God hallelujah Lord if there's one who needs a big current for healing I pray they receive it tonight you need an encouragement for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I pray they'll receive it tonight dear God that's your word strengthen them Lord lift them up Oh God give them the encouragement they need tonight we know these scriptures aren't just for human knowledge or to puff us up but they're to keep us humble and remember that you've given us a fully protected a fully guarded gospel amen every promise is guarded your word has no contradictions amen every promise of yours is yeah amen in Christ Jesus and not one word will ever fail we thank you for that Lord tonight we give you glory Lord we worship you Father in Jesus Christ amen let's get Lord Rama father laid ahead thank you lord thank you lord oh my this isn't knowledge to me this is life to me this all points the one truth that Jesus Christ is here he's interested in us and he's trying to protect our lives he was trying to protect our church our church is surrounded by all these demon powers and drug addicts and all violence and everything like that and God's Word is protecting us tonight pushing us closer to Christ amen not further closer how many are interested in closer walk with God a man listing that seek you first the kingdom of God we're seeking that tonight we want a closer walk with Christ amen glory seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be like this one or we're seeking you first tonight we want you first in our lives first in our hearts first place the first thing on our mind [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen let's worship the Lord thank you lord we're seeking you asking not be feasting on the Word of God thank you Lord God I thought it was striking as I prepared this sermon it ended with the pillar of fire and then this Sunday we start our pillar of fire services when the pillar fire saved this generation by God's grace I thought it was striking so on Sunday at 4 o'clock we'll be preaching on the save the Lord for today we don't have to guess well this is program's opinion we know this is God's opinion because the Holy Ghost protects all of his word he guards office word if no contradictions in the message of God because God's message is the Word of God amen also thank you aren't you glad the pillar fire came and vindicated his message more gives me such a confidence I don't care how small their churches I don't care how many few people there are I know one thing that God loves this word that we pray amen no matter we know it's gonna be less and less I just heard it today brother says it's the pyramid doctrine he called it not a doctor but it's just less less and less with me fewer and fewer people but I'm telling you you and I are one of those feeling that we have to be one of those few fewer fewer are you willing to hold on if you're one of the few absolutely I'll hang on if nobody else does amen
