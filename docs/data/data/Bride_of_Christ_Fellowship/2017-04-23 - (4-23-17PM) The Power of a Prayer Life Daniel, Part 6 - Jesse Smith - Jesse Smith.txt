word I got cut it a little shorter for my voice not have no voice this week thank you brother tremendous my a great what a great gift that is Glory let's stand on our feet let's go to Daniel chapter 6 by the grace of God Daniel chapter 6 very familiar uh story Daniel Lion's Den I'd like to just preach on the power of prayer life you know that's kind of the thought I got coming out of here as I Was preparing and so forth like those are the thoughts that have come into Me So Daniel chapter 6 let me get the verse I want to read here God's gra Daniel chapter 6 I'd like to read I want to start at verse 10 read 10 and 11 Danel 6 10 and 11 now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneel down upon his knees three times a day prayed gave thanks before his God as he did a four time then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God that's i' like to read there let's that word of prayer have KN on your heart just make a know unto God as we pray heavly father thank you for Lord this service thank you for the songs that we heard and sang Lord God thank you Lord as the song said we just have to remember what Jesus did and your love for us your amazing love Lord God hallelujah we thank you Lord that as many as you love you rebuke and Chase and Lord and you Lord change us into Sons and Daughters Lord God but thank you for that amazing love dear God father we just ask Lord you Minister here tonight Lord through the scripture Lord It's Your Eternal Word help us to see Jesus Christ in every scripture your Prophet taught us dear God especially for our our young children Lord God that they could see Christ in this story dear Lord we thank you for it God we ask that just Minister God to us Lord in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen amen God bless you being seated praise God Sor if there's ever a distraction let me know this was up a little bit higher I can see how you know everybody that drives past I can see how that might be a distraction let me know if there's anything we can do to help out like God I know what that's I know it's like it could be distracting you know things back here for me can be distracting I do want to thank brother bang he got the video up that work okay on Wednesday the live stream yeah except for when you were playing sorry that's my fault let's thank brother bang for that thank you [Applause] you thank you brother I really appreciate that you're such a good faithful Soldier brother thank you sir I want to show a few quotes by God's grace yeah personal computer in so let's look at this here tonight I just want to look at the power of a prayer life this part six chapter six uh the next few chapters are all prophetic if you look at chapter seven a lot of prophetic things chapter eight a lot of Visions uh chapter nine is the Great uh chapter of Daniel 70 weeks so we'll revisit that and uh I'll never forget when brother Kevin after I preached that over at the other Church brother Kevin walked up and he he said we've heard preaching for these decades and that was the best teaching I ever heard on that so I said thank you sir I appreciate that uh but we want it to be clear we want all the teachings to be clear by God's grace because we want we think brother BR the holy spirit makes it simple so we want it to be simple by God's grace and so I want to review that a little later and then chapter 10 11 and 12 there's only a few more chapters after that a lot of them are prophetic I think the most um maybe the most prophetic ones would be the ones about the King of the North you know uh with Russia brother Russia was the King of the North and the King of the South not sure who that is yet I think it's Egypt I have to go back and check the quotes and make sure my memory is right but there's a lot of there's a lot of uh prophecy in those books so I'll be real careful about that if I don't know if I don't have a quote from Brother brand I won't interpret it you know I just well maybe just have to skip it but I just want to let you know there's a lot in there chapter 11 remember there's a lot about the Antichrist in chapter 11 about taking the Covenant by flatter flatteries you he comes in peely all these things we heard brother Ram say Well they're laying right there in chapter 11 as well so a lot of them get prophetic and we'll just try to gather all those quotes you know and bring them together and to see the the best picture we can and I think hopefully helped on Wednesday night to hear that again how brother brandom said I believe the bride will be forced to stop preaching right remember brother said that according to Revelation 13:16 um so again seeing the the rising of the of the denominations will have to rise in change the laws right in order to bring a squeeze upon the bride but brother said before that happens there'll be a Jesus Will Be The Showdown he'll be the Mount Zion Showdown and he'll come and Rapture his bride away so that's what we're taught by God's grace and so when people ask me that's I told Austin you that's why I told Benjamin you know I tell them that that's that's what we have as far as prophecy for for before the Rapture okay so Daniel chapter 6 again a very familiar chapter um let me set the timer I don't think I'll go over but if I do forgive me but I'm not going to try to go over now what awesome was here I would slow down a little bit but I think I'm just gonna U get to the main points by God's grace and maybe make it a little shorter so I wanted I wanted to kind of teach him through you know the word of God I know he's never read this before but since he's not here I'll just hit the highlights okay all right so chapter six um little background here scoffield says this is 537 BC so one year after know Bazar fell this is one year after it and remember brother Ram said when Daniel came before Bazar he was an old man with a big beard and white beard on and an old rugged Preacher Brother ra said he would preach a little bit there babyon he's an old man now uh this is under the rule of Darius which is true you know that I'm saying I got that from the scripture uh in scoffield that's five uh chapter 5:31 Darius the me so when the mees and Persians remember they took over Bel shazar they didn't have to fight remember that and people get so prideful and puffed up Satan hard has to fight them you know they're just already T overtaken by the demons you know the previous demons and all kinds of all kinds of evil influences but now Daniel is seeing the the chest and arms of silver now Daniel's a part of that he's seeing his vision now he's walking in the vision he's he's walking he's uh the modern events were made clear by prophecy can you say Amen to that he's walking said wow this is what I've seen the needs and perss are ruling this is what I saw this is the silver uh he's walking in the vision right he's walking and the vision of God has made plain before him so it's just a very striking thing to see now verses 1 through3 it explains how Daniel was over he was one of the presidents who was over groups of 120 okay and then the King was thinking to make him above everybody else in verse three he supposed to be over he was going to make him above the whole realm now verse four uh you start seeing a real good type of Daniel typing Christ because in verse four then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any he or fault found in him so these Sinners hate the holy man right they don't like this guy so they want to find fault with him and that's all they did with Jesus they just try to find fault with Jesus that's the what they'll try to do to us they'll try to find fault with us we've got to live pure before the Lord now uh it's just like Christ and you'll see here in verses 8 and N the laws had to be change in order to find fault with Daniel that's how the you know right now in America don't you enjoy the freedom that we have butam said that they'll close our doors close our doors thinking they're doing God of service he said but they have to change the laws in order to persecute the true church that's talking about the false church so they change the laws right they change the laws this is a beautiful type of the the crucifixion but also of the end time as well it's a beautiful uh types of both of these now in verse 10 and 11 what we read despite the law Daniel kept his fellowship with God that's what we've got a purpose in our hearts because that's what brother Bram said brother Bram said we have we must have unbroken fellowship with God no matter what Trials come no matter what laws change no matter how we suffer and uh no matter if we even feel like Heaven's closed to us we must still have unbroken Fellowship because listen we're going to have fellowship with somebody right if you don't have if you stop if we stop praying if we stop coming to church you're going to be fellowshiping with somebody it's going to be demons so we must keep the fellowship and God allows these Hard Times brother says of course to test us I listened to a sermon what was that I can't remember last week and brother so blessed me oh was the one about Easter yeah living yeah living dying buried and raised from 57 and brother man said the disciples were discouraged on that Saturday when after Jesus was crucified and brother said sometimes God will let us be discouraged but it's just to test us he said because every son and daughter must be tried amen so that's what I'm saying like if you feel like Heaven's closed if you feel like the prayers have been answered we keep our fellowship with God Almighty because we know God is just testing us and we've got to make our calling election sure amen that's exactly right let's look at this quote I pulled out just this one quote there was a couple I wanted to pull out but I think I'll just I just pulled this one up don't never never try to get to God under anything other than the fellowship the fellowship with God under the blood that's why I love that song Through the blood I really appreciate that that's the only way God knows that's the only way God will recognize you must first be Washed by the Water of the word then cleanse through the blood and enter the sh of Glory go into there into Fellowship then you know where you're standing at amen how many know where they're standing at tonight you've been you've been through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost you know where you stand with fellowship with God Daniel another one who had purpose in his heart he wouldn't defile himself with the king's meat when he had taken down into Babylon he maintained his Fellowship in the presence of lions that was ready to kill him oh my remember Satan's like a roaring lion right he maintained his Fellowship in the presence of lions that was ready to kill and yet Daniel held his fellowship and God sent angel and stood by him that night and blinded his eyes and shut the mouth of the lion because Daniel had fellowship with the supernatural Glory Daniel had fellowship with the god of Heaven because he was under the blood that's how he maintained his stand amen the Bible says we must do all we can do to stand right put on the full armor of God that you be able to withstand against the Ws of the devil right and having done all he said stand Hallelujah so what we see the power of prayer the power of prayer helps us to stand when everything else falls apart we must keep our prayer life strong how many how many believe that by God's grace we must keep the prayer life strong as we'll get to some quotes at the end here but I just want to read through this the Hebrew children we preached on this a few weeks ago right in the middle of the fire furnace no matter what you do to them you can't Scorch that Fellowship away from them Hallelujah you can throw them under enough trials I'm sry you can't throw them under enough trials to make them deny it praise God see that Fellowship St with you right it's like that white stone we talked about it's that revelation of who you are I'm a Child of God Daniel knew he was a child of God and remember just one chapter later the Bible said the angel Gabriel came to him and said you're greatly beloved in heaven see look what see look at his Decades of I think of you know Loris and Karen look at the decades and years of Daniel's life and finally at the end of his life the Holy Spirit through the angel comes and says you're greatly beloved Heaven loves you amen hallelujah you might not have heard that before but Heaven came down and tell him you're greatly beloved Daniel because you love the things of God Amen said a man that's ever been under the blood of Jesus Christ and become filled with the Holy Ghost all the devils in Hell couldn't rooted out of him he knows where he stands man I know you think I'm crazy swinging my hands but if you felt like I did you'd jump up in your seat and do the same thing amen so can you imagine oh my if you felt like I see how this raises people's Faith here keep your fellowship with God go keep your prayer life with God hallelujah it's the power of the prayer life amen glory I just want to bring this scripture to your mind I mentioned it when I was praying because it was just been so dear to me God loves our prayers as long as our hearts are right the sacrifice of the wicked is abomination to the Lord but the prayer of the upright is his Delight amen one thing there's there's one thing we know God what God loves is somebody who prays with a pure heart amen not for my I mean yes we need we have needs we can ask for needs but like brother B said if we can be uh if we can just pray and be in the middle of the road and not tell God what to do but and be okay if God doesn't answer our prayer we can just be right in the middle of the road God Delights in that God Delights in somebody that will be humble and submissive and say let your will be done but not my will be done amen the prayer of the upright is his Delight so he loves to hear your pray in the morning doesn't he he loves to hear you pray at noon and he loves to hear you pray at night time amen because that's Daniel's testimony as we read in our scripture he kneeled upon his knees three times a day now I didn't put this in my notes because it just kind of came to me but he did the same thing Jonah did Jonah turned brother said he turned somehow in the belly of the way he must have had like a spiritual Compass he turned to pray to Jerusalem and God uttered his prayer because solom had written that Lord May the whoever prays this Temple May and they they if they pray repenting may you hear from heaven and hear them and answer their prayer so just as Jonah prayed toward Jerusalem he Daniel but Daniel with a pure heart right Daniel wasn't a runaway Prophet right so God hears a runaway prophet and God hears a faithful Prophet God hears anybody who cries with a sincere heart amen I just thought I'd put that in there there it's his Delight he delighted that that Jonah would turn and look to he to heaven or turn and look to the Heavenly Temple there on Earth and he delighted that Daniel would turn and face the temple God just loves people that look up to him amen amen PR praise God I'm G just share a quick testimony can I I hope sister Kristen Walker is okay with this she shared a testimony with me this week uh or yesterday or I'm sorry earlier today anyways she she knew a saint who was talking to somebody who's who has like mental trouble and they forgot to take their uh their medication and so uh sister Kristen said that um the person would talk in 27 different personalities and different voes and this was just this week and uh the person came in this this demon possessed person came into the Saints house that Kristen knows uh and the demon started saying things like I own this house and and sister Kristen said that her that this dear Saint just looked with a just a calm voice and said said you don't have anything here let me speak to the real person in the name of Jesus Christ just spoken a didn't have to shout right like sometimes I'll shout or stuff didn't have to do nothing like that just speak it and uh sister Kristen said the testimony was that the demon voice stopped and instantly and then the person came back to their normal mind and it happened again she said the name of Jesus Christ again and the person came back to themselves and ended up leaving the house praise God doesn't God Delight doesn't God back up his word think about that the demon said I'm going to take over this home I'm going to torment and do all these things but the power just speaking that lovely name in prayer every demon in Hell shakes at that name we serve a risen savior don't we the reality of the power of the Cross is so real so we Face a demon this week just breathe that holy name in prayer just breathe that holy name in prayer God promised to hear our prayers man woman anyone anyone that will just take the name of Jesus and speak that name the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and they're saved you imagine being uh having a demon possessed person in your house what what what ammunition some some of us might get our guns out you know some some of us might get our tawan do moves ready you know or something like that some people might do that but alls we need is the name of Jesus that is enough Hallelujah more than enough amen so this all share that by God's grace stay in that channel stay with that word keep his name always on your lips to praise His name that's just this week the power of Jesus Christ rebuking demons amen don't you appreciate that testimony if you see her tell her tell her thanks for that hope it was okay that I shared that I try to keep out all the details you know by God's grace I just thought my that's just wonderful praise the Lord now my next one is verse 17 and a stone was brought and of course we know the story the the the the the the workers there you know change the laws Daniel gets caught praying uh and then uh the Bible said this that a stone was brought he he's cast into the uh the den and uh laid upon the mouth of the den and the King sealed it with his own signate and with the signate of the Lords and the per that the purpose might not be Chang concerning Daniel now this is a beautiful type of Christ isn't it remember when Christ died they put his body in there and the Bible said the uh the Bible said that pilate sealed it it was sealed what a beautiful type I I wonder if Daniel knew that brother bang that he was going to be a type of Jesus Christ I'm going to be I'm G to be unlawfully uh uh put on trial I have no fault but they're goingon to they're going to condemn me and they're going to throw me down into a pit and they're going to roll a stone over the pit and they're going to seal it with the king's seal that's exactly what the the Bible said about Pilate pilate sealed it and then he put prisoners there but little did he know it is not wasn't going to be three days it just going to be one day so Daniel had to endure one night but the angel of God was there amen God's angel comes to shut the the lion's mouth how many can see Christ in that is that beautiful that's beautiful there's a trial he's not guilty but they make him guilty by changing the lost and God comes God's angel comes and helps out Daniel praise the Lord I think that's a beautiful type you can see there verse 22 the angel of the Lord shuts uh the Lion's mouths I'll never forget that when brother Tim McKinny preached here and he he preached Your Den of Lions remember that I don't know if bang might remember that Bo might remember that that was one of my favorite Servants of all time well I shouldn't say favorite but one of my most impactful sermons that I've ever heard preach because he brought it down to uh we we get in our trials and all these Lions all of our trials surround us like lions Satan comes from this this angle Satan comes from that angle uh but God's able to Deliver Us from all of our Lives amen he's able to Deliver Us from every time Satan comes like a roaring Lon uh the Bible said that we can overcome him the Bible said that we'll overcome him by the blood of the Lamb amen so when Satan comes in like a lion the Bible said cast your cares upon the Lord amen for he carth for you I remember after that sermon I wrote down five or six things I struggled with and I prayed about them and God gave me victory over all like I wasn't you know give my wife wife attention I was eating too much food I was being really gluttonous you know uh was watching uh sport too much Sports on my on my phone and stuff like that and God gave me victory over all those by God's grace so I know if we go sincere before God and we say God deliver me from these lines deliver me from Satan's Temptations God is the deliverer amen he's mighty to save as we sing that song Hallelujah Christ is mighty to save amen and it's also good to think about this he'll shut the mouth of your accusers oh brother brother's saying this about you the sister saying this about you your cooworker saying this about you your grandma grandpa your dad saying evil things about you he'll close their mouths so you don't hear it amen he'll close their mouths so you can stand there and worship God stand there and be in the right standing have your fellowship with God Almighty I like that look at verse 23 we'll skip ahead we know the story The King was up all night can you imagine having a heathen King praying and fasting for you God will make everybody witness amen of his power and His glory amen see the king even this needs a pers he could tell Daniel was a man of God why because he was always faithful at work he saw how Godly he was he saw what a faithful man he was fair he was honest and so that will make even a Godly life will make a sinner I'll say like that praying fast for you he spent the night prayer fasting could hardly get to bed my goodness look at verse 23 it says actually let me read 22 my God ha sent his Angel has shut the Lion's mouths that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee okay have I done no hurt isn't this something now just uh think about this too God saved uh Daniel because he was innocent but God didn't save Stephen from being stoed so see every life has a Purp purpose on this Earth can you say Amen to that am amen they're both innocent they both done nothing wrong they're both falsely accused God Saves one and God brings another one right to Heaven amen know it's like the I heard a denomination they say God has a great plan for your life what about Stephen's life you know see they're talking about oh riches money big churches Fame that's what they mean God has a great plan for your life but God did have a great plan for even martyr's lives right because they receive a martyr's crown amen they receive a different Crown it's a martyr's crown but it's still eternal life attached to it amen remember uh uh brother BR said we went on this quote a few weeks ago brother saids some lives are given and some lives are striven right some lives are given as Martyrs and we must strive daily uh in order to win our Crown right now we don't have persecution so our crown comes by striving daily pressing on every day keeping our fellowship with God God Amen brother said the same faith that makes a man give his life like Stephen is the same faith it takes to daily serve God and pray and St the channel of Fellowship all the days of your life amen it's the same Faith exactly right so see because he believed yeah verse 23 I never got that then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was taken up out of the dead and no matter hurt was found on him why because he believed in his God go so this time God came down to show I'm going to show everybody there that I'm going to protect an innocent man now he didn't have to do that he didn't he didn't do that with Stephen although he did put him to bed early you know before Bible say he went to sleep before he got Stone remember that in the face of an Angel so God did keep him from some of the pain but he never kept Christ from the pain right so in this situation God come out and said the reason I saved you was because you were innocent because you believed in God amen so that's that that that's our desire church is to believe God if the laws change we'll still believe God's word praise God whether he sends an angel or not whether he send comes as a fourth man in the fire or not no matter what he allows we must believe God and be innocent before God right and live according to the word of God Amen so that's a good a good type there for us to see now I want to read that the verse 26 and then we'll I'm kind of be done with this and I want to just end with the quotes so I'm going to end with the quotes but in verse 26 uh after he is brought up out of the pit Darius writes a letter unto all nations peoples the languages that dwell upon Earth now remember Nebuchadnezzar did the same thing right after God uh after God changed Nebuchadnezzar's heart for seven years and brought him back what Nebuchadnezzar do he wrote a letter to everybody on the earth so can you imagine Daniel's testimony so strong he had two kings send letters all around the world to glorify God Amen The Power of One testimony what did he do all the time he just prayed all the time he worked hard all the time he gave God all the glory he's a man greatly beloved of God and so God makes two kings uh tell all the world that he is the Living God Amen what a testimony my goodness Glory Mercy verse 25 then King darus wrote unto all people Nations and languages that dwell in all the Earth peace be multiplied unto you I make a decree that in every Dominion of my kingdom men tremble in fear before the god of Daniel for he is the Living God and steadfast forever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed and his Dominion shall be even unto the end you see how there's a time that you need to tremble before God can you see that he's darus is telling them you need to tremble in fear before God almighty now usually our trembling in fear comes when at the beginning of our conversion right because the Bible tells us that we should serve god with fear and trembling I many remember that demons believe but the demons believe and tremble don't they so we should have a point in our Christian life where we're such uh we have such a holy reverence for God we fear and tremble God's word because this is what this is what he learned this is what Darius learned a me right a me he's not even a a Hebrew he learns we must fear and tremble before God don't play games with God be as sincere as you possibly can with God Almighty fear and tremble before him right now verse 20 y read that verse 27 he delivereth and rescue and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in Earth who have delivered Daniel from the power of the lion so this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius in the reign of Cyrus the verion now just a minut here let me look up that scripture fear and Trum think it's like right on my tongue here anybody remember that New Testament scripture about fear and trembling okay well there's actually numerous scriptures in here oh yeah yeah there it is Ephesians 2:12 let me switch over here Ephesians sorry Philippians 2:12 pardon that's the one I was thinking of Philippians 2:12 haven't studied that one lately so I couldn't recall it very good Ephesians I'm sorry Philippians 2:12 wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with what fear and trembling so fear and trembling is required in the Old Testament and guess what church it's required in the New Testament too you must fear and tremble before God so there's times in prayer when we're just we're like that I don't know about you but I've had many times like when I'm praying I'm trembling asking God for Mercy or asking God for Grace or giving me God God give me direction or Lord I love you I will worship you this is a requirement in the old and the new how believe Daniel had fear and trembling in his life no doubt all those prayers all those faithful uh requests made before God God honored it and said because you're innocent I'm going to protect you from those lies amen glory let's here let's try to finish up here by God's grace one been preaching about 20 24 minutes so this GNA be a real record here my wife's gonna be real proud of me here by God's grace but the reason I say that just a joke she doesn't give me a hard time I'm saying I gotta I just don't want to lose my voice okay so I did a little search on just the words prayer life and there's eight hits and I'm not going to read that I don't have I don't have that ready I was going to play that but I don't have that ready but said having a prayer life is an old fashion fashioned experience so when you're constantly in prayer with God then you know you're one of them I'm one of them I'm one of them it's oldfashioned because people don't stay in prayer like they ought to now I'm going to go down to paragraph 52 this is uh believe this and if you want this I can just email to you I'd rather have a man that didn't know split peas from coffee split beans from coffee and know God in his heart to deal with my people then I would some man with enough education to choke a mule and know nothing about God that's right bless your heart brother an oldfashioned sassr experience what we need today we don't want to know genealogy you need a little neology that's what man needs today amen back to God back to the prayer life where speaking out praying hold on to God till it comes to pass God will do it amen amen what are we holding on for church well the Rapture our loved ones gifts of the spear Miracles whatever whatever you're holding on for God to do hang on to it that shows you're a real saint of God Abraham did it 25 years how many can do it longer by God's gra I can go longer Hallelujah I'm looking for Joel chapter 2 brother B I'm looking looking for that to be fulfilled in our day Hallelujah the former and the latter Reign Glory I'm hanging over that with all my heart now brother gets all excited he said oh don't be scared with that Hallelujah that means praise our God he's worthy of it amen you won't scare me when you say it either oh I love this brother testimony in Cleveland Ohio let everything else be secondarily but your prayer life now my Christian friends if you believe me to be set from God you seek the kingdom of God just as quick as you can get into it that's the only safety we have today the world's at the End of the Age only in Christ are you saved I'm not saying this is scary I'm saying it just as sely as I know how to stand here in the platform and say it but my heart's been stirred for a time and I know that we're ready for something and you Christians don't stay in that lukewarm condition any longer lay aside everything to get just get as close to God as you can walk with him talk with him let everything else be secondary but your prayer life stay right with him all the time am I don't know why I stopped in my speech to say that but I could prove that I'd be willing to say that that's the spirit of God that's speaking right now a warning to you that's right remember I'm saying that under the anointing of the spirit of God is that beautiful that's in Cleveland Ohio in 1950 brother Ram gives them a warning by the spirit of God don't St in luk or condition walk with him and talk with him put prayer life before for everything by God's grace the prophet Elisha I'm going to skip down here watch when a Believer gets out of contact with his maker they fixed up their compass for seven days and went out to Wilderness taking the king of Edom with them to meet this great company and the mobites out there now when they went off such a hurry without even considering God he tells the story of Israel not praying I'm sorry with Joseph Jehosaphat and Ahab not even considering God when they found out seven days was up well their water supply was cut off they didn't have any water to drink and there they was out there with their cattle with their animals and water supply cut off and looks like it was just about the end for them now that's what we do sometimes we go up on a tantrum somewhere and not think about God not pray over it ask the Lord whether we should do it or not and we find out that our supply of blessings is cut off then we wonder sometimes well wonder why I can't have no more blessings if you don't watch you let down your prayer life you say well I'm MC Christian well that's the more sign you should pray than ever read the Bible every day pray every day don't make any decision too harshly or too quickly without first considering God about it ask him father shall I do this father ask him is it your will for me to do this then see what the holy spirit will speak to you he might not give you a vision but he will speak to you in some way to let you know if you'll be sincere and ask you amen beautiful see sometimes you get little TR Tantrums he said why does this happen why does that happen but man says pray about it pray about it don't let down in your prayer life I'm many want a more active prayer life praise God I do I guess he keeps going here let me read this if I underline it it must been important well if a nation or Army should consult the Lord in a time of trouble what about when a cancer has got you in a corner when TV's got you in a corner when afflictions got you in a corner don't give up let's consult the Lord about it and see what he' have to say maybe say well I'm a drunker I'm a harder I'm cursed all my life don't give up let's consult the Lord about it now and let's see what he'd say about it say well brother BR I've tried for six years to be born again the spirit of God to receive the Holy Spirit he never yet come to me well well let's try again tonight and see what the Lord will say for you always willing if we'll just get everything out of the way amen praise God when Satan Cuts your prayer life he says you're gone now what gone from the blessings right if you're a True Believer gone from the blessings all right now he gives a statement about uh if you love the world or things of the world the love of God's not even in you it's satisfying portion of God he has for each of you it's for whosoever will David he said as the heart thirst for the water Brook so my soul thirst after thee oh god oh when I think of that David being a Woodsman I've been through that part of the country you find out a lot of times there's been a lot of deers at Rome the heart is a deer and if you watch nature you'll see God and they'll have wild dogs in that country and they eat the deer they would come in packs and they overtook the deers and one of the things they do is cut the little what we call hamstring in the back the leader and just cut out a whole pack then they can't run those dogs will eat as much as they can then the others can't pull away very much and then they're easier prey than to run right back and get them he said that's the way the devil does he will cut you off from prayer meetings right he's done cut the hamstrings right then so he he types hamstring as your prayer life and the Bible said we're supposed to run the race with perseverance so where's your strength come from running being persevering prayer helps your perseverance prayer helps you keep pressing on why because you start talking to God about it God gives you peace or God gives you hope or you renew your strength when you talk to God God gives you back he pours something back into your heart and it gives you the perseverance you need to press on he said you'll be you'll pull around from this church to that you'll run from here to there but anytime the devil wants to go you up he's got you under his control when he cut your pray life brother you're gone that's right when he cuts that thirst off of you and perverts it in the things of the world he's got you where he wants you he will let you gobble on here till you get to a certain place then crash your life without God right there true he's talking about Sinners there right but we all know there's power in prayer we all know there's power in prayer and that's your hamstring right you don't want to get your prayer life cut off because there goes your hamstring I injured my hamstring a few times in football guess what I didn't play I wasn't running I do a lot out of rehab to get my hamstring back or my groin muscle all these muscles right brother Likens that unto prayer you can't run the race without a prayer life amen where's your strength gone Samson I don't underline anything in there all right I'm just going to go to this one where's our strength gone Samson I'm sorry neglecting the Holy Ghost not moving up with God Grieves the spirit shaving of Samson was getting away from prayer life and the Holy Ghost wow that's what the hair represented right his prayer life and the Holy Ghost brother a secret so what's our secret prayer time with God and the move of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's our secret praise God we must not give that away we must not give away our prayer life this is from 1959 all right he talks about sinners the Sinners will start to the altar to get right with God and the Christians will sit and pop chewing gum looking at them that's the truth when he used to be in the Baptist Church when I come out the Old Kentucky Baptist why old cner boy would start to the altar would be every mam in there around his neck he'd come through before he got to the altar so brother saw women mothers that would see their children come to the altar intercept them before they could even get here and already start praying for them my a that something church that sounds like Revival to me [Applause] what's the matter he said they shaved off the secret they got away from paralyzed they got away from the Holy Ghost crowing roosters educated canaries with canary bird brain trying to explain to you all the ins outs of God you don't know God that way you know him when you're born again that's the only way you'll ever be able to know him God is still God he's just as much God today as ever was he's the God that was on the mount with Elijah he's a God that was in the Dead with Daniel amen he's the god of Pentecost he's the god of the church amen get back to all night prayer meetings as you had down there last night he says he said I'm seeing the world coming into the Pentecost I'm zealous and when I see the church begin to flirt with the world it rises something in within me I can't set still I've got to say something can call me what you want to I just got to let it out I'm jealous of the church I don't want her entangled with the world God forbid that she'll ever get entangled with the world let her stay free if she even has to Worship in a Tin Pan Alley Tin Pan Alley she don't need no seminaries no cemeteries whatever goes with it what she needs is a baptism of the Holy Ghost and a renewing praise God renew my salvation restore the joy of my salvation I like that see the power of God doesn't shake the church anymore just becomes so common to them and they go down and say well that's pretty good uh huh going off my it ought to drive us to our knees to repentance it ought to bring us to teardrops it ought to bring Salvation And Soul winning the coming Lord ought to press us so hard till we be in every street corner trying to tell somebody do something about it it'll be too late to do it after a while amen look at that sounds like Zeal for the Lord does it hallelujah what is quite a quote I didn't know it this long here I okay he said I'm closing saying this one hope we have while they had Samson bound there was a new shock grow out I'm praying God that he'll grow out of here somewhere a new shock that'll shake the Philistines like they' never been shook before I believe God will have it if he won't do it through the churches he'll take a Christian Christian businessman he'll do something another but there will be a shock of power a secret power of the Holy Ghost grow out again just as certain as anything and it'll do the job in the last days God grant that we'll all be numbered with that shock when it comes amen all right I'm going to keep going here because I want to finish here all quite a quotation so how's this new shock of Samson going to brought through prayer and the Holy Ghost so brother says the reason people can't get the Holy Ghost is because their prayer life is too loose they have a loose prayer life I I need to pray today I have to pray tonight not to pray at any time he said they get loose and he says the inspector will not seal the train car until the car is so completely packed until it's so packed down so an order that the shaking of the ride won't bother the product that's on the inside that's what's the matter don't get sealed so much we're too loose about things when the inspector goes through to inspect your life to see if you're not just a little loose about things a little loose about your prayer life little loose about that temper little loose about that tongue to talk to others he'll never seal the car see some dirty habits some vile things some vulgarity mind he can't seal the car but when he's found everything in his place then he seals it amen glory amen see that church we can't get loose if we get loose on sin or I mean if we get loose on sin that's another thing but if we just get loose on our prayer lives we shouldn't even be loose on prayer lives right Sinners are loose you know are lukewarm people are loose on worldly things but the Christian the real spirit filled Christian can't be loose on spiritual things we can't be loose on prayer life and reading the Bible and listening to sermons all week and and enjoying brother R's Ministry you know we can't get loose on those things how many want to how how you want to stay tight on those things by God's gra you don't want to loose up loosen up that you want to stay focused on that Hallelujah but R said not going on with God kept Israel out of the promised land he said younger men look to the older men like our older brother here just because Mana falls from heaven doesn't mean God is well pleased with us God is calling us back to prayer life so let me just find that that's I just try to summarize it with the red up there and here to you older Christians and to the younger the younger women look at the older women the younger men look to the older men and see the way you conduct yourself to see what you do and they presume that they're all right is because you do the way you do see that's why we that's why we have to all live a Godly example right we have to all live a Godly example we should all have prayer lives we should all be an example to others exactly right let me go to the prayer line here now it's almost a impossible thing to get people praying fasting and calling on the Lord seems like the church has got so drowsy lazy in the last days so pitiful and I hate to come and just keep stirring and preaching and saying these things but brother sister that's the truth I just can't hold it it's the gospel and it must be preached it's got to be preach as a witness it's true so I think that we just presuming too much can you say Amen to that amen we've got the battle the spiritual drowsy Spirit that's right we've got to battle that lukewarm spirit and we got that church I'll just be honest as a pastor it is difficult to get people praying and fasting and calling on God right every Church of God want to how many people in that church you really think are praying fasting and call upon God and are you are we praying and fasting and calling upon God giving a sincere prayers offering sincere prayers calling on God missing meals in order to have fellowship with God have The Unbroken Fellowship I think that's a good uh that's a good quote don't you for our lives it's so hard to do it talks about coming to Kadesh Baria all right I want to see how many more I got here okay okay that's the last one okay I want to close this one because I've only been uh good 40 minutes the meanus man in Santa Maria another prayer life quote this is last one so if there's no prayer life in the family that explains the condition of a worldly family right said now I want to tell you something about Sunday school it's absolutely wrong to send your children to Sunday school you know that take that that's right all right I'm gonna um yeah let's go on this you think of the modern American people what is it well Dad's out at the pool room mother's out with some Pet Society somewhere on the beach stretched out daughter's down at the canteen or down at the rock and roll Junior's got his hot rod there you are one he said one get a hamburger there's no home life no prayer life I've always say this if you straighten up when we break the backbone of America is when Womanhood is broken and I say this with Godly respects for my sisters this morning I met some of the finest women over there but what's happened to our women what's the matter with them let's s to our feet by God's grace how many appreciate those prayer life quotes we don't have that power's gone can't run home life's all out of order prayer is the most important thing I just want to remind of that you know as I studied and I was looking at Daniel that's what kind of came to me Church having that prayer Life by God's grace let's just have a time of prayer here if we can just bow our heads here let's ask God to keep our prayer life strong or if it's gotten weak if it's got drowsy wake my prayer life up because remember it's his Delight when we pray with a pure heart Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this word father let this never become common Lord God Daniel showed us the power of a prayer life three times a day you get on his knees now Lord we know we can pray without ceasing we don't have to get on our knees but Lord many times it humbles us Lord God I heard brother brandom say also that there's something about standing up and praying there's something about kneeling and praying because it's in the scripture all these Saints did it at different times when Solomon delegated the temple he fell on his knees the Bible said he raised His Hands to Heaven Daniel here knowing that the law would try to persecute him oh has the windows open anyway he's not ashamed he goes and gets on his knees and offers up prayers supplications and thanksgivings Lord I just pray you'd bring our prayer lives to a spot where we can be Lord if we could be privileged to be called prayer [Music] orders Lord I'll be honest I don't feel like one yet I feel like I want to press in with more prayer dear God not to time myself not to Pat myself on the back but just to talk it over with you Lord God to keep our fellowship I love you Jesus what would your spirit have me to do today direct me Lord I have a a big decision a great big decision Lord direct me what should I do I'll wait till I hear your voice I wait till I see you open or close the door dear Lord may we keep up on our prayer time Lord God the prayer time gave Daniel power and favor and nothing could hurt him because of his fellowship with you dear God or we know that's not the case as we said with Stephen but Lord it may be the case with some of our Lives we'll be like a Daniel you'll protect us from every mouth of every roaring demon around us Lord and silence them by the power of the Holy Spirit dear God father I just pray bless these Souls that are here Lord we so appreciate I appreciate these Saints their faith pressing their way out to the house of God again let these quotes become a greater reality to each one here to me and to all these precious Souls that are still hungry to hear your word on a Sunday evening Lord God these are precious times Lord precious times your Prophet said one day they'll close these doors if we if you T long [Music] enough may we stay in tune our brother even sang about this morning about watching and praying and the kingdom of God will be given to us Lord as we see the

lives what you want for the future of our families Lord Our Lives dear God give us a burden to pray that we can run the race we won't be hindered we won't pull a hamstring Lord as we'd say let up on
