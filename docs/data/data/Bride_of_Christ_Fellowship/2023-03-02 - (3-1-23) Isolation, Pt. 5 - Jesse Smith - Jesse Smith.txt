I'd like to look at isolation this might be my last part here part five quite sure so I'm 142. what don't see brother Chris I'm just going to text him real quick okay Psalms 141 I'm sorry 42 verses 1 and 2 or just read those verse two verses I mentioned on Sunday I'd like to look at some of David's prayers and of course some other Psalms solemn writers rather I think it'd be encouragement to us you know as we go through our Trials of life you know I'm sure you've experienced God's word just pick you up when you're down and so it's hard to find people that were maybe as down as David in some of the cases where he was and as we saw with Adam and Eve and different places people were Believers yet they got to such Low Places but it's just powerful to see how these were songs they sang to lift them up out of discouragement to lift them up out of difficult places and so I'd like to look at that tonight and just as a reminder that when we're isolated or in tough places let's go to the word of God let's sing a song that's been sung before praise God or God could be so gracious he could give us a new song Amen Psalm 142 verses 1 and 2. let's read that if we can one two three I Cried unto the Lord with my voice with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication I poured out my complaint before him I shooed before him my trouble amen may God add His blessings to read his word maybe seated and praise God so I wanted to open with this verse to just show you how when we go through difficult times there is a way to complain to God where it's not a sinful complaint that's why I want to open up with this we see it right here in the scripture I don't think any of us in our sound Minds would deny this and say well this verse isn't inspired brother I don't think you'd say that I wouldn't say that how we leave all the word of gods inspired praise God I'm not gonna I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands but I'm sure some of us have complained before before the Lord I think my hand will go up first maybe things didn't go the way I wanted everything was going good until that and then Lord why did you do you do and we see the songwriter this is a Psalm of David a prayer when he was in a cave of course running from Saul and it's been guessed at you know I looked at the at some of the the numbers and he he ran from David anywhere from 13 to maybe 16 years I'm sorry I ran from Saul rather David ran from Saul because he didn't become king until he was 30. it was likely he was around 17 or 16 when he slew Goliath and you know we know he had a little bit of time after that where he was accepted but then you know jealousy crept into Saul's heart when the women sang you know Saul slayed a thousand and David is ten thousand and here we find David here in a cave most of us probably haven't been hiding in a cave for our lives right but how many have ever felt alone in the dark at night you ever felt like you've been in your room and you're just just you it's dark and you feel alone you don't feel the presence of God maybe things look very discouraging or maybe you're alone out and sitting out in the car in the parking lot you're just out there in the dark well we can a little bit relate to David there in that sense that David is alone in the dark now some caves were small David was in some caves were large remember in some caves all all of his mighty men could stay in there they would hide from Saul talk about some deep Caverns you can get into there's any place I want to be though in a dark place like that I want to be with God's armies praise God I want to be with some mighty men if I'm going to be in a cave like that praise God and I know like when I'm with you I know when you're praying for me I know I'm in a cave with some real saints praise God I'm in a dark place but I know God is with me when you're praying for me and I'm praying for you but notice David complained about the symptoms but he never charged God foolishly just like job never did job had lots of questions why is this happening where is God but job never got to the point where he charged God like a fool where he would Curse God and say God is Not faithful God doesn't deserve my praise he never got to that point now he did say I'm more righteous than God in Pride he exalted himself but he never cursed God and said I'll just curse God and die so we read here from the scripture that David actually uses the word complaint I poured out my complaint before him now pouring we get the illustration if someone's pouring something it probably means there's usually a lot in there right and I'm sure we can all relate to times where we've had heavy hearts and it seems like Lord there's so much that I want to say there's so much that I really don't understand in my life and that's what David is experiencing here all of his frustration all of his all of his pain all of his questions he just needs to pour it out I don't know if you do a journal but I do a journal and sometimes my mind gets so full and I get so nervous or anxious I just got I got I call it a brain dump I watched a video one time and they said you got to do a brain dub I thought that's exactly what I got to do praise God I gotta dump out my brain and all my thoughts and all my worries and all my concerns all my ideas and all my questions and so I just you know take a page there just turn the page and just pour out all my thoughts there I do a brain dump and of course it's good to do that but it's also it's better to pray about that though right like David says here I pour out my prayer he says in verse one I've Cried unto God with my voice now church that's a good thing to do to do as well I'm sure I'm sure you know it but let's just say it for tonight rather than just thinking about problems it's good to express them and tell them to God it's good to actually say it out loud in other words don't get it all vent up inside or cooped up inside don't let it all stay inside right because if you keep keeping it in like that eventually you're going to explode it's all going to come out it's going to come out the wrong way the way you don't want it to come out all right like we have family members my wife and I and they just let it get boiled up and then all of a sudden boom here it comes and you don't want to be around when it boils out like that uh that's happened to me I told you one time at work one teacher got so frustrated with me and it finally just exploded because I was forgetting to do a little bit of paperwork each year I forgot to do a little bit of paperwork each year and she said why do you always forget to do that I'm like I'm so sorry no one told me I'm sorry I made a mistake but boy did I get a red-faced explosion because it just boiled up and you know the first time it was a mistake they never came to me and said well you know could you fix this but let it boil up over years and years and years and I'm sure I'm the only one that's ever made a mistake at work okay so so you just feel bad for me okay now we all make mistakes at work but I like this idea in verse two of pouring it out before God it's okay to complain it's okay to share your discontentment that's what complaining is discontentment it's okay to share that as long as it's in the right spirit right it's not accusing God of evil it's not uh cursing God it's not and as long as it's not accusing God of any wrongdoing if it was a sin then then later on this would have said Davidson when he said this prayer it's not a sin to express your discontentment as we'll see here tonight now years ago I preached a sermon about I think I called it the worst sound in the world I preach in Columbus numerous times I got a good response from it it was all about complaining and murmuring and when I preached there in Columbus I think four or five almost the whole there was only seven people in the church I think everybody come up for prayer it's a really small Church in Columbus and each person and even the pastor come up and said I'm complaining forgive me I've been complaining all week to my wife about the situation at the church but it was based upon this study I read I was reading you know how Israel was complaining of Moses they complained about Moses they complained about not have enough food they complain about not have enough water they complained it was too hot they complained it's all complaints and I found this study back in 2011 this uh the scientists or whatever they are to know sociologists I'm not sure what they are but they studied and they asked all these humans what's the worst sound in the world you know they got someone scratching a chalkboard you know I can kind of shiver right now just thinking about that um you know the sirens going off baby screaming uh gunshots or whatever all these sounds and they rated them and the very worst sound of almond all of them was whining and complaining they said the people could work better under any other sound except for whining and complaining people just couldn't work as well through that that's the worst sound in the world and how many believe that's the worst sound in the world to God whining complaining with the wrong spirit right in order to accuse God of some wrong or to uh to to to make him uh to make yourself greater than him or or to accuse him of something that he never did maybe not answering our prayers the way we wanted us not having what the life we thought we should have but I thought that was such a a great expression of the natural relating to the spiritual in the natural we hate to hear I mean who likes to hear your co-workers complain about work like and really our jobs aren't that hard we're sitting at a computer answering phone calls typing emails clicking and doing grade cards that's me now sometimes we've got to clean up throw up you know sometimes we gotta do that sometimes not all the time but really how hard is our work but yet people will complain on the job and it doesn't make work any better it makes it harder like what time is is it it's not even lunch yet we've got all this complaining going on you know I still got a half a day left nothing is worse than complaining that's why the Bible says in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus God's got a purpose God's writing a story God's doing something praise God he's molding our character and so just let's remember that remember Israel would murmur and complain now that's the thing they complained which is okay to express your discontentment to God but it's murmur and that speak against other people the Bible said they murmured against Moses and Aaron right and as Christians mother Brown said we we don't want to murmur we don't want to hurt anybody's influence right we don't want to murmur against people so the Bible said they murmured and complained there was another time I think you're just coming to me now yeah I didn't write down let's go to the book of Jude let's read that one in June and then we're going to spend a little time in the Psalms here tonight by God's grace Jude there's only one chapter it speaks of judgment upon sinners and this is not a harsh sermon on you church this is just a of course you know we all I believe we're all under grace Hallelujah but just a reminder it's verse 14 speaks of Enoch's prophecy about the battle of Armageddon with Jesus coming back on a white horse with ten thousand of his Saints and then in verse 15 Jesus comes to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly Deeds which they have ungodly committed aren't you glad you got godliness over there what are sinners sinners are ungodly they reject the anointing of godliness but you've got it and all of their hard speeches which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him think about that how many Democrats or how many liberals go on Tick Tock or whatever they got Facebook and they give all these hard speeches against Christians or or hard speeches against God they'll be judged for that if they don't repent of that that's the reason God Jesus is coming back to judge them because of their hard speeches against God they think they can have some argument against God when God is a god of Grace right now praise God and he promises whosoever seeks after me shall find me the trouble is they haven't sought after God they haven't uh humbled themselves and and accepted the grace of God hallelujah that's all they got to do to accept it or else all they gotta do is receive it is accept it verse 16. These are here's here's what I was looking for these are murmurs right now people will call it today well I got to give a little rant on Facebook right here I'm gonna go get my rant now it's okay to give rants if they're funny or you know uh if they're not critical or something like that or if it's if it's God's righteous indignation it's okay to rant like that David did that he gave many rants against his enemies in the Book of Psalms many you could do whole sermons on just his prayers against his enemies right but here it's murmuring complainers walking after their own lust so see usually people that complain against God are those who know they're going against the word of God and so they want to enjoy their lust and they don't want to think about the Judgment that they're going to receive because of their Disobedience their ungodliness and their mouths speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of advantage so of course they're saying everything in order to get more money or get more position or popularity or whatever they're trying to get but the point is they speak great swelling things against God that they don't even understand like job when job said Lord he said Lord I'm more righteous than you and and God come down to job and said job where are the treasure houses of snow can you make them can you make some snow for me can you make it snow today of course the answer is no with great swelling words like I deserve this and how could God do this to me and this is what I deserve it it's it's what I want instead of what God wants right selfishness and church let's keep going because it's a beautiful portion it all comes out of this serving God or serving your lusts that's what it comes down to those that are saved will crucify the affections and lust thereof those that are lost will live in their lusts Hallelujah right that's what we see here verse 17. that's a great summary of being saved and being lost crucify Your Lust and you're saved uh fulfill your lust and your loss verse 17 but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own lust these be they who separate themselves sensual not having the spirit you don't have to worry you know when new people come in you don't have to wait too long pretty soon they're sensual lusts are going to take them out of the church right like we've had friends come in within the last years or two but then they leave and find out where they're living in fornication or they're living in adultery right it didn't take very long you hang around the preaching too long and if they're living in it they don't want to hear it that means they're sensual instead of spiritual praise God right they they fulfill the lust of the flesh rather than the desires of the Soul right so in most cases as long as the church is a spiritual church those who are sensual and feed the lust of the flesh they won't last very long they'll separate themselves praise God amen all right now let's get back to David here now go back to Psalms here uh let's go back to Psalm 142. what I just want to go through this I've never preached on this I've heard this preach before and I just really felt inspired I wanted to preach this and and just gain a lot of inspiration from David's writings and the psalm writers so here David shows us how to pour out your complaints to God without sinning now don't raise your hand but how many would like to know how to complain without sinning there's a way to do it now like what Henry says Henry says he was in some cave whether Adam or and Getty and he prayed this prayer it's plain he was in distress okay now I'm going to skip down and it just says it's so wonderful he said religion about him despite being chased down by a bounty hunter right his own father-in-law he still had the spiritual state to pray Church what a blessing like I said if you're sitting in a dark car if you're sitting in a dark room at night what a blessing if you can still pray in those dark times the caves the caves of Our Lives what a blessing if we still have some spiritual uh we'd say spiritual characteristic about us or spiritual desire about us in the midst of our biggest sufferings and notice yeah I like this too prayers and tears were his weapons now look at that in one of those cases Saul was right in the cave with him instead of taking the weapons and killing him and taking care of his problem his weapons were prayer amen his rep weapons were songs praise God right just like Hezekiah and you know the prophecy came back against all the many not many nights but I can't remember which ones it was but the the the way to get victory was to praise the Lord and as they praise the Lord God fought for them praise God amen there's no cave so dark or so deep but he may out of it send up our prayers and our souls in prayer to God in other words there's no trial so hard that you've gone through where it's not too low enough where God won't hear your prayer if you call it out to him praise God there's no cave too deep where God doesn't hear the prayer remember the Bible said he's with you in heaven he's with you in hell praise God your lowest spot he says he calls this prayer Mass skill now there's a lot of Psalms called Mass skill and it seems to be a Psalm of instruction so David's writing this song to instruct us because of the good lessons he learned in the cave the lessons he learned praying on his knees which he desired and teach others so this is a a Psalm that will teach us how to pray teach us how to complain when things don't go our way okay now let's read this whole chapter verse 1. let me get there I'm sorry there it is look at verse one mascale of David a prayer when he was in a cave I Cried unto the Lord with my voice with my voice unto Lord did I make my supplication I poured out my complaint before him I showed before him my trouble so he's in a cave he's in distress he wants us to teach people and he's got to complaint now look I showed him my trouble I told God all of my trouble now if David's a man after his own heart or after God's Own Heart and tells God all of our troubles then let's be encouraged we can tell God all of our troubles don't hold any trouble back sell them all your troubles praise God well doesn't the Bible say we have not because we ask not see pour all of it out you know God can do something amazing we didn't expect God can he can do great things praise God so we see the complaint verse three now here's where we start to see the wisdom when you complain when you complain remember God knows what you're going through when my spirit was overwhelmed within me then thou knewest my path see there it is you knew my path when I was overwhelmed you know what was going to happen next God knew so this is to instruct us when we're overwhelmed God knows the next answer God knows what's coming around the bend God knows the next turn praise God in the way wherein I walked have they privately laid a snare for me so David says I know there's traps out there but God knows my path Hallelujah Church remember we talked about that we're either in a temptation right we just got out of a Temptation or we're coming up to another Temptation so Church there's snares that we're going to come to eventually right so let's remember no matter no matter what we feel when we're overwhelmed God knows all about it God's going to bring us through it praise God tell God all about it what does this feel like what does this trap look like tell God all about it but no God is going to bring you through it praise God look at verse 4. here he's alone I looked on my right hand and beheld there was no man that would know me oh where's my right hand man where's where's Jonathan he's not there now for us that are married where's my wife well she's not there to help me in this time where's my husband he's not there to help me in this time it's just you and God praise God David's Bender and the church said he's looking for a strong man where's my mighty man when I need him where's that Mighty Guy he's not there it's all alone Refuge failed me so I had no protection I had if there was no place I could go to find peace or comfort no man cared for my soul ever feel like that nobody cares about me remember nobody cares for me where's all my friends where's all the church at David could have said where's the prophet where where's the priest where where's all my helpers where's my dad where where's my brothers where's my mighty Brothers they're so much greater than me so much bigger than me where's everybody at see it's okay to tell God the conditions that you feel it's okay to tell them verse five and six I cried into the Lord unto thee oh Lord I said Thou Art my refuge and my portion the land of the living amen my portion attend unto my cry for I am brought very low deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than I I'm weak and I'm low look at that what a condition to be in I don't feel strong in today's service I don't feel strong today facing what I gotta face I feel low I feel discouraged I don't feel like I'm on the Mountaintop anymore that's when God wants to hear your prayer praise God I'm low I'm weak verse 7. bring my soul out of prison that I am I pray that I may praise thy name the righteous shall Compass me about for Thou shalt deal bountifully with me so here we see request hear receive Faith here we see hope praise God God's going to deal with me graciously praise God I'm going to come out of this and God's going to bless me I just got to get through it see so here's it's so here's here's what we learn tell God all the situation tell God all the problems tell them every single one but then at the end take hope and remember he knows what you're going through he's going to bring you out and you're going to be better after the trial praise God your spiritual life is going to be more Bountiful I'm going to have more joy after I get out of this I'm gonna have more Thanksgiving I'm going to have more long-suffering once I get done with this praise God but it's okay to be discontent Lord I'm not happy with this I look around nobody's with me I'm low I'm weak things are falling apart but I know you're going to bring me out of this I know it's just a season hallelujah thank God this too shall pass right those famous words Glory brother man was talking about job's wife and job's wife trying to convince him oh and then his friends were his three friends his miserable comforters were coming to discourage him and they said job you might as well make a confession because you've sinned because God wouldn't let him righteous man be tormented like that now think about what we just read with David he's all alone he's being hunted down he's got a bounty on him he's low he's weak no friends nobody's there but God does let a righteous man be tormented like that now I'm not talking about devil torment that's a devil possession is a different thing fear hath torment that's a demon possession right or that's a complex where someone won't let a demon Spirit leave their mind and it needs to get cast out that's what I'm not talking about I'm talking I'm not talking about that I'm talking about trials you go through right and you're trying to keep the faith you're trying to be strong you're trying to be a faithful Christian God does let us go through torment see that that things happen to us because we sin but sometimes it's testing a saint instead of chastening a sinner okay so sometimes it's a test praise God and remember I read that verse I read that on uh Romans Romans 8 on Sunday nothing shall separate us from the love of God how many still believe that praise God and remember again that means God's love is going to let some people go through a famine God's love is gonna let some people be persecuted some people die by the sword or face a gun God's love is going to do that but God's love will never forsake them praise God like brother Adam said God was with Jonah and the ship in the whale God's with you if the swords pointing at you or the gun's pointing at you God's still with you praise God God's with you if there's no food on your table right or there's no money in your bank account God's still with you praise God it may be a test and nothing can separate us from the love of God now this here's the source of my article or a source of my sermon I come across as I just typed in you know David's prayers of complaint and it's a beautiful article beautiful now this article says about one-third of the Psalms are laments which is like Lamentations Jeremiah wrote that book right or passionate grief or sorrow now don't don't answer yes or no don't say anything out loud but does that match your life a third of your life I hope not I don't think it matches my life because God has really blessed us in America and God's given us a real spiritual lovely Church now the hardest times in my life maybe my wife and I would agree probably is when we had difficult people in the church that had evil spirits on them that's been the hardest times of my life since I came on the message right but isn't that interesting out of 150 Psalms 50 of those are about lamenting and and complaining and expressing grief you know praying about enemies praying about trials passion griefs passionate griefs all these troubles all these Hard Times a third of them think of that a third of your life or just think every three years so if 2022 is good and 2020 was good well 2020 was probably bad for everybody do that 2020 was that lament here okay so then 2021 would be good 2020 uh so 2021 good 2022 2023 is going to be bad every three years that's the ratio that we're given here in the Psalms but of course that doesn't apply but just uh just take it as a perspective David went through 13 years maybe of running from Saul was it Joseph two years in prison if I'm not mistaken two years in prison yeah the baker forgot about him for two years was it Baker yeah for the butler the baker was saying okay brother okay thank you is that right honey you always give me the right answer right so think about that a third of them difficult times David went through you know either way we still got we have still reasons to praise the Lord right either way we should find reasons to pray that's why I love that song we still got a reason to praise no matter what trial we're going through God still wants us to praise His name Hallelujah to teach us and teach us to look past You Know Have Eyes of Faith right eyes of Faith program says like egos can look up and they can see a mile away right we ought to be able to look up by faith we ought to be able to look up and look at this Bible and this Bible These Wings of the Bible ought to raise us up and we can see beyond our trials although it's but even but when you're in the midst of it yes tell God all about it that's that's that's quality time for you and God talking right that's quality time in your relationship with your dad your father your spiritual father tell them all about your troubles like that song says let's have a little talk with Jesus tell them all about our troubles praise God that's what David did I poured all of it out to God and he heard My Cry no just have your Bibles ready here um this article I just copied this no the the article just gave the the the the the chapters I'm gonna actually read the verses so go to since we're there go to Psalm 140 verse 10. we see anger in this Psalm anyone ever been angry before and just uncontrollable David wrote a song about anger and now here's how you see he's angry now in verse 1 Deliver Me O Lord from the evil man preserve me from the violent man now I'm going to skip down to verse 8. Grant now oh Lord the desires of the wicked further not his Wicked device lest they exalt themselves say la as for the head of those that Compass me about let the Mischief of their own lips cover them now here's verse 10 let burning coals fall upon them think about that that's anger right there I want fire to fall on these enemies that's called indignation that's called wrath let burning coals they're going to be they're going to die right burning coals fall on them sounds like Sodom and Gomorrah in one way let them be cast Into the Fire throw my enemies into a fire can anybody relate to anger issues right David could say Amen I've got some real anger issues David help me brother right and throw them into deep pits that they rise not up again I never want to see this person again Lord throw them in the deepest pit so I never see that person again so there you go there you see some anger a song about anger did God still love David we showed you two we showed you on Sunday God took David's sins and put him behind his back I'm not going to show you these David because this is the evil you've done but I'm gonna I'm gonna be merciful I'm gonna take it out of your side and my sight I'm gonna put your anger fear Psalm 69 verse 3. now again you can read these whole chapters I kind of want to get through this thought I'd like to be done it's almost eight o'clock already wow psalm 69. verse 3. Psalm of David now look at this Save Me O God for the waters that are come into my soul ever seen ever seen a car sink in water how the water just rushes into there that's what David said my soul's like that just like water trials pouring in I'm filling up with stress and and distress and anger and fear it's just pouring in I sink in deep mire anyone ever had any dreams of sinking I've had lots of dreams of sinking or drowning where there's no standing I cannot get a foothold to stand on in this trial right I am coming to deep Waters where the floods overflow me I'm weary of my crying my throat is dried my eyes fail while I wait for my God I've cried so much I'm tired of crying right verse 13. but as for me my prayers unto thee O Lord an acceptable time o God in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvation so see he expresses his most hard trials but then he says Lord my prayers still coming to you praise God see I'm complaining I'm discontent about all this going on it's floods of Trials are coming in but my prayer is still going to you verse 30. I will praise thy name I'm sorry the name of God with a song and will Magnify Him with Thanksgiving Hallelujah see it's the fear I'm sinking and those are some of the worst dreams right I was telling my I'm telling somebody I just had another dream I was in the band I'm driving my kids in the van and we got coach going up this little Hill and acacia's like Daddy you can't make it I'm like I can make it up the hill I haven't gone off Hills like this before but as I got on the hill got steeper and steeper until I got perfectly 90 degrees and I'm like and I just got to the spot where I'm just starting to come down I'm like uh girls and I woke up I didn't feel good when I woke up that's fear beer I'm sinking there's no bottom so that doesn't sound like Satan in the millennium he's casting a bottomless pit sinks for a thousand years right fear these are these are feelings and experiences we battle but he said in the midst of that fear while I'm sinking my my voice will call unto God hallelujah and God will hear my prayer how about confusion Psalm 102 verse 1. ever been confused why is this happening what what what what is God doing here what's going on this was not in my schedule I didn't schedule this Psalm 102 verse 1. hear my prayer oh Lord and let me Let My Cry come unto thee let's go down to verse 12 and 13. like I said I could read all of it but it just takes too long but thou O Lord shall endure forever and thy remembrance unto all generations Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time for the time to favor her yea the set time is come praise God so confusion I might have wrote that one down wrong oh yeah I'm sorry I was verse two y'all started there hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble incline thine ear unto me in the day when I when I call answer me speedily I mean that may not be the one church so I'm sorry but I'll get to one for sure that has one the song We sang I told Malachi we're going to sing Psalm 42 loudest praise because that chapter is full of questions right it's full of confusion where is God right so yeah I'm sorry that may be been the wrong chapter desolation now this is striking Psalms Psalm 22 this is of course the chapter of Jesus crucifixion David by Vision experienced the crucifixion as far as we know David's bones were never broke David's bones never stared at him it was prophetic of Christ's death on the cross psalm 22. my God my God why Thou forsaken me none of us can ever pray that now you could pray this Lord I feel like I'm forsaken but you never were but it's okay to tell God your feelings and the church said you understand it's okay to say I feel like that it's okay I'm having some of these symptoms like I feel like I'm drowning but you really are not drowning right you know I feel like I'm forsaken but I'm really not forsaken tell God your feelings why are thou so far from helping me look think about that I don't feel close to God God feels A Million Miles Away and from the words of my roaring he's roaring shouting screaming now verse 6 he said but I am a worm and no man look how low he is I am a worm and no man this is total desolation have you ever thought that I'm worse than an animal I'm just a worm you ever thought that I've never got there now I've looked at my sin and I've looked at my shortcomings I think well I'm I'm nothing I thought that before but he's so just he's so desolate he said I'm a worm I'm not even a man and yes this is David a king a man after God's Own Heart verse seven let's go there for the king trusteth in the Lord and through the mercy of the most high he shall not be moved now go down to verse 24. I'm sorry I'm in the wrong I was in the wrong yeah I'm in the wrong chapters forgive me Psalm 22. I read the wrong verse Psalm 22 7 I'm sorry I was reading chapter 21 verse 7. forgive me so I'm 22 7. all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him sing he delighteth him now look you have two things there the people the the Sinners know God didn't answer David yet and then they mock him so he's got a double trouble they know he's cried out to God they've heard David pray God didn't answer yet it wasn't an instant miracle which most prayers are instant Miracles right right and then now they start mocking him they pile it on top of him now the closest I've ever had is that when I played college football and we would visit another school and they would mock me and they'd say look at you know they look look at these guys you guys stink and you got they'd Mock and make fun of us of course they do it on online all the time too I get on YouTube all the time too um just total mocking and and you know one time a guy I was never forget at Miami Ohio there was probably 20 or 30 000 people there I don't know I was you know doing sports with them the whole game of football and he walked up he said you blankety blanket he blank you don't even belong on the practicing on the practice team is the worst players on the team so he's saying you're the worst of the worst and I thought I had a pretty good game that game actually but he was cussing me out I looked at him I was already Christian I said you know what Jesus loves you and he literally he was talking he just went like this and walked away so he must have been raised in church and he knew better I was like where are you at now bro I said Jesus loves you that's all I said I had enough just like David I in the midst of that trial that was a very small trial all so I can think of was Jesus I didn't want to curse him back I I want to bless people I don't want to curse people desolation now David's in Desolation verse 24. for he hath not despised nor abhorred the Affliction of The Afflicted now look at that God is Not despised nor abhorred the Affliction of The Afflicted in other words God's allowing you and us to be afflicted neither hath he hid his face from him God's not hiding his face from you but when he Cried unto him he heard him praise God so God heard me when I cried he just didn't answer me when I wanted him to I don't know if I'm gonna have time to get to okay let's go quickly here let's go to repentance Psalm 51 you're familiar with this one after Bathsheba same with Bathsheba and Uriah verse 1 have mercy on me o God according to thy loving kindness now look he just murdered a man right committed adultery he said ask me for mercy and he thought about God's loving kindness I'm a murderer I'm an adulterer but God's loving according unto that multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me throughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me now go down to verse say verse 8. make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice now look at this God didn't do anything wrong David's the one who murdered but David makes it feel like my bones have been broken now I've broken just one bone one time I think it was more more of a ligament and I could I could I couldn't move my shoulder and David said you've broken my bones yet David's the guilty one yeah right who's had a broken bone before actually I fractured my lumbar so yes I have had another fracture yeah and there's there's no other times I broke or have been hurt those have been the worst pains ever fractured vertebrae broken bone it was sticking up like this out of my skin there I heard a crack heard it snap and I couldn't even move it and David's saying my sin has caused me to feel like I have broken bones in other words like I'm paralyzed right and David says you've broken my bones well it's it's the conviction of the holy spirit that he feels praise God and thank God that God did that thank God he could feel that praise God but it wasn't God that did that it was God's convicting power but David brought it upon himself I just want you to see that that's what repentance should feel like God I'm broken restore the joy so see in the midst of complaining remember ask God restore my joy restore my strength amen take not your Holy Spirit from me let the Holy Spirit follow me again Hallelujah amen disappointment whoever who's ever had a disappointment Psalm 74 verse 1. Psalm 74 verse 1. Mass skill of asaph oh God why hast thou cast us off forever look at that he feels like God's forsaken our whole church why does thine anger smoke against the Sheep of thy pasture so he feel he feels God is angry with us and God has totally left all of us I'm disappointed so I got a typo there verse 10 and 11. oh God how long shall the adversary reproach shall the enemy blasting thy name forever why withdraw thou thy hand even thy right hand pluck it out from thy bosom you've taken your hand from me right I don't see your power how long that's quite a question how long do I have to wait God disappointment I didn't think God would have to wait this long it's okay to tell God that just end it with some praise and thanksgiving Hallelujah just end it with some I know you heard me Lord I know you're there I know it's going to get better eventually but it's really hard to go through this and then depression you know David was depressed I think this was David Psalm 88 verse 3. last one then we'll move on to another Psalm here this is a song or psalm for the sons of Korah it doesn't say David okay but anyways verse 3. Psalm 88 verse 3 4 5. sorry for my soul is full of troubles talk about depression I'm full I'm not full of testimonies I'm full of trouble I got nothing to testify right now have you ever been in that condition where I ask people to come testify and you don't have anything to testify about never felt like that that's how this writer's feeling all I got is trouble I have nothing to say that's good and my life draweth nine to the Grave I feel like I'm gonna die I feel like death is knocking up at my doorway verse 4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit I am as a man that hath no strength free among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave whom now remembers no more and they are cut off from thy hand thank God verse 7. thy wrath life hard upon me and thou has Afflicted me with all thy waves Sila okay so we're gonna get to that pretty soon here a waves David calls it waves it's one wave after another right one wave after another I feel depressed because it's just one wave after another one breaker after another all right go to Psalm 42 let's read through this whole chapter very short this is the one we sang about today how many know that everybody's all happy and rejoicing right that song that's because the song ends with the loudest praise right I'm going to give him the loudest praise verse 1. and two as the heart panted after the water Brooks so my or so panteth my soul out for the old God so I'm longing for God my soul thirst is for God for Living God When shall I come and appear before God so the question is when God I'm hungry for you but when am I going to have the spirit poured out on me like we've been preaching when I'm hungry for Revival and the church said but when when is it well I'll just let you know ahead of time God doesn't tell him when God expects him to wait church God expects us with weight verses three and five so look at these questions it's okay to pray these questions when God where and why verse 3 my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually send to me where is thy God when I remember these things I pour out my soul in me for I had gone with the multitude I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holding down think about that he's going to church everybody's happy but he's not he's pouring out a soul God they're so happy I'm not so happy verse five why are thou cast down on my soul all these people are rejoicing and I'm not rejoicing and why are thou disquieted in me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance amen it's okay to say I'm hungry for God I want God to pour it out but when is it going to happen where is it going to happen and why hasn't it happened yet praise God everybody else seems happy everybody else seems like they're on cloud nine and they're rejoicing they're on the Mountaintop when am I going to get to the Mountaintop it's okay to pray this unto God it's okay to say God I'm discontent when is it going to happen where is it going to happen verse 6 and 7. and if he come to see me he speak of vanity I was disarming the wrong chapter again man I keep jumping over the wrong time oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan unto the land I'm saying uh and of the hermanites from the hill mizar deep cough unto deep at the noise of thy water spouts all thy waves and thy Billows are gone over me okay so we see at least two meanings here brother random uses the spiritual meaning of like this he says like the Deep calling to the Deep the noise of thy water spouts in David in other words if there's a deep in here calling there's got to be a deep out there to respond to that call in other words how many believes that you'd like to have a closer walk with God raise up your hand all right Harmony believes that he's God's A Healer raise up your hand well now if you've got something new telling you that there's got to be something out there to respond to that crave so that's how brother M uses it in the spiritual longing a deep inside of you call us out to God so there's got to be a deep to respond that's one way to apply this but there's another way to apply it it's the application of waves that just come over you right trials deep calls and deep in other words the Deep sound of one wave that's what the Bible says Billows look at this billows there in verse 7. all thy waves and thy Billows are gone out for me so these these Billows these waves have voices and they speak trial after trial and it's deep calling unto deep right it's trial after trial that's what David's saying this is coming over me I want to be happy with every church but I'm going through trials and deep causing the Deep each of these waves calls it another one it's like calling saying more in church don't you know that's how Ways work just one after another praise God David's saying my trials are unending they're difficult trials where are you God one wave seems to speak to the other send another child send another way send another wave this is David's life and there's noise there's voices to these water spouts there's voices to these Billows these strong waves verse 8 yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime so the trials feel like wave after wave but then he's convinced God's love will return and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life what are Breakers Breakers are heavy sea waves we felt like the waves now I've only been out in the ocean a few times twice when I was in college we went on to Florida on spring break and did some Habitat for Humanity there's a couple times I almost drowned because I didn't understand the waves you go out there and you swim out there and you try not to get bit by jellyfish or whatever and there's a couple times I wasn't ready for the wave I come up by the ocean I wasn't ready and knocked me over and I got a whole mouthful of salt water that's the nastiest stuff you're ever going to taste and I I felt I just got knocked over I just wasn't ready for it and David's saying that's what my trials are like breaker after breaker Billow after Billow knocking me over I think we took Lydia out in the Atlantic one time I think she don't remember that well maybe she does she got a good memory verse 8 9. so we see God's loving kindness but look in verse 9 I will say unto God my rock why hast thou forgotten me see look it's still a good testimony God's my rock but why I know God's a rock I know God's my Foundation I know God's my strength but why why have you forgotten me why do I go mourning because of the oppression of my enemy why am I the one morning why look in this chapter we have when where why all these questions do you think God's afraid of your questions of course not does God want to hear your questions God don't expect us to be super Christians all the time that's kind of like a cliche yes we want to have Supernatural strength and Faith but we don't have it all the time in those moments it's okay to be honest with God verse 10 and 11 let's finish this here as with a sword in my bones my enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me where is thy God I thought you're a Christian I thought you prayed I thought God heard your prayers verse 11. why are why art thou cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted Within Me hope thou and God for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God see there's questions where why how but at the I love at the end of the song he says but yet there will come a time when I will praise God God won't leave me desolate God won't leave me in this this isolated condition God won't leave me here and it's okay to pray and tell God about that it's okay to express your discontent this doesn't feel right where's where's the Revival where's the answer to my prayer why is this happening a man of God expressed that and he but he ends it by saying I know God will bring me out of it praise God I'm almost done here I think here's another one where brother Adam says when the Deep calls into the deep it takes more than joining a church takes more than shaking hands with the preacher it takes more than living a good straight life it takes something to satisfy inside of you that pours down from God into the soul see that's what we need here tonight we all need to love God and worship God until we're satisfied in our soul praise God to get out of the Mind battles get out of the trials to overcome uh the waves that Rush In And forget about that for a while and let God satisfy our soul he said the Deep calls to the Deep he says at the noise of thy water spouts O Lord the Deep calleth to the Deep Amen Let God cry out to God for satisfaction and God will satisfy your soul praise God amen Proverbs so I'm done with the Psalms here now just for a few moments we'll try to finish up here I love this verse leina wait a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous spoil not his resting place for a just man Flawless seven times and Rises up again but the wicked shall fall into Mischief Now what's the meaning of seven well seven means what completion so a just man falls completely ever completely embarrass yourself at least I got some laughs I didn't get any amens of course we've all embarrassed ourselves at times this means you just you you completed the uh the actions of following right you've just you messed up you've done wrong a just person does this right adjust one because this is showing a contrast here's a just person a say person and here's a lost person the the same person does fall seven times sometimes we make a complete failure of ourselves we embarrass ourselves completely but we never stay down we never stay embarrassed because we know there's a sacrifice to take away our embarrassment praise God we don't stay that way but we feel that way I love it see but the wicked Fallen to Mischief in other words they get addicted to a sinful lifestyle they don't rise up after they fall so they stumble and fall into their sin whether it's fear or like we said desperation anger desolation feeling abandoned alone they fall on that and they just remain in that they keep going over that then they get that takes them into a mischievous lifestyle or a sinful lifestyle but a Christian Falls and then he gets back up and says I'm not going to stay in that that's why I love coming to the altar or you can pray at your chair I love how you can get on your knees and spiritually you can cast it on God and you can raise up and say I'm walking out of here Victor I'm walking out of here not falling I'm walking out here rising up and I've got Victory praise God you fall seven times right so in other words a just man is battling to be just Hallelujah a righteous person battles seven times to be righteous Hallelujah if you finish the verse remember God will not let allow me to come into a Mischief or addiction Hallelujah Hallelujah if I say an evil word against somebody and I Repent of it God's not going to let me be a gossiper right if I think a lustful thought God's not going to let me become an adulterer right right if I accidentally take something that doesn't belong to me God's not going to let me become a thief see God is gracious we fall but God puts in our heart to raise up praise God and not go on that path we won't go in the path of mischievousness right but we'll look where we are when we're down when we're down we should pray and say our discontent Lord I'm discontent with this and this I don't understand why where when how it's going to happen but I know I can I can pray and you can hear my voice praise God Amen thank God Amen because remember Church you're fighting the greatest battle ever fought against your worst enemy yourself your flesh and Satan right and demons powers of Darkness Paul said he did things he hated he hated the sins that he did brother random said I made thousands of mistakes in a year but he needed daily Revival I put that video out about the raspberry Revival and somebody was all self-righteous and they said I don't even know what you're talking about Revival I just walk with God every day I'm like well you apparently haven't been a Christian longer than two minutes okay maybe 10 minutes I said I feel sorry for you that's what I said I said I feel sorry for you did you know brother man I'm taught you need a Revival every day uh crickets no no reply see people just want to be critical oh you don't you don't know what it means to be revived you don't know what it means to be discouraged or depressed like David was to feel like you're sinking my life is sinking is going down what what's going to happen what's around the next corner what's going to happen next year you don't know what that's like but then God to give you hope and say it's gonna be okay praise God I said you haven't been serving God very long and it's my guess you've never been serving God because all those he loves he chastens he rebukes all those that He Loves so how could they be saved I don't know it's in God's hands God knows it's a spirit of Pride I think remember again Peter fell a righteous man falls seven times Peter fell into segregation and Jesus said you forgive your brother not seven times but 70 times seven now I want to end with this I think this might be the last thought yeah that's the last thought I want to close with this you know I just want to balance church this this idea here of yeah I was so blessing brother cam would come and preach I just want to just share this last thing here as we close here you know it's it's just what I've found as a Christian I need to balance feeling secure but also I gotta balance feeling humble as well right if we go to side if we go too far on the side of humility I'm nothing I fail I fall short every day that's false humility right humility is just like I'm under God and I'm going to follow God right that's humility I'm going to obey God today God I'm gonna trust God today I'm going to take God's way not my that's humility but see people getting a false humility oh I'm nothing I'm a failure I can't do anything that's a false humility but then also people can seem so secure that it becomes prideful like you've heard people say well I'll never struggle with that how can that person struggle with that and yet they'll come struggle with that a few years later don't say you won't church because you're going to find out you will like I love that scripture the Bible Jesus said you can rebuke Satan and say return no more into him but that doesn't mean he's not going to come back and knock on your door like I told you with all my addictions with tobacco or whatever even movies or sports like I'm free from them they're never coming back but they still come knock on my door you watch this game or do you wanna look I mean how many times how many times there's a there's a a cigarette just on just on the ground it's barely smoke it's barely even smoked and my flesh would be like oh pick that up and smoke it I would have done that when I was a sinner that's gross but I would have done that or I would have stole it from the store that's how awful I was I was awful rank sinner I'm just a sinner but see it's going to come back but I'm thankful Jesus said he'll enter no more into you praise God that don't mean he's not coming back he's going to come back but you got the right to say Satan you're kicked out and you're not coming in praise God so we got to balance this this false security with real security and we also have to have real humility not false humility and so when brother you know uh so we want to be we have to remember this again I look at look at it like your three parts of your being we're secure in our soul but we got to be humble in our spirits and our body I know it's very simple but in the same week cam after cam came I had a brother that uh he asked me he was so battling in his mind he's like uh it's like I don't even know if I'm saved you know I don't even know um I hear people say you know he said there's people in the church that talk so highly like they're never going to fall they never sin and I said brother I said brother Branham said he couldn't prove his name was on the Lamb's Book of Life he said God could use me as a tool for evil now look how humble that is he's a prophet he's seen thousands of visions but he says he's so still humble enough to say I can't prove my names in the Lamb's Book of Life and God could use me for evil he said because we're saved by faith right and so that's that's what I told the brother he said oh that helped me so much brother man was so humble in his mind in other words he never got so lifted up like I'm the greatest I'm the strongest nothing can ever touch me just give it a few years and a lot of things are going to come touching you a lot of Temptations are going to crawl up and try to try to tempt you right so the same week this brother's asking me how can I be humble you know or how can I even make it I said I don't even feel like in my mind so you got to be humble in your mind and then I love how brother cam came and preached to encourage us you know when we're when we're not as diligent or faithful brother Cam said as we are we got to remember I already was a son or daughter of God before the foundation of the world so that's the confidence you have to have you have to have that security that I I know I was chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world but yeah I got to be humble in my mind and say Lord let me keep my mind just focused on you we have to have both we're saved by grace through faith we're satisfied with Christ but we're seeking more of Christ how did I say to our feet praise God musicians can come so I hope by now by God's grace you understand how to complain like David did how to complain without getting into a sinful attitude in church I hope this was helpful to somebody by God's grace I I've just kind of been strangely pulled this way and I always wanted to preach on David's Psalms so and I didn't even get to all of them there's so many more where David is saying where are you God does God hear me I just thought this would be a nice encouragement if we're going through dark times if we feel like we're hiding in a cave if we feel like storms and Billows of Life are rushing into us trying to drown us there is hope Hallelujah there is Victory Hallelujah and as the Bible said God hears Us in every one of our prayers a just man falls seven times do you mean brother Jess you fall seven times I sure do but I don't I don't stay down we can't stay down we gotta rise up praise God Rise Up in Jesus name let's have a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight Lord God where there's so much inspiration in these Psalms look at
