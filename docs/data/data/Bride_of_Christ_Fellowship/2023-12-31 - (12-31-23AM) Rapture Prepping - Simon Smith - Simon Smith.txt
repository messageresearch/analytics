========================================

but if you could let's go to the scripture here I guys so we had a little fellowship at the at the house this uh yesterday and uh you could turn me me turn to Daniel or Deuteronomy three and then so brother cam like brother can you do this okay so you know I don't know about you brother Jess but I get stressed out when you have to do another service but Jess but Jesse's been doing this for a long time I'm not a pastor so I don't I do like once or twice a month that's it it's like okay okay and then uh when it's time you know a little stressed out so I was struggling I was like Lord why do I bring to your children here and brother Cam's like well let's just have at your house so I had quite a few people in the house yesterday and uh we had just a nice Fellowship there amen but but C wanted to do a study to keep it focused on the word obviously and not just messing around talking about work or whatever but just a word based study so amen uh the Lord kind of I feel like the Lord showed me a couple um powerful quotes that we'll he he at the end and just something to emphasize uh the sincerity uh the carefulness amen we must have with what God gave us um yes we want to now surely all of us you know we're all have faults and failures and we've fallen short many many times I know I have and we are trusting for the blood of Jesus Christ for those things you know yes um but in this day uh I have not realized until yesterday but there's been a great um thing placed upon us um in the message of the hour maybe like a a real warning if I could say it like that and we'll get that by God's grace today Lord will so amen and then tonight like brother Jesse said if if you would like you could do a little Thailand update there and things went really well um but we'll share those things we're doing tonight and I trust that' be a blessing so if we could turn to Deuteronomy 3 and we'll start at Verse 18 here and I got a little bit of reading here but I just want to I want to read this you're be standing here all the way probably to 29 so from 18 says and I commanded you at that time saying the Lord your God hath given you this land to possess it you shall pass over armed before your brethren and the children of Israel all that are meat for war but your wives and your little ones and your cattle for I know that ye have much cattle shall abide in your cities which I have given you until the Lord hath given rest unto your brethren as well as unto you and unto and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God hath given them Beyond Jordan and then shall you return every man unto his possession which I have given you and I commanded Joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen all to the Lord your God ha done unto these two kings so shall so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whether thou passest amen ye shall not fear them for the Lord your God shall fight for you and I besought the Lord at that time saying oh Lord God thou Hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness and thy Mighty hand for what God is there in heaven or in Earth that can do can do according to thy works and according to thy might yes I pray thee let me go over now notice what God as as he they defeated the two kings and Moses saw that God was with Israel and he's like man I want to go in I I want to go in this land with them so he besought the Lord he says I pray thee let me go over and see the good land that is beyond Jordan that goodly mountain in Lebanon but the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes and would not hear me and the Lord said unto me let suffice thee speak no more of me unto me of this matter get me up into get thee up into the top of Pisa and lift up thine eyes Westward and northward and Southward and Eastward and behold it was and With Thine Eyes for Thou shalt not go over this Jordan but charge Joshua and encourage him and strength strengthen him for uh he shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inherit the land which uh Thou shalt see so we Abode in the land in the valley over against bethor um if we could then real quick here turn to Hebrews 11 so it might be a little bit of everything here in this little study I just but we trust it is a blessing Hebrews 11 and 5 115 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God amen amen so let's say a word of prayer Hallelujah bow our heads humble our hearts dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you and Lord so been so good and so kind Hallelujah so marvelous so longsuffering yes Jesus every breath every good thought every little blessing every trial that looks rough every thing we have to go through Lord is for our good Lord you saw it from the foundation of the world that this is how you train up a child Lord and Lord you wanted children Lord and you decide to have children even in this day in this hour Lord and Lord You're training us up even right now Lord for a final battle here Lord a final test and Lord God we want to come and pass the test Lord God lord we need your spirit Lord we need your word and Lord God we want to be uh LED of you Lord in all things Lord may you brighten the paths Lord may you bring forth light as our we take step after step Lord God and Lord lead our pastor brother Jesse There Lord strengthen him God lord uh give him wisdom Lord to minister Lord to the flock and Lord May the flock be uh hungry God lord and stay in the pasture Lord and not get close to the edge or the perimeter of this uh enclosure Lord God but Lord just stay right in the word we love you bless the saints of God lord yes Jesus Lord help me Lord to bring forth this little thought God lord may you speak tonight this morning Lord we love you in the name of Jesus Christ amen seated sorry at the portion of scripture there in Deuteronomy is gu I've never when when we get to it you'll see why it's so important um so this uh morning connect something just dropped off let's see here this is see anyhow um the Lord's been so good he's kept us this whole year amen and we could literally take a piece of paper each one of us I could take a a blank sheet here and pass it each one and you could start from today yesterday and start writing the testimonies throughout the year of everything that God has protected you from everything he's brought to you every and then even that think about every Revelation you've heard over this Pulpit every Revelation you've been at home and read in the scripture and listen to the tapes and uh things that God has shown you and um it's uh it's you can't match it I mean he's been so good uh and I'll say with this the the spiritual food is by far more important than anything natural we could take because it's the spiritual food that gives us faith that raises our belief that all things are possible that he is the same yesterday today and forever and that God is going to perform his good W work and his Good Will in your life amen amen and I don't believe as the song would say I don't believe he's brought us this far to leave that's right amen wait a second he called us out of denomination he called us out of the world to miss a Rapture SS of God I believe that God has called you to make this Rapture amen and I believe we're going to make this Rapture because I there's what else why would I I don't think any of us are last year we all believe the same word and we're pressing towards it we want to be found in that number now there's a great challenge this this whole life here since you've heard the message U or or the the the the word of God for this hour there's been a challenge we have a challenge now to believe it or to doubt it to reject it those sort of things and then uh other things come with that challenge as well uh so this morning I'd like to teach Maybe by God's grace I don't know how long this willo I actually have a lot of slides but um the last 15 or so or maybe something I could just touch and go maybe however but uh I I want to teach on this Rapture prepping so um I I believe we're close uh you there's just something stirring this I like this there's something holding me there's something keeping me from just who knows whatever the the devil could anoint me to do or however or pull me out of this gospel but God has kept me the entire time he has kept you this entire time and because why because there's something about this word there's something that's different when I was denomination they we went through the same old studies every year money and finances and Co dating and and and and and romance and this in the in the in the church you hear those things and it's just a it's just a a circle a spiral just going around the mountain again just the same old things and the I'll never forget the one day I was sitting in there and I the thought came to me and this was when I was really trying to be Chris I said is this all there is in the Bible and that's when the Lord started hungering that where did that thought come from it had to come from the Lord Jesus Christ and then I started seeking the Lord and say Lord where is what is the truth and then he brought this and now all my questions I'll say this have been answered amen AMJ in fact that the Lord continually gives Revelation I was in Thailand when I get the chance the lord gave me another powerful Revelation on baptism and it was just marvelous and I I've wondered this for 20 years another another one of them things I've been long long and waited a long time to and then then a brother said a certain thing and then all of a sudden I was like there it is and I said we have so much spiritual Firepower the sword of the spirit is sharper than anything amen and it's all true so uh by God's grace let's get into this Rapture prepping so we want to be obviously we know the Rapture is the great thing promised for us in this hour is the great thing there's great and there's terrible right promised that come after Malachi 4 at the time Malachi 4 there's great things for the bride and terrible things for the Lost amen so we want to be found in the great things in the number of the Blessed people I like that and holy amen who are counted worthy to make the first resurrection there the Bible talks about in The Book of Revelation so uh in this we want to jump here to Genesis 5 and 21 just we'll just read this real quick here and we can go there to now uh verse 23 and and and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so we see a man right here and we know that he according to the scripture he was the seventh from Adam right and that seventh has a special meaning to us as our wonderful sister I can't which one said it there about what does the number seven mean and she said the seven Church ages and I was just like still I'm still flored that that just popped right out of her mouth that she knew that and praise God that's they are being taught and trained up in the Lord right that's what to class for that right sure now as we uh continue on Enoch was walked with God and he was not for God took him so he was the he was literally the one of the proving types that what the Rapture is pre-tribulation the Bible what God says I'll not punish the righteous with the wicked but he I've got something special for my bride amen something for the people who God has I'll say this God has visited with the word of God as as God himself came down to Abraham and visited him right before the destruction of Sodom gomorra that exactly that exact same thing not in the exact way but that exact same type of thing has taken place in this day God has said what a messenger and what brought us the word revealed R it yes Flash the sign then now what we have received the true word of God Amen Hallelujah and what did he say about Abraham what did he say to the two angels He says I will what how can I hide these things from Abraham right how can I hide these from my friend Abol and Abraham was chosen he was elected he was called to what be God's friend and that's exactly what we're uh I believe that we sit in the position that place this morning am God has revealed these things to us and that's a special thing God does not hide does not reveal his Secrets his mystery to just any certain kind of people he not the Bible says that we're not supposed to cast our Pearls Before Swine do you think God would cast us Pearls Before Swine I don't think so but he'll give his pearls what to his wife for you believe that is what God is trying to do here is show you he's giving your his his spiritual gifts to you putting on the ornaments what of of the Hidden man the character uh the I was like this the revealed word and I'll say and and there's one thing I don't know if I've taught this here or not um but the way that God displays love is what he Reveals His word to his wife brother brother R always alluded to him writing letters to Ma and Ma writing letters to him and he said it's just like this God there's things hidden in the scripture there's things hidden right in there that what is only revealed to his wife that only his wife can catch I'll say it like that Hallelujah right so amen so that's what we're uh believing uh by God's grace so everybody thinks that you know Enoch was some great phenomenal revelated beyond all conditions there was no one more intelligent more this or that about Enoch Enoch was just so in our minds we say oh my goodness here's the guy that made the Rapture here's the guy that took the body change here's the guy that did not see death even without the Holy Ghost that's right brother but what did it the Bible said what did it require what did Enoch uh require uh uh to make the Rapture it was only Faith Hallelujah without the Holy Ghost he only needed Faith now in this hour and in this day God has already come 2,000 years ago in a flesh and he had the spirit within him so he was not just a man right right in fact the Bible says it was the blood of God it was not Jewish blood it was the blood of God and then now when that spiritual blood mixed with the spirit of God he became he was what a different kind of creature he was the firstborn of many Brethren and the only way that you can actually get like him is to receive receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to receive his filling in your spirit and sealed off to the day of redemption right am so but we're going to need Faith to make this Rapture in this day and how are we going to get that kind of faith that kind of faith will only come from what the holy spirit amen now amen sorry when you're writing in the car you don't really get to exercise and get that you know in the morning you're just trying to you know I get to work you're trying to you start breaking up you know and feel better and getting kind of like the mo something I fresh out of the truck so no notice now what was Enoch and I believe brother Jess had taught this a long time ago and he always stuck with me justtin how Enoch was just a simple uh uh what Shepherd farmer un uneducated not nothing great in the world he was just a Simple Man yes he says but the elected Enoch Noah were shepherds Farmers humble Not educated not smart not not but knowing their God now that was the key and the only way you can know God is of god reveals himself to you amen how he going to reveal himself he's going to be in the word amen God is the word amen now that's the key right there do we know the word and I I'll just jump a little bit have we added or taken from it I want to that as like a premises right there you're going to see this thing you're going to see this at the end here by God's grace now so here's Enoch it was nothing special about him but something in them moving calling will get to that of the B so here that that moving and calling should be in you right there Hallelujah why are you here this morning why did you why did you wake up up early on a Sunday morning come to this specific assembly you could have went to a Baptist Catholic however but you decided to come here what pulled you what moved you what motivated you to come right here this morning at this specific location under that headship that believes this word amen amen that was the Holy Spirit right there I believe all my heart God has been faithful amen now now look at this it says 500 years he walked before God walking walking the light with with a testimony that everything God said he did it well I've been I've been unfaithful there okay I'm not been I've not been perfect right but that's see the difference between us and that is that we have the blood of Jesus Christ amen he covers all mistakes everything every blessing I may have missed or everything i' I've done or this or that that was a faults or however or uh cheated here lied there whatever it's all covered by the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen and I'm thankful that even now when I have been a Christian when I still fall and fail and have FAL that God is still faithful to be up there in the intercessory booth there what putting his blood on the mercy seat for what my transgressions amen and I'm the most grateful for what those iniquities of mine that are not that I that are washed away amen because every time we fall and fail there's something in my heart that says Lord God forgive me Lord God wash me one more time we got to check up every minute every hour every week every second of our days every every part of our life we've got to check up and be ready right amen amen sure that's right he says he says 500 years he walked before God walking walking in the light with a testimony that everything God said he did it he didn't displease him what the Lord said Enoch done it amen now that was the Enoch Covenant that's their type right but if you look at the Abraham the abrahamic Covenant is nothing that I had to do is something God was going to do amen and I believe if we be children of Abraham which what we are because we are able to hear the voice of God in this day that what we will believe the word of God and that will be counted as righteousness to us amen sure sure he says now he was a type of remember he says the ark is a law is a type to the Jews and the 144,000 is carried over which is Noah and his Bunch but Enoch went home just a little bit before the flood you know that so Enoch just kept walking in the light just so one day he felt his feet getting off the ground he just kept walking and walked up into Glory without even dying SS of God amen amen that really happened and that's going to happen again for you amenallah it's a promise well brother it sure does sound like far off something like in a comic book or in a movie or however but SS of God this was before comic book and movies ever took place there nothing where do you think they got the inspiration for someone to cany where do you think they got the inspiration for someone to transport telepathically or or on Star Trek and be me up Scotty right where do you think they got that they got that from there Satan is always a a mimicker he's always an impersonator of all things amen that God has and this is what and that's and remember well I don't know how but when I first started watching when I you know my dad had me watching Star Trek I was like they go or whatever and they like they disappear and they go somewhere else I'm like that's crazy man that's that's that's amazing is that impossible
