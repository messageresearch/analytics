========================================

so this has always been like a question in my mind but i think through the scriptures i found my answer by god's grace but it's got four kinds of revivals tonight if you would let's go to a verse here that might help us here let's go to psalm 138 verse 7. so on 138 percent we'll just read one verse here by god's grace we'll try to conserve the time but we're willing psalm 138 verse 7. this is my as i said it's my next youtube video i've been working on this one and writing the script and extending it out a little bit so i found four types of revival if you find it a couple more let me know about god's grace but there's at least four kinds of revivals here and this would help this would be like more like a message question like why did brother graham say this how many kinds of revivals are there has the bride had a revival yet so let's look at this here tonight joseph be a blessing to you and help you by the grace of god psalm 138 verse 7. we have of course a psalm here and it's talking about he's asking god he's trusting god to revive him in the old testament he was asking god for a revival so which revival would this be this would be a revival where in the human spirit praise god sure you couldn't have uh holy ghost-filled souls it wouldn't be a revival of the flesh right there are scriptures that talk about the revival of flesh if a person dies the bible said if they're raised up they're revived that's the king james version word there's at least four kinds actually that's five counts now there's at least five kinds of revival i forgot about the flesh so if we can let's read this here on three ready one two three though i walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth on hand against the wrath of my enemies and thy right hand shall save me god bless you maybe see that may god his blessing to read his word yeah so that just showed me there's five there's a revival of the flesh speaking of the lord jesus christ at least five different kinds of revivals i want to look at this here tonight so here's the here's the quote in question in the third seal brother graham said the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it now watch he says now she was dead speaking of course to the church okay now recently i preached all the seven thunders i think i had a question on it on sunday did i not i think i had a question on sunday i'll bet you all right good to see you sir uh so you know what i believe about the seven thunders i believe when brother graham preached the first seal and he gave us the state of the lord that was the first thunder of march of 1963 i believe the revelations on the second seal were the second thunder third and all the way through and remember church each seal has three aspects to it you have the reality form you have the revelation form and you have the symbol form praise god and so the seventh seal is the one that's mysterious brother and says he has revealed it and then one place he says he hasn't opened it yet to us okay so that's because there's no symbol for other than their silence in heaven for the space of half an hour okay of course that he taught that in one place he taught the silence in heaven meant jesus christ's body left heaven and went down to meet the saints in the air he taught that in one place so that's the way i believe it of course there's other thoughts on that and that's just the way i can see it through the scripture uh so that's the symbol the revelation form is that the the seventh seal i believe is the literal day and hour of the rapture of the bride of jesus christ that's what i believe there's numerous quotes on that of course there's other quotes on the other side of that that's the one that i believe fits the scripture and the last one is the reality form of the seventh seal that's the part that's unknown that hasn't opened up yet because no one knows the day of the hour that will not open up the father keeps that a secret until he tells the son to go down and get his bride amen praise god so uh it's mysterious yes it is mysterious but if you look to the scripture you'll certainly find the answer praise god and the mystery of god is finished in this hour praise god i believe that so the question is what does program mean the bride hasn't had a revival yet in the third seal well there's at least two things it could mean uh it could mean he was referring to the bride hadn't had those seven seals open yet to her it could mean that or it could mean uh the bride hasn't had the latter rain yet rapturing faith now according to the the context of the quote it looks like rapturing faith but it's a little bit mysterious so we'll get to that eventually but let's start in the bible praise god how many want to guess how many times the word revive is in the entire king james by a version of bible any children 13 really close 15 yeah really close the word revive is only in the scripture 15 times 13 in the old testament and then two in the new testament so let's look at the highlights now most of them in the old testament deal with how a dead a dead person was revived back to life so when in the cases where the person was dead and then restored to life like in case of elijah and different ones in the scripture their bodies were revived also samson got his he was revived when he drank the water and got his strength back you know after battling off the philistines right uh with the jawbone of a donkey there so his human strength was revived but there's numerous scriptures that speak of the revival of the human spirit and so in the old testament that's the only revival they could have as far as spiritually the revival of the human spirit right so let's look at ezra 9. malacca can you hold it up here i don't have any slides today i had a busy week this week you know with uh my wife in the hospital not the hospital but the medication there uh ezra 9 verses 8 and 9 please four kinds of revival actually i could not change it to five kinds here's at least five times there's probably more by god's grace but for the sake of this little teaching here tonight ezra 9 8 the bible says and now for little space grace has been shown from the lord our god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bond thank you lord right see what was the revival the revival was they were slaves in babylon but god moved it upon the king right to let some of them come back a little remnant in fact all that wanted to come back could come back amen and that's what we got today all those who want to come back to the day of pentecost can come back amen they will come back i'll say like that all the brides holy ghostfield things will come back to the day of pentecost experience praise god they'll know that this is that that joel spoke of amen amen when they get the holy ghost they'll say this is that praise god and the bible said peter says this which you now see and hear god has shed forth abundantly upon his children praise god amen he poured out his fear and when god pours out his spirit something happens to the person you can see it and hear it it's wine it's oil it's new life praise god it's eternal life amen i don't know your praise god it's the life that comes forth something has to happen when eternal life comes in amen oh glory thank you jesus praise god so but their revival was reviving for we had no temple we were uh we were uh slave people in babylon but now we've got a church now we got a church building amen and that was their little revival he called it little revival praise god because it was not as big as solomon's temple which they all witnessed that right the glory but they even believed the glory of the latter would be greater than the former of course speaking of the millennial temple praise god but zerubbabel's temple was much smaller right remember when they built this removal's temple and they put the capstone on with and crying grace grace the older generation was weeping because they said oh this ain't even close as big as the days of solomon but the younger group was rejoicing because they never seen a temple before and now they had a temple church so let us choose to be happy that god's doing something in our midst praise god let's let's see the spiritual aspect of that today we don't have a mega church but we got a church we got a place to worship amen and jesus is still the same he's still here today amen praise god we must rejoice whenever god doesn't move praise god as for rejoicemen they had a little revival if we've got just a little bit of number of revival we should rejoice on that praise god not be discouraged not be afraid uh not fear praise god but rejoice that god has given us a little revival praise god now i'm talking about the revival of the soul praise god that's what i'm talking about praise god amen now psalm 85 6 male 1 okay psalm 85 6 and then that's right before the text that we read psalms 85 6. four kinds or five kinds of revival that was just a fresh one there with the resurrections of the bodies will thou revive us again that thy people may rejoice in now you're here we can relate to this sometimes we come to church we don't feel like rejoicing right sometimes we get up in the morning we don't feel happy right so see how see how the old testament can really help us out here praise god we get the spot where we don't feel we really enjoy the songs anymore it's not really rejoicing uh then we start criticizing well i could do better or this person would do better if they were there you know instead of rejoicing there's a little bit of a loss of enthusiasm so he says a great prayer i know you'll revive us again so we can rejoice again praise god i know you'll stir us up again i know you'll get out of the cobwebs of unbelief and frustration and fear and doubt i know you'll clean all that and you'll give us life again we'll feel excited again we'll be encouraged again god's the god of revival praise god hallelujah praise god amen thank you jesus yeah it happens every time i come to church without a failure every time it always happens when we come to church we rejoice in the lord praise god and again i say rejoice okay now all right we read our text i'm skipping that one uh go to isaiah 57 15. i believe that's the one brother dennis mcbride uses i'm not mistaken and he kind of slipped up on brother cam last friday when i was studying i i saw a live a live stream pop up and like cam's having service on the friday night and so denniston pride was driving up to preach in michigan so he slipped by cams and cam's like let's have a service i thought that was pretty powerful hallelujah for thus save the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high holy place with him also that is of a contrite that's repented repentant and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and revive the heart of the repentant ones so we know this should shine light if we want to be revived we've got to humble ourselves we've got to repent and we've got to ask every every day god forgive me revive me let me feel life again let me feel encouraged again praise god even i repent of my uh whatever my discouragement or my depression or or my my lusts i repent of my greed i repent of my my fear i repent of all that god revive me praise god i humble myself in church that's where we'll find god in the place of humility right amen that's where we find him humbling ourselves like that song in your presence that's where i belong that's where i'm strong praise god seeking your face touching your grace in the back of the rock amen repenting of our sins hosea 6 uh verse 1 and 2 maokai can't preach this one years ago though i think uh oh that was a way back i think that's when bowen's er we're still coming by god's grace uh our wonderful sisters there uh hosea can't preach a good message on this come and let us return to the lord for he have torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up go back to verse one now how many believe god sometimes will spank you here it says he will tear you oh tear you up he'll break you down so what he can build you back up again right get the get the picture of the clip get the picture the clay right the pottery so see that as your human spirit that your human spirit is in constantly molding he's molding you right you put your hands to the clay you can mold it you know i'm not gonna go through that i haven't studied that a long time so i couldn't do it justice but i know jeremiah said take me down to the potter's house that's where you see god amen god putting water on our minds and our hearts and and molding us but sometimes church he's going to break us down so he feels defeated we feel we feel hopeless and then he'll inspire us and then some blessing will come out from god amen some blessing will come out of our our dark despair and he'll start building us up again and we'll see well god had to break me in order to build me up to make me something new praise god to make me something that i wasn't and now i can be something that i should be praise god i can be the vessel that god wants to use for the next assignment right oh my he god form me into the right type of shape the vessel that he wants to use praise god it's not according to our thinking we got to let god shape us praise god through tearing us through breaking us down through tests and trials praise god jesus learned obedience through all the victories no jesus learned no beings through the things he suffered amen and we think we're going to be uh reserved from suffering in order to obey absolutely not we have to go through some hard times we have to be broken down in order for god to build us back up again but trust god he'll revive you praise god his yoke is easy amen he will not uh he'll not break a broken ring praise god amen read amen verse 2 here's where he says it after two days he'll revive us that's right yeah speaking of the resurrection that's right it's also speaking of the church ages there's numerous types in here two days yeah two thousand years yeah after two thousand years after two days he will revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight amen hallelujah just like jesus amen a type of the resurrection of christ on the third day he rose he was revived amen hallelujah glory thank you jesus yeah after two days after two thousand years of church ages amen he'll raise the rope praise god from every generation all the saints of all the angels praise god he'll raise them up all those that overcame and did not worship the beast he'll raise them up and set them in honor as kings and priests and they shall rule and reign with christ on this earth amen thank god one day regime of politicians will not reign on this earth but the saints already on this earth hurry up praise god paul and barnabas say that silas timothy and all these godly men brother and martin luther and john wesley will rule the earth won't be rude hallelujah these evil wicked ones and these reprobates but people with character people with the rod of iron people that act and look and and behave just like jesus christ amen the messiah ruling over the messiahs [Applause] not now but after two days that's the law amen believe in church he'll raise you up great job if he raise up those uh those annuals after you know all the winter and all the snow imagine the three feet of snow we get every year you don't see the annuals but come around spring they come right back up praise god all right if god raises those up you can guarantee god's going to raise us up praise god amen let our bodies go down it doesn't matter god said he'll quicken our mortal bodies just as sure as the sun comes up every morning and the annual comes up every spring so will you and i come up and we'll see you at the general resurrection the first resurrection we'll meet our husband i'll be the master gardener in the air third day hallelujah habitat three verse one habit three verse one beautiful book in fact the very first bible study i did even before i did a water baptism bible study was on habakkuk chapter three i did that with the chapel members at the campus crusade that was my first bible study it was back in the last chapter chapter three but verse one a prayer of habakkuk the prophet unto shaigana shaganov oh lord i have heard thy speech and was afraid so in chapter one he's complaining to god in chapter two god speaks in chapter three says i'm afraid forgive me for speaking the way i did he church see how god wants to see how god wants us to be contrite that's right we'll speak harsh things and watch if if we're not careful we speech heart if we speak harsh things god's gonna tear us that's right he's gonna humble us right away from speaking too soon i've heard thy speech and was afraid oh lord revive thy work in the midst of the years in the midst of the years make known in wrath remember mercy he was crying out for wrath if you're in chapter one he's crying out for wrath and see that's what the holy spirit does it comes down and humbles you and asks instead of asking for wrath it asks for mercy glory amen hallelujah in other words he didn't see god's word remember in chapter two god assured him he says write down the vision make it sure make it plain praise god so that they that see the vision can run with it amen praise god because that vision will tear it i'm sorry the mission will come but it will not tear it it will be fulfilled praise god look just about the time habakkuk starts complaining god has to remind him i'm just about ready to fulfill my word praise god just about the time we start down if god is going to answer our prayers that's when [Applause] [Applause] and strengthens us praise god wonderful hallelujah just like he did in habakkuk amen he did that all down through the ages he's still doing it today yeah we think god's forgotten about us oh no he's right on time amen amen he's right on time he might have to break us down a little bit that's what he's got to do he's got to break us down and humble us we think we know all about it we think i'm ready for the rapture and uh yeah i'm ready for this promise to go from fast no we're not quite ready for it we need more humility we need more patience we need more temperance as i'm finding out right we're finding it out be temperate in all things the bible says true now with that habakkuk 3 verse 2 that's the end of revival scriptures in the old testament now of course remember you have some about dying and then reviving now in the new testament there's only two i'm not going to read them ones in romans uh one's in corinthians the first one is the law revived and i sin so paul was speaking about when he lived under the law he said he would sin and then he said he would hear the law and then sin would revive in him and he wanted to go against the law right your flesh the bible says the flesh is enmity against the holy spirit yes it is the flesh doesn't want to obey the word of god no but you got to bring it under subjection right so when paul hear the word sin would revive and say i don't want to believe that i don't have to do that right that's why church even after he's a christian that's why he said o wretched men that i am oh yeah how many you can how many can you relate to that sometimes you feel like a wretched person yeah yeah at least at least at least seven times a week how many days in a week i'm sorry so every day i feel like wretched man right we see our humanity you know i can so relate to paul oh wretched man that i am but thanks be to god who gives us the victory we always give [Music] and so the other one was jesus his resurrection is called a uh revival body revived okay now in the hebrew the word revive means to quicken to refresh to restore to life to cause to grow uh to to restore one's health okay so we see all these definitions now i told you there's four there's probably these five revivals now there's probably even more the fifth one that i found was just the body after it dies it can be revived like jesus's body was revived and anyone else who was raised from the dead so now there's five okay so again the question is has the bride had a revival yet okay that's the question but let's first go through there's uh there's quotes on at least uh now there's gonna be quotes on these five kinds of revival but we're just going to go through the four i'm sure i can find one find one about a body being revived from the dead i'm sure like with the boy in finland right sure dead revived sir i'm sure we could find one like that yeah but i'll go through four because that's what i was i was planning for okay so there's at least four kinds of revivals let's get back to um can you pull that scripture in first chronicles of my people which are called by my my name will humble themselves and pray can you search for those brother words even quotes that for america did you know that but we know the other side of this so let's look at the first kind of road the first revival is a national revival okay thank you good job good see when you become a teenager look how you go open levels you just went up another level now program quotes this as well if my people god's people which are called by my name shall humble themselves see that contrite there right good try and pray and seek my face instead of seeking facebook or seeking instagram right or seeking movies or seeking entertainment or seeking sports instead of seeking that seek my face amen and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven so god tells you i will listen to you if you turn away and stop listening to other things i listen to you if you listen to me praise god amen then i'll hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and i'll heal their heal their land now this is still true for israel and see that little group remember i sent that video to brother william there's ethiopians still coming to israel jewish jewish men and women still coming to israel today the 144 000 is not there yet but they're on their road yeah they're on their own all these years i mean brother a few years ago i got another uh video where the the tribe of manasseh i forgot i think they were in germany if i'm not mistaken russia i think they were russia i had a video about the sons of manasseh returning to israel so we got manasseh and different groups coming back the 144 000 are still coming back praise god and they have this promise look at israel we i got pictures from israel before 1948 and pictures from today it was a total wasteland right yeah oh yeah but now that they're calling on god they're making their prayers you should see them dance those women get in a circle and they dance around like this those israelite women and they those men get on their shoulders and they praise the lord and they got their shawls on those are real believers amen yeah and god is here in their prayer and god's poured out blessings naturally they're they're exporters of all these foods and patents they're one of the most smartest countries in the entire world praise why because some of them are humbling themselves seeking their faces whitening god hasn't wiped usa off the map yet because of your prayers right amen because of my prayers amen god sees our prayers god sees us as individuals seeking his face we've been holding ourselves and god is blessing us praise amen boundaries come so the first revival is a national revival now brother graham talks about the united states will never have a national revival i believe that i do not pray for a national revival but i do pray for little victories praise god true lord plainly says with thus saith the lord a national revival will not take place why because in the book of revelation chapter 13 verses 11 through 18 a beast rises up out of the land with two horns right oh yeah right yeah and that's the american buffalo that's right right talks like a land comes up live like a lamb but then starts talking like a dragon right and that's where all these presidents say oh they go to these united nations mean like i want to president trump when he he was at the united nations he said now we're the most greatest and powerful country there ever was and we're going to defend ourselves we're building our military greater than ever was then they give away 80 billion of it to afghanistan awful move doesn't really matter anyway it's not about natural powers it's about spiritual powers but the point was american presidents bragging about how great they are they speak like a dragon we're the great ones and see we're great all the friends have done that they're talking about how we're the greatest country and they all do it yeah and so this beast rises up and the mark of the beast will come out of this beast out of the land that's right christ god said there can be no national revival because america is the beast out of the land now brother man says in jehovah jair in 1961 now look sodom was sinners they were perverted just like the world is today great portions of this nation is completely gone is that true here we are over half the states in this union are completely gone they'll never come back new york california you name it massachusetts some of these places where it's democrat strongholds they're totally gone they're never going to come back all the all the honest people left most of the house people left all the conservatives left they're completely gone right we've got people i've heard people say they went to california and they said they didn't even look like america right and they they leave california they come back and they say it's going to be back in america because california is almost like a third world country you know just turning into awful conditions but rather said this nate portion of the nation is completely gone he said we're being honeycombed with communism and everything he says if you put a righteous president in every county in the whole united states and still be gone she'll never rise again thus saith the lord 1956 she made her fatal move now she took well on her way about three months ago that was in 1961. okay so that's why church we don't pray for our national revival in the united states but paul says we are to pray for our governments right and for people to be saved right right praise god praise god paul said that first timothy two can you pull up through america first timothy two verse one through four i exhort therefore first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving thanks be made for who all men that's why i pray for our president right i pray for all of them mainly to repent all of them all of them praise god i'm supposed to pray for the president yes you are yeah yeah bible said all men see what does that take humility right because you think oh there's no way they're going to repent well they might not but you're still supposed to pray for them because you and i don't know the beginning from the end for kings and all that are in authority all ever say oh all that's authority when was last time you prayed for nancy pelosi i prayed the other night i said god help them repent or god remove them from office i don't know we'll see it's in god's hands i'm just i'm just i was like a new church is make my request known unto god right and god let's let god do what he wants to do right now there'll be times church where we get the mind of christ like when we got the mind of christ to pray against roe v wade what did we get there other people wouldn't even pray for what have we got we got the mind of christ to pray for us amen amen they thought oh there's no way to be overturned that's okay we kept praying i kept crying at this altar right here i keep asking god being with god and then pretty soon after 49 years glory almost a jubilee praise god right before the jubilee it gets overturned why because god hears the prayers of his people praise god and not every time but sometimes we are able by prayer and the heart of god to touch the mind of god to have the mind of christ to feel the heart of god oh god help us to pray like that praise god help us to be so close to god we can feel his heartbeat amen others say well i don't even pray for the nation but yet we were that's right what's different we got the mind of christ for that one amen that's true i'm not condemning everybody else i'm just saying we got the mind of god we might miss it another time but that's one time for sure we got the mind of christ [Music] oh thank you jesus why do we pray church verse 2 that we might lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness in honor true right amen paul said pray for a peaceful life yeah that you can live honestly you don't have to steal you don't have to lie you don't have to cheat yeah right verse three for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior who will have now this doesn't mean he will but he wishes he would have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth so god god desires everybody to be saved amen so who does he need he needs believers that will pray for some people no he needs believers that will pray for all people i'm going to read the scripture praise god amen did we just read the scripture did it say pray for all men you yeah church sometimes we battle just to pray sometimes we battle just to pray for ourselves you see but the bible says make supplications make intercession that's why it's become the house of god and pray because this is a house of prayer amen we want to make it always just the house of singing and preaching but church this is the house of prayer amen hallelujah it's more than singing and preaching it's a house of prayer hallelujah amen so glad we caught the mind of christ for that glory other people spank against it i know everyone's would make any comments on youtube why are you praying for that why are you praying for that one i said well because i feel out of the lord to pray for that it wasn't my leading it was god's leading amen i love when god comes around and vindicates you like that praise god people doctor speak against you criticize you like god comes around he shows who's right praise god hi he shows you really pray through about it there you go so see church we have verses to pray within our nation for souls to be saved i know there's no national revival i know that all right but i have prayed ezekiel 9 6 malachi i'm sorry zego nine four i've prayed this and you've seen me do it those you've been around ezekiel 9 4. no i wrote down the wrong one there it is oh yeah okay thank you buddy the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark on the foreheads of who the men that signed when was the last time you cried over sin i'm not talking about your sin i'm talking about somebody else's sin right that's what moves the heart of god yeah and he says that's the one the writer with the ring horns gonna see the holy spirit entith amen hallelujah god's going to send somebody to mark all those people in jerusalem who are sighing crying against all the wickedness in the land yeah see church you got to be burdened for some sinner right that's true you got to be burned for hot fest i got to be burning for my co-workers all right different ones i can call their names right i got to be burdened for them when i see that when i see anyone doing abominations we got to be burdened for them we got to have a real sincere prayer i'm going to leave that by god's grace yes now the part where we get tested is how many times have i shouting pride for my parents and yeah i don't see a lot of moving that's okay god still sees it it might just be like we're talking about earlier we're about ready to give up and then hopefully god's going to come around god's going to come around and encourage us amen he's going to revive us amen in the midst of the years amen glory i'm waiting on it praise the lord it's all god's will it's all god's time ezekiel i love this one i recorded this one for months by the way i wrote this on a card i had my prayer clauses he go 22 30. and i sought for a man among them where's a real man in the church today god said i'm looking for a man that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap but before me for the land so god is standing here and the land is sinful here god says i need somebody to come stand in the middle and plead with me yes god forgive the land have mercy on the land god said where's anybody who's gonna come and intercede for the sinners that's what in jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever it's our duty to pray amen amen hallelujah and god he's looking for somebody saying the gap that i should destroy i found how many in the days of ezekiel he found nobody that would pray for the country shame on those people that would not pray for individuals in the country oh i didn't say national revival i said individuals now i said kings and leaders and all men the bible said see that not a national revival but for individuals right that's good look at verse 31. therefore have i poured out my incarnation upon why because nobody was interceding for them right see church god may have allowed this current administration to get in here to make people pray right to wake them up from their slumber i know this i know this current conditions are waking me up from i've been sharing it with my financial sermons these current conditions are waking me up right just attempt just being more temporary being more strict about finances could it be this is a wake-up call for god's people to pray more we'll find out pretty soon the midterms and then the next presidential election we'll find out [Music] oh don't forget yours brother said he liked eisenhower don't forget he was the president who was baptized when he was in office as a presbyterian remember that he went into office and brother brown said he liked him he would have voted for him if he could have ran again but he got baptized when he was in office brother said i like that guy there's nothing wrong with liking good men if they're good men or women right if you were the days of deborah would you like denver being a judge in the politics or not look what she did she got the holy ghost on her she prophesied we're going to go destroy and israel got the victory man a woman just come on george you can say man hey amen he's the same yesterday today and whatever they were in a backseating condition so god had used somebody he raised up a prophetess named deborah praise god that's right true and that king the israel king brother he said i won't even go unless you go oh my goodness praise god yeah that's the power of can i say it that's the power of a spirit-filled woman praise god that's right praise god when she's got the holy spirit on her and she's anointed that man follows her that's right yeah church i understand you gotta see some of those faces not jesus but that's how it wasn't that a day so what is god saying i want to find somebody who will stand the gap between god and a sinful land bless the lord and i'll if i don't find it then i'll pour out wrath that's why time is going on the bible says god has long suffering he's still saving souls why that's right this year lena was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ brother austin was re-baptized this year that's why that's part of the reason why 2022 had to happen that's part of the reason why the rapture couldn't happen last god it was year suffering he's still saving souls amen when austin shared a message with her she's like do you want to go she's like yes i'm down let's go praise god there was nothing in her heart to deny the word of god she said let's go let's live in the word of god amen [Applause] and who was praying for them the whole time charis acacia haven putting repair requests in every single week for them right and you're all witnesses is that right right you all witnesses praise the lord man see god is long suffering he wants somebody that'll stand together and cry out for sinners cry out for salvation that's what god loves amen hallelujah now church there's there's message churches now that say they're having revivals i hope i hope so that's a good thing now when i say our church isn't a revival like like some of theirs doesn't look like it like they got people dancing around shouting around almost every service you know it'll eventually cool down i've been watching their sermons for years you know it goes up like brother ray knows about time it goes up and everybody's real emotion and comes back down and then you're waiting what you're waiting for to go back up but we learned on the mountaintops and we also learn in the valleys that's right yeah praise god amen he wants to revive us i thank god for the messenger churches that have revival right at camp's church in this church we would have tremendous revival services we'd have four hour five hour services at cams one time i danced around the church for an entire hour i was dancing around praising the lord i was like david i'll dance around preach you know two hours and i go dance around the church and praising god excuse me and i'm just dancing for a whole hour i've got a choice i can be revived amen praise the lord shall i see them away they're acting now brother uh william some of their revivals that's how we were that's how we were 12 years ago when brother uh brother bill's wife died mary we were standing right next to his cast or her casket brother and he told me brother jesse i just want to thank you when you guys came to church there in 2002 he said we were in need of revival and when you guys came in those college students you sat on the front row you said that he said god brought a revival to our church that's what he told me yeah hallelujah bro i didn't even know i didn't even know william i was bringing revival to their church sure now all of our all of us college students right but and then after we left he said it kept going god started adding more young people and young people so that's how god does god's faithful he's going to test you he's going to try you he's going to bring you back he's going to he's going to answer your prayers praise god just wait on god don't give up on god he will restore our restore say the lord i'll revive my word in the midst of your years amen glory praise god so i'm thankful for these churches and messages that are having revival i've been there sure i've done that i'm looking for more too god hallelujah you may not know when you may not know how you may not know when but don't do it again amen now do it again bless the name of the lord bill says wait what 20 years or so or more for a revival that's what brother bill told me he said he saw his wife's theophany he told me that last time we seen him praise the lord he was sitting there and he heard his wife's voice and he said he saw his wife writes theophany in the kitchen wow she passed away a couple years ago how are you believing in revival amen there's the first revival there'll be no national revival but we're supposed to pray for souls to be saved anyway and god has vindicated it by answering our prayers about roe v wade absolute vindication absolute second uh kind of revival now this may be the one that will help you friends this is the one that helped me by the way the second type of revival is that the church age revival so what i mean by that there's seven church ages brother brahma was the messenger of the seven church age his ministry brought a holy ghost baptism revival i went to the church yes sir every one of those messengers was a stall in the hand of jesus christ praise god and each man would preach his message and brother and said that message would sound out from the messenger breakdown and he would teach faith amen and then they would go out and they would teach faithful men and spread like wildfire praise god amen went from one to the other to the next and spread and this is the revival that we have right now praise god praise god amen praise god we still have the revival from brother branham's ministry because it's the revival of the soul praise god like brother amen said when he came up here for the holy ghost and when you got the holy ghost when amen come up here sami just laid his head and my amen said that hand felt like it was three times bigger so one very gentle three simon's little hand felt like it was this big right well the and screaming and crying and praising the lord he's never been the same since amen it started a revival where in his soul praise god amen praise the lord amen now the quote to back this up to help you is from harvest time 64. there's lots of them but william won't be from a brother sure will be familiar with this brother and said what day are we living in we've had a 15-year revival how many can say amen to that amen he said one organization raised up none they tried to get me to make an organization brother graham on your ministry now not me i ain't talking about me i'm talking about the message of the hour the message of the day right you'll hear about him say it many times yeah god has given us a revival and it's been going on 15 years and it hasn't died down what's he talking about he's talking about the baptism of the holy ghost revival the message that god gave that star was burning praise god amen and just like the candlestick praise god just let each one each candlestick was pulling on the same oil it's the same oil the same battery the same experience the same life the same joy the same victory the same forgiveness it's the same praise god amen amen hallelujah but i said you cannot denominate this revival you cannot denominate this church because it's the life of jesus christ and it won't compromise it won't denominate it'll keep living and growing getting greater and greater [Applause] austin for 16 years as pastor and the revival keeps going on you're next buddy to get the holy ghost one of you i don't [Applause] now you will get tested and tried you will get broken down but he'll revive you again yeah oh hallelujah bless his holy name hallelujah wonderful thank you jesus amen so see you got these quotes brother man said i've had a 15 year revival it's never stopped and then he has a quote the bride hasn't had a revival yet what do you do with those quotes what do you do we got to go to the scripture if you go to the scripture you find each church age messenger he said what the spirit said to the churches that's right right and then paul paul said the things that i've learned from jesus i've talked to faithful men often yeah that they might teach others oh yes and that's how the word talks about it in great length in the church age book i didn't have time to get the quotes i was going to get the quotes he goes to great lengths to show how god reveals the message to the messenger and then he teaches the group next to him and then the group after that the next generation praise god amen amen hey man i showed you our connection by the brand right brother branham bill dow and tom brown remember show you the picture on sunday brother branham bill bill dow the millionaire tom brown brother brooks pastor tom brown's church right right but brooks was pastor and out of that came us right i got the holy ghost from brother brooks's ministry he ordained me and approached amen let's just remove what three generations removed praise god from brother ready and i'm preaching the same thing by the way i don't care what these people say i'm preaching the right message praise god amen praise god they can worship the tapes all they want but i will not bow down to any demonic deity spirit i will only worship the lord jesus christ i appreciate the truth but the things point me to the king of kings the one person the eternal person the king of kings who is the absolute and his name is not tape his name is jesus christ [Applause] eternity [Applause] no no although i thank god for the tapes yeah yeah yeah they they really point me let's just like this quote this quote points me to the scripture that's right amen what revival can take place from a seven church age messenger and go on 15 years it has to be the light of the age yeah it actually the message to the church age angel yeah that's good that's right that's good oh like that now you're getting it good i had to get it too it took me a long time yeah get it church get it hallelujah so see now for those people that say the bride hasn't awakened what about recognizing your dangerous message 1964. brother adam says every ministers are complaining everywhere fast pray fast pray yeah he said they have not recognized the awakening of the brain right right so one earlier a year earlier he said he said the bride hasn't had a revival and now he says the bride's awake that's it hallelujah that's it so see we have these quotes and we gotta take all the quotes back to the word praise god see the bride is awakened in the bible the bride is awakened or the foolish or the foolish and wise are awakened when the shout goes out the bridegroom's coming jesus coming get up trip your lips go out to meet jesus christ praise god amen amen surprise and awaken praise god yeah everybody says she's been in revival for 15 years amen if you go back 15 years from 1964 all right what's that 15 64 54 49 that's a long time that's way before the quote on the third seal where he said the bride hasn't had a revival yet so see he's talking about a different kind of revival in my opinion he's talking about the latter rain the bride hasn't had the latter rain yet but she'll get it praise god ah but we need first the revival of acts chapter 2 repent be baptized and you shall be filled with the holy ghost amen i believe that's revival you need first praise god and then yes that last revival is coming the bride is revival it'll be a refilling of the holy ghost praise god a lot of science miracles and wonders praise god it'll be the third poem or the opening of the word in the broader it'll be jesus christ in the world preparing her to rapture her off the earth amen that's his name so you got to make the quotes fit yes that's right and if you do that that's this is this is what you come to different kinds of revivals right so the third kind of revival is the bride's revival i call it the latter rain right if you it's the only way to make it make sense right right right so the second the third revival we're talking about is the latter rain it's future it hasn't happened yet right i've even heard you know wonderful preachers today saying we're in the latter rain now impossible no the map says that it can't happen until the squeeze happens that's what brother branson yeah he said you won't see it used in the great waves comes down right this ain't no sweet search no no right we're not physically be wrapped of anything we're not we got actually we brought up too much food right in the church right we're not being tested yet no we're not this ain't this ain't coming down to a scrubbing squeeze yet no see so see when brother says she hasn't had a revival yet he's got to be referring to the latter rain because brotherhood says in the latter rain will come a mount carmel showdown but the second forerunner of christ which is his ministry will sow for the latter rain so brother adam planted for the latter rain that's right hallelujah former rain right he planted he planted for the former or for the latter rain jesus will be the showdown between denominations and creeds that's why church we got to know our bibles more than denominations of the bible because this is a showdown who really believes the bible that's right that's the showdown and with with the renewal i'm sorry with the rest of the word will come restoration of power praise god amen because we got restored word we'll have the restored power praise god we've seen god's power this last year we've seen god heal people we've seen god answer prayers like that right we've seen god open up the windows of heaven and for our blessings we can hardly receive that's right hallelujah that's right church he said jesus will come back to back up his word and take his bride in the rapture the first showdown was mark mount carmel second was not transfiguration the third will be mount zion remember mount zion was the one david nobody ever conquered nobody never conquered zion so david became king of hebron and when he was becoming king of all jerusalem he said whoever goes into zion whoever uh whoever conquers this he said i'll make him rule over my army wasn't it joab how'd you get in there he got him through there through a secret passage didn't jesus say when you pray go in the secret place how do you conquer in some insurmountable obstacles through the secret place amen that's right i love that how do you get victory over insurmountable odds humble yourself that's right do the secret find the secret way find a secret place where you can get through and you can break through the barriers and get the victory and if you humble yourself if you go the secret way god will exalt you praise god that's rich i got like five points brother how that types the rapture i just can't remember it i preached on it before you got here so i can go back to my notes if you want sorry it was beautiful praise god brother says next will come the harvest reign or rapturing faith so we'll come it hadn't come yet no you see the wraps the latter rain is the last anointing right that the seed needs to bring forth true that's right it's final grains praise god can you imagine that sincerely right before the rapture let's say let's say a couple weeks worth of rapture some people are going to get the holy ghost for the first time and they only got to live like a couple weeks of trials and then they go into rapture what a blessing that would be praise god but hey we we might all have blessings if we're seeing the dead in christ rise again first yeah we we won't envy anybody right we'll just be happy especially we see the dead in christ rise either way we're going to be happy praise god because jesus christ is living in our midst amen and he will quicken our immortal bodies amen death will be swallowed up in life praise god so there you go there's three of the four revivals i wanted to preach on tonight here's the last one ephesians 4 23 mountain now what paul said where does paul say we get a renewal or revival he said where be renewed in the soul no be renewed in the spirit of your mind so where's the revival take place in your mind you get one revival in the soul that's the baptism holy ghost that's the church age revival that cannot be denominated message brother is going to keep going around the world until the rapture this bible-based message is going to keep going on finding those predestinated seeds it's going to fill them with the holy ghost and they're going to be like you and i whether they're in a big church or a small church it don't matter how many you're here praise god we're going to preach and sing like there's mans here because we know there's angels here praise god come on now there's more with us that is with the world praise god angels surround this place angels are here to hear your prayers amen angels are here to minister to your needs because you're the heirs of salvation praise god praise the lord amen yes praises that's what angels are they're servants to minister to the heirs of salvation yeah praise you thank god thank you jesus second corinthians 4 16 now saying goodness i'm almost done here by god's grace i'm not going to preach two hours we'll see secretaries 4 16. for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish right yet the inward man is renewed when david every single day you can have a revival oh right yeah human mind there is no scripture that says you'll get sealed a second time no no no there's no scripture that says your soul be filled again and again and again right so when romans says we need a refilling of the holy ghost for the rapture he's talking about in the mind that's right hallelujah what are you talking about about the first love brother that's what you're talking about yeah he said go back to your first love amen right do the first works amen right remember repent and go back to the first verse go back to your first love oh don't imagine that when the rapture comes we'll feel like we just got saved amen you just got bored again praise god that first feeling will come back that's what it takes is that letter a it's the anointing of god in our lives to make us feel new again praise god i can't wait to feel new again god's grace yes lord you mean i get to cry like a baby all over again yeah oh i get to shout like a baby okay yes yeah what's going on [Applause] it's going to be like it was at first the bible says sure the former ladder rain joel 2 says are going to come like in the first month that means as it was at the beginning sure yeah so we're getting the holy ghost like we did the first time it's going to be like the same way what a day that will be when i look upon his face the one who saved me by amazing grace then he takes me by the head and leads me through the promised land what a day glorious day i just want him to take my hand in the air i kind of want to feel what it's like you know i'm walking on air i don't know if i get a chance but you know all the saints will be there i'll be in the very back you know but maybe i'll get a chance to come up to the front and shake his head after paul and the saints and all the disciples hallelujah amen amen so this is a fourth kind of revival the one we can have every single day this is the one the new testament writers were writing about this daily revival of the money that's right sure sure don't get tired of doing good habits just get a revival with those habits oh praise god say lord make the bible reading feel new again yeah lord make the prayer laws that feel fresh again amen hallelujah revive me amen make those tapes sound new again hallelujah make it new again revive my strengths help me jesus i love it amen but i have taught this thing how can i overcome 1963. he said i want to take my subject this morning how can i overcome now i chose this because that i think it's at a time we should never let the spirit of revival die that's right whoa what do you mean brother what do you mean you're going to lose your salvation your soul that's not what he's talking about no you cannot the bible says your soul is sealed unto the david look up the word seal sometime in the bible you'll never see you lose your seal let me see no no just so you got an idea it could be such an easy search there's only 32 verses in the whole new testament take your bible tomorrow morning if you have anything planned to study and take your bible concord to type in seal and just read all the verses about see i challenge you you'll never find a verse that says you lose your seal because it is god's glory it is god's permanent mark on your soul right god comes down he comes past the body and he goes past the mind and he goes deeper deeper down that rider with the inquirer by the way he takes that penalty of the holy spirit and he writes thus saying the lord on your soul he marks you your gods for all time and all eternity praise god amen yes praise god i seal you i stamp you i permanently mark you i permanently brand you you are god's property you're the bride of jesus christ praise god you're oh you're over every devil in hell you're sealed nothing can shake you nothing can stop you you're sealed to your redemption praise god amen amen one day you'll get a mind and a body that matches your soul will get the same amount of soul the soul that cannot sin will give us a mind that cannot sin a body that cannot save then we'll be just like him when we see him we should never let the spirit of revival die he's talking about in your mind [Music] we got to keep a revival constantly revived every day now look at the verse he says yeah paul said he had to die you finished a quote for me i didn't know you got a memory paul said he had to die daily that christ could live yes and we must never let that revival die within us to see program taught this he taught all of all these quotes about rival there's hundreds of quotes about rival sure but the one that struggles people well the bride doesn't have everybody oh have you had a revival going on in 15 years people struggle with that but they got to go back to the word of god when you go back to the word of god the soul is sealed it's revived one time that's right i challenge anybody show me where the soul loses it's sealed it can't lose its seed oh no that's the whole point of it a permanent mark your robbery he bought you with the price he's claiming you as his he will not lose one christ [Applause] amen the son of man will not lose one of this praise god it's impossible praise god because they came out of this mind they're foreknown right i challenge anybody show me a verse where you lose your seal that's not where the real that's not where the refilling refilling happens that's in the human mind right oh glory i feel good now hallelujah see what you got to see what scripture is about random use when he talks about revival when he talks about seal to the day of your redemption see you never see it there's four you can't really see that there's at least four maybe five revivals the flesh that's dead can be revived raised from the dead the national revival uh there's the church age revival the revival of the human mind what was the next one can anybody shout it out for i said church oh the bride's reviled a lot of rain sorry that's all right brides lottery good guess i like how you're open to try that's way better than i was as a child i was so afraid fearful let's try it closer church every the soul of man needs one filling or one baptism only the soul does not need refilling right it's the human spirit that needs refillings now church the uh the part as soon as they said but the help we need is to revive our spirits every day like we don't want to have to be drug off to work or children we don't have to just drag our way into school we want to be revived when we go to school who can i witness to you praise god or just like this who can i help today at work i going to be a blessing to somebody lord revive my attitude oh glory revive my mind oh yeah renew my mind yeah i can help somebody that's it amen praise god i can shine the love of jesus christ i just found out today i got a muslim family in my in my room so boy i really got a lot to shine this year don't know she's going to be wearing one of those uh called do you want their turn i got to meet with the parents there so i'm going to have a real good opportunity a light for jesus christ all my smiles or whatever all my patience and all my love maybe they'll ask me about jesus i don't know we'll see granted lord jesus but now i've got something to pray for help me to go to work so that child who's in a muslim home which don't know jesus christ they deny the blood of jesus christ right they do not believe he was savior of the world no they believe just another prophet they believe muhammad is actually the last prophet right but may that child come to my room and see a real living example from jesus christ amen the life of jesus christ whose opportunity is it mine what do i need to do i need to be revived every day yeah that's it that's right every year church kids ask me are you a christian are you they ask me every year are you a pastor a parent or are you a pastor are you a preacher i said yeah yeah what's your favorite verse 238 right that's what i asked you last year i said acts 238 oh i didn't know that one i'm done john 360. that's a good one too i like acts 2 38 because it talks about the revelation of jesus christ one name the bible said the bible never even says you're quick and more than once the bible said you have the quicken who are dead in sin trespassing if i want to say get quick and again and again that's the me that's the soul being quick and the soul being born again right even we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ with christ colossians 2 13 being dead in your sins hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all your transgressions church all your sins are forgiven do amen sit in here and let the devil tell you your sins are foreign right he is saying get behind me satan the bible says thus saith the lord if i repented all my sins are forgiven praise god amen now move on with the revised heart praise god with the revived mind and servant like you love him praise god [Applause] servant because he's worthy of your praise he's worthy of being revived every day hallelujah hallelujah amen ephesians 4 30 grievous whereby your spirit i'm sorry about your seal one time never said seal it again again again again no no ephesians 1 13 after you heard the word of truth you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise i said pull up second corinthians 1 22 this is the one i always forget it's always like that hidden gem it's that hidden verse about the sealing of god who have also sealed us doesn't say many times sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts praise god sealed us sealed quickened it's always one time but then he says renew your mind day by day every day renew your mind transform die daily my soul wait look how confused they would be you were dead your soul was dead and it's quickened and then you got your soul's got to die every day that's all we know no it makes no sense no no your soul was dead had no life in it you're baptized with the holy ghost now you saw his life and it's alive forevermore it's the spirit of christ amen amen that means your nature will always say amen to the spirit of christ amen to the word of christ amen that's right the token 1964 this is february brother ram said if god ever healed you you live long enough you're going to get sick again yeah yeah that's right but if one time you take that token you've had it forever amen grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed until the day of redemption that's good not to the next revival you all see no no no you got emotionally worked up no but you're dead and your life is hitting christ through god and you're sealed by the holy ghost if you are once baptized in that holy spirit now you can backslide that's true but you can't get away from that seal you're sealed into it praise god that's it there it is there it is one time you're sealed forever you're sealed eternally in the soul but then you backslide in your mind every day that's why paul said renew your mind every day read your bible every day or listen to it at least it's better if you're not driving then you're distracted by driving lit read it in your home praise god isn't god worthy of some time in the morning when you wake up and be worthy to spend time with her sure of course oh yeah you gotta get up early do that get retired take a nap later on today that's why i do today i'll take a little nap today i didn't try to get up early i just woke up at five o'clock trying to sleep until 5 30. had to think of that see you can backside but not your soul you're sealed forever and yourself you'd be surprised how many people think you can be resealed and baptized yeah and again and again that goes against this quote yeah you're not sealed to the next revival let's have another revival get another seal no i'm only seeing once praise god amen that's all it takes just one time praise god it's one and good there's one another this one's mine i'm placing my stamp my permanent bird this one's mine forever mine eternally mine he's marked he'll never be the devils he'll always be mine praise god amen that's the seal of the holy ghost jesus christ amen now brother says and souls that are in prison my last quote as far as i know if i get something quick in that mission this is my note this is my last quote on the notes the god might have different numbers yeah he says now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul the soul is something that's the nature of the spirit yeah so body spirit but inside of the spirit deeper is the soul that's it and then he says we are dead this scripture plainly tells that we're dead and our lives are hitting god through christ sealed there by the holy spirit praise the lord now it wasn't your body who died it wasn't your spirit that died no oh so now we know where we're dying we're dying to unbelief in the soul right it was the nature of your spirit that died or your soul see the nature which is the soul right the nature of your soul is god if you're born again anything that begin has to end so therefore the only way you can have eternal life is to have the life that never did begin let's stand to our feet musicians can come praise god how many can see there's lots of different kinds of revivals sure i wasn't even thinking of more and i forgot them now now that i was preaching other things but i was thinking of a few more revivals actually for church there's at least five revivals and the one i'm asking you is the will get the one renew your mind today renew your mind get motivated in your mind i'm going to do this for the lord i'm going to i'm going to seek the face of god yeah i'm going to draw closer to god true like i preach on the the uh the double portion a couple weeks ago first one went in on the double portion but man said if you've got a double portion he said you'll have double the effort now think about that for me what effort did you give to seek god's face today if you got a double anointing brother ramp said you'd do double than what you did today that's right and the church said hey man hallelujah i know i go on this every service i i got to i gotta give you fired up it's my job yes it is to point you to the word to lead you to green pastures where is the green pasture going to be when you're feeding on the word [Music] right where's the still water is going to be when you're in his presence it's right man the stillness is the sweetness of the holy spirit right beautiful yes it is glory amen amen yes it is that's where i experience mine daily revival is in the presence of the lord hey amen right so these are all different kind of revivals the best part is with that soul revival if you get that revival you have to worry about any other robotics really because if you get that reviving the soul then it will move your mind to be revived right it's like a rapist it's like a living well yes yes it's like an artesian well yes it praise god is if you get that receive praise god if you get that revival you can't help it it's just constantly flowing you can't help it'll just keep gushing out praise god gush you now you don't feel like it was gushing out i'm going to go to church now you don't feel like praising i'm going to praise the lord today it's just gushing out praise god i don't feel like witnessing i'm going to witness today and pretty soon you start feeling it fear pretty soon you start enjoying it praise god and then you got revival up here and right here too thank god amen amen yeah thank god for different revivals praise god that's right sure hallelujah what's a good song for our lives spirit living god fall fresh on me in this amen because it's not always about noise you guys you know you hear me loud and shouting that don't always mean revival no no it can be in the like the bible says the contrite heart right and be that oh yes i guarantee you now you don't feel this good feel as good as that i'm sure if you brought me some scripture i'll be
