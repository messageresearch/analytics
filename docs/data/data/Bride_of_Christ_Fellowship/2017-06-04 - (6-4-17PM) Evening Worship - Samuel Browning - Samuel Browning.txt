my faith I'm sure that no yes yes Jesus is at all Alleluia let's look at a few verses of Scripture they look German i-29 we want to be traversed in some Lemaitre scriptures to us praise God what thus saith the Lord the after 70 years we accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place where I know the thoughts that I think toward save for or thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you and expected in then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me that I mean when you shall search for me with all your heart yes I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven save the Lord and I will bring you again into the place once I caused you to be carried away captive hallelujah hey let's just look to the Lord in a word of Prayer tonight yes Jesus our Heavenly Father Lord we are just so thankful Lord once again Lord for your mercy new grass Lord we thank you Father Lord for a time opportunity Lord that we have Lord Father we realize that Lord these times that we have more they may not be too much longer Lord that we have this kind of liturgy Lord it is all together together so Lord we ask that you would help us Lord in the midst of this time what God that we might be able to receive and Lord take hold of that word not as it would take hold of us yes we pray the Lord you would just have your way here Lord at this service Lord God I just desire to be hidden behind the cross the Lord you would be the one who would speak administer to the beats of your people tonight more yes Father you even know the words and how that they would need to be said Lord the father that it might be known that Lord that you are mine and that familiar the eyes of the Lord are searching to and fro Lord God and you're mindful at every need another children from an earlier yes the father you would just Lord move among us in a special way once again Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen may God richly bless you being seated I'd like to just that if we could just continue with that thought of dedication raise God and truly we could just really continue to work with this salt all the way through because any any time there has ever been a move of God you always see that those who are part of that move it God brings them into the time and a life of dedication in that we've seen we're looking at that this morning that it takes God moving upon our lives and then there must be a counter response on our hearts it's just like in the scriptures when you think of how that there is not one place in the scriptures where it says wives love your husband's it does say in one place that they render due benevolence but you look in the scriptures and you'll find that how in Ephesians 5 you'll find it throughout the Scriptures read will say that husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church and you recognize that where as Paul was drawing that type from that it's not our love that we love the Lord with but it's actually the love of God that has been projected and we as the counterpart the helpmate that that part which is come out of God it is to reflect back to him that same love that he has reflected and made known or manifested to us him as oh so the wife is a reflection of his love so the true bride of Jesus Christ in this hour is a reflection of the depth of God's love that moves to bring about a real change in our life in and so what that does is it brings it brings them the dedication that God is desiring and seeking for and how could that happen unless God himself moved upon our lives and there has to be a part to respond to what is calling for elder Davis said a deep call it to the D at the noise of non water spots there is already something to satisfy what the calling is before you could ever have a desire there must be something that is craving that that is there to satisfy that long amen that's the same thing it is even in our lives there is a thirst within the heart of every mortal person but yet within that of the elect of God and we don't look down on any that are not elected but we recognize there's a desire within us we are not contented with a church life is that something you can be content with and I know that there we can speak of others that perhaps you know I've known people that really even in other places that they don't really have a church life they live according to all that they they know and like brother BAM told us he said if the Catholic is trusting in Jesus Christ for his salvation you say right right leg but I say yes it's like in the type that where Abram went after lot he we know that lot was his nephew but the scripture says when he heard it he said lot his brother Abraham heard lot his brother was taken captive and in that heart lot was in that particular chapter was a type of the elect of God yes there are many others in Sodom that were taken captive right but Abram was not moved for the whole that was in chemistry for block email his kindred yeah but all of the rest that were identified and taken captive receive the benefit of Abram going and redemption its rise like the rest of this curve and many that are out they receive the benefits even you can testify or hear many better say God deliver me of this concept in pre-existing and they're on the right God has got ever again they have aniseed the benefits of God coming and redemption for his elect right so when we speak up out of the elect it is a great responsibility that we feel upon our hearts yes and it's something that we thought that God moves in our life that we are not able to feel just in a place of rest or come to complacency and that's something that we truly have to battle we would have to stand against but that word that living word comes forth it comes to stir us up it comes to direct us yeah it comes to breathe the freshness from the presence of God that we would stayed in the place and right on target yeah man I wasn't aimin so when we were looking at this tonight I want to just take just a few examples here in the scripture and really looking at this once again God of dedication but I want to look at it in a manner of how that God itself is committed to his word yes uh you know you how many times have got into projects that are way over our head but God has never got into something that's amen amen God knows exactly what he was doing and he knew God knew all of the background God even knew the the things that we would come through God even new scars marks got new all of those things yes yet even in the midst of it all how did that God was able to look down past all of that and is choosing is based on that of himself yes God's got confidence as we see we're looking at this morning his confidence is it his word yeah God comes to minister to that part of the other side which is of his rights of his genealogy so when we're looking at God being committed to his word then God comes to cultivate and bring forth that same dedication in the lives on his people so here when we're looking God has made a promise that he's going to visit Israel and God is faithful he did not overlook Israel's sin we know Israel is in the condition or a the place of Babylon yeah cause of their rebellion to the voice of God yes they they were they they still were going through the feast but yet God doesn't what things just going through the manner he wants a heart you know because the heart has in it God said you are representative of a place called Babylon so they were overtaken and now here dwelling in Babylon but he let of no I'm gonna visit you and I will perform my good word toward you that's right but as we you know you look at it even though it means 70 years God just didn't have you know his watch or his calendar and said 69 years old knives Rico's Mayas give no clothes here but the conditions the 70 years he would deliver but there must also be conditions that are met at that time yes a man he must be in a desperation and it's not just a desperation to I want to be free of this Babylonian oppression it wasn't just that because people can want to be freed and you know people say I don't want this drug addiction I don't want this I don't want that and that in itself is is a good thing you can look at it well that's hindering a life it's true but that's not that's not serving God that's not what you get you and I said of it you but when it must come which God is calling for here is where their heart begins to long after that seek out her but everywhere else it goes around our life with things that could still beat we said it sends all those things it is to seek after God and falling deeper in love with the Lord and as you know deeper in love with the Lord did you find the strength that you need because the stress is needed and that strength works in your life to perform the word that he's already Amen glory he's always looking at things as though that I'm going to get rid of this I'm going to get rid of that I'm gonna get rid of that it's falling in love with you yeah man we fall in love with him it's more and more and you realize our faith increases yes you realize that yeah we've seen that even in Abraham's life this journey his faith caught always knew the faith that was within Abram because Abraham is of God yes it's alright yes God already knew that you and I fall along in the chapter and we're we're seeing Abraham progressed within his life and yet God already seen that but call out circumstances and conditions call allow all that even where God I mean how of us when we would someone when we would sell something to somebody and they laugh they would smirk at what you're saying Abraham did that to God that's right right sir not just in the early chapters in the very scriptures before the visitation of Genesis 18 right you're going to have a child by self the Bible said Abraham laughter you see yeah we're looking at it God is not in any way coming back and saying my arrack why are you laughing if it is o God withdraw back we know God brings correction but yet God is faithful to his word and God many times where we get in trouble we look at everything else around sometimes we can see the faults we can see failures we can see false we can see all the other things but God is looking deeper than that that's not saying that that we can don't know say what I'm saying is it that we get focused upon all of that instead of recognizing the source that we have accessed and that sauce is the grace of God yeah Holy Spirit is the blood as well we are access to to be able to overcome and prevail against those things yeah so that's where when we're looking at it within here even in the scriptures we see how that God would move even in the midst of things for that of Abraham and in Abraham's life and here with among the children of Israel you know when you think of it if I could just just for a few moments before we would go and go onto that a little bit you think of how that God spoke to Noah the scriptures we can read we read just the one Scripture in Hebrews 11 that if I faith Noah being warned of God of things not yet seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of the house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith we even in reading in the account in Noah's life we do not read in there any discouragement yes but there were yes sir we don't read in that account in Noah's part of a times where you were trying to make something fit and it didn't fit we don't read that but yet we know that there were times I'll presume it yes we know it I say how can you know that because that is a characteristic God never God has never tried to hide humanity right but God makes himself known by where you call people to just like Abraham and Sarah it would have seemed like that God if you're wanting a child a comforter you'll call people that can produce one right right but God does not work that way God moves to declare himself by calling and ordaining that which his seeming so contrary to what he's decided he has proved himself yeah you see this is where if come interceptors of your mobile you can look at the word itself and you can even see you recognize by way with them when your nature it's change them and satisfy that in prayer there is a there's a landing up of the Word of God yet you find the word your flesh your your other part should be stunned by that word that's where God told Joshua be strong and of the curse to observe all that Moses is said why because this message is Pope yes sir yes sir yeah it's a life-changing message that it is yeah your body changing message it has the full page yes it's not going to be something that the flesh was always going to go along with ride a the inner man and that is who has been born of the Spirit of God in that Internet is feeding on that word and that inner man is bringing the outer man its objective or itself taking over our lives where it is having preeminence it's not just knowledge it's the little person of Jesus Christ by I don't know it's guys taking over life that's the adoption lujah its Christ and self-rule within us hallelujah moving in us yeah running out on us where he would direct you at the right time just like with Caleb it was not Joshua as a kid waiting you think right now is about time that you go take the mountain I know that was God yeah yes sir man hey hey what told him this was the time the Spirit of God he had to my lawyer you recognize this is the time to take my mountain yes Hey same thing within our lives the Spirit of God inspiring you and I what is that that's God's dedication to his work I'll make sure is he lit culture yes he then becomes been working you shall perform it unto the day of Jesus right that is dedication I literally yeah so God Himself is drawn to dedication we see that but Noah knows North dedication was that his heart here here fine found favor with God his dedication was to what God had revealed a man no doubt there were times that you know I had to get down on his knees he's praying God how do I make these pieces come together yeah yes but you see here's the difference being a believer does not mean that we have all the answers right it means we have access to the answer yeah mix the situations where we don't know what to do we know we can go to him literally yeah I mean no he met him yes and no was resting in him even when it came time to the final parts were after the flood come and and here they are in the window you see the scriptures don't tell us this but the Prophet picks it up and the Prophet tells us that the window that God had naught to make this Satan gotten got in a window and begin speaking down through the window and calling Noah okay you can get out now I don't know rain has come but he did your opportunity yeah right I see that that was not for Satan see Satan was trying to come through that access but that this was actually reserved for when God would confirm his word yeah I was not able to confirm the end of the flood in the first level right the second stage right what a second pool God was going to confirm it in the third Hey it was not a secret coming right right you see the clap in the third he opened the window as he over the window to two or two fouls were sent out right right Dalton you have got the crow yes right the crow found rest right y'all found no rest they don't return then did you find here Noah sends out again you know after after seven days the dump goes up gets guess I would Lee comes back and what does going do wait seven more days who told no other way except more days you don't read the scriptures where it says God's told North Norway seven more days but see God knows how to speak to your heart into your life to where the things that what he does becomes a pattern not a self-made pattern gets a pattern of his spirit in his life is character so what Noah knew there was seven days we were here waiting for the blood so here are coming back seven days and we'll walk out was it in hey we'll make knowledge in you God was faithful to where were no other than this our God was going to let him know but it's time to walk out yes I let you and I know everything Lord so when we look at this you see even without us in Abraham's life you see remember with with with with in where God had made a promise that Sarah or the Sarah she has an idea to take Hagar the the bond the bond woman take her and prevent your God is going to give child by weave her see that's her idea right and Sarah's dedicated to it she's dedicated to it even though it would go against something she what but she's dedicated to it but he was self dedication right right that was not what God wanted her to be dedicated amen the Bible even goes on to say how that Sara herself through faith that's right amen yes Sabbath don't received strength to conceive outside of a messenger that's right I'm talking about the earthly man I'm talking about the message to the Holy Spirit coming yeah okay let's he said it wasn't so straight it was Abraham Smith so how did it because we know that it could just be Sarah riding in and bringing conception upon Abraham's faith but there had to be that faith had to move down and become resolute within Sarah's life Hey but the ministry that God had ordained in that time that the the the God Himself came down and visit with Ava they never went LW never went down pass off that's right right yes hey special that's why you know when brother battle with dresses in his foot spiritual food new season and run around was saying you know remember he was told many times what did he bother nurse sinners why don't you take this off the nursery the mess is not for them right it's not that we don't want to witness we do all of it but recognizing is the public say it's not fair food it would make them sick I do believe God opened the door for me to go and stand and minister in a church that's not a message trip uh you know and I'd say this by God's grace I don't need to read quotes to preach the Word of God that's right right I do it yes you do it for Sarah amen but man I'm not proud reaching right from a quote I miss not quoting it the same time right right because the you the message is Christ it's a living person yes a picture of Jesus Christ it makes the Bible alive amen so able to orchestrate to where the people God could move and speak to things that they believe in the scripture but he can make it real to them that would cause them to seek after you yes yes amen god knows what he's doing so when we see this that we know it's not that we're not the witness we are the witness if God gives an opportunity I have many many times of the many funerals where there have been some times who knows where there were people that never ever said in the church never and I didn't have been a good bedside pray for them and all they could do is squeeze my hand at the end of the way you said for the signer you creature Shin sure I take the opportunity because I can talk about the Lord Jesus to all those people that's right and I would I would speak of the Lord Jesus Christ and the certainty that we have in him uncertainty of this life but certainly we have in him yeah yeah any to speak to someone to minister to them a concerning the Lord Jesus right I believe God will lead it guys because I'm out of jacket as believing we understand the wire and God is open to us we understand the responsibility that sometimes it's not for us to give up the cannon that's right it's simply the sweetness and the light that's lived at you melody and the sincerity that comes forth to people that people begin to see a man in real amen see they heard all this all of the those things that Jesus was reading from the scroll but they said never man spake like this I'm different they have heard and read it but this was something there Sheriff received that thing God so move in her life to bring her to that place to open beyond self dedication when we look at this just here just for a moment when you see how God is moving you find within this return from Babylon God moves and Junction's of time there are people that are allotted for each station the first thing is to come back and build a temple that's amazing yes God has people that are our date for that yes then after that here they have the coming forth with the the law of God the priest of God coming for God knows when to breathe air yes then you find it after that this is coming then it comes that time to strengthen the build up the walls God his people that's wording for them amen so he can't God everything is in his time and in his season we see that yes and God you know when you're looking at it you find how that even in the book of Ezra Ezra chapter one well refer from you'll find that how that when God anoints silence and Cyrus catches the inspiration God has spoken concerning Cyrus but the inspiration falls upon Cyrus and Cyrus himself not a believer right yet the inspiration fall and he speaks to the people of God and I want you to catch this the people of God did not look and say who are you you're not even a believer right right they they recognized this is what God has said my shepherd that's what he called Cyrus mine anointing my shepherd you know he also called never Knesset my servant that's right that's right right - in the hand of God yeah puppet said they're always raving about communism you see it's a tool in the hand of God amen so you look at different ones figures throughout the world it seem like they're becoming involved what is it tools in the head of God yeah that's allowing them to become involved for this time so here the Lord stirs up the spirit of silence and sounder speaks to them and and how that it sounds you know even mentioned them who is there among you of all his people his God be with him let him go up to Jerusalem which is the Judea and build the house of the Lord God of Israel he is the God which is in Jerusalem and you find that how that there are people that roast up in verse five is that there are people Ezra 1:5 that rose up chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites with all them whose spirit God had written yeah you know what to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem behind that same pattern over in since 35 where we were coming from this morning after God the atonement has been made and he's moving the people along and Moses has the assurance that the presence of the Lord will cool I will go before you and hear then Moses in Exodus 35 begins to speak of the vision before to the people yes even though the vision was of God everything had to get in his proper place Lydia it's just like when you look at it and you think of how that God in this hour to bring up people by God's grace of where we are by His grace that God would have a vessel that was reserved to catch the inspiration eyes of God above the earth to catch in this hour the revelation of Jesus Christ amen then just speak and transmit that and we can say that we do have the perfect interpretation of the Word of God yes but yet because the side was not just going to be recorded on tape oh yeah to become material hey yes just because the message itself when we look at the message and we call the books it takes the message and we say we had the perfect interpretation of the Word of God but that's not the achievement of God lies that word being interpreted through us a man yeah yeah but isn't this prophecy through Jeremiah he spoke this prophecy here and what is the interpretation of it is this word having an impact what your glory coming back to Jerusalem is Jeremiah's prophecy weight was moved by this beautiful yeah seeing the interpretation of hey it's cause breaking forth his word in his season linaria it's just like when you take for example when the RAM is is is dealing with the seals and it's administering on the seagulls remember how it says I want questions that are dealing with the seals yeah I want questions what does he get rajamma questions should we wear pajamas should we do this related what are the people are in a sanctification mode yes no no that's not a balloon and is suing where the people were act all right brother that was a type of the tabernacle by the mount they were back in sanctification go you can speak the different ones over there they said we recognize something great is happily oh it wasn't that it bypass God had things reserved for a time yes it's in God's hands when all these things come into order but it must first be spoken and declared that if it stays back here and it just be seized at just a message by a prophet that right there people can still perish yes sir it must be vision that breaks in the hearts of people litora otherwise it just becomes for the ground of the message conscience for the ground across to the public you could get in before on that but you can't get in on that okay thanks quickly so when they're looking at me you must see you are caught in the vision a little bit already can say Daniel 70 weeks this message has a power and a vision behind it it's a way sent from God to get the church in order mark in the vision glory I know it sometimes it's pretty surreal you're in your scene right nor the things that you're showing you should meet me and you almost like want to pinch yourself and but you what it is it's gone making you aware of who you really are yeah yeah all these things about you as far as the part thereof the flesh I could have changed your flesh when he gave it all he goes right here he magnifies and declares his victory by changing your nature yeah shines after your life but your son's daughter God and hearing manthis you strongly for your life and you stand victorious in the midst of a fleshly party is glory amen so when you find out how God is its people might say I don't know where time go sometimes you seem like you just get seemed like it's time to sing stared at and I stole mine so let me just let me just hurry here you're going to stir them up then you're at glory and I stood here building you know it would seem like my everything is going right for them and it does seem like my everything's going for them but remember when they lay the foundation the Bible says that their adversaries heard about it our the adversaries heard they came and begin to trouble right the - as they sought to frustrate their purpose yes that word frustrate me break they hired counselors try against them they they begin to bring accusation and you find that that accusation worked or where they wrote letters to the King and they begin to make also accusation concerning them saying their rebellious city rebellious people and these false accusations caused a king that was in between now he all he could do is look at the accusations and say tell him to stop doing right stop him they stopped building from 15 years yes sir it they laid the foundation but that's it for 15 years and yet they've been commissioned by God what's God's dedication to his word a man brought the dedication to his word he has some has some some reserved servants ah yes yes David hi di he's not coming with another message hey guys reaching and the inspiration of God is falling on hey guy hey eye begins to speak and begins to address their purpose yeah so purpose that they are back in the land for is to build the tabernacle god no no look at this using my head yeah you're nice goodness man it's it's really cutting damage it's coming really like that wasn't it they has become crushed it over out the dedication has to go ah God dedication Hey hi they should be slower all those things in the midst of that the guys dedication was he would sing a sermon and serve it with reminder hey why you could say consider your ways hallelujah you see they become occupied with it's like the wind were taking other cells of those accusations they had become so occupied to where they had forgot that purpose that God had form and they were working and working working working you see st. you to your time right brother I say paladin right amen I wrote they were feeling tiny and here God is like a note you're getting all but there's really no increase you put it on the table a bow on it that's right you're feeling bad and it's bags for holes in yes sir yes make was that me why would God do that in our life there's a poet tells us of why you know Bethlehem the practice of God is that we'd be terminated and then we have the churn of Christ old life inside of a holiday international berry fruit of his life glory amen and I got to a spot in her life she was already married yeah she was united with open her husband but she got to a place she says I want to bear his image you know a real manifestation receiving life right the light wasn't taking hold she was united with with alcohol but here it moved the desperation wasn't just enough to be United she said I'm out there I want to she doesn't say all to bear a child she said I want to bear a son where was that coming from her the mind of God he was going to give her son but he just been give her son she had decided what God designed for are you the new the head up will have records and respect so we gave her a special son Laurie amen oh oh Mugen gamin so how that that God moves on negative calls the people to consider their ways and you not so know you know God just didn't say you know three hey guy um you know just you know this is the stuff what you're doing but he lets them know you have become so occupied with this but you need to go to the mountain you need to get the wood you need to bring it on down and you need to build the house of God yes yeah so he's calling them reminding them of their purpose and you know it stirs up because their language among the people and that time had come to a place to where they were beginning to say this is not the time for the house of God right brother right they have become discouraged yes all the accusations lining up it becomes a skirt see the word itself when it comes it comes to suffering you from you the word itself as your abiding and living in the word and looking to the Lord it's that which gives you prevailing power to dismiss accusations nay mad because the devil is the accuser of the brother yes is this atmospheres are contaminated with Devon right and oh yes point out your failures and your mistake as you begin to look at all of that and become consumed with it it puts you in a place of evil Billa yeah nothing yeah you're not right I'm not just moving here you're not you do wanna be a man your receptors aren't up to where they ought to be yes girls is a cloud yes but we when you can recognize the strength of the atonement and you're recognizing the real you by knowing that designer of that clock has raised up on the inside and you're able to stand there and say I know you're able to stand there and bring that discernment and being able or ask down literally free happy thank you smiles imagination everything that raises up against the knowledge of Christ hallelujah see this is where for the battle you would admonish us even by way of the scripture where the scripture said seek you first the kingdom of God and then all these other things will be added unto you yes I believe it behooves us to look at even in checking in our lives because there are things all all around but you try to get the attention try to bring distractions yes but in all things the principle is not you know it's like suppose we're we're in the interview get hit somebody and they get so tangled up financially right rather right on and they might even want to be doing something no real good principles oh I know this God's principle and I want to do this on a day but God will not have to obey those principles and disobey those right amen come on yo man so the word is to all the work Alleluia when the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and then all these other things will be added unto yeah that's beautiful beautiful I'll tell your friends you know I'm not just I'm not talking to your textbook knowledge and once yeah I'm awareness of what after you forgot to put God first amen and no one was like to take 21 credit hours in school I have that and go out and preach the gospel preach it home to visitation and still to study yes sir yes sir yes sir lame not burning up on anybody else but I'm just saying that I know what God is able to do sometimes we limit God yes amen yeah look at this you know you you can limit God but God is unlimited yes you know brother Justin over talking here is literally my used to have all kinds of stamina when I first started backing up for me to see if the one o'clock in the morning by we were walking in the revelation of God and also you have a five in the morning run on the treadmill I'm Adam ooh no I need more than four hours sleep it'll be down there for a while I call my brother the one that's a mellow and world's born I felt fast live because I wasn't able to stay up like that and studying and everything I wanted to and you know he gave me some real powerful words always been very short you're getting old getting older but it's true we do get older we don't we don't have maybe the salmon and the strength and we're trying to do everything we can but our vessels would be a presented unto the Lord as yet we recognize that within at all but there is times that I want to get on preach on that but there times that God doesn't want to stress yes yeah I'm a man back in here gasps gonna pass out a road you got you you've been talking about Rizzoli's there's people that need to be saint there's people that need to be come with the Holy Ghost how can you go out fishing real ramps that I've come to the place I realize she said that everybody this ruler on the look of yeah lover yeah Laury Laury but that's where the brand will make a steam out I'll always love that statement right I found it to be true I've seen to be true my mom says you show me a man or woman gotta put God first yes he said how show you a person that will come out on top no matter what the devil's oh yeah sorry hey man it goes why first yes it's gone first glory and when we when you look in through this here let me just try to just wrap this up here in when you find it how's it hanging on your God's dedication this is why once you see God's dedication because you and I are God are this workmanship created ordained unto good works therefore gain in Christ Jesus Gras is faithful to supply all that we have neato oh yeah he's faithful to it and so when you find that how within this 15 years there's no movement going on the people have become disheartened the time has not come let me get to speak extinct so God sends a word that whereby that they would begin to really align and speak with what the purpose that God already had for their life the Bible says after that heavy I and the prophets in as our five they were speaking to them the Bible says after they were done speaking minerals of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and just sure the son of josedech and begin to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem and with them were the prophets of God helping them I'm so glad the larrya provides the help we have neither yeah I'm glad God as vessels that are ordained to minister that word and get out of the way that can really get down to God to come down and speak to our lives and make things real preciate left it spots dedications God having a ministry God never remove the ministry cuts God having a ministry in Scotts dedication yes dedication to what to his word nothing area he knows hey what I wouldn't need that and it's God coming through the varieties of his officers to minister to our nice little area God knew we just didn't need all the badges we didn't need all pastors use all teachers but all parts of it had to come together yes hey mom I what you know Lord my I'd say we can really deal with that in humility that I tell you what God is so dedicated at yeah I know where the scripture says in Ezra PI aware that here the the Word of God was having an effect in their life and yet these people that came up in verse 3 of this refined and partly if I don't say the names correctly and says at the same time came to them 10 tonight governor on this side of the Jordan and and set for the Sarlacc and companions and send us unto them who have commended you to build this house in the make up the swamp then I said we under man after this matter what are the names of the men that make this building what the high look at this now but the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews that they could not cause them to cease till the matter came to Darius name and then they returned by letter concerning this matter the king that was in between those were in between in the 15 years yes they didn't recognize because there was one who by edict of Cyrus but that had been lost what accusations had had caused the Kings in here to just focus on the accusations instead of going back to the original document that's right but then after year the focus was put back to the original document which gave them the authority to field hey man a man don't give the focus in this hour to come back yeah your name questions asking questions yes and we could say verse 3 in verse 4 they had their blog post there were their YouTube video and asking questions but happy are you right you see the service when you look at in the New Testament ah you know just to study out of some things that I've done when you look at how many times is the Lord Jesus the Bible says that they pressed upon him to him yeah he would say something they ask questions yes but how many times of Jesus answering very very very few yes sir very few yes sir Jesus and many of the times he caught the spirit and he walked away you know what you were going to help ma they were asking questions you don't find in this scripture where they turn around and answer them ah right hope you understand what I'm saying yes sometimes those questions is just to try to breathe back into places that God's already brought you food yeah that's different if I'm witnessing to somebody here then I'm opening showing them behind way of the Lord how God sends a messenger in this hour but to among the people of God are not proving their programs a messenger rock words trust indicated that yeah there's anything you're walking yeah amen but it's questions and you fine yeah they were to ask look you say focus on your what's the harm in answering that question they would stop working yes you see sometimes the things that are put out or and work to try to stop working it would to try to be to distract yeah I can try to distract and say well you know you need to answer questions you need to try to help them you know train that's a great philanthropist way to look at it and you know but the reality is is you've got tried to discern you focus upon that what about that's right really right understand yeah we are game my god this word self he is moving by divine revelation to produce a rapture a mass it's got dedicated to his word it's God in this moment and in this hour we're not we're not set it to argue the word we're not set to try to prove the word we're believers yeah a is so when we see it the eye of God the Bible says was upon them they couldn't cause him to stop the eye of God was Christ Christ was ass back where is worth in their life and then you find let me just let me do the wrap around wrap this up for you you find here in in the scripture when when Ezra leaves I believe in Azra 7 when Ezra leaves Babylon the King has given commandment concerning those things which are to be done to beautify the house of God they are given an off they're given that which is needed of gold of silver and the King has said anything else that you need yes he wrote in the letter give to them whatever they have neither what is it it's an hour of fullness yes it's an hour because what is it God is dedicated to his word today we are finishing up to the fulfilling of all things what is needed God is not sparing it like it save this way no expenses yeah lelou yeah this hours not a portion of him it's the fullness prioritize dealing with an art by the way of the word yes and here you find something a a great precious time where we come into in our own lives to wear that here in Ezra eight they walk out and they have all of this substance and when they come out with all this substance in Ezra eight years as right this is a tight as was returning the temple has has already been built yeah now it's time to have how that leadership in that direction coming back in they're going to come and they're going to teach the law of Moses and Janet equal but the Bible said calls him to understand yeah what is written therein then you find that Ezra in himself in verse 21 of Ezra eight can I just read this yes let me just read it you're just just real quick glory in 21 they come to a place by the river they've left out of Babylon Ezra and the chief fathers that are with him he says then I proclaimed a fast there at the river out of which that we might afflict ourselves before I've got to seek Him him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our subdued offense beautiful for I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken unto the king saying the hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him but his power and his wrath is it gets all them that proceeding so we fasted and insult our God for this and he was entreated man but is it God's dedication to his word yes Ezra and then recognize there's enemies ahead of us we're carrying all this substance all this gold all the silver how are we going to get it back Jerusalem but he stopped that he says Lord shows the way how should we go about this yes and they fasted yes how am i fasting is a very precious thing to the people of God yes there's times where you have God is draw it draws you in in a fast there's times where you move fast you're trying to find an answer trying to find a little eating of the Lord looking to God and this is the thing that you can take from here you find in many other places in the scripture God is drawn to dedication I mean it just moves God hey when people are dedicated in the time of the dedication of Solomon's took on this movement yeah but they were ready in the upper room God was moved Lydia when Daniel prayed 21 days yes wait 21 days for an answer and we finally when the answer comes let's see no I heard you the first time you prayed that's right when you set your heart and you chastened yourself I heard you hey man gosh God why am I here yeah you know how the Gabriel had to fight through yes and God was so drawn to comes in Michael go down every meeting and April came on through what God is drawn to dedication because that's a characteristic of yourself my glory for the people of God and that's where it comes down even in your life in my life we come into these times like this the Lord which way do I go which way do I stay or after I moved to yes where and God is faithful to his word hallelujah because our desires to are pleasing to him and not just presume and go around recording illegally I think you only grow in it but we want to know Lord what do you want yeah it's a tremendous I tell you Frank it to me is so tremendous how God it directs us to be sensitive to ask for his little piece of paradise I notice how simple little paradox how that God we've embraced to a place to where we see everyone what's what you will is that yes you know because there's certain things that we go about our life we don't ask God's will so it's just like you're at a red light you don't need to ask if it's God's will for you stop it's a red light it's like certain things in the word where Paulson is the will of God for you to know how to possess your vessel in the sink yeah yes very good it's the will of God for you to receive the Holy Ghost it's the will go to the command I it's a little God to be in the house of yeah well you know if it's God's will for me to be in the hospital or I can tell you to sit the Lord to be a knowledge that's not it that's a clear clear reality there right comes to other things job houses where you live so forth everything in all the things we need is leadership yes yes but it all God's peace is always accompanied and always signification of the school there's a stupid vision I train or whatever it's always a kind of the peace because God's will is pleased Hey and God come on the scene here to guide his people and to move them into the place and position that he had for that because God is committed to his word hallelujah it was just committed to Uriah it would have been like him looking at all the people say Oh fifteen years look how they're talking the time has not come because not committed to our flesh right he's committed to his work man my flesh he sees the benefit of God me headed to his word and the word dwelling in yes amen the word dwelling in you his life dwelling you your flesh receives the benefit that's right yes sir when you're sick in your body God moves down and he touches you yeah whether it is by weight and God will perform a miracle by surgeon or doctors you know brother Graham said that he says God performs miracles by surgeons sure he did he say Bobby performs miracles by doctors he said go forth miracles by medicine right you know we don't take up those miracles big miracles but it's still America right all Heymann comes from God yeah I love the simplicity have a problem explains that he says if penicillin heals he says then what happens he said penicillin is the healer then he said you take a person has a cut and you put penicillin in them but let's take the light on right let's kind of silly move for him no sir he sits what what is the healer not the pit of Silla it only aids but life is of you that's right I say tonight even the EP is it don't believe in God in the life and then still use them my dear I come from God he's a vegetable when they get sick I know Lord that's right amen oh he's worried the head a shake in his faithful to see this all the way through yes even when it came to the time of where they came to the Jordan Moses passed off the scene and God was letting Joshua know God was reaffirming Moses my servant is dead why would he have to say that he's letting it be known Moses is no longer here right but Joshua under safe yes is all right hey man and the promises that he came to vows in my nature before you to bring you into the place yeah sure I'm scared for you now say means your glory was there in the land yes I say that same name to the Lord our inheritance that we have this word holiday I mean to a galore oh I'm so happy Lydia suppose some if you have problems sure you have disappointments sure you have discouragement sure you have setbacks sure hey man there's no doubt about it no doubt god I let others down I failed in many different in many different ways but God is faithful God is always faithful to guide and direct us and teach us and bring things about in our life that will match his choosing and goes out for our life yes God and nothing Alleluia morning his purpose cannot be defeated olivarium not God has never lost I'm not one yes he is not going to lose you hey go ahead you would be to lose the identity on himself that's right that's right yeah that's true to lose you would be to lose the identity of himself because you are part of that's right yes sir an expression of the Living God in this hour yes but God cannot lose his identity he's never lost as I get a little area the same yesterday today hail ahead yes say Lord I feel like pressing on yes
