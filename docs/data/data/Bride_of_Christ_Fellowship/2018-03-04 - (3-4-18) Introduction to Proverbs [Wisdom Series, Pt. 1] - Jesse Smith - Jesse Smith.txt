Bo's on the tenth sister Karen's on the 13th and sister Wendy's on the 27th so let's just give them around vlog they met happy birthday to our March birthdays a lot of them March Lord richly bless all of you with another year of service made Lord at his blessings to you also I asked brother bang if he and I could meet after service he's a trustee I'm a trustee and we'll talk about a church savings account if the Saints want to do that seems like there is some interest in that so we'll talk about that and he and I will have to make that decision but thank you for the feedback that I received I appreciate everybody's feedback who is able to give me some feedback I appreciate the wisdom and the different thoughts and so forth so brother bang and I would try to meet after service and talk about that let's do a prayer request now yesterday I met family and Copley and their 18 year old son is in heavy use of marijuana and he's left the house so let's pray for him I told the father that we'll set up a day of prayer and fasting and whoever can fast that day we couldn't fast to bring this 18 year old home he's a senior but that's usually the the gateway drug is marijuana and then when you get to that and they do all these all crazy drugs and so we're just crying out you know God will deliver this 18 year old boy from such awful destruction of Satan so let's just pray for that also brother John has a surgery on Tuesday let's remember him in prayer by the grace of Lord I've asked him numerous times if there's anything we can do to help out so please let me know there's anything we can do I know your wife might need the help but please let me know if there's anything we can do by the grace of God he'll have a total hip replacement and we just believe it's the hand of God that God has allowed him to be able to have that you know and when you remember he gave his testimony kind of member of the story behind his hip in the car accident and so forth but just the grace of God that he can have this hip replaced here and trust me a good time of healing for him by the grace of Lord trust God to bring the healing also my brother Simon he asked all of us to pray just for unspoken requests he's kind of going through a battle he and I talked about last night on the phone it's kind of personal but he's really going through a hard battle right now just kind of like a mind battle and different things so I could really sense how how much here this was bothering him so let's just pray that God will meet his unspoken need and also don't forget sister Murray's requests I'm just going to try to keep remembering those four other two granddaughters and then one of Marie's daughter's marriage needs a lot of prayer so let's pray for that this morning are there other needs

hallelujah thank you brother let's take our Bibles this morning I like to open up to proverbs chapter 1 I'd like to begin a little series on wisdom by the grace of Lord I still have one more service I want to preach on the later scene church age so probably look at that maybe on Wednesday I've just been feeling led to go to the Book of Proverbs lately and Ecclesiastes and perhaps Jobe will see what the Lord allows here just kind of feeling that of the Lord I think you'll see what see what I mean at the end of this sermon I'm just going to share some of the things we were talking about last Sunday at Giant Eagle we're talking about a few things but I want to kind of just lay a little foundation this morning and then begin looking at the wisdom in the Book of Proverbs by God's grace so very thankful for the word of the Lord this morning and good to see the Saints in the house of Lord proverbs chapter 1 [Music] Rober chapter 1 verse 1 the Proverbs of Solomon the son of David king of Israel to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding to receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and equity to give subtility to the simple to young man knowledge and discretion a wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels to understand a proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark sayings the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom but fools despise wisdom and instruction I like verse 10 my son if sinners entice the consent thou not that's just bar heads in word of Prayer ask the Lord here to minister if you ever need on your heart just make it unto God as we pray Heavenly Father we've opened this divinely inspired book we know every word Lord God is inspired it's God breathed Lord you've anointed men of God to write this book and given it to us we know there is profound wisdom inside of this book in every page but Lord especially here in the books of wisdom Lord speak to us this morning Lord God I believe numerous thoughts I've had in just studies Lord I've just felt felt you leading me Lord to this book so I just pray you'd guide me by the Holy Spirit Lord God and may it be a blessing to your people father for we all want to be wise Lord God none of us want to be foolish we want to be wise Lord God so help us this morning Lord to understand the Word of God and help us to have wisdom with that word that you've given to us we ask you to meet every need now in Jesus Christ's name never said Amen god bless you to be in season praise the Lord so Malachi can switch over there buddy we've got some quotes and things want to show I just kind of want to do a an outline this morning and maybe like a summary and then I want to close with just some of those thoughts the revelations I feel like God has shown me in the book of Proverbs by God's grace I'm not really preached on it you know I'm sorry I think I plugged in the wrong adapter here pardon me never really preached you know through this book but I'd like to begin preaching through this book if the Lord would help me this morning so I want to let's look at a introduction here to proverbs and I like to use slides because it kind of slows me down kind of try to say sometimes like going too fast and I just kind of want to slow and emphasize different thoughts so that's what I love about PowerPoint it slows me down you know I've just in a hurry to I always have so much to say but this kind of forces me to slow down and not I like that you know there's importance to the proverbs they're divinely inspired we know they are actually God's guide for our daily lives which actually guide us to eternal life we're supposed to take these proverbs and apply them everyday and then that makes a way that makes a guide for us to go to heaven to be with Christ it's proverbs is quite clear on this where it says the way of life is above to the wise that he may depart from Hell beneath so the Bible plainly states it there to depart from Hell is to choose the way of wisdom barmy and I love this she is a tree of life to them that lay upon her so when a Christian really has the wisdom of God and this is what we're gonna you know we're gonna emphasize again and again the wise Virgin will have all these proverbs manifesting in her life the foolish virgin will have some of them but she's going to miss out on certain of them that deal with the baptism of the holy ghost of course but it makes it a tree of life and brother Branham said over and over again but one time in particular in marriage in divorce he said that Christ is the Tree of Life so wisdom is personified as a woman how many brothers know your wife is very wise y'all better raise your hand she's a tree of life God uses a woman to represent wisdom there's something about a woman's personality that God built and formed to be very wise to be analytical to examine things to understand things and I was look at this thing to some research I don't have it in front of me is from Michael Hyatt I really like some things he says he's just like a motivational speaker but it kind of motivates me to be more diligent but he was saying there's some research that shows how you know men and women's brains are different you know men's brains more focus on the possibilities and and taking risk whereas a woman's mind is more analytical and more thinking about the details and that's definitely true in my marriage there's definitely true my wife thinks that things are really well you know very thoroughly through whereas I just kind of like to I'll just go with that you know I see the direction I want to go and I don't think about the details maybe but its personified as a woman now and we're gonna see there's many types here you can type it to an individual woman but you can also type it to the bride of Jesus Christ the Church of Jesus Christ is like a tree of life amen I'm gonna glad when you come to our church you can hear the words of eternal life you will hear part of it you know you hear some things at other churches that don't believe the message you know here's part of it but here we're supposed to get a whole loaf of wisdom oh not just a slice we're supposed to have a whole loaf of the eternal wisdom of God Almighty I'm glad we got an amen hallelujah we have it by the grace of God how do you know because you can look at the lives of those who are living off wisdom you know give every person the word test give you yourself the word test examine yourselves according to the word not according to other people but when we look at ourselves align ourselves look with God's Word we can look at other lives and say my there no they don't have this wisdom that God is offering and God is graciously offering this wisdom he is we'll get to that in Chapter 1 in just a moment let us keep looking here now here's why it's important to you and I as well other than eternal life if we are the wise virgins our lives should be centered around the wisdom of Proverbs because we're wise virgins that's what we're called by Jesus wisdom of course is the first gift of the Holy Ghost needed to manage the other gifts so wisdom is so crucial to the Bride of Christ who has the gifts operating charity those first needed before wisdom so you really must be born again that makes you wise virgin and then if you have that Holy Spirit seal inside of you then you'll take that wisdom that's a part of that Co a part of that Europe and you apply it to every gift of God in our myths amen wisdom has to manage every all the other eight and this is beautiful as we'll get to it kind at the end the climax or culmination of proverbs is this mature fruitful rare woman of wisdom the Bible says who can find a woman like this and when I preach on that I'm gonna probably reach on the next set well not whether there ought to be your next Sunday so the Sunday after I don't want the sisters would be discouraged I'm sure you've read proverbs 31 before I don't want you be discouraged because you've got to see her as she's a woman she represents the church this is what the church as a whole will be will produce if she's got the wisdom of God in her life and this is and for one woman to accomplish that it's possible but it's very rare so it's it's something that is something that should encourage us look how much God can use a woman if she's yield to the Spirit amen but it's not these things aren't to discourage this looks just like the life of Christ shouldn't discourage us brothers you know what Christ never felt a lust or Christ never I could never be like Christ that shouldn't discourage us but we should look at his victories and say my if he overcome that then he can help me overcome that he's the sakr of all those who need help amen he overcame it for my sake amen hallelujah so we've got to understand that that this is therefore our our it's like our goal this is what we're shooting for is this mature Christian who who can hear the voice of God who has the mind of Christ amen which we're gonna see that's very similar to wisdom is the mind of Christ the Holy Ghost these are kind of synonymous things here now the author of course was Solomon he says it in chapter 1 verse 1 in chapter 10 verse 1 he's the author and he he gathered it's really striking he gathered all this all these Proverbs and he placed them in this this book because that's what Ackley's yesyes 12:9 says the preacher was why's he still taught the people knowledge yeah he yeah he gave good he and sought out and set in order many proverbs so sow there's a time of Solomon's life where he was just collecting wisdom all the time he collected he write it down collected you tell his scribes write this down file it for me keep this don't use this I'm gonna need this later he was just collecting he was a collector of wisdom I'll tell you the greatest collection of wisdom we have it right here the word of the Lord we have to look very far we have to go on the internet and search for wisdom so much you can but any wisdom out there's got to be backed up right here because this is the whole Council of God amen so he was one that was searching out and setting in order and and looking for wisdom and God gave it to him because we know he asked for it because he said Behold I've done a cord to thy words you know he was offered money and he's offered anything you want somebody said give me an understanding heart that I might judge your people he said I've given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there is none like thee before they neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee what man outside of Jesus Christ could write a book as inspired as the proverbs 31 chapters of just golden nuggets of truths that we all need to listen to and obey no man has ever written because no man was wiser than Solomon outside of Christ no one could write such an inspired book God anointed him to collect all this wisdom write down this knowledge for our sake today amen that's why I wrote it down the Bible says see the Proverbs of Solomon doesn't mean that you know he had everyone these ones you know was just originally from him it wasn't like that no doubt maybe some of them were but the scripture tells us he had over 3,000 proverbs 3,000 and now you know there's not three thousand verses you know well there might be I have to check that out there might be there might be three thousand verses in Proverbs I don't know that's I've to add those up I doubt it but he says look here more in first Kings four and God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much enlarged nosov heart even as a sand that is on the seashore his wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East country and all the wisdom of Egypt for he was wiser than all men then Ethan the Ezra hide and he Manon and chow call and Darla the sons of Mahal and his fame was in all nations round about and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a thousand and five this man was just receiving inspiration all the time he imagined three thousand thoughts and then I thought I was a hundred songs I was a thousand songs a thousand songs just about the glory of God the wisdom of God the instruction of God and His wisdom went to all all extremes he had wisdom from trees he had wisdom from a common weed called hyssop he learned wisdom from beasts he learned wisdom from the birds and creeping things and fishes he had wisdom he could gain wisdom from anything and that reminds us of brother Brad and I said my first Bible was what nature and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon from all kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom now if you'd like I have this little I thought that Bible I bought last year with the gift cards it has all these divisions and it shows you where all these different things are so the topics are organized by category on these printouts I have so if you want to learn about anger there's this little printout to tell you right where to find anger you can find something similar I'm sure on the internet but look look how much that proverbs covers anger anxiety bitterness desire jealousy grief sadness all these human emotions healing hope joy delight rejoicing love hate panic dread separation shame the human spirit friends neighbors strangers enemies and dynamics of relationships all this is covered in proverbs if we're willing to look for it our tongues in our bodies the longevity of our bodies the strength our body bones the head gray hair our face eyes ears mouth tongues lips neck hand heart foot you can gain wisdom from all these body parts and God has a purpose for all of them nobody likes the gray hair proudly but there's wisdom in that gray hair that gray hair speaks to something and then the godly traits you can find the Blessed that how God covers us he conceals a sin discerning judicious astute discretion fear glory being even being you know centered even with the word street-level humble lowly meek integrity blameless wholeness learning instruction practical wisdom prudence purity righteousness to be satisfied with God understanding upright integrity and marital faithfulness and then there's the ungodly traits the abominations horrible deeds backsliders the boorish the brutish the stupid the Bible calls it cruel deceitful deceiving enticing evil fools gluttony drinking perverse pride reproach scoffers scorn or shame simple-minded sins traitors treacherous vanity vengeance wicked the viciousness offense and adultery and if you want know about economics they have justice injustice poverty wealth work work habits occupation business business practices borrowing lending inheritance possessions properties lotteries farming it gets into political matters about political justice injustice war those in authority goes into nature with creation water birds animals weather storms silver gold jewels even goes into cities and towns and then principles of commandments councils guidance secret counsel discipline goodness grace justice injustice knowledge law mercy name the reputation peace rebuke scolding truth lies wisdom in our word day men he was more wise than all the kings of Egypt he knew what God wanted for political matters amen God knew what we can learn from nature and showed it to Solomon he had principles God wanted us to know God wants us to know these things God wants us to apply this advice to our lives but as we as we've known as I preach out at a couple years ago the sad thing about Solomon Solomon had all this as the sand of the sea but he ultimately left the beach can I say like that he was enjoying life at the beach like you all do on vacation like to go down to the beach but he spiritually left that beach he left the wisdom for the sake of his wives I don't want I don't want you to miss that he had all this wisdom at his disposal all these gifts all these truths all these understandings all this instruction but he turned from it but for the sake of his wives to please his wives he loved many strange women the Bible says God had not God see God even gave a warning God said these women are going to turn your hearts away in first Kings verse 11 and the seven hundred wives and princesses 300 concubines his wives turned away his heart so he could have all this the sand of the sea as far as wisdom and all the other glory and the promises behind it but he eventually kind of got old to him he let the word of God become common to him God help us to not let the beach become common to us remember the story brother mantle what's so special about the beach I've seen him for 40 years what's so special about your church I've been going there for 10 years it's not us it's special it's the word is special it's your credit though your walk with God that's special it's the presence of Christ in your life that's special amen and you've got to keep it special I'll see you grieve him and then he leaves your life his influence in your life will leave if you don't keep it special but we've got to keep it special it keeps going and says it came to pass when he was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as David David just failed in one manner Bathsheba every other thing he kept he went after asterisk the goddess of the zidonians milcom the abomination of the hammerites and Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord and went not fully after the Lord as did David his father so much wisdom 3000 proverbs he could live from he can pull strength from 3000 different sources but at the end of his life the women seem more interesting than the Word of God and yet he's seen God twice just like brother Branham saw Jesus try twice what a striking contrast between brother Branham and Salomon aha then did Salman bring in a high place for shamash the abomination of Moab can you imagine Jerusalem putting up building permits you know they come down to the temple to worship on a Sabbath day it's Saturday brother amen and his wife were walking down there to bring their lambs you know their offerings oh there's a building permit oh I wonder what Solomon's building today one of he's gonna add to the temple no it's it's a house of whoredom it's a house of spiritual heart it's a house of idols can you imagine the people right here's a man that love the Lord and yet he allowed repeated permit after permit after permit to all these houses of hell can I say like that abominations disgusting hateful loathsome things in the mind of God so it proves it's not so much what you have it's what you do with what you have that's why God will say foolish virgins than denominations that's why God will save Catholics it's what you do with what you have amen you're judged by what you do it's what you have he did this for all of his strange wives I don't know if that's you know I'm not sure how many houses that was but amongst a thousand wives how many different gods because you have the Bible said he built a house for all of their gods and yet he had all this wisdom like the sand of the sea so how did God feel about that angry anger you know Solomon was saved of course Jesus talks about the glory of Solomon and we know that he was buried with you know by David his father and so forth like this but it made God in a temporary sense angry with Solomon not to wrath but to his disobedience he was upset with Solomon's disobedience I've showed myself to you twice you've seen the pur glory of God twice you've asked for all this wisdom and then you asked or but then you do nothing with it my we must remember what we asked for we must be faithful with what we've asked for Church see wisdom is useless without application who has been given more wisdom than the people in the message who do you know as the Buddhists been given more wisdom Mahatma Gandhi has a how you say his name has he been given more wisdom than the people the message absolutely not because our our wisdom is thus saith the Lord our wisdom is the Bible the mysteries on the Bible the loose ends the confusion that's all been unwrapped although the seals have all been unwrapped and the loose ends have all been tied together and now the Bible makes sense and now we know what God expects but what are we doing with what he's given to us we have a great responsibility to apply and live this message that's what I love to live it that's what I love to see who will hang around who will hang around and live the message not just talk about it and not even just come to church but actually live it in every day of your life that's what I get excited about to see people who actually live what brother Branham said not just saying that's good and well I agree with it you know but who actually live what brother Branham said as it's written in the Bible that's what we're talking about not just brother man we talked about that last week 1977 you know not just things that he said but things that were actually in the scripture which was most of what he said now you get this wisdom here I'm sorry and what good are gifts if they're not consecrated completely to Almighty God what good is it to see God twice to have wisdom and proverbs as the sand of the sea what good is that to have access to the beach on your vacation if it rains the whole time or if you just don't want to go out because you rather sit in and watch TV or something but what good would that beach be it wouldn't do any good and so what good is what good is the message unless we're gonna be fully going after the message with all of our hearts so see that's what that's these are these thoughts I want to pull out from Proverbs he accumulated all this wisdom and he was for a while he's very faithful just pulling in all the wisdom but there came a spot when he stopped applying it to his life he thought that he was above the message praise the Lord he thought he's above that and I have so much peace and I've done so much forgotten I'm above that I don't have to live that anymore god help us to just remain humble that means below Christ not exalting are what we want above but just to remain just do what God says so hard to find humble people right we should be the most humble praise the Lord that's right now verses I'm sorry chapters 1 to 24 were all wisdom of Solomon that he wrote down during his days but the Bible tells us chapters 25 to 29 just think this just like kind of like details about Proverbs I love seeing all these details in the scripture I never knew before so I had to share them with you they were collected and copied in Hezekiah time when Scofield pointed that out when I was reading his notes because the Bible says it's in Proverbs 25 these are also Proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out so these were copied out after Solomon died in the days of Hezekiah and then the Holy Spirit had them put you know chapters 1 to 24 together with chapters 25 to 29 and then chapters 30 and 31 were by Egger and King Lemuel respectively so that's where we get that's that's how the book is brought together a 1 to 24 from Solomon than the Solomon wrote those down collected those and then in the days of Hezekiah they found these other Proverbs of Solomon they brought them together to make this book along with these last two chapters now the message and purpose of this book is to exhort encourage and offer hope amen how many one hoped today and the one of the purposes of this book is to the youth so we need to teach our young people the wisdom of God because Almond repeatedly admonishes the young people my son my son chapters one through eight is full of that my son listen to me listen to me son he says they're supposed to pursue wisdom rather than foolishness Solomon is trying to nip it at the bud with there's any temptation for sin Solomon is trying to nip it at the bud to make sure the life is not a disgraced life which which may end up with salvation at the end but Solomon wants a fruitful life for Christ he doesn't want to thief on the cross at this point doesn't want a thief on the cross experience where you're a thief your whole life a murder your whole life and at the last moment you get saved thank God for that but Solomon saying as you're young remember Christ when you're young amen choose a wise path don't choose a foolish path and he goes says over and over learn being let someone instruct you take instruction be teachable in other words go to church and learn something however you learn mess if you learn best by writing it down write it down learn something don't act like you know everything because the Holy Spirit will go right over the top of your head if you don't humble yourself you must be teachable if not if you're not teachable you'll become a mocker and don't we see that in different churches people that are no longer hungry to learn and grow in the Word of God they just mock other people they mock preachers they mock anybody who's trying to feed on the Word of God some and said you want to become one of the other a learner or a mocker we don't want to be in church the Pharisees were mocking the move of God out there they're mocking that and we don't want to mock the move of God we want to be right in the thick of it amen I want to be right in the thick of it hallelujah Amen now here's where we're gonna get down into some just some understanding of proverbs proverbs are not the same as laws and commands necessarily they're more like advice they're they predict they're more like predictions prediction that that those who pursue wisdom would generally find success and happiness in this earthly life so there's many of the Proverbs or predictions as we'll see I'll show you some examples this morning but then other proverbs are absolute promises that they'll find blessings for in eternity like I've already showed you the one to one's about eternal life so there are some proverbs that are just wisdom like this is pretty good advice you should follow this advice in every situation but it's not a guarantee guarantee and we'll get to those we'll get to those and then others are absolute promises of God she really got the balance when you read proverbs and especially when you read Ecclesiastes you really got to balance that out Ecclesiastes of Solomon he's battling is this even worth it this seems meaningless what is this about life and this one dies the next one raises up and don't even care what his father did and left him all his money he don't even care and solomon sees it all he's wrestling with these ideas and he says it's vanity it's meaningless it's it's meaningless but see that's a mind that's not born again by the Holy Ghost hey Dad that's right and so Ecclesiastes shows this wrestling with Solomon trying to understand life and and he brings it down the best he can without the baptism of the Holy Ghost he brings it down to saying fear God and keep his commands that's the best and that is that is still the best thing to do but we should not look at our daily lives and say it's vain you know the fellowship or it's vain to read my Bible it's vain to save money or we shouldn't look at it like that we should rejoice in what God has given us the wisdom and enjoy every moment that God has given us on this earth amen enjoy and see God's hand in it and see how God wants to put his hand into our lives amen I just look at just and this pessimistic view God doesn't want negative pessimistic Christians God wants Christians that are full of the joy of the Lord the happiness the peace of God that passes all understanding God wants us to be overcomers amen ha ha that's right church overcomers yeah we'll go through trials but we were not we shouldn't be pessimistic like Solomon was in Ecclesiastes and why and I've got little hint why it was like that because he was given he was given love to his wives at that time this at the end of his life he's writing Ecclesiastes he all his heart's already turned away from God so he started saying this seems vain this seems useless this seems useless but the Bible said there's nothing that's done in vain in the Lord and how to do yet God sees every effort we give amen God hears every prayer God sees every time we try to seek his face it's not done if been done in vain if it's done in the Lord Amen it's exactly right but there are like I said there are proverbs you have to balance out they deal more with probability and prediction or as advice more so than actual commandment so let's look at a few I didn't get to the structure there's a different part I want to get to the structure but I did get to this outline this is how Scofield outlines and I just I just try to stay with Scofield because mother man liked a lot of his work not all of it but a lot of it so chapters one to seven is two sons Solomon is speaking directly to his son and then he prays his wisdom in chapters 8 9 and then the folly of sin but of course there's there's a lot of wisdom in here too it kind of shows the blessing of obedience and then the folly of sin it kind of shows both I just wrote what Scofield said but you understand warnings and instructions are in chapters 20 to 29 the words of agar chapter 30 and then the the words of King Lemuel chapter 31 now what is wisdom I had to find it like this and correct me if I'm wrong after church notice I said after church your application is de Miz your application of the word to your daily life we all know we hear the word we know the word that's just knowledge okay I know it I know it I know it now how do you apply it how do you base your decisions with the knowledge that you have how do you base your to sit right what what decisions do you make based upon what you know that is wisdom or lack thereof I put in another way that we might you know program talks about how we're creators that's what wisdom is you take the Word of God and you create an atmosphere in your home praise the Lord you create an atmosphere in your church that's wisdom you're taking what you know and you create with that word you let that word live through you amen hallelujah how will you build your crate this this light of yours how well are you building what are you building what kind of atmosphere are you creating what kind of life what kind of habits are you forming this is what wisdom is here for amen how do you want to build a life that's a testimony a monument to Jesus Christ now I come up with this definition because of the Hebrew here's the Hebrew Hebrew means skill in war but also skill shrewdness prudence which is governing or disciplining yourself that's it's the application you govern your own life with that's wisdom how you govern yourself how you rule over yourself like Paul said I've got to beat my body and bring it under subjection he's talking about whiz that's what wisdom does it governs over your sinful nature that's inside your flesh now wisdom in the Greek has a similar meaning it's your skill in the management of your affairs it's the practice of a godly and upright life not just talking about how loving God is or how great or how wonderful the bride is or or how holy the bride is or how to beat it not just talking about it but actually doing it that's a wisdom is how you apply the Word of God that's preached to you and that you read in your home how you apply that to your life now you've got to hold a wisdom it's the atmosphere you create it's the the life that you're building through the wisdom of God through the Word of God now Webster a Moore a modern definition is something like good sense or judgment you know we would say oats and that does apply spiritually it kind of it lines up with our other definitions but Webster calls it the ability to discern inner qualities and relationships insight which is true I mean every decision you make involves wisdom you're they're gonna use the wisdom of God or you're not going to use the wisdom of God so it all does go together now I kind of put a note here wisdom is a gift of the Holy Ghost and yet also and actually that every Christian should possess I didn't put up the scriptures here but I preached on him before about how wisdom is something we should all grow in knowledge and wisdom always go together throughout the the New Testament knowledge and wisdom now I'm gonna call back - when I preach on the gifts of the Spirit how I differentiated differentiated between wisdom and discernment wisdom the word of wisdom is the skill in managing affairs its discretion imparting truth and Jesus said wisdom is justified through its children or in other words wisdom is declared through the works or your actions right so your actions show our actions show the results of our actions show if we use wisdom or not and then wisdom tells you what to do with Bible knowledge because the Bible said wisdom hath builded her house wisdom takes the materials of knowledge and starts building them into something a structure because a wise man builds his house upon a rock hallelujah wise man mother bear said wisdom is the best group but guess best gift of the group of the nine gifts of the Spirit remember he said if you'll notice he said the verses to get the wisdom this is the best gift of the group and if we don't have wisdom we won't know how to use knowledge he says which is the second gift praise the Lord we got to have this wisdom first to know what to do with the other gifts of the Holy Spirit now discernment though is just to say though but the sermon is just distinguishing or judging the source behind an action that's the sermon wisdom is actually taking the word and actually doing something with it but discernment is just able to say that's of God that's of the devil that's what the sermon is and it's important gift because the sermon judges the spirit behind actions prophecies and words according to the Bible so wisdom and discernment are close but discernment is just the simple acknowledging of God not of God brother Branham said a message of tongues has to be before the church receives it Paul said leave two or three judges with discernment of spirit before it can be accepted to the church that's all discernment is and thank God thank God the sermons there but it's not as great of a gift as wisdom how do you apply what we've heard that's are my desires a pastor to help you learn myself to learn how to apply the message to our daily lives that's right now I'm gonna skip past that because that's the court I just read now what's a proverb because we have the book of Proverbs that when you know wisdom is and can contain in Proverbs a proverb is a brief well-known principle that states a general truth this is generally true in most cases it's a proverb it's kind of like this is what is probably going to be the end result if you do this action right because in the in the in the Hebrew proverb means a maxim it's a maximum and a maximum is an adage or a general truth a fundamental principle or it's a rule of conduct you should generally do this this is a generally the right way to do it adage is a principle now I put at the bottom note that proverbs are general truths they're fundamental principles some are absolute truths as we said some proverbs emphasize probability about what will likely happen but not always not always let me share some examples so let me show some absolute examples of proverbs versus probability proverbs I can say it like that so here's some I'm sorry we already the absolutes yeah so though if you choose wisdom you're gonna be saved there's no doubt about that right you if you if you eat from the tree of life the holy ghost you're going to be saved no doubt about its absolute right if you let it go all the way down to your soul you're gonna be saved now let me give you an example of a probability it's proverbs 22:6 train up a child in the way you should go and when he is old he will not depart from it and yet we can all say we know families who raise children the best they could to know God better than what they received as children yet their children turn away from God so this is of a proverb that's problem it's a probability it's predictive because there's no guarantee that every child of a believer is going to be saved there's no guarantee because the examples Jacob and Esau God hated Esau hated him and yet who's gonna say that Isaac and Rebekah were not good parents who's gonna raise up and say they got Bible proof for that right Jacob turned out to be a type of Christ Jacob turned out to be a mighty man of God right the twelve tribes of Israel the trove tribes of Jacob he was like the father of the 12 tribes both his parents were righteous scripture never alludes that Esau his parents did not train them in the ways of God do you think Isaac and Rebekah are saying it's okay for you to drink and smoke Esau but I I'm sorry but Jacob no you can't do that it's okay for you to watch evil things but no Jacob you're not allowed to do you think they were doing that absolutely not they've been hypocrites they have been compromisers so see there's there's but generally it's true if you raise a child and train them with love and the way the Bible says generally they're gonna keep the habits that you've formed in their lives generally they asked brother Branham this is quite a question are all the children of those who go in the rapture are they gonna go in the rapture - what a question to ask brother Branham doesn't give them a guarantee he just says if if if their names are on the book he cannot guarantee that every child of a believer is going to be safe it all depends if their name is on the book Esau they could not guarantee Esau was gonna be safe because God knew God foreknew what was in his heart evil was in his heart so there's no guarantees with salvation salvation is of the Lord he has mercy on whom he would I'm talking about there's no guarantees as far as parents training that's what I'm talking about there is a guarantee for you if you have faith amen that's Jesus's word Jesus word is a guarantee he that believeth on me has passed from death unto life Amen hallelujah and will not come into condemnation there are guarantees for believers but as far as parents if you train them up and do the best that you can there really is no guarantee it's all about their calling it's all about the election of God the Bible says he has mercy on whom he will and that's what Romans 9 18 now here's a probability in the Psalms I don't know if you ever check this out but David said I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread that's not a promise this is misunderstood this is not a promise that a Christian will never have to beg for food it's not because it's true it's true David never saw a believer begging bread that's true David never saw it but if you go to Luke 16 20 the Bible caused Lazarus a beggar and he got the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table and the church said and you can't tell me he wasn't a seat of God because there is with Abraham in Abraham's bosom as the seat of Abraham so what does it show God that's true God with David David never saw righteous person begging bread but there may be a time there may be a situation where God allows a Christian or believer to become a beggar why in order to have a testimony in order to be able to say well this person overcame this person was an overcomer he you cannot say it wasn't the seed of Abraham because right there he's with Abraham hallelujah I love the wisdom of the Holy Spirit don't you church oh my I think it's beautiful so we got to be careful when we when we try to interpret the Word of God like like in the case of the children well these parents all it's their fault they didn't raise their child good enough well be careful wait till you have children wait till you have children I will see what kind of children you produce it's easy to judge that's why the Bible said be merciful [Laughter] be merciful here's another probability look at this proverbs 12 21 there shall no evil happen to the just no evil but then job tells his wife show we received good the hand of God and not receive evil he's making a general observation right that Christians generally God will not send evil upon them God will generally not allow evil to come upon them but sometimes he does now this hero I wrote here this might refer to the soul because once you get sealed by the Baptist and Holy Ghost Satan can't touch your soul praise the Lord all things and remember all things work together for good to them that love the Lord the Bible said there's no evil happen to the just of course nothing evil can happen to myself Christ is living in me praise God might happen evil to my flesh like job or even my spirit I might get some horrible mind battle or something some awful you know disruption of my spirit you know am I gonna scar my mind or some shocking tragic accident that might shake my mind but the Bible said no evil will happen to the just so see we've got to look at this as probability these are predictive things some of these proverbs are predictive and we can clearly see that through the scripture here's another probability we often misunderstand proverbs 10 27 the fear of the Lord prolong if days in other words if you if your fear God you live longer than sinners but the years of the wicked shall be shortened so some if we're not careful then every Christians got to live longer than every sinner you know well we got some problems in Jesus Christ was the most righteous man ever he only lived 33 years st. Paul lived around 58 to 60 years brother Branham only lived 56 years but Hugh Hefner the Playboy founder lived 91 years Billy Graham live 99 so in some cases the Reich just do live longer right but sometimes the sinners live longer the church said Hugh Hefner was one of the most awful wicked business man's ever because he exploited the the beauty that God gave to women exploited it and then live with a bunch of women all his adult life fornication after for adultery after dollar after Daltry after Daltry all for money SiC and he lived 91 years old 91 years remember Saul's death was premature so there there are some truths to this but even God God didn't lengthen Saul's days he shortened them because that kind of goes with this if you do wicked things I'm gonna shorten your life and then Hezekiah was not wicked but his death was post mature due to his sins he lived 15 extra years in the permissive will of God rather than the perfect will of God it would've been better if he would have left 15 years earlier but generally it's true if you serve God your life's gonna last longer generally and generally God will take sinners off the earth generally much of the time but there are some times where God allows tests or God is testing our faith or or God God God is doing something church that's we gotta remember God is doing something today amen he's in control he knows what he's doing praise the Lord we've got to trust God we've got to trust the process that God is playing out in our lives there's a lot more on this if the days the days of our years are threescore and ten and if look at that if there's no guarantee we'll get seventy years there's no guarantee brother Graham got fifty-six right and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years yet their strength labor and sorrow for too soon cut off and we fly away I remind me that song I'll fly away Oh glory so you brought a man that's what happens when we die we fly away hallelujah brother Lawrence we'll fly away we died flying off to heaven amen it's scriptural hallelujah that's right heat now God weak and it's my strength in their way he shortness my days this is what David wrote look it up it's David wrote this he's shortening my days so see it's all about God's purpose God's timing on some of these proverbs proverbs 3:16 length of days is in her right hand and in left her left hand riches and honor so God may give you from his left hand he may give you a I'm sorry right hand length of days left hand riches and honor either way I just want to kiss that nail-scarred hand I just want to I just want to get everything I receive I want everything I received to come from the hand of Christ Jobe said this seeing his days are determined so see God has a determined number God had 99 years for Billy Graham the number of his months are with thee God already knows the number thou has appointed his bounds that he cannot pass brother Ram couldn't live past 56 years because God had numbered his years got a number as months and the same thing is true for you and I God has all of our days in his hand amen he said my times are in that hand deliver me from the hand of mine enemies and from then that persecute me does this help by God's grace I hope it's a help it's getting real quiet out there I hope it's a help to you by the grace of Lord I'll try to watch my time too sometimes I know it gets quiet because I'm going so long so I know that so I cuz I was sat listening to brother salmon too and I kind of got tired at the end of course I was sick you know okay I'm not often sitting the sees what I'm saying I'm mostly up at the pulpit preaching so I get all kinds of energy and inspiration up here but when I sit there you know I got a battle through that the flesh I put 15 minutes aw give me about 20 minutes we'll try to finish up here these three books in the Bible are known as the wisdom books proverbs ecclesiastes in job they complement each other they don't contradict a compliment but you've got to look at them the right way like Ecclesiastes this is Solomon's struggle he's struggling in life he's saying this is vain if I work this is vain if I read books or this is vain because he's struggling he doesn't he don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's compromising right he's compromising with women he's compromising on the word he's not using the wisdom God gave him amen so he's struggling the preach the preacher was struggling and that day of all the people to struggle that's the one we don't want to struggle because he's guiding the rest yet he was struggling they didn't have the Holy Ghost in the baptism see he was struggling to connect behavior well this sinner behaves like this but his consequence seems different both died and this one lives the whys that the Beast this one dies like the Beast and and this one is the sinner lives longer than the holy one what is this he was trying to understand the uncertainty of life in other words he was trying to understand God's plan for every person but Church you and I can't understand God's plan for every person who can understand God's prophet brother Graham dying in a car accident I've never heard a preacher understand that or explain that to me why why God want to do it and you know why because it was God's decision and he didn't share with anybody from Peregrine's testimony all the people all the bodies that were in intensive care unit they all got healed and left according to Perry green testimony so that might have been part of it but he died you know December 24th 1965 he died but all the other ones got healed in there why I don't know why it's God's purpose he's the author of truth he's the author of peace he's the author of hope he's not the author of confusion of frustration that's where we're going to he's the author of peace God had a number of months for brother Branham he fulfilled it let's just be faithful for our number of months job also brings balance to these general truths of proverbs he was a righteous man yet he was tested like few others yeah he was perfect in the sight of God and this lets us know Church that God is in control throughout your entire trial hope it's okay but I just you know I've been talking to brother John hope it's okay if I say this about John but in the midst of his trial with this hip replacement he's been looking for the hand of God in it he's seeing he's seeing how he's shared with me how God has allowed this to happen and different things happening his lives to see how God is what God is doing with and I think that's very admirable of our brother to see these things the pain that he suffers the physical pain and different things like that that's admirable because he could have too easily took the other way and thought all gods against me and what good is it to do serve God and all he could add others negative attitude he could have looked at like Solomon what good is it vanity vanity all these years of serving God vanity but he's choosing look at it as God has a purpose in it God is doing something amen God maybe no understand it but I got enough faith in maturity know that God is doing something in my life amen God's in control I didn't bring myself here God brought me here and I didn't bring myself here then God's got a he's got a purpose for me being here now I want to bring this thought to this is getting real deep so bear with me I'm gonna go real deep here for a moment I think this whole series is gonna be deep because I've really I'm gonna scratch my head a few times but it's good that the Holy Spirit brings us the deep things of God job was perfect yet to say in heaven he was perfect but on the earth he was battling fear how can a man by the Amen be battling fear on the earth but yet in heaven God sees him as perfect because God's looking at his sacrifice what a job say job said the thing which I greatly fear job just didn't battle with this every now and then brother John it was just wasn't well I battled fear every now and then it was a constant battle he was scared Oh mom I'm gonna lose my children I might lose my money I might lose my home I might is something he battled all the time yet in heaven God said this man is perfect amen Ilia why because he your Feist the soccer the blood sacrifice a man he met gods requirement but yet he had mind battles and I'm so scared I'm gonna lose all this don't be scared about losing material things just be concerned about losing your testimony for Christ's fear also is a seed and it works in the law of reaping and sowing joel planted seeds of fear in his life and he said that which i planted i reaped church let's not be a slave to fear this morning amen let's not be a slave to doubt don't don't greatly battle doubt past all the doubt out and have faith that god knows what he's doing amen joke planted in the heaven he's perfect because he sacrificed blood he used the blood of God told you I was going deep but at the same time was perfect in heaven he's battling spiritual powers and principalities in high places amen and he lost the battle can I say like that brother Bram said he lost the battle I'm not presuming I'm telling you what brother Branham said God sees his children as perfect or sinless in heaven under their blood sacrifice because there's no condemnation than learn in Christ Jesus hallelujah see don't let guilt get you I know we struck time people have told me they struggle with guilt in our church from time to time they feel guilty like God can't forgive them this proves God does forgive you amen you're perfect in heaven but in the earth you're still battling because God accepts your sacrifice and he just wants you to develop some real character down there on earth amen he just wants you to overcome on the battlefield hallelujah but in heaven you're already perfect there's no condemnation to you you're forgiven you're going to heaven you're a child of God trust God at the same time God sees him is perfect I still need to correct my child he shouldn't have planted all these fear seeds in his life because if you plant fear guess what you're going to get Church here if you plant holiness guess what guess what you're gonna get holiness the man said and look at the book of Job and said Joe feared and what he feared it actually happened because it's a law of reaping and sowing what brought it his fear what brought this test upon him brother Baptist had fear that's what made it happen his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought him brought it to him and the church said his faith could have kept it from him so doesn't this make you feel better Church doesn't make it feel better job wasn't perfect he reap what he sowed but he also overcame by the blood he overcame by understanding God as England I had to learn it on a hard lesson after 42 chapters he had to learn at our lesson 42 chapters of argue and he argued three times with those three friends there's three cycles of three in there which is pretty striking and interesting then Allah who comes and then God comes oh my god had to show him this I'm in control and you know God really never answered why he loved this trial to go to pass God never let job know about that he just said you try to you run the universe sometime cuz job was accusing God of not being faithful he said where is God I'm just invited God allowing this what's wrong with God and God said you try to run you try to bring snow out of the the great secret places you tried to divide the rivers from the stream you tried to divide the mountains from the land try that sometimes you see it was to Humble him search time you know we want to be humble by God's grace humble humble God knows what he's doing Church it's the wisdom of God he was scared it was gonna happen and it did happen now if he if he knowed it would it happened it wouldn't happen see what I mean so look it was a seed of fear planted in his life that's why when you come to church honest Church hear the word of God and leave a different person leave with different thoughts or else you're gonna reap what you sow you got to speak the Word of God like we said last week the overcomer speaks the word amen I will not let fear I will not let doubt I would not let lust oh not get greed I'll not let these things take a root in my life I'll let faith rule my life but man said if you're afraid when you come in the prayer line maybe I just have got enough faith all submission it'll never happen don't worry why because you've already planted seeds of fear in your life yet in heaven you're gonna be saved you're gonna go to heaven you're gonna be the rapture but on earth you're going through a trial and you've got to overcome that trial so I told you it's deep but if you know it's going to happen healing it'll happen see it's a substance of thump something Jobe had a fear that these things would come upon him and they did if you have a fear that your disease is gonna leave you or won't leave you it won't if you have faith that it will it will leave you love the Lord and I expect some questions so send me an email shoot me an email talk to me after church I know it gets really deep because the thing is God has a certain purpose for every is a certain testimony for every life and he needs to overcomer for every area of life now this is our confidence in Christ I told you I was gonna try to get here our confidence is this that we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose that's the thing Joel didn't know the purpose of it but we are told what the purpose was Satan thought Jobe would just work in the system oh he just serves you because you know you do good to him see we know the purpose their God trying to prove to the devil that somebody will love it may men not just for natural blessings but somebody really loves the righteousness of Christ amen more they love sin and lust that was the purpose of job's trial and also to be a testimony of patience to all of us because remember the patience of Job be patient in trials be patient don't get upset don't try to solve it yourself I know now if you can solve it by God's grace by the leadership the Holy Spirit solve it but if you can't trust God to solve it just give him glory in the midst of the trial amen for whom he did foreknow he did also predetermined he's predetermined to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren God has determined that you are going to live like Christ lived a man God has already determined that you're going to be victorious and you're gonna act like Christ would act amen if Christ was acting a living here in 2018 he'd be living like you are amen that's the predestinated plan of God we are here choice in that amen we're the ones that are supposed to be Christ in flesh Toma moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also justified whom he justified them he also glorified you see Israel could not figure out God's love the Prophet says they thought love meant no suffering they thought their love met a baby with parental care but God said his love was elective love I know we read this Coral you need it I need it because we go through so many mind battles and trials there's so many voices and seeds of doubt and and fear all these things we need to hear the word of God the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen the salvation because God has chosen you from to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose there's an end result God wants to get out of all of our lives and that's why I like we said that's why some of the Proverbs may seem they may seem predictable they may seem like probability because God may have a certain testimony for a believer and they may have to suffer and they'd have to go through different trials but it's all with a purpose in mind God knows what he's doing with the clay aren't you glad all my desire just pour more water on me Lord let the water of the word just pour over me like a hot bath her hot shower just let it pour we clean me out and just mold me help me to just get in your mind if God did not have a purpose he would be the author of frustration I hope we come to church and we don't feel like God it's so frustrating to serve you if we are we've missed the purpose of God we're not we think we know our purpose for our life better than God does and that's called pride but God is the author of peace his purpose is that we after we have suffered a while we be made perfect and be established strengthened and settled in the faith as Jobe said he put strength in us you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things which he suffered like the Bible said about Christ think about what are you learning lately what is God teaching you lately I hope you can think of something he's taught you lately through suffering usually it's through suffering we have to learn the lesson the hard way gotta suffer and oh it's like God's got a pound in our brain and preach it again and preach it again and preach it again and now it comes on a tape I'm listening brother brown then I hear another preacher say it on YouTube where I hear Tara just he's got to just pound it until we go through our thick skulls sometimes let me just be playing a little bit this morning let's not be stubborn let's just be humble let's be teachable we must trust purpose in the probability or the uncertainty of our lives each one of our lives we can't predict the future each one of us have uncertainty about tomorrow there's probability well this may happen or that may happen it's true that may happen but we must trust God in the midst of it all and I'm almost done here I told you 15 minutes yeah I got 14 here left huh gang so afraid so hard now not know I think I hit 30 instead of 15 forgive me I'm looking at that clock here give me yeah let me keep let me give me 13 more now Jesus member now this what we're saying I brought this up before but Jesus gave two examples God needed overcomers for the day of judgment he needed men and women of true christ-like character and so he used the men of Nineveh and the queen of sheba he brings up what is what was their whole life about the men of Nineveh their whole life's purpose was to do one thing repent at Jonas preaching that's all because God is going to raise them all in their judgment what was your testimony we repented when we heard a prophet preach the word amen we knew judgment was coming we knew the wrath of God was coming but we repented and that was the whole purpose for the Amen of their life hey man that part of their testimony is going to speak on the day of judgment it's gonna shine like the Sun the Bible says the Sun of righteousness the Bible says that's the whole purpose of their life was to just repent because member in Jesus member these are gonna witness against Jesus's day because John the Baptist said you generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath of God that is to come and they didn't repent at that so God needed someone with a testimony of repentance and the church said that's beautiful that's the Holy Spirit given us understand that was their whole purpose of life was just to repent their whole life was building up the one thing to repent when a prophet got spit out of a whale's mouth after that just had to live a holy life pleasing to God and God's gonna use them these were over comers oh my life seems so dull my life seems so this is that but just be what God called you to be find the purpose of God for your life and live for Christ with all of your heart amen what was the Queen of Sheba her whole testimony on the day of judgment is to rise up against these Pharisees who wouldn't even go go over and be baptized by John the Baptist or join Jesus church because she came from the uttermost parts of the earth God is gonna use her extreme effort and sacrifice physically she physically sacrificed everything across the desert in order just I just want to hear God's Word amen and God is going to use her as an example of sacrificing everything was there her whole life was about that think about that after she left Israel her life was just it was as a decrescendo said the right word brothers day crescendo decrescendo he would he'd know the music word I learned in fifth grade I remember that that's all I remember see the very climax of her life was to be led by the Holy Spirit to cross the desert and hear the words of Solomon and then the rest of her life was kind of just downhill and God said I'm in that part of your life that I'm sorry Queen of Sheba I'm gonna raise it up on the day of judgment that was your purpose in life and we have sister Wendy crossing the state I wonder if God's gonna use her as a witness one day I wonder Church some of you cross hundreds of my house drive hundreds of miles to church I wonder if God is gonna use you as a witness of it what's the purpose of my life brother Jesse it's so there's so much it's so hard to know I don't know but it sure seems like God chooses very simple humble things in our lives we just need to be faithful with what he's given to us see Satan's trick oh the grass is greener on the other side Oh only my life had a testimony like sister so-and-so only if my life was like brother so-and-so it's so much easier if I was a brother or a preacher or something God wants us to be content with his purpose for our life and we can kick against him all we want but guess what if you're a son of God he's gonna rebuke you and correct you until you get in your position man or woman and the church said you can fight against you can kick against the pricks like Saul you can do all you want but he is gonna give you're a child of God you are gonna find your predestinated place in the body of Christ amen I feel inspired this morning amen how do I so tell her I'm so excited to preach this message this morning I just feel like the wisdom of God's all over it ought to be if it's God's wisdom I ought to be preaching on wisdom let me close with this you're giving I got 9 minutes these were some of the revelations out I believe now rub to me a revelation is the unveiling these are revelations the Holy Spirit I believe gave to me you can disagree but the way you'll know is about what it produces in my life that's how you know if it's a revelation if the gates of hell cannot overcome me then it was a revelation hallelujah that's what Jesus said by the way flesh and blood could not give it unto you but my father which is given it he said that's a revelation and the gates of Hell will not prevail against them we're not prevail against those who have the revelation look at this look at the first and last chapters of Proverbs go home and read it today if you got a chance more than one service go don't read your Bible if you can tonight you off to you anyway chapter one begins with the plea to receive the seeds of wisdom like chapter one which i pers 1/3 all about just receive it get wisdom get understanding it's it's pleading with the young people to receive the seeds and it's from a king to a son and wisdom as build up as is built up as a spiritual lady wisdom as like a symbolic personification of wisdom so if you put wisdom in a person it be a woman a godly woman that I'll encourage our sisters God likens wisdom to a old lady so chapter one is the scene chapter chapter 31 is the fruit chapter or the results of living a life a wisdom from another king that he received from his mother isn't that striking the father is instructing the son the beginning but at the end we see where our another King where did this King get his wisdom from his faithful mother the fifth gospel amen glory all mothers he ought to be so thankful for what God's given to you a chance to teach the next generation the Word of God King Lemuel says this is the prophecy that my mother taught me this is what a true woman who's led by the Holy Ghost in the wisdom of God this is how she lives her life amen where the King get this wisdom from his momma where I get a lot of my wisdom from well if you think it's wisdom for my mom taught me to put God first always pray always go to church never forsake the house of God but God's house above everything else read your Bible pray pray before everything you know give God ties give to people give to the poor know nothing is over not give it to him I know there's balance on that I could preach on that recent I understand that but the idea is like the Proverbs woman the Bible said she stretched out her hand to the poor well preach on that hopefully in about two Sundays she didn't wait for all the beggars to put out their hands to her the Bible said she stretched out her hand to the poor which means she found people that were hurting and she reached out to them instead of them just reaching out to to me give it to me give it to me she she sought people she knew people who are hurting and so she purposely went and found them help them out so see 4:31 is what wisdom is now that wisdom is now in the flesh is no longer symbolic just as lady wisdom now it's in flesh the word is made flesh how many want to be the Word made flesh today amen how many want to be the masterpiece of God amen that's what chapter 31 is all about this is how a wise woman who has applied the wisdom of Solomon throughout the entire book this is what her life produces amen and did you know this I'm gonna preach on this this is good in verses 10 to 31 it starts with who can find a virtuous woman every verse from ten to thirty one starts with a different Hebrew letter it's the A to Z Hebrew alphabet about a mature woman and there's some good thoughts behind that I'm going to bring out the whole alphabet explains in other words all the language declares the wisdom of a godly woman I got it's got a couple more slides I'm almost done I got five more minutes on here so bear with me it's not even one church ninety one I don't know what I don't wear you out you know I told you I try to close to chapter one chapter one contains as go to our Bibles chapter one contains the baptism of the Holy Ghost I read this and it just jumped off the pages to me this is my Dharma it's a revelation of the Holy Spirit I wasn't looking for this I'm just reading and then the voice of the voice of God speaks this to my heart go to proverbs 1 verse 20 now chapter one the baptism the Holy Ghost this is because the baptism Holy Ghost most certainly would represent the mind of Christ when Paul says have the mind of Christ what does he say he saying be filled with the Holy Ghost walk in the spirit obey the spirit use the wisdom of the Holy Ghost look at proverbs 1 22 23 this is beautiful wisdom cries without she utters her voice in the streets what a brother Graham say when they got the Holy Ghost he said they jumped out of windows down into the streets can you believe that church jumped out of windows in the streets and now wisdom what were they saying the Bible said they were declaring the wonderful works of God wisdom doesn't hide itself wisdom declares itself wisdom is not afraid to glorify the Lord ER to honor and magnify the Lord that's not whiz that's fear but wisdom enjoys expressing itself amen hallelujah that's verse 20 she cried in the chief place of Concours in the openings of the gates in the city she out of her voice her word saying I'm sorry how long we love simplicity and scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate now it's look at verse 23 here's the baptism holy ghost turn at you my reproof behold I will pour out my spirit unto you I will make no my words unto you in that beautiful wisdom goes out in the street and said let me pour out the spirit unto you amen Joel chapter 2 Acts chapter 2 I will pull out my spirit upon all flesh hallelujah how does wisdom get started in a person's heart they got to be borned again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if you got the back to the Holy Ghost it'll produce a proverbs 31 Church oh yes sir can everybody see that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is laying right in chapter one if you want wisdom you've got to let the Holy Ghost be poured out upon you amen do you believe that church it's beautiful my the wisdom of God now let's finish with this this is my last thought it is because I only got I think three more slides yeah I got two more slides let's go to chapter eight now this doesn't a prophet along with all the other proof I don't know what does but this is an insight only a prophet could have proverbs 8 chapter 8 contains the origins of wisdom where did wisdom come from or the logos we'd say which remember is just the visible Spirit of God when there was nothing before there was no earth before there was any angels before there was any heaven it was just all nothingness but now that nothingness came forth a little light brother Branham said that was the Spirit of God that was the logos he said that was a pillar of fire whatever you want to call it it was all those synonyms that was the Spirit of God proverbs 822 the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way the speaking of wisdom before his works of old I was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was when there was no depth I was brought forth when there was no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills I was brought forth who is brought forth wisdom while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields or the highest part of the dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth when he established the clouds above when he strengtheneth The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the sea has decreed that the water should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundation of the earth then I was by him listened as one brought up with him I was like a little child right there by Daddy and I was daily his delight rejoicing always before him wisdom is like a little child as the delight of their parent rejoicing before their parent is that striking or what look at verse 31 rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of man let's stand to our feet there's my timer did you catch that wisdom was like this little child standing before God and what does brother BAM say about the logos now the Bible teaches us that the logos went forth I might say all of God becoming his first body form when the logos went out of God let's look what it looked like no one had seen the father at any time nowhere never did never will because God is invisible you never see God but then that little guy that went out of him become like a little halo of light let's see it playing yonder like a child before the door steps of the Father hey man and now I can see him as he moves over here and he draws into his memory or his mind a picture of what the world should be now there's there's not a star or nothing how do brother Graham described the beginning before the creation of the world he describes it as a little light dancing and playing before the Father and the Bible describes wisdom as I was by him one row up with him and I was daily his delight rejoicing always before him amen how many love the Lord Church oh isn't this beautiful don't you delight in the wisdom of God that's justice I'll just thank the Lord for his word thank you Lord thank you Jesus for your word it is so true church this word is so true brother Lord's mind you come to the pulpit I'm so not the pulpit and the piano let's sing how great thou art praise God how great is God how great he had his wisdom there personified as the Holy Spirit just dancing before him and this wisdom was going to create the entire world and now I'm sure she says now can live in you and I we don't have to be defeated we have to wonder what's God's purpose we have to be jealous or envious or discourage or full of guilt we don't have to be any of those things we can be confident in Christ hallelujah I've seen that first [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] when I think that God and when I feel that God is son [Music]

a child playing at his father's feet and you're delighted in that wisdom you looked down and said that's my son look at him and by your grace you've said that wisdom into our hearts by the baptism of the Holy Ghost thank you Jesus hardly more than I can fathom Lord this morning but yet it's true because the Bible sensitive is to be filled with all the wisdom and knowledge and revelation of God

calendar father help me to use all of them with wisdom to apply what I know about you and create a wise life a humble pleasing life that you could allow me to sit on the throne near somewhere near you
