we preach oh god it might be uh let the people pull and be whole and may you speak to your people tonight lord i just pray god you'll bless his service now for your glory anoint this as we read your word in jesus christ's name church let's take the bible here tonight i'd like to uh willing to get back to the history of god's will series we finished um mystery weekly on sunday night really great series there i'm just sure you enjoyed that i appreciate the feedback uh so let's uh have a scripture read i think it would not be nice if we could go to ephesians one let's go back there just to god's will don't worry about remember let's read uh actually let me just read 789 just myself and then we'll read that verse together verse 7 says in whom we have redemption through his blood notice it's not your blood amen remember how gracious salvation through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace that's one thing he's really rich in his grace remember grace and mercy amen chapter 2 says that he's rich in mercy as well rich in mercy rich in grace where he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and all prudence if you need wisdom tonight just ask god amen if you need prudence discretion ask god he loves to give it verse 9 having made no notice already he's already made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself remember we found out his will was holiness praise god and having no blemish praise god in our lives that's his will for our lives let's go to uh matthew 6 30 we'll read our verses 30. [Music] let's read 30 down to 34. that's the holy spirit to write jesus on three one two three wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye have no faith therefore take no thoughts saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father know it that you have thee of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the model for the morrow shall take off for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil [Music] lord willing we'll uh we'll try to just do a quick review of part one i know it's been a couple of weeks the reason i kind of took a break on that was because i i got some good feedback on the iniquity series and i just when i appreciate it i felt a little more annoying i just got to go with the one that i feel the strongest annoying amen by god's grace so uh let's just quickly review i i will honestly try to quickly review it right here so we can be very cautious so remember uh let's look at the mystery of god's will it's stated specifically it's already made known unto us and paul is speaking to holy ghost-filled saints uh of course remember he wrote this letter about 11 years after leaving ephesus as well and so uh he remember he spent three years there and he said i've made known to you the whole council of god's will he already made that known to them and so he was talking to people that already knew god's will how many would agree before you came to god you really didn't know god's will right you didn't know it you felt something in your heart like i know from a child i always wanted to serve god i never could do it but there was that holy thirst in my life i'm sure you felt the same uh but you didn't really know the will of god until you heard the preacher right and then once you hear the preacher then you know god's will it's very sick it's very simple it comes through jesus when he first adam preached he said repent and tell them the kingdom of god is at hand amen so the kingdom of god the will of god is to repent from sins and accept the authority of the holy spirit in your life amen and so it's very simple you know to know god's general will that's made known to us uh it's holiness how many people would really want to know god's will if they when they find out it's holiness how many really want to go deeper in god's will most don't right but but we're ones that want to praise god and paul says that we should be holy and without blame of form and love in ephesians 1 4 we should be remember holy means sacred physically pure and morally blameless so we don't want people to be able to come to our house and say oh look look look at what they're doing in their house they they deserve blame we don't want anybody to come to our work and say well look i can find where they cheated a little bit here they didn't do the right job here we want to be blameless praise god amen and that is the will of god and remember church will means desire choice or pleasure so we say what is god's will we're saying what is god's pleasure what is god like what does god desire he desires holiness amen thank the lord it's requirement for without holiness no man shall see the lord praise god remember the greatest prayer was luke 22 42 not my will but thy will be done the greatest prayer with the greatest temptation with the greatest load of of the weight of a burden of any human could ever experience he he uttered the greatest words not my human will but let the will of god be done praise god that's something we need to learn to pray church in every situation how many learning to pray that amen praise god learning to pray that it's easy to say it like that but you got to say it when we go through the hard trials we got to be afraid god not my will but thy will be done praise god and so we must learn to say that and remember the confusion is can it be no is god's will known or not and am i responsible for it the revelation is god's will is known he initiates reveals it to every person so all men are without excuse and then once he makes it known they're responsible for responding to him and then seeking his future desires praise god romans 1 tells us that he makes himself known in our bodies and in nature and then all men are responsible because all men have a soul thirst praise god amen and every life is a gift amen and then god gives you your soul but then he's going to demand that soul back and say what did you do with that soul what did you do with that nature did you fill with my nature or the world's nature and he's going to demand that soul back i'm so glad to see jesus nature living in me praise god i'm not doing what i want i'm doing what god wants me to do praise god remember we looked at god's sovereign will there's three aspects to it uh his unconditional will we know he'll do whatever he wants he didn't ask you for your opinion and so you don't really care really right he's gonna do what's best he'll do what's best for you but he didn't ask you what you want to happen praise god and then there's the second aspect is god makes his known will to us through the word and then there's a future will that we must seek out and we went through all the scriptures god didn't ask anybody right he declares the beginning from the end he raises up nations he takes them down ah he changes the times and seasons so we can trust anything that happens god already knew it god allowed it and god is with us amen praise god he says i do all things after the counsel of my will what a counselor god's got himself amen how did you have to ask us for the counsel he just he thought about it in his own mind praise god and he got counsel not from a second or third person but from his own mind praise god and he does all things always for our good praise god i know it's hard for my wife and i but this is for god's this is for our good this this little season here with the baby not be in the right position this is working out for our good praise god and so we don't have to wonder church we know god's going to work it out and we finished by by saying that we finish with that then uh we can make our requests known to god and whatever happens we can have peace as long as we express our desire we'll have peace because we know god will do what's best praise god and we know there's the aspects where god says you have not because you ask not now church that deals with unbelief so see you got you and i should be confident if we just ask in prayer we can have confidence that we're not in unbelief we have faith amen we have faith we have a belief that if we ask that we know god can do it but if we don't ask it shows we don't believe we can do it so we know god is pleased when we just ask and say lord if you can do this we would be glorious in my opinion my side i would like you to do this but nevertheless let thy will be done praise god see not asking shows unbelief right but asking shows faith but probably it's even more faith when you can accept that god didn't do you what he you wanted but he did what he wanted and you still love him amen that's real faith amen remember the status clef baby uh they died in germany they wanted to fly brother random over and they said let me go ask father about it remember that everyone and the baby died brother said god said you want to take the baby home and the woman said brother do i not have enough faith the brother said no you have great faith and this proves you have great faith because you still love god even after he takes your baby home that's right so it's great faith church that we want to have and we want to have faith in this hour especially when there's hardly any faith there's hardly any confidence in god there's hardly any revelation of god but we have revelation of god we must act upon that revelation praise god we must stand up on the rock of revelation praise god now the next next aspect is we did the sovereign unconditional will now let's go to god's known will to man now this is known of course uh through the scripture god gives you a thirst and it's your opportunity do you quench that thirst and you just is this a picture of you just drinking in the holy spirit is that a picture of you my children it was so hot this summer they would take the hose sister naomi outside they would take the hose and just go like this ah it took so hot whatever that cares she tried to get me to do it i wouldn't do it i like water but i don't like water that much but is that you spiritually are you just you just have a hose from heaven and you're just letting the holy spirit pour down blessings in your soul or are you stopping that and and enjoying the pleasures of the world oh let's let's receive the fresh water from heaven amen let's be like harrison david let that water pour over pour sweep over my soul holy spirit amen sweet spirits sweep over my soul amen since one or the other either gonna be uh uh filled with the the blessings of god's nature or hush that and do the will of the flesh so we choose the will of the lord amen and then you read the bible praise god and through the bible you find the known will of god now there's two things i'm not going to spend much time on them but church i preached this a few months ago maybe quite a few months ago by now remember it is god's will to do two things to save all men and to fill all men with the holy ghost it is god's will to do that amen you believe that remember that's the scripture second peter 3 9 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is suffering to us we're not willing that any let's all say any ready annie let's say it again annie god is not willing that anybody should perish he said but that all should come to repentance first peter 2 4 who will have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth don't let the devil tell you that god doesn't want to save your loved one don't let him say that god wants to save him amen but you and i need to be open saying god use me to save that praise god use me to share the word or pray for them or or if they get sick i can go pray for them in the hospital somehow lord use me to do it praise god that's biblical proof jesus says it is not the will of their father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish amen it's not god's will god desires them to be saved praise god the bible says hebrew galatians 1 4. while you're going there don't forget hold up there uh don't forget ezekiel 33 11 as so say i unto them as i live saith the lord i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked god doesn't rejoice when wicked people die right but let's pull up galatians 1 4 it is god's will who gave himself for us that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and the father amen if you are bound and chained up god wants you free praise god that is god's will it is the will of god to deliver us from this present world and his change and lust and desires and addictions so we knew god's desires amen it is the will of god that we could do that he wants that he said he who the son is set free is free in need it's it's so easy right for us to see it now right that god wants us free all we have to do is expose the devil and and make and let people know that he's there and we don't want him there and he can we can be free after that praise god it's such an easy uh thing but it's hard for the flesh to want to let go of the lust of the flesh that's why so many people are not delivered you see church it's biblical truth so see as soon as someone hears the good news they know it it's repent get rid of your sins be baptized go with the holy ghost they know follow jesus right love jesus don't love sin love jesus it's already known to them paul says it's known to them in that manner now there's a great scripture here yeah let's go ahead and read it ah it's just so beautiful how can i go ephesians 1 9 let's let's quote up there ephesians 1 9 through 12. some of these things are just so precious i mean i just i know i preached that ephesians series years ago i don't remember much of it now but uh it's so precious let's read this map verse 9 says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure so his will is his good pleasure which he have purpose in himself so what's the purpose of his will and his pleasure himself and who is he the word amen so his will is the word praise god okay next verse 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ what is this speaking of the new jerusalem when is everything all gathered in christ at jerusalem right new jersey you might well you might even say this could be the i wouldn't say that it couldn't be the white throne judgment because then you've got still got people that haven't uh ceased to exist yet so this must be speaking of the new jerusalem both which are in heaven and which are in earth even to him so god's god's god's good will and pleasure is to eventually bring everybody back to christ everybody to look upon christ everybody to worship him praise god everybody to acknowledge that their life came from jesus and jesus sustains their life and jesus gives them eternal life amen because everybody look at one thing christ amen the word amen that's god's mystery of his will it's good pleasure to gather everything in jesus christ verse 11 hallelujah in whom also we have in pain oh i don't have any of this for my parents but i do have some in heaven praise god amen praise the lord that's okay i'm not upset with my parents i'm happy i'm just alive i'm happy i got jesus praise god that's the only real inheritance i need god probably knew if i had a lot of inheritance he'd probably draw me away from the lord right that's what i mean i said god gave uh made him poor because he uh he wouldn't make a future home on this earth his future home would be the new jerusalem let the denominations have their future homes let them have all that but we want heaven to be our future home great god inheritance being predestinated predetermined according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his will everything is all ordained for god's purpose it's all bringing everybody to a head it's all bringing them to the new jerusalem praise god the believers now praise god who have an inheritance i remember that song i've got a father over yonder i've got a home over yonder praise god church we've got an inheritance amen that the devil can't touch hallelujah amen we've got just houses and lands and a mansion but all outside of that we've got christ amen the greatest inheritance is the love of god hallelujah being in jesus's presence oh my the counsel of his own will look how wise and his great counsel that he has verse 12 we'll just stop right here with this one that we should be to the praise of his glory see we're to praise him we're to glorify him that's why he saves all of us all these things he's so merciful right he's so loving and he's so good and so gracious that we'll praise him who first trusted in christ are you trusting him tonight amen let's trust in his blood amen let's trust in his plan that it's all going to work out because it's for god's glory praise god he's going to do great things hallelujah so the second thing is he wants all men to be born again now pull up deuteronomy 6 23 if you could this gives god great pleasure when men are and women are born again remember god did it as the type god didn't bring israel to leave him in the wilderness he brought us out from that that he might bring us in praise god what was the plan of god to take them out of egypt but take them through the wilderness and put them in to the promised land to give us the land which he swear by our fathers our inheritance amen praise god so see it's incomplete jesus brought you out uh but he doesn't want you to stop there he wants us to go possess the land and reign over all the enemies in laodicea he says you're a new creature when you're in christ right joshua them were real were new creatures once they got in the promised land they were mighty conquerors right they were possessors of land praise god oh it's a great picture isn't it and jesus commands all to be born again you must be born again in john 3 7. if they didn't reach canaan they fell short of god's will and jesus cried out he said if any man thirst let then come unto me and drink this fakie of the spirit for the holy ghost was not yet given oh no it's a universal invitation from revelation 22 17 the spirit of the bride say come and let him not hear say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely oh he doesn't keep anybody out he wants them all to come in praise god oh it's god's will that whosoever will you're probably remembering some of these right all you need church to know god's will and do it is love jesus said all the laws are fulfilled in one word love praise god he says loving god with all your heart and all your soul mind and strength loving your neighbor fulfills every command three times paul says love fulfills the law it's in romans 13 8 13 10 and galatians 5 14 he said love will take care of everything oh my if we just love everybody here we just love all of our neighbors we just love our enemies we have to worry about all the details love will take care of it all praise god caring about people more than ourselves will take care of everything praise god oh it takes all the pressure off doesn't the church just loving god loving people it makes you fulfill it makes you keep all of god's commands go to first john 5 1. in case you pull it up there i don't well one point a couple years ago i wanted to preach a whole series just on the book of first john i probably will if the lord it's such a beautiful book verse one whosoever believeth that jesus the christ is born of god and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that has begotten of him see you can't say you you love say can't say you have the holy ghost and not love somebody who has the holy ghost see by this we know that we love i'm sorry that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commands first john 5 probably verse 3 by now for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so when a person is born of god but born again they got the love of god the faith causes them to work right and because love is motivating it it's not a hard thing to do right when i was when i was uh recording my wife if i i didn't i didn't mind driving three hours every every weekend i didn't mind leaving so i i'd probably stayed to what like probably until like 10 o'clock on a sunday night 10 11 12 1. i'm going to get back to my dorm until 1am i never had any trouble staying up because i was dreaming about my wife or my future wife all the way on the roads in my honda it wasn't a grievous thing and i remember many of those times i get up early go to class at 7 45 the next morning or football practice see love love is such a motivator praise god and it's not grievous to keep the commands not grievous because love makes it easy love operates faith and faith works hallelujah oh my such a plain thing to see how people can miss it i don't see how they just don't want to see it you're seeking salvation church or if you're seeking the holy ghost undoubtedly it's god's will for you to do that undoubtedly there's nothing in the scripture that would ever say different now next let's go to god's known will through the bible is your spiritual food praise god uh if you would uh let get your book john 4 34 please john 4 34. so see that god has a sovereign will and then god makes his will known to you in the word but you and i have to keep feeding on the word because jesus said to them my me is to do the will of him that set me and to finish his work so we have the known will right i mean how do you believe we have the known will of god but you and i can't remember everything in here we forget sometimes to do the things we're supposed to do so we got a daily feed on it and not just feed on it but then go do something about it praise god and jesus said that is my meat when i get up in the morning and i'm hungry my meat is to do god's will amen amen see in other words it's a spiritual diet to do the will of god you've got to die your diet has to be the word of god and then you really read the word we hear the word we hear it preach and then we got to go act upon it i remember our facebook post a few years ago i don't know if case remembers this on a wednesday night i preached on the morning routine and getting up early and seeking god and in case you the next morning i put on facebook uh she said daddy i'm getting up early i'm going to read my bible first remember that i put on facebook i said that is doing the will of god right there hearing it on wednesday night and doing it thursday morning amen that's god's will that's when you know god's word is your meat because you act upon it you do it praise god that's right i and to finish his work i like that finished oh he got something to do amen we're at the very end of god finishing the word praise god we're at the very end otherwise we're the last harvesters amen we're the last ones that are out here we get to be the last ones to finish it up and say there's nothing left it's time to go enjoy the harvest amen amen oh the last one's the finish god's work in the gentile dispensation now in the book i just go through these obvious these are all called the will of god sanctification is the will of god we're not going to read all these because you know keeping your body sexually pure so from fornication homosexuality or adultery finding a home church listening to male preachers only living preachers only and increasing your attendance to church more that's the will of god right that's what hebrews 10 says giving your tithes and offerings that's the will of god abstaining from substance abuse like tobacco alcohol marijuana uh keeping wicked lustful movies and shows away from your eyes being adorned in modest clothing the correct hair length for familiarity water batches of feet washing communion continual prayers giving thanks church if you haven't thank god all week then not tonight tonight to do it praise god that's the will of god instead in everything give thanks this is the will of god in christ jesus amen i like when the atmosphere changes amen i might be tired before the service but when we get in service it's time to do the will of god amen it's god's will to praise him and to pray and pass and give homes to the poor and work it's god's will to work support your family that's god's will obey the government unless they contradict god's commands and worship in spirit and truth that's god's will so this is where people backside they'll come to church and they don't worship in the holy spirit they're already disobeying god's will they're backsliding and then we see it later and you know they stopped paying ties and they stopped coming to church and they go off in some tangent or sin or something like that see it's god's will they instantly have broken the will of god they're disobeying god's will but if you love god these things are easy amen i don't know because it's all about love amen praise god those are just what are those three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven so those are thirteen simple clear-cut will of god now how many people keep those in the churches very few let's be the some of those few let's be the little flock jesus is going to give the kingdom to amen praise god you can clearly know right away i'm out of god's will if i'm doing this if i'm treating my body like that if i'm doing this if i'm not seeking more of god if i'm not worshiping the right way that's why worship is so important praise god with brother amen and malachi with it it's so important that we enjoy that and and do it in truth praise god because if not we've broken god's will and that something's going to happen unless we repent remember all this was prophesied to come elijah restore all things jesus remains in heaven to the restitution of all things elijah would come before the great and dreadful day lord turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers and god orchestrated all these mysteries to be finished in his lifetime so he could lead you to the revealed word for this day i bought a dictionary of the pentecostal dictionary i've been reading through that and it's awesome to see uh the world world war ii killed the revival of christianity and so after world war ii ended in 1945 what happened in 1946 god called william branham to a worldwide campaign healing ministry and the book says it the book says he got off on his doctrine you know the surface scene was wrong and all these things but everybody acknowledges william branham started the post world war ii revival and it said it's reached or today its effects still touch every denomination in every church in usa it says main street usa so brother brother went first billy graham didn't get popular until 49. i'm sorry oral roberts was 47. so brother ram46 or robertson but rams called the the first the greatest giant of that age he's called a giant in that book yet he was a man five six right i missed him but he was he was a giant in christ he had the floor of god and he had the sword of the king that he lived by praise god he lived by that sword that's what we needed to live by the sword of god's word he was small stature but a giant of faith hallelujah amen so he goes first brother amen there's an article that says in that dictionary in 1950 a thousand preachers gathered i forget where the city a thousand preachers gathered in 1950 and the whole event was to honor brother branham for brother brahm inspired a thousand preachers that was in 1950 and that was right after the pillar of fire picture can you imagine a thousand people gathering to honor you maybe it's your funeral but in your lifetime he's been on the field four years church he imagined preaching four years and a thousand people come now not the worst but just to say thank you for showing us that divine healing is possible i don't know yet praise god oh my this is all done to show the last signs of the gentile church with thus saying the lord amen to restore the hearts of the tutor back to the pentecostal fathers oh i'm so glad i can see it i never would have caught it by reading the dictionary i needed god to send my brother simon to make me listen to that sermon praise god oh thank you lord praise god billy graham got popular in 1949 look it up he started a sixth a sixth night revival in new york city and it went nine weeks he preached for nine weeks straight every night i've only done i think three is the most i've ever preached three days in a row of course he don't preach as hard we do we're sweating and screaming and shouting and spitting everywhere i can't hear my voice anymore different kind of preaching he's just trying to get them to the holy arabic to the salvation we're trying to get to the holy ghost it's a whole different thing we're trying to get him all the way to caden he's just trying to get him out of egypt but that skyrocketed him in the national eye history says now what's interesting too they had that meeting by the amen in 1915 to honor him in 1951 god healed that congressman upshur i thought was so awesome god gave him a vindication right from the white house well around the white house he wasn't the president but no man around the the capital could say oh god doesn't heal god raised up a man in a wheelchair amen amen through this prophet hallelujah amen and then they say well in the 60s he started forcing everybody to get out of that trinitarian baptism and uh said there was a sir see the serpent and they they misinterpreted the dictionary oh if only they look in this dictionary praise god right and it is scriptural it is the bible truth amen they think he went down yeah he went down in popularity but he came up and trained as a giant in faith amen hallelujah well i've just been so encouraged by reading the history the more you read the more you realize we got the truth saints we are in the truth of god's word amen there's no doubt about it and then you see billy graham and his wife they're all painted face like jezebel someone got skirts on some got pants up they're nice people somebody married some one of his daughters been married three or four times is on i think the fourth marriage trying to preach and write books now see they're fine people nice people nice people but that's not a life that's dedicated to all the will of god because the known will of god tells you the known will of god tells you not to do those things praise god ah thank the lord but see what is the church they fail many of these fail in first peter 4 2 they are not established in the present truth that's i like jason demar's ministry name present truth ministries we must be established in the present truth it's the church is not the truth ever changed but the amount of truth available changed do you remember the church but ransom the key started of the bible is that god never changes nor do his ways but by the way i'm saying but do you remember god never said the church wouldn't change i don't remember that but i said god will never change he said what the church will see each age they lost a little bit of god's word till the fourth age you just had little groups you know on the outward parts of europe that were hiding out in monasteries or having holy ghost revivals and little churches way far away from rome and italy uh until god raised up a martin luther god rose up martin luther right out of the catholic system and condemned them everything it was amen amen if he called somebody right out of the midst of that and he didn't have all the truth but he had enough to start a reformation praise god oh man and so there wasn't as much revelation until god gave more with wesley and then god gave more to zeus the street and then god gave the full council with his prophet that's right church the present truth did you have it up there uh if you could please first peter 4 2 for valentine that he should no longer live the rest of his time in the wilderness one hold on the rest of time is flush to the lust tonight but to the will of god okay well anyways that's a scripture where we must live oh yeah i'm way ahead of myself second peter 1 12 but just yeah go to second peter 1 12 but note there church you lived according to the will of the flesh before but now as a christian we have to live god's pleasure we have to live god's desire but what does god desire of me at this point in my life that's what we got to know we got to know that look at this one wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth he was saying there's a truth that's present that they had to receive in that day and so it is in every day you have to receive the truth that's available in that day praise god now no longer live the flesh but to the will of god now we need a hungry heart like dave you know what david said david had the word but you know what david said in psalms 143 10 he said teach me to do thy will that's what we need that's what i need i need i need to have a humble heart and say god teach me to do your will because there's times i don't do your pleasure i do my pleasure instead of your pleasure but david said teach me to do thy will for thou art my god in other words don't let me be god you'll be let let me acknowledge you're my god that means i worship the god of this world satan let me worship you because you're the one who made this world amen but i gotta be taught how many are you learning tonight amen are we learning tonight or tonight at night off if you don't learn anything is it night off i don't think so i think tonight's a good night we can learn see teach me here's a man that slew giants within he defeated kingdoms constantly i'm reading through i'm at the end of the first saturday right up you slew everybody fight and destroy take back ziklag and just defeat everybody everybody fell but he's praying god teach me to do your will that's a humble that's a man after god's own heart not my god thy spirit is good lead me into land it's a land it's a promised land it's a spiritual land amen when we obey god and do his will it's a land it's a new uh it's a new experience i'll say like that it's a new life oh thank you jesus remember ephesians 5 17 be not unwise but understand what the will of god is now that's a good prayer church teach me to do your will and help me to understand your will oh god give us humble hearts like that we come to church and say god teach me and also help me understand it help me to understand why would you want me to do this why would i choose this or why would i sacrifice this and do this lord teach me and also help me to understand your will understanding what the will of the lord is james 1 5 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask god that give it to all men liberally and upbringeth not and it shall be given to them i was wondering for years but amen why do we have such a small church then god sent brother ray what i just had to ask right just had to ask and say lord what what is why is your what's your will about this why why how come it's so hard or how come it's there's things i thought would happen that haven't happened and god is faithful if you ask and wait upon the lord god will answer your prayer amen hallelujah patience is the key attribute hebrews 10 35-38 said cast not away therefore your confidence amen let's be confident in god which has great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you've done the will of god you might receive the promise amen amen for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not care not terry when's the rapture going gonna come for just a little while so the word says yes right that's what the word says a little while and he'll come now the just shall live by faith amen but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him see he has pleasure and those who wait for him and those who can be patient praise god and know that he's coming in a little while praise god amen let me close with a few more thoughts now in the book i show how the statue of perfect man connects to the known will of god god shows you the steps to become like christ it's known it's not a mystery how you get the holy ghost it's known each attribute each anointing is known right just like israel could know all the way from egypt they could know all the towns they could know all the deserts they passed through until they got to the promised land you can know it and paul said god has already made known unto us the mystery of his will oh hallelujah thank the lord all right i got a little bit of time left here let me see yeah let me just try to get through this section here so there's two principles that govern god's progressive will for man okay there's two things that uh govern it okay because after you're saved after you got the holy ghost because i said how many got the holy ghost most hands would go up right but after you get the holy ghost you still wonder what does god want me to do so there's two things that uh have to be made known after that all right his future plans are called the progressive will of god we would call it that the plans are already known to god but they're unknown to you and i he reveals his future desires as you seek his guidance traveling on this earthly pilgrimage so here's the two principles that will govern god's future will the first one is that his will will align perfectly with his known will in the bible praise god so anything god asks you to do if it's his perfect progressive will it'll line up exactly with the word of god and second it will happen in his ordained time in season hallelujah put up hebrews 11 8 uh if you could occasionally please abraham is the example abraham was constantly seeking the progressive will of god god said god called to abraham and the bible said he was called into a place which he should have to receive for an inheritance he obeyed and he went there not knowing where he went so abraham just acted on the word of god praise god a lot of us maybe don't know where our life is going right we might not know exactly where we're going give me five minutes here that's 40 minutes already a lot of us don't know what the future holds right a lot of us don't know like what's going to happen with our families what's going to happen with our jobs there's a lot of uncertainty right what's going to happen with the church or god going to send me to another church like a lot of us don't know there's uncertainty but we have to go by what god has made known to us and act upon it just like abraham we've got to obey what god has already made known to us and abraham was content the bible said each day he just waited for the next voice from god he just kept waiting he's the father of what faith see faith will grab ahold and obey what you know i know god wants me to do this i'll do it i'll act upon it i don't know everything but i'll act upon what god told me to do i'll obey and i'll walk by faith by sight praise god that's what we need today people that walk by faith and not by sight praise god he was content he was waiting for the next revelation see he went from city to city we go from faith to faith we go from glory to glory amen now we might go city of the city sometimes right but he went from city to city and he was going fake the faith so we do the same thing now here's some good examples god's will will always agree with his written word like when satan tempted christ and he tried to take him immediately rule over the nations don't wait take it now see the same the same impatience we talked about don't wait jesus take rule now you just got to bow down and worship me see but jesus triumph right he didn't have to do america he just obeyed the known will of god amen known will of god said never worship anybody but god well that's that should be pretty easy right so jesus kept that first principle it always will align with god's perfect will his progressive will made known it will always line up with the written word of god seems pretty easy how many would say amen seems pretty easy david tried to bring the ark back right but failed because he disobeyed one word it couldn't be on a cart it had to be on the shoulder brother ram said i heard him say it this week he said it was right above the left shoulder right above the heart the words got to be carried above the heart of a living man right you i'm sorry uza died god smote him three months later david fully obeys and he worships god the same way but this time they get blessings from it everybody gets blessings because david lined up everything with the known will of god amen praise god daniel 9 verses 1 and 2. daniel saying god show me your progressive will for israel how long is israel going to be out of the promised land how did he know he read the bible said in verse 2 he knew that the 70-year exile was about to come up because he read jeremiah's books amen he just put his he just put his eyes on this book and this book revealed god's future plans for israel he just had to keep reading church let's keep reading praise god there's so much there's so much bible we haven't really studied over right how many old testament texts are there where we haven't read over them but some of them may unlock blessings for us praise god some of them may reveal god's future will for our lives praise god like that one brother samuel brown has shared with me in genesis 12 the bible said abraham god said i'm going to bless you and you're going to be a blessing to others and the revelation from that samuel told me he said wherever your home church is he said you'll be a blessing to other people and people will bless you i know that's beautiful that's a beautiful revelation brother may have never said that but it's in the bible praise god and you can see how that's a revelation that opened up further well i see my i see people being blessed by me and i'm being blessed by other people praise god just like abraham whoever blesses you will be blessed see the known will of god who will always the progressive will of god what he's going to have you to do will always line up with the previous known will of god remember i mentioned hananiah and jeremiah on sunday and i said two years jeremiah said us uh 70 years and the reason he knew jeremiah knew that because elijah had already i'm sorry ezekiel had already said all those years i'm sorry there's my time all right let me close in other words church no matter how strong you feel about a decision we must first see if it lines up with god's will and the example i use lord willing in the book like a woman cutting her hair well i'll give my hair to a cancer patient that breaks the known will of god and so i put the book lay hands on the person with cancer right don't break the word obey the word anoint the person with oil pray for them maybe god will do a great miracle praise god but it doesn't do us any good to break the known will of god when we're trying to find the progressive will of god in other words the future will of god it does it's no good to break the word of god i've seen it in many cases i can't remember that i can't remember the exact examples but i've seen women with long hair cut their hair and they become an awful uh aggressive arrogant person domineering dominate that's the word i've i can't remember i was going to think of some examples but i've seen them have long hair cut their hair and it's like they're like the big boss now because they cut their hair you can see the effects of it church because it breaks the known will of god god has a desire it's the best design let's stay with god's design amen very simple a man that's tempted to commit adultery or a man that's not married uh to commit fornication you know that's not the will that's not that goes against the known will of god god's not gonna lead you to that uh deuteronomy 13. keep it up here real [Music] quick a good one deuteronomy 13 1-3 if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth me a sign or a wonder and the sign or the wonder come to pass wherefore he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the lord your god prove with you to know whether you will love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul praise god see church do not follow anything that's outside the word no matter what sign or wonder because it's a test of your love for god god's testing us some people have miracles and their churches they got a better church in us or maybe that maybe there's something about that we'll just sit around and watch and see where they're pointing brother says right you saw the silence remember he said always listen for the voice of the sign after you see a sign what is it going to say afterwards like i'll give you example jeffersonville they had actually a man rise from the dead in their church a few years ago but what has the voice said afterwards they said the wrong thing it's not saying the right thing this week i've debated somebody who goes to that church uh i haven't heard back from the pastor either but he he he was saying every word is not saved the lord he said billy paul is joseph that was thus saith the lord and then it was changed to joseph like thus say the lord can change it can't he said i should have had thus saith the lord uh the white horse rider was the holy spirit but man said and then not three years later he said it's the uh the antichrist i said how can that be thus saith the lord he said there both us save the lord he said that's getting close to blasphemy right there but look what i'm saying church no matter if they have someone rise from the dead i mean they have miracles no doubt uh you know clapping and worshiping you get the anointing right but watch the voice that follows the sign praise god and look at this example they tell you to go do something you know is outside the word of god and god said i'm testing you i want to see if you love the word more than you love a movement praise god do you love the word more than you love popularity you have the word more than you love money you know the word more than anything let's love god's word amen verse four sorry yes first let me finish verse three to know whether you love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul for ye shall walk after the lord your god and fear him and keep his commands and obey his voice and he shall serve him and cleave unto him and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams which will be shall be put to death because he has spoken to you to turn o you away from the lord your god anything that takes away your worship from jesus christ is turning you away from true worship which brought you out of the land of egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage to thrust thee out of the way which the lord thy god commanded thee to walk so shalt thou put that evil out of the midst of thee look at verse 6 and thy brother [Music] the bible says in verse 8 do not conceal him but surely he put him to death verse 10 says because he has sought to thrust thee away from the lord thy god so god says whether they have a sign or wonder whether they just nobody secretly know let's go up and drive this he said get that person away from you flee from the devil right resist the devil he'll flee from you and cleave unto god let's stand to our feet praise musicians if you like to come praise the lord hey what a blessing to know the will of god god's desires god's pleasure are we doing god's desires are we doing god's pleasures let's bow our heads as we meditate upon the lord jesus's meat every day his meat was to do the will of him that sent him heavenly father lord we love you today [Music] and lord we know you're proving each heart whether the heart will love you back your love is proven your love is faithful your love is sure o god your love is eternal god your love is strong lord you've got to prove the love of men father we're here tonight proving our love to you lord for a moment lord we just examine our hearts are we doing lord the known will of god are we doing your pleasure are we doing your desire in our life [Music] if there's something we're doing that's not pleasing to you forgive us lord god david truly repent of each one of us [Music] for your wills to be holy [Music] you've been so good to let us know your will you've made it known to us we have a bible oh god we're here preaching constantly we're blessed because of it we're thankful for it but help us to do it for god help us to obey what you've made known to us and keep seeking for the next understanding the next revelation [Music] scripture said don't cast away our confidence more confident we'll be patient after we've done the will of god we'll inherit the promise you'll come in a little while dear god that's the way the voice of the word [Music] i'm glad to be a holy ghost built satan lord god to be born again of the kingdom of god hallelujah let us worship in the spirit of truth in jesus christ [Music] is my desired [Music] oh
