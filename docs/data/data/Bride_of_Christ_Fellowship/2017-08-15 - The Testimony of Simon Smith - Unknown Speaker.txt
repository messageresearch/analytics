========================================

Green's my name is Smith how is the oldest of six children born to Snooki and Ruby Smith when I was born my mother and my father they were Catholic by tradition or however and they took me as a baby and they sprinkled me as a Catholic baby so I was already initiated into religion early on as a child then my mom shortly after that she left that's the Catholic Church and moved to a Pentecostals Assembly God Church and that's where I remained the remainder of my life in Defiance Ohio somebody's God and then we moved from there to Delta Ohio Assemblies of God but when I was five years old my mother had always been teaching us about Jesus being faithful she took all six children to to church faithfully every Sunday every every Wednesday even before we go to school she made sure we didn't we didn't go to school unless we prayed and then we didn't go to bed until we prayed so our life growing up was centered around prayer and I remember early on if five years old probably my mom was driving me uptown in Holgate Ohio to a gas station or to a supermarket or whoever and we were talking about the Lord she was telling about Jesus and I said mom I want to give my heart to Jesus Christ so she pulled over the car right and one of the county roads there and we sat on the side of the road and she led me to the Lord my hand was in her mama hand there and she led me to the Lord and I was so joyous and I was excited that day I was five years old and I just later on that week I went to spend the night at one of my friends named Danny Noah one of my good buddies back then and I was so excited about Jesus actually was able to lead him to the Lord through a prayer and leading him like a little to a sinner's prayer and I was able to lead him to the Lord that was exciting for me as a little little child so but after that you know we get it uh my mother and father had marital problems back in 1982 my dad actually was praying in the closet and he met God and it changed his life and then after directly after that he started God starting dealing with his life revealing mysteries to him that are hidden in the scripture and he would set all four of us boys me cam Sam and Jesse down at four chairs and he'd preach to us for an hour hour and a half at a time and one thing that was revealed to him was the parable of the wheat and tares and he would tell us he said boys he says so-and-so was a tare someone supposed to tear and this is false and that's false and we're just sitting as young children just absorbing these things not knowing what he's even talking about and so he didn't believe in going to church and my mother did and we went religiously every Sunday and Wednesday and my dad would watch these televangelist in the 80s and one by one he would tell us Simon whoever Jesse Paul's him or salmon cam he said that minister is going to fall because he's off the word this Minister is going to follow he's Antichrist and this one's lifting himself up he'll fall and we're little children being fed this to us and one by one we're watching these things as children and boom this televangelist would fall this one would fall from grace that one was caught in this and they'd fall and were and as a little child I'm absorbing these things and how did my dad know these things I know he met God back then how did he know these things and he didn't even go to church and hear the pastor preacher nothing and yet God showed him this one's fallen that one's fallen that what's wrong so we grew up and I grew up in a really confusion confused situation we did it religiously my momma went to church my dad didn't believe it so we have conflict there and then I see where my dad's right and my mom's wrong and yet I see where my mom's right my dad's wrong so it's very very confusing so then we end up moving to Delta Ohio to go to church in Delta something's a god and we moved to Liberty Center where I spent the remainder of my years in high school so growing up in this situation my parents sent him getting divorced when I was a sophomore in high school really ripped ripped our hearts apart pretty well I find myself not knowing which who to go to and the weekends we go with mom do I go with dad who would I stay with you know so it was really a tough time for me but I knew God was real my grandpa's old-school Pentecostal Mexican man and he would tell us constantly on how God raised his own wife from the dead just a year just being a year Christian and his my grandma had died giving birth to my my youngest uncle and he went and prayed by the prayer of faith over my grandmother in the wind in the morgue and God raised her up supernaturally then growing up we're still just in Delta my mother came down with cancer she they were given only a couple months to live and we being young children we thought we were going to have a mama and my dad wanting one night and snuck in he told me and laid his hand on my mom's hand on my mom's head and he said he started praying the prayer of faith and his hand got red-hot warm he said and then the very next day was the surgery the surgeons the doctors went in and they could not find the tumors the size of a softball I believe a grapefruit one of those too and so growing up I hear these testimonies from my grandpa and seeing it on my own life from my mother and and because of these I had a grandma garza raised up and because that also I had a mother that was able to raise these recipes six children up and feel very blessed I knew God was real and so he raised up that had a respect for my grandparents from my pastor at the time his family and just what God was doing for us of course we weren't born again we lived a little bit like the world my mother was really strict so then as it came to as I came to age at age 18 it was time for me to go to college I decide to go to college and I said man I better get baptized to keep me through these colleges ages and I remember going down and I sold a pastor I said pastor Trowbridge I said I need to get baptized I'm going to college you know I don't wanna get involved he baptized me in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost so I went up to college and I became an absolute heathen lived like the devil partied Geraint got drunk constantly run around with women girlfriends here and there or whatever just filthy and I get given up on God mostly due to confusion in religion I see in the household and I didn't know what else to do so I just was now the temptations are coming and I just went a full head hedonism so but at the end of four and a half years in college the Lord allowed me to destroy my life I lost a girlfriend college funds had run out and now I come back to my mother's house a college dropout and in a deep depression for six months I didn't know what to do so I gave up I said Lord I said I had to go back I went back to my mother's Church and I gave up I repented and I realized that I cannot I can't even live my own life so I had to move on I started praying for a job God gave me a job my brother cam had already gotten saved was at the church and we started raising up as youth in the u.s. ministry there and they saw us as leaders because we're older and we were on fire for God witnessing to everyone we could tell and we were excited for what God I all the burden all the pain had left my my spirit realm I feel so good I was so glad to be a Christian and then as we grow as I'm raising up in the youth group I see sin in the church and I went up to my old pastor I said pastor preach against sin he said I said if they had a problem with you you tell him to come see me I was real bold you know but he would never preach against sin like I thought because I saw in the youth group and then I started seeing things as I read the Bible now a new Christian uh things contrary to the Word of God like speaking in tongues of the EMAs of the Holy Ghost so when I seen that doctrine coming I'd watched the people's lives as spoke with tongues because if they had spoke with tongues they had the Holy Ghost so I'd watch their lives and I could live a cleaner life without speaking in tongues without the Holy Ghost than they could with him so now I'm getting confused I didn't know what to do mean for the cam is Elias every extra service from any denomination we would go to it on a Friday night Saturday night just looking for more truth whether we knew it or not so we go there and hear this church and that church and that church even though being faithful to our are one thing about my old Pentecostal church they loved you they express love real genuine love and I respect them for that I love them for that and then so I didn't know what to do and then the thing came started ringing in my ear was my dad always told me he said Simon if you want to meet God he said go pray in your closet so I took that serious one time was the end of I got saved the spring of 2000 and by the end near the end of 2001 I started going in my closet every night and I said one simple prayer and I prayer was this I said Lord if this is not the truth talking about the Pentecostal rankings some ways a God if this is not the truth send me the truth I don't care how crazy it is I'll believe it and I said a one-sentence prayer for three and a half months in my closet now to back this up brother Brooks Isaiah Brooks my first pastor and the message I love the man dearly I just got off the phone with him recently he said that at that time I was praying in the mud in those closet for three half months three months prior to that he started fasting and praying and he had serviced almost every day for six months praying for a revival I didn't know it was that intense but he said he had and he was the only one preaching his over services every day he had service every day he said praying and fasting the church would as a body would fast praying for a revival so then at this the end of 2001 there I've been praying these things and at the end of the three and a half mark 911 hit where the towers fell and two weeks before that I was actually in New York looking directly up at those towers are underneath was looking up so it was a sign throat for me from God so I was praying for truth and then another brother named brother Craig he was working at Sauter's I had previously worked disorders and my best friend was still working as auditors so a 9/11 hit all this all the denominational seed or however the people at Sauter's started coming to brother Craig said at the end of the world is this the end of the world was this the end of the world but the correct we are he said we are at the end so from my understanding he went to brother Isaiah and said brother would you let me do but the book said start a service in your house so they started printing out flyers and getting all these copied out flyers to start a service on a Saturday and I just talked to my best friend and borrowed his truck for a week and he let me borrow it and he was going back to solder and as a brother Craig and brother Dave Llewellyn called Big Dave Llewellyn there they had these flyers now they're passing them out at Sauter's they see my best friend juan garcia and i love that man to this day juan garcia he's a he's a real sweet gentleman and brother dave Llewelyn specifically took one of flyers and he had just heard that I got saved Dave Lewallen told my buddy Juan said Juan make sure you give this the Simon so the flyer was passed from brother Dave Llewellyn to my buddy juan garcia jr. and add lights returned his truck at the end of that week Juan gave me that flyer he said hey Simon he said hey it was I've done her clapping hands and I said what's up man and he said hey go to the service he says I'll meet you there and I'm like okay I took the fire I was looking at okay and I was just have been praying for truth for three and a half months in my closet every night and I said okay I'll meet you there buddy and we hugged and shook hands over and that Saturday night I showed up and a little house church on you could live Euclid Avenue on Defiance Ohio and I sat down I had my little third day hat on beanie and I pull in there and I had my Bible and I sat down and it's strange it's in a house there's chairs and there's a pulpit up there and I sat down for my first message sermon being preached there and Brooks I believe preached and then brother Craig I went back Saturday after Saturday after Saturday and brother Craig and brother Brooks would alternating one would preach here the other one appreciate I'm hearing things I've never heard before and I'm saying wow what is this so one night after a couple maybe a month or so of these services on Saturday I pulled brother Craig and Big Dave aside I said I said I got to ask you as a question they said yeah yeah by the sign when I said I said where are you getting this because I sat in the church from a baby if it were raised up my entire youth in a church and these things they're teaching in one month I understood and heard things I never heard before beyond what I've been previously taught and they're teaching it straight from the Bible so they said you really want to know I said absolutely they said come follow me they went into their bedroom they took me into the bedroom and we did like a three or four hour Bible study all the way to 2:00 p.m. 2:00 a.m. in the morning and I'm sitting there with my all the scriptures and revelations running through my brain I don't thinking whoa this is it and then I step coming faithful hungry I hear the word I'm hungry I'm hungry I'm hungry for more of the word and brother Craig would be faithful he was the one that pretty much set the good gospel foundation in the word for me it was probably a year and a half later I actually received the Batson's of the Holy Ghost after when the services brother Brooks had preached and that was one of my greatest experiences is receiving the baptism the Holy Ghost where God Himself comes down and comes in so as I'm receiving this word it comes now down to Thanksgiving it was two months after 9/11 hit and I started hitting my entire family up and one of the first people the two people that got actually pressed of my heart to witness to is my brother Jesse Smith he's a faithful pastor now in Akron and he almost received it immediately he's seen it right away and then I felt led to hit my dad up because when I was taught original sin urban seed as soon as that served that Bible study was being taught my mind went back to what my dad was preaching us 15 years earlier the wheat and tares that man's a tear that man's a tear and I think my dad was right so I knew God had contacted my dad revealed to him wheat and tares appreciate to his baby boys there and then now I'm hearing it through the Word of God from Genesis all the way to revelations and I said absolutely I knew that was right I went got baptized in England sheezus Christ and then the kind of from my area the stir started taking place brother Jesse became a witnessing machine he he brought in Tim Myers and Scott Overmeyer and brought him right in and he was witnessing to all the Liberty Center boys this and that but I did find resistance within my own family my mother and brother cam they fought me tooth and nail for an entire year one time I was working with brother cam we worked at the same location and we tried to work together back and forth and we're riding back home and he had me drive and as I was driving I looked over and I never seen this before there was a rainbow in one cloud and as I'm as I'm driving I go man cameras you ever see that before and he looks over like this because man I never seen it before and I'm watching this as I'm driving and that rainbow jumped from cloud to cloud to cloud for 20 miles west and I go cam are you seeing this and he's just like whoa we took a left south on 109 headed to her house and that cloud that rainbow jumped from cloud to cloud so in this the Lord is dealing with my my brother cam now he's seeing something supernatural take place while I'm driving as soon as we get home that that rainbow was too I ran up upstairs to my room I looked out the window and that rainbow was right in the cloud right outside my window and I said praise be to God I knew that was the promise that God had you know the rainbow represents a covenant God made a promise with me a confident amen so we're the cameras seeing these things and so Liam brother Jesse went on we started witnessing to every single person we could there was quite a stir we tried to pull as many from any church any soul lost or whatever we could do we went out with zeal witnessing the entire group was witnessing machines by God's grace at that time at that time that the the Saturday night study had moved from defiance to Florida Ohio on the corner of Church and Vine so much do I I walked many of the streets in defiance I walked almost the entire town of Holgate passing out flyers I walked almost the entire town of Florida Ohio passing out flyers I walked parts of Toledo Ohio passing out flyers so we went out with zeal tried to hit as many as we could and then after one year the message fighting my own back my own pastor now brother cam where the cam was Lord was dealing with him at the same time he left the old church because of he caught one revelation we brought in it that a woman shouldn't preach it and brother cam he felt solid on that doctrine because he goes if you could see it that's what God allowed him to see so he was faithful on that so one night he showed up in Florida Ohio at our one of our Saturday services and I had already brought a towel and sandals and everything for some reason I just packed that night cam shows up was dropped off because the other guys didn't want to come was dropped off there and he listened to the service after service he's like sigh can you drive me home and I was like yeah absolutely so we're driving home and cameras for the cam was like so the revelation or understanding that the Father Son Holy Ghost the name is Jesus Christ right that's it yeah that's right and then he we it was silence for about a couple minutes and I do say so sigh the the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ I said absolutely brother you know and I'm I was on guard because I you fight you know and you're ready for a battle at any time you won't have your sword ready and I was expecting it and then the great was like a third time he said Simon he says the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is is the way to be baptized in the following ghost I said absolutely that is the interpretation of that scripture and he turned to me and maybe him even outside us at Simon a Warren get baptized I go what he goes yes I go really you're not joking right he goes no no so I said praise the Lord I said listen let's get you baptized so we were almost pretty much home he said let me go get some stuff and whatever so we went inside and said p.m. I already had towels I had a shower shoes I had everything you know he's like what so I called brother Brooks Brooks was an hour down or hour away already down in Lima I said brother Brooks cameras get baptized he's like what but so he drove all the way back up for Lima to baptize for the cam that would we call in Florida Ohio our little book of Acts baptism location where you walk down by the canal there's a little waterfall and that waterfall falls into like a pool of a nice pool water and that's where baptized a majority of our Saints by the grace of God right there at the old looking back book of Acts baptisms location so for the cam now has entered and joined into the fold I have my own brother I got two brothers now for the Jesse for the cam I feel invincible so so now brother cam you want was zeal hard after all the youth group that he told was I was a call to me brother Jesse was back slidden deceivers now we went back to the youth group trying to witness to them and they and they didn't want to receive it now but then he went with zeal and in one night he went ended one he said for scripture Bible study with my sister Betsy Dustin Sammy who they got married my brother-in-law now is Mary to my sister he witness to them and brother Rani virgin in one night and they come right in fresh into the Word of God and then now wind gets back back to the denominational positions there and they get fired up right now because we've been hitting false doctrine for a year brother cam who is their main warrior in the fight now switches sides a modern-day Paul and starts fighting against the denominational doctrine and brings in three souls in one night they got baptized as well within a couple days and I get a call as soon as I get home from work one night it was one day after my sister brother Dustin soundly brother Randy Burke can come in you know some Scott Overmeyer and Scott / Myers he's kind of stirred he's like Bruce I say they want to have a meeting they want to have meeting what are you talking about Scotty wait talking about he says they want to have a meeting they want to they want to have a showdown I go what are you talking about he goes yeah they're gathering all the pastors they want to meet with us tonight a lot hold on hold on I said I'll give you a call right back and I called Berger Isaiah my pastor precious brother and Lord mighty soldier I said brother Isaiah what what this is what's going on he says yes he's mean but Craig have already heard he says we don't feel led to go I know what now me just being a year into the message a year solid that's it I was like well okay well a few guys aren't going I'm not going and he's like okay praise Lord you know we're not messing around okay so I hung up I called Scott Overmeyer back I said Scotty I said brother Brooks brother Craig don't feel that to go however and Scotty is now desperation he said sigh my mom and dad are making me go he said because he go he still had to home and they're forced him to go to this meeting and Scott / Myers a quiet man's a few words a real gentle spirit yo big man and he's not he's not a speaker and my heart went out to him because he was being forced to go to this meeting where they were probably just going to tear the living shreds out of him I said Scotty I'm going I'm going with you he said oh thank you sigh thank you absolutely so I said I'll go I'll see you tonight but what time such-and-such such place okay it was in the old it was in a Methodist Church in the basement at 6:30 or six o'clock son like that is it okay I'll be there so I I get off the phone and Betsy one day in the skirts sis iemon I'm going with you I said yes amen but the Randy said I'm going with him but I can still his anger issues he said I'm not going I said it's pretty celibate so as me Betsy in brother Randy went down I grabbed all my histories all my scripture notes everything had a pile like this going into this meeting and it was at night it was already dark at the time so we drove out to the Methodist Church went down into it and lo and behold I find myself sitting among there was a half-circle five or six pastors and their wives my actually my old pastor their denomination was there his wife and then there was about forty Christians to here to view this meeting sitting that way my mother was included as well and their Scott over Meyerson with his mom and dad then my sister Betsy said right next to me and brother Randy said right next to me and the Methodist pastor stood up said all right we called this meeting together because we want to talk about what you're doing to our youth in this area how you're spreading these false doctrines especially demon seed and I go to serpent seed he goes now demon seed I said fine and he went on and he says he goes how are you bringing this through the Bible I said okay I said I'm going to teach you a Bible study on surface seed and if you can see in the scripture then you have to agree with it if I can bring it right from this Bible then they all agreed they're absolutely so I started real slow into the Bible study I probably got five or six scriptures in and one started yelling at this you can't teach that and you can't do this and what about this and I throw the scripture here I'd wrote with Scripture there I drew a scripture there but the Lord the Holy Ghost had given me wisdom and he taught me showed me how to set a trap that that in that instant he showed me how to set a trap and I kept feeding that I tried this net and finally they're out almost like an up or asked my sister they're up and upward business not yelling at me and screaming and this and this and finally I waited for the moment where I felt like I said change it and I said hold on I said less I said let's switch to baptism you know let's just switch from service he let's just go right to baptism why we teach baptism different absolutely and the Lord was giving me wisdom how I had to get him to say in unison and all want to court a certain thing so I started working baptism now show them this scripture showing that scripture went to 29 to 20 19 went to acts 2 X 8 X 10 X 19 and isn't that and the the major consensus after the whole little study pretty much in use and they said we'll believe the red letters will believe what Jesus said over what Paul and Peter and Philip said any day of the week will take Jesus's words in other words they're saying the rest of the scripture doesn't matter it doesn't matter what they did in the book of Acts and when I had them to the point where they said will believe Jesus's words over there's any day of the week I had them when they said that now the Lord directed me to go back to original sin I said hold on now you just said that if Jesus said it you'd believe it they said absolutely I said let's go back to serpent seed it's okay all right all right there is a rough spirit in there if you can imagine so I started working Matthew 13 I said you said you told me that if Jesus appreciate you believe it is absolutely absolutely okay all right I started Matthew 13 and I took the two first parables I said you know he preached a parable of the sower let's read that and I read the parable to sober I said does anyone have a problem here I said this is Jesus own words it's a no problem I said one thing I love about these first two parables that Jesus gave his own interpretation of these parables what they meant so I and you cannot add to or take from it I said absolutely let's read the interpretation of the perilous sower we read it I said does anyone have a problem they said No I said let's go to the next parable and this is the one my daddy preached to this boys and that was just taught to me the truth on I said let's go to see what Jesus said about the wheat and the tares I said let's read the parable I read the parable what does it mean does anyone have a problem with this parable I said no absolutely not I said one good thing about this parable is that Jesus interpreted it a parable is something hidden that's not revealed it's not open but Jesus actually opened this parable I said this is the serpent seed preached right here and I started reading the interpretation in Matthew 13 of what Jesus said on the parable of the wheat and tares and saints of God it was silence I was watching them as they glanced back and forth looking at one another one lady got up and prophesized that you can't read it like that this is of the devil Allah you can't I said I'm reading the scripture do you believe the scripture or not this is Jesus's own words do you believe him or not she sat down and it was silence and it sounded like that for about a minute pin drop style and the pastor said you know what let's switch back to something else but at that moment I knew it was opened up to them they saw it let this be a witness to them and they went we went on for almost an hour and a half two hours doctrine the doctrine and then finally one man stood up said let's go over here and dress why are you teaching them to dress this way this way I said absolutely sir started going through hair and dress and at this time my sister started bawling or weeping a little bit she's one day in the in the Word of God one day dress and holiness for the first time went to Walmart bought three skirts just like that she was wearing one of them sin that night she's she started weeping and I started I'm thinking oh she's breaking please Lord hold her hold her Lord ISTEP teaching hair and dress holiness a clean living how women's to let her hair grow and where's Hertz and these things list such that nature and finally after a couple minutes or maybe 10 minutes she was bawling she was actually just weeping and I'm thinking oh Jesus help me and a pastor out of nowhere stood up said why don't you let your sister speak for herself and I'm thinking oh my god help us for Jesus and my sisters there was bent down like this just crying and my sister stood up out of her chair like this and she goes with her finger like this and she says I've never been so persecuted in all my life I just want to go to Saturday night Bible studies I want to go to and hear the true Word of God they can prove this from Genesis to revelations and I'm getting emails and text calling me a devil and deceived in a demon and this miss earnest and my the Holy Ghost had my sister tear them up and right after my sister got done with her speech there the Methodist pastor said stood up said ok we're done we're calling this meeting it's over and that's how it was so saints of God you don't have to be a rebel aiding man you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to be anything all you have to have is the leading of the Holy Ghost it was the Holy Spirit working through me and we took on five and six pastors with 20 years 30 years who knows how many years of experience and their wives and these people and the Holy Ghost left a witness right there so after that can you Vaughn in the Word of God my sister now in my brother-in-law they got married now in brother Randy a powerful preacher singer than the message that he came in and the Lord continued to do miraculous things so we continued on in the word and this message a couple things I'd like to hit is I was just maybe a year into the message I started pipe fitting and I was at a job site and an older man was working to us young a ladder he was on six foot ladder he fell down dead he fell down dead and as my first experience time with death and but I knew the promises of God and I had didn't have a whole lot of boldness with healing yet I could witness all day long but I didn't have the boldness for healing and in my mind I closed my eyes I said lord please spare his life and it wasn't 15 minutes later he was back up and alive so I started seeing you know the God answers even silent prayers and your thoughts that the Prophet said your thoughts speak louder than your words and actions do in heaven so it was a couple years after that I was on the job site again and a carpenter a drywall finisher had a seizure while he was on stilts finishing high drywall he fell down smacked his head cracked his head on the concrete floor me and my Foreman run in there and he's already in later I find out it was called the death rattle because my Foreman James Rocchi a wonderful man he was a paramedic at a time or knew about those things he did runs with the fair the firefighters all the time he said Simon he said he was in his death rattle and now a little bit further growing up in Christ on the power of God I went down and I just touched his foot as he's having his death rattles and I said in the name of Jesus Christ and it wasn't five minutes and he was back to his self he lived and they carried him off an ambulance so now I'm seeing the power of God as it moved through my grandpa and my mother and my father and then last year I was at another job site where a man was on two stories up until some scaffolding and I was down 15 feet away 10 15 feet away working on my my pipe there in age in Michigan and I heard a big boom I didn't think getting of interior's loud noises all day long and I looked over and there's a there's a man laying there half his shoulder on the scaffold scaffold outrigger and I'm thinking oh my goodness and he's he's breathing like barely breathing I run over to him and I'm looking at his his coworkers and they're not doing anything and I'm like what is going on here they're just watching him so I I was like man Lord 911 all my thoughts and then it was a couple minutes later I was like Lord what do we do whatever do so then two of his co-workers come right over and I was waiting for kind of to take concern you know somebody do something here and they just looking and I just stood there looking at this man laying on this ground and he was like breathing and it was really loud and it was just like that death rattle that I heard years before so I knew is its I told those two men I took control of the situation this time I said bow your heads we're going to call out for his name in the Jesus Christ name Jesus Christ I went down I prayed a one-minute prayer probably calling for this man's life his breathing is slowing now as he's doing the death ran I was getting real slow I got done with the prayer I've said that some young first-year apprentice I said call nine one now call nine one one I ran into the the school I was working at and I got the nurse I ran out by the time I got back he was conscious and breathing normal I was rejoicing um we have witnesses of what was done and they shipped him off and what I found out with a life flighted him all the way to Ann Arbor the more the most specialized hospital there now it was two weeks later that his this man's Foreman comes and hunts me up on the jobsite big six foot five man's and he comes up to me looking down like this he's like you're the guy who prayed over him I said yes sir he said you're not going to believe this I said what's dad he said when he fell he said he fractured his skull there was blood on his brain he broke his shoulder he's and his ribs were pointing into his lungs and bleeding in his lungs and they life flighted him all the way to n Arbor that night they got their face his head was starting to swell his brain was swelling and his shoulder started swelling out of controllably he said the very next day all the swelling was gone he was up talking and walking around and I whoa I said I looked up this big six with like five six foot five guy I said you tell that man Jesus Christ saved his life that day I heard on reason yes sir yes sir so I see the healing power of Jesus Christ on the jobsite and then years before that my brother had just had his one of his last boys there named Weston and he was born on a Saturday after church on Sunday I called him I said Sammy I want to come over to your boy and he was really down I said Sammy what's wrong man he goes side he was they want to operate him a new board they want to operate him necessary operate I go what I said Sammy let me come over pray tomorrow after work he's like yes sir so I was ready to come over and pray and then right before I rounded up my wife I said we're going to pray and she's like okay and then I got a phone call it was from sister Karen Sanders down in Lima and she fed me two hours of testimonies and the Saints my faith was so high I knew something was going to happen and it was already late now by the time those testimonies are over I called him my brother same as Tammy I'm coming over he said come over side come over so we rolled over there in the car we got there and you can tell they're real down and my sister-in-law and my brother roll down I said saying to God we're going to pray over this child and what was wrong the aorta was completely deformed of the heart one of the valves was not working or closed there was a hole in the heart and I also had a murmur to it so there's four things wrong with this heart and so we said a prayer we gathered hands and prayed over this baby we just cried out the name Jesus Christ for the healing of this baby the miracle whatever was we needed it we needed we needed it everybody's weeping and crying the Holy Ghost had come down and then fine as soon as I started feeding my brothers faith give him Scripture I said Sammy by His stripes he's healed seems like that's right that's right I said if Jesus Christ was here right now we couldn't hear mama Nico's what I said because he's already human seems like Sam goes that boy is healed and I knew it was right the very next day they went in for the pre pre surgery scan and they actually did a 4d scan of the heart however that works and the doctors got the pictures back and they said we don't need to do a surgery the heart is totally changed it's a miracle because my brother Sam just called me on the way home from where sighs I we don't have they cancel the surgery he's healed he's healed I said praise the Lord Sam by God's grace by His stripes he's you it's done he said praise God so now I have a wonderful six-year-old nephew that God has come down totally changed his heart made him a young healthy healthy boy in closing I hope this was beneficial and hope it encourages the saints of God right now as of right now I've got three brothers in this message serving two of them are pastors my little baby brother just come in about three years ago to the word believing the word my sister has been faithful so I have one brother my mama and my daddy and we got them all and then we're ready for the flight so be praying for us but we want to give all the praise and glory honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ there's no one like him or depending fully on him and hope this has been a blessing god bless you
