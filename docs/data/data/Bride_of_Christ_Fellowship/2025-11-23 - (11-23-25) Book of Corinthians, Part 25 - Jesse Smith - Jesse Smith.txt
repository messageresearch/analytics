========================================

Thank you, Lord, for every good and perfect gift that's been given from the Father of lights above. Lord, you've been so kind. You've been so gracious. Hallelujah. Thank you for the old rugged cross, Lord God. Hallelujah. Someday we'll exchange it for a crown, Lord God. Then forever we'll be with you, the one who died for us, Lord God. And you'll lead us to green pastures, still waters, Lord, in that other land, Lord God, the land of the living. Hallelujah. Father, till then God, give us grace and strength. Lord God, keep leading us along. Lord God, some through the waters, I was thinking like Moses took them through the waters. Some through the floods like Noah, some through the fire like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo, but yet all come through the blood. Thank you, Lord, for the blood of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Lord God, we come through that blood today, Lord God. realizing our littleness. Lord, how small we are, but yet, Lord, we're your children. The Bible said you loved us and washed us from our sins in your own blood. Thank you, Lord, for being so faithful, providing us, Lord, forgiveness, providing us, Lord, power, giving us of your own spirit, Lord God, Christ in us, the hope of glory. So, Father, take this day, Lord. Use it for your glory. We're just yielding to you, Lord God. Bless each and every heart especially our faithful saints who came out to the house of the Lord today. Minister to them I pray be with our saints that are traveling Lord God couldn't be with us today Lord remember them Lord Jesus and meet their spiritual needs we pray and God will be happy when we leave this place because of your presence in Jesus Christ's name saint said. Amen. Let's take our Bibles here. Let's go to uh 1 Corinthians chapter 13 verse4. I would like to finish this chapter today, Lord willing. I'll try to preach maybe an hour this morning here by God's grace. I got a my throat's uh been a very sore throat this week. But uh for the second service uh not sure which way we'll go, but uh I did have an email from a brother in Tennessee said he's going to try to attend with his little family. I guess he's got one. He's got a son and a wife and he said he felt the Lord put it on his heart to come to the 3M service. So uh I'm a little nervous about that. You know, when someone uh says that God told them to come to your church to hear from you, that makes me a little nervous. So, uh, but, uh, not sure if I'll preach or do a kids Bible study yet. I'll just have to wait on the Lord and kind of see how I feel that of the Holy Spirit. But, uh, and then maybe they won't come. Who knows, you know, we never know. But, uh, we just want to be ready to, uh, do the Lord's will. So, 1 Corinthians 13, uh, 4, I'll read four, five, six, then we can all read uh, verse 7 here. Charity suffereth long and is kind. Charity envieth not. Charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up. Doth not behave itself unseemly. Seketh not her own. Is not easily provoked. Thinkketh no evil. Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoicth in the truth. Let's read verse seven. 1 2 3. Beareth all things. Believeth all things. Hopeeth all things. endureth all things. And I'll say charity never faileth because that's the 16th and final attribute of God's love. May God add his blessing to the reading of his word. You can be seated. So Wednesday we saw how the uh the Lord Jesus manifested all of these. And if we ever uh knew what love was, it was through Jesus Christ. That's the only way we could know love uh on this earth by God's grace. You can switch over Kaia if whenever you're ready. Just again to see where we're at. We're at uh the the point of this letter of charity. He's gone through all their problems and he's on charity now. And what's what's interesting is he doesn't really deal with problems after this. Once he hits charity uh he well he deals with tongues and interpretation, you know, in the next chapter, but then after that he's not really dealing with too much of the problems. So he started with dealing with a lot of their problems in the church and then moves and and shows how charity is the solution to all of it. Love is what the world is hungry for. Praise God. Love is what we have. Hallelujah. And so if people can uh if people really want the love of God, God will send them in here if they live around here. Praise God. Or God will send them to whatever message church there is around the world that has the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. God will send them there if they truly want it. Praise God. But every person will get what they want. Hallelujah. Right? Uh they'll get what they want. If they delight themselves in the Lord, then God will give them desires of their hearts. Hallelujah. Then he'll end with the the certainty of the resurrection and gives his closing greetings. Now, uh years ago, I preached this uh Jose probably remember he was one of my biggest ameners when I preached on all the meanings of the Bible. I think it was like a 17-p part series or something. But Jesus, if we ever saw suffering long, Jesus suffered long. Jesus is kind. Jesus did not envy. He built up others. Uh he did not vaunt up himself. Uh he was not puffed up in pride. He did not behave himself unseemly. He did not seek his own. He sought the father's will. He was not easily provoked. It took a You could not get Jesus provoked. Hallelujah. And he thought no evil. He only thought the word of God. And Wednesday we finish with Jesus did not rejoice in iniquity. In fact, we saw how he condemned the workers of iniquity, but gave grace to those who kept the commands. Hallelujah. And today we'll look at the rest of these, Lord willing, uh, by God's grace. So, I think I said 17, but if I counted, I think it was 16. 16 attributes. So, this just a fresh thought I had. You know, if if anyone could manifest all of these, it would be the Lord Jesus Christ. So, uh, let's keep looking at his life here. Um he says in Matthew 11, this is the one time we can see Jesus rejoice in the Bible. You ever think of that? You know, we're not given many opportunities where we see him happy, rejoicing, we'd say, but this is one for sure where uh Jesus rejoiced. And I think it maybe was the other gospel that records him rejoicing, but uh he said, "But I say unto you that it should be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee." And we'll look at that here in a moment. But uh Jesus answered and said, "I thank thee, oh father, uh Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes." So in the context, Jesus had just finished rebuking three cities in northern Israel, which we'll look at today, and they'd rejected the message. Um, uh, it's hard and it's hard, it's always been hard for me to grasp that sodomites who would knock on doors in the days of Lot, they'll get less punishment than these cities we're going to look at here today. They would knock on the door and say, "Give us the young men. Give us those men. We want them for our evil purposes." It's just, it's hard to understand, but Jesus said it, so we must accept it. We must recognize that his ways are higher than our ways. His thoughts are greater than our thoughts. &gt;&gt; But this is one time he rejoiced. Jesus rejoiced and said, "Thank you, God, that you've hid it from the wise and prudent, but you revealed it unto babes." How happy that should make us today. Praise God. That we are the very few in this world. We're we're very few of the people that will actually be saved. Hallelujah. And go to heaven because we've received the revelation. And brother Ram said, you know, your church didn't give it to you. Uh, your parents didn't give you it to, &gt;&gt; but the father in heaven gave you the revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you. No one could give it to you, but you had to love the father, and the father gave you the revelation of his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And uh so here's a little map. Uh you'll see is the furthest north. Betha is uh southoutheast of of Churzan. And then Capertium is almost directly south of Trazan. Uh and I I could be saying these wrong. I'm not from the east. Um I want to real quickly look up that verse where it said Jesus I thought it said he rejoiced in spirit. Am I am I remembering that right? Okay. Yes. Okay. It's Luke. So if you don't if you have your Bible, it's Luke 10:21. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit. So I I used a parallel passage that didn't say he rejoiced. just said he thanked God. But here we see he rejoiced. So in in Jesus's happiest moments, he's he's recognizing I'm rejected by most of the people, &gt;&gt; but he rejoices. I'm glad some people receive my message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what I can rejoice in today. Uh all many people in Akran maybe or few people in Akran have heard of our church, but I'm thankful that God has given us some that believe it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. out of the few that have heard, you know, or want to hear, I'm glad God's given us a church that rejoices in the message. Hallelujah. The Bible revelations that God's vindicating right now. So Jesus rejoiced in his spirit said, "I thank thee, oh father." Now, what's interesting, you know, is when this is the moment or this is the the context where Jesus saying, "I thank you, Lord." So Jesus had spent what what the research I I did just said he he spent between weeks in these cities or maybe six months or maybe even 24 months. The first two years of his ministry, Jesus spent most of his time in northern Israel. And these three cities in particular saw some of his greatest miracles. Now remember the wine, the water was turned to wine in Canaa, right? That was his first miracle. uh the maniac of Gadra with uh we'd say 6,000 demons, whatever it is, legions, however, legions of devils. He was healed there. Uh and all the different uh miracles that these names of these cities bring to our remembrance. You know, he was raised in Nazareth, right? Just a wicked town, wicked uh wicked place to live. He said, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" But yet Jesus came out of Nazareth. Praise God. Because God can bring something evil out of something I'm sorry. So God can bring something holy out of something unholy. Hallelujah. Just like your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus said, "These three cities in particular saw uh many mighty works, but yet they did not repent." &gt;&gt; Now, and of course there's always a balance because it seems like God needs a test a witness from every experience of life. Uh, so John the Baptist did no miracles. Yet he was the greatest Old Testament person. &gt;&gt; So we got to keep this, we just want to keep everything balanced. And Jesus said, "You're me, you're more blessed to believe in Jesus if you haven't seen all these miracles." &gt;&gt; I want to read that just because I I want to make did he say more blessed? Was that or is that my own thought? 2029 Jesus said, "Thomas, because thou hast believed, thou I'm sorry, thou has seen me, thou hast believed. Blessed are they that have not seen." So there there is a blessing he must be missing out on and yet have believed. Hallelujah. I've, you know, none of us saw brother Brandham, yet we believe that he was sent by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there is there is a blessing for us &gt;&gt; that others don't get, but they they did get a prophet's reward. Hallelujah. If they were with a prophet, they got a prophet's reward. And then also to balance this out, you know, uh Jesus told the parable of Moses, uh I'm sorry, Abraham in Abraham's bosom, and we found that love for the law, love for the word of God will save someone. And yet, you know, miracles would not save people. So, so some people God's going to send miracles to and they don't have to believe them. They just got to believe the word, right? other people God will send lots of miracles to and that that ought to be enough to get them to believe. &gt;&gt; So you we basically got to look at uh what has God done for us? What has God shown us? And then we're accountable to what God has shown us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus said the witnesses souls were accountable for the mighty works that he did because he did so many mighty works in uh Galilee. We'd say we sing that song, I love that man from Galilee. &gt;&gt; You know why they sing that? Because he did Jesus did the majority of his miracles in northern Israel. That's why they loved him so much. It was all so many supernatural many mighty works. And remember when he after he did all these mighty works, he upgraded them because they didn't repent. So this these group of cities here in northern Israel should have repented because they saw so many miracles. &gt;&gt; That's right. So, you know, I would say the people around brother Random's time, they they're probably they probably saw so many miracles that God probably required that they repent because of all the miracles that they saw. But then like in other cases, you might not have as many miracles. Uh and God just wants you to believe the word of God just based upon what the word of God says. You should believe the word of God. &gt;&gt; You might not have saw as many miracles, but God wants you just to love the word. Believe the word &gt;&gt; and God will make you an overcomer. &gt;&gt; That's right. But cher and uh capernium and besada they should have believed and they should have overcame because of all the miracles that they saw around them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now uh there's at least six miracles recorded in capernium uh the healing of the centurion servants. That's when the centurion said Jesus just speak the word of God and your ser and my servant will be made well. &gt;&gt; So Jesus said my I've not seen such great faith of this in all of Israel. So this was a land of great faith for the believers. &gt;&gt; Uh Peter's mother-in-law was healed in Capernaum. Remember she had the fever and he just touched her and instantly she jumped up and started serving people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why you should want a miracle of healing so God can heal your body so you can go help other people as well. &gt;&gt; That's why we should want to be healed. And then Jesus even cast out a demon in their synagogue. Remember they brought the man in there and he was foaming at the mouth and Jesus rebuked the spirit. So they saw a demon cast out right in their church. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "You should repent if you've seen that." &gt;&gt; Also, uh this was the city where they lowered the the paralyzed man through the roof. And Jesus said, "I forgive your sins, but I'm going to do better than that. I'm going to raise you from your uh raise you from your paralyzed condition. Take up your bed and walk." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was done there. The noble man's son was healed as well. Oh, and I don't remember that one, too. So, let me turn to that one. John 4:46. Just to kind of give a little brother Ram called a polish up. Let me polish up on this one here. Uh, by God's grace. Okay. So, the son was at the point of death in verse 47. And Jesus said, "Except ye see signs and miracles, ye will not believe." The nobleman said unto him, "Sir, come down, my child die." And he said, 'Go thy way, thy son liveth.' And the man believed the word that Jesus spoken unto him and went his way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we find out later in verse 52, it was a fever. The boy was at a point of death because of the fever. And Jesus said, "Just go. You're going to find him. Just believe the word of God." So this was done. This would have been noised abroad uh by all their friends and companions. And then I love these that multitudes were healed at evening time here in Capernaum. So the Bible said just multitudes. It's like everybody was getting healed. Hallelujah. Faith was present to heal faith. This person was believing. That person was believing. Everybody was believing. But yet the city the heart of the cities of I'm sorry the the hearts of the people in the city did not change and the city did not fully accept Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So it'd be better I'm sorry. It' be less tolerable for the sodomites than for that city. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, Besada has at least four uh miracles that were manifested. Uh the blind man was healed. Hallelujah. See, not every city got a blind man healed, but Bessa did. They saw 5,000 fed. Hallelujah. The brother Ram said God took a creation and just multiplied the creation. Right? But then God said or brother Ram said there's greater miracles than that where you don't even have anything to multiply. You just speak it and it comes into existence like Moses speaking those uh plagues into existence and brother Ram speaking squirrels into existence. &gt;&gt; Right? That's even greater when you start with nothing and you just speak and God creates something. But that's still a great mighty miracle. Jesus walked on water toward Bethadas. That was going towards Bethedada. And then there were many local healings in the surrounding plains. uh in Janisera, I think the woman of Jesus was the one with the blood issue if I'm not mistaken and touched uh Jesus uh if I'm not mistaken by God's grace. Now Galilee on the Sea of Galilee itself there was miracles that they saw. They saw the the calming of the storm. Jesus walked on water, the miraculous catching of the all the fish that was right there on the Sea of Galilee. This place was hopping with miracles. And then they saw the second miraculous catch of fish after the resurrection. And they saw where the boat instantly, now the disciples would have saw this, the boat instantly got to the shore from being out in the middle of the Sea of Galilee in the midst of the storm. As soon as Jesus got into it, then he transported the whole boat right there to shore. So Jesus says, "This generation's required to believe all of it. If not, it'll be worse than the judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah." My now church, this boils down to this. Why you preaching this, Brother Jesse? Because it's in the Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says we must believe what God has shown us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, has God shown us all kinds of miracles where we're required to believe because of that or have we seen less miracles and God wants us to believe the word of God? &gt;&gt; You only you can answer that by God's grace. I mean, I could guess, but only you can answer that. How many miracles have you seen? But the but the gospel itself always has miracles. And the Bible said we must not neglect the salvation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The Bible said we ought to give the most earnest heed. So we've got to pay most attention in our life to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Don't let anything get more attention &gt;&gt; than the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Right? We've seen it over the years. People let family get more attention than the gospel. &gt;&gt; Family becomes more important than coming to church &gt;&gt; or reading your Bible in your home. &gt;&gt; Right? Or money. money becomes more important than the gospel. Like getting enough money, &gt;&gt; then you can't come to Wednesday night and you can't come to Sunday night and because money is more important than the gospel of Jesus Christ. We just have to constantly watch our lives and make sure we're giving most of our attention to the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We don't want these blessings to slip out of our hands. Think about that. God has placed blessings in your hand. Don't let it slip out of your hand. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't drop it. Don't lay it aside. Hold on to the gospel. &gt;&gt; Because if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience receive a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? Hallelujah. Each one of us are responsible to the word of God that we've heard. Do not let it slip away. Give the most earnest heed that we can to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, because at first it was began to be spoken by the Lord, and it was confirmed unto us by them that heard him, the apostles. God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will. And I can say the same for me. When I came to this message, I started seeing way more miracles than what I did in denomination. &gt;&gt; In other words, God gave me witness that this message was right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so uh we cannot let these things slip. We must give the more earnest heed to them. &gt;&gt; Now let's get to the next one. So Jesus rejoice in truth. Right? Now let's go to Jesus bears all things. And if he can bear it church, we can bear our trials. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh you'll be familiar with this. And in this case, G uh s or church, Jesus is bearing with you and I. If Jesus bears with us despite our weaknesses, then we should bear with one another. The Bible said, "Bear one another's burdens." &gt;&gt; This is in the parable of the unjust judge. And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjudged or unjust judge saith. Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?" &gt;&gt; So, this just struck me. God is bearing long with us. God is having patience with you and I. &gt;&gt; But Jesus says, "I tell you, God will avenge them speedily." So, in other words, God's working quickly to answer your prayers, but it can't be in your idea of quickly. It's in God's idea of quickly. &gt;&gt; It's at God's speed. Amen. Not our speed. It's at God's speed. We can't make Jesus a liar, right? Jesus is not lying. God's going to answer your request speedily, but not in your time, in his time. That's right. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth. So, in other words, Jesus saying, we wrestle with faith, right? We wrestle with believing. Brother Ram said, you know, uh we and I just read the quote a few uh months ago, but uh brother Ram said, "We have trouble believing from Sunday to Wednesday. Like, we'll we'll be so fired up Sunday when Wednesday comes around." Some of us just barely, and me included, sometimes we just walk in here just trying to get through the battle, &gt;&gt; right? Uh, and then what about believing from one week, one Sunday to the next Sunday? &gt;&gt; We were just rejoicing last week with ministry from Kentucky. Whoa, wasn't it wonderful? But do we have the same zeal that we had last Sunday? &gt;&gt; Or is God bearing bearing with us despite our trials? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, will Jesus bear with us? Yes, he'll bear with us. Praise God. Because that's what love does. Love bears with us. And so what does the word bear mean? This is the one that I thought was most helpful. It's patient in bearing our offenses. So Jesus is very patient with all the offenses that we have, yet he still answers our prayers. &gt;&gt; I like this church. Even though we injure other people, we have offenses, we offend people, Jesus is mild and he's slow to punish us. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says, right? though he bear long with them. Hallelujah. And I guess uh in the context remember the the unjust judge was bearing long with the woman who kept asking. He was bearing with her, right? And so God is bearing with us despite our offenses. He still answers our prayers speedily. &gt;&gt; Speedily. And I need that today. I need I need God to give me grace, right? I I I want I want uh I want patience. I want longsuffering to believe that he's going to answer my prayers speedily. &gt;&gt; And every time, church, every time I uh well, you've probably seen it, but every time I go to this slide and I uh cross one off, what do I say? I say, "Let's give God a round of applause." Amen. Because God answers something speedily, &gt;&gt; right? With Fabrigio and Muriel and everything like that, he's answered something speedily. So, we want to give him praise. Hallelujah. every time he answers a prayer request. Jesus bears all things. Jesus endured his disciples arguing about who is greatest. And he said he he he hears them arguing. He goes and gets a child and sets the child right by him. So this is a good lesson. Whenever someone's talking about how great they are, we should look at a go go go look at a child. Let's look at uh let's look at Eden this morning or let's look at uh uh Michelle, you know, let's let's look at Zion this morning or Genevieve. You know, when when when we think how great we are, let's put our eyes on a little child. And that that should remind us who's great among us. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receives me. Whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me. For he that is least among you all, the same shall be great. And this kind of goes with what we preached about, right, in chapter 12. The foot is the least esteem, right? It's sweaty. It's dirty. Is no one's ever thinking, "Wow, I got really great feet." Or, "Well, my feet look great today." You know, we want to make sure our face looks clean and everything like that, which we ought to. But in other words, the emphasis was we give honor to certain body parts. We don't give as much honor to other body parts. And those that are less honored by us, God will give them more honor. So God will give the people who have the attitude most like a child, they'll be called greatest in the kingdom of God. Now church, if you go study a little bit, why were the children called the least in the days of Jesus? Well, their uh children's uh lives didn't last very long. 50% of kids died by the time they were 10 in the days of Jesus according to what history says. That's not very much. Half the children died, right? Because of all the conditions, right? You had, of course, you had evil leaders, you know, like Herod that would kill the children, right? Pharaoh. Um, but on top of that, you had all the sickness, right? All the disease. And so, in order to be important in the days of Jesus, you had to be older. wiser, wealthy, and yet to be more honorable. And so all the apostles arguing, "Oh, we're greater. We're greater." And Jesus, you know, we're older, you know, we we we're fishermen, we're tax collectors, all these things. And Jesus go gets a he gets a child. And he said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like, &gt;&gt; a child. The le the people you think are the least are actually the greatest." Remember his own disciples tried to turn away the parents from bringing their children to Jesus. They rebuked them. It would be like me saying, "Don't bring the kids up in the prayer line. Don't come and tell me to pray for your kids. We got bigger problems than that." That's but it would be the same thing. And Jesus said, "Let them come to me." Right? They're the least uh uh they're the least esteemed. No one thinks they're important. We think importance is physical strength and money and your age and how much you know. And Jesus says it's not that. It's not in pride, right? It's not in anything you can do. Uh but it's in being humble before the Lord, just believing God's word. &gt;&gt; So Jesus bears all things. He bears with his apostles who think they're great, right? Jesus hoped all things. And uh the Bible said all Jesus said all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. So this is Jesus's great hope. All that want to come to me will come and and no one will be able to pluck them out of my father's hand. &gt;&gt; See he could hope. He hoped for all things. And just remember church Jesus prayed for you in John 17. Uh if you remember this Jesus said and now I'm no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee holy father keep through thine own name that's the authority keep through the authority of the lord those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are. So Jesus said he prayed and said god keep them through uni unity by god's grace. So think about that. People who fall away from the message, people who fall away from the church, they do so because they're divided and they don't have the same unity that we have. &gt;&gt; Okay? That was Jesus' prayer. Your main goal should be to be unified in love with everyone in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Satan's trying to divide you and get you out of the church, &gt;&gt; the true church of God. We're talking about &gt;&gt; the body of Christ, right? That was his prayer. He prayed that God keep them that they can be one that they can be unified. But Satan loves to divide. He loves to steal, kill, and destroy. &gt;&gt; But greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "I've given them thy word, Father, and the world hates them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. &gt;&gt; I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world." So church, we shouldn't hope that we could just go to heaven, right? Despite our trials. I know it's normal. Elijah felt like that, right? He said, "God, just take me home." But we should remember Jesus wants us in the world uh to overcome. &gt;&gt; But he did pray, "God, keep them from the evil." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's like the Lord's prayer where he said, "Lord, lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil." So friend, be encouraged. The reason you don't have more evil in your life is because Jesus prayed for you. &gt;&gt; That's the reason. Think about that. You hear about evil in that person's life and you see my the evil in that life. Like I just a few months ago, I read this awful situation. There was this rich couple. They were rich and a man and a woman. They're they're newly married. They're driving so fast in the Canadian highways. A moose comes out and hits their car. and the moose's antlers killed the woman and she was on Instagram or had all these followings you know she was like a model or something like that &gt;&gt; and it was just instantly church that's an evil thing &gt;&gt; but think God has kept us from evil like that &gt;&gt; and that's a woman who basically accepted worship from all these men you know if you go back and look at it you know and this man's a millionaire they're living this extremely uh luxurious life and you know God is the judge of all these souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I don't know the condition of every heart, but I just want you to see there's so much evil &gt;&gt; that goes on. But Jesus prayed, "God, keep them from the evil." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And look at this, church. This is beautiful. Let this encourage you today. They are not of the world. You are not of the world today. &gt;&gt; Jesus said so. Hallelujah. Well, if I'm not of this world, brother Mercy, where am I from? I'm from heaven. Hallelujah. You are from heaven. &gt;&gt; You're not a part of really of America. You're not really a part of that. You're a part of a better kingdom than that. &gt;&gt; A kingdom that cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; The United States has moved. China's moved and Russia's moved on these things. They get moved, you know, in their stances. But we never get moved because we're standing on the rock of ages. &gt;&gt; And Jesus prays, "Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is truth. So if you want to be sanctified, stay in the word of God. &gt;&gt; It will keep you. Sanctified means set apart, right? Uh reserved for the service of the Lord. Stay in the word of God. The truth will keep you set apart for God's purpose. Now he continues to pray. This is a beautiful prayer. I'll just say like this. Nobody could pray like Jesus. Hallelujah. that was God in flesh. Neither pray I for these alone, speaking of his apostles, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word. Now, that's where he prayed for you and I. We have heard on Jesus because of Peter's preaching, because of uh Matthew, Mark, right? all all the saints down through the ages, Bartholomew, Philip, hallelujah, uh James, John, all these all these faithful apostles, we've heard their word. Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Jesus prayed for us. Hallelujah. What did he pray, church? That we would all be one. &gt;&gt; So this is why unity is so important because Satan seeks to divide and conquer. Conquer the leoty, right? Nicicoleism is conquering the leoty. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Dividing them from the preachers, right? Putting all the holiness on the in the Catholics in the Catholics way in on the priest, right? But in churches, putting it all on the preachers. But I just read it this morning. Uh brother Ram said there's no holiness in the church except God's in the church. &gt;&gt; He said there's no holy man. It's the Holy Ghost in the man. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost in the church. Praise God. So if you've got the Holy Ghost, you're holy. I Amen. Just as holy as anybody else who's got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus prayed, "God, let them be. Let them be one as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us." So that's the same spirit. Jesus wants the same spirit in the church that he and the father shares that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. Hallelujah. And that's how the world will know. I don't know how to fully explain this, but that's how the world will know that Jesus is real because of our love for each other. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus says. &gt;&gt; And I remember I had that one time somebody said, "You go to church twice on Sunday." And I said, "Yeah, I just love those people. That's what that was my answer. And they were just blown away. A lot of a lot of Catholics just like to go on Saturday night so they don't have to go on Sunday, right? Just what I'll just go Saturday night and I got I don't got to go Sunday. I can work on Sunday. I can do whatever I want on Sunday. Oh yeah. And the qu the question was I mean they're like and you have a small church and you preach to the same people twice on Sunday. Like it's not a whole another group of people. No, it's the same people. They must really love God. They do love God. Hallelujah. It's a shock to them. &gt;&gt; He keeps praying, "Father, I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am." Isn't that beautiful? Jesus wanted to be with you, &gt;&gt; that they may behold my glory. Amen. Which thou has given me, for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world. Oh righteous father, the world hath not known thee, but I've known thee, and these have known thee, or have known that thou hast sent me, and I have declared. So here's the end of the chapter, church. Here's his last prayer before he goes to be arrested. and I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it, that the love or the charity wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. So he closes his prayer by asking, God, yet let your love that's in me be in your people. &gt;&gt; So no wonder the Bible said charity is the greatest of all the gifts. Jesus's last prayer before he's arrested is, "God, give them the love that you and I have, Father." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Next, Jesus endured all things. The Bible said we should look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and faint in your minds. You have not resisted unto blood, striving against sin. Hallelujah. So see the same word endure. Jesus endured all things. What did he endure? He endured people that contradicted himself. So you and I must endure, people who contradict our Bible beliefs. &gt;&gt; We just got to get used to that. Most people you're going to come in contact with contradict you. &gt;&gt; They don't like you. They don't agree with what you say. They don't believe what you believe. But you must endure them &gt;&gt; because that's what Jesus did, &gt;&gt; right? It's just kind of like when I do the YouTube comments. Like I just expect most people are going to be contradicting me, which it's about a 50-50 split. But the same is true whoever you talk to at school, right, Brother Patrick? Most people are going to contradict what you believe. But the Bible said you can handle it. Just look to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he did. The Bible said look to Jesus and then you can you can deal with all these people that contradict you. &gt;&gt; Amen. because that's what Jesus did. You've got to resist them. Don't give into them. Resist them like Jesus resisted their lies and all their traps and their deception uh and all the all the the badgering brother called in the church age book. They just badgered him. You can endure that by looking unto Jesus. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said you could endure physical pain as well. The Bible said in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. So whatever sickness God could allow like in the days of brother Ram tuberculosis was an awful sickness. Uh today it's more like cancer. You know painful sicknesses. It doesn't matter whatever you what do you ever you battle you can endure it because Jesus endured all things for your sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus went through the agony of the cross. And if if he endured the agony, you can endure all things as well. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you have to know, you won't have a trial that's too hard for you to handle. &gt;&gt; He won't give you something that you can't endure. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Remember this. Uh Jesus had depression that would kill a person. No one No one had depression like Jesus. You say, "Boy, I've been really depressed." you that can't touch what Jesus went through. &gt;&gt; Well, I've really been defeated. That's nothing compared to what Jesus went through. &gt;&gt; The Bible says it. He began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Now, very heavy. I'll show you the Greek definition. So Jesus when he was praying had such a heaviness. It was just weighing him down. So much so that blood would come out of his his forehead. That's the heaviness that was on him. What was it? It was your sin. It was my sin. &gt;&gt; The weight of the world came on Jesus's shoulders. &gt;&gt; And it was such a heavy weight to pay for all of your sins, my sins, past sins, future sins that it caused blood to come out of his face &gt;&gt; and it caused him to be so depressed. But he endured it. And so God asked us to endure our trials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't forget Jesus. Look to Jesus. If he endured it, you can endure your trials. Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is what I mean. I found this years ago. Very heavy means to be full of heaviness. It's great distress and anguish. This is the strongest of the three words in the New Testament for depression. So no one has ever been as depressed as Jesus Christ. Yet he overcame it because he focused on the joy that was before him. Amen. &gt;&gt; It didn't it didn't say he had the joy going through the the the beatings, &gt;&gt; but the joy was before him. &gt;&gt; So, if you're battling depression, if you're battling discouragement, yeah, of course you won't feel joy, but look to the joy that you'll receive. &gt;&gt; Have hope that you will have joy again. &gt;&gt; And understand, I can look to Jesus. I can endure this because Jesus endured it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, be encouraged. You know, if you know somebody who's battling depression, maybe take this verse to them and say, "You know what? I understand you're struggling, but did you know Jesus battled depression and he overcame it?" Praise God. He had such depression he would sweat drops of blood. None of us have been like that. We get depressed because we don't have this or we don't have that or don't have that or there are some serious causes, you know, of trauma and things like that. And I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about things that like for most of us, you know, our depression, I imagine, wouldn't be as great as other people who've experienced lots of trauma. But there are exceptions, of course. And this is what I want you to remember, church. You know, no matter what you face, Jesus is here. The spirit of God is here to bring good tidings to the humble. &gt;&gt; In other words, God's going to bring you good news today because you're the humble people. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love this. Jesus was sent to bind up the brokenhearted. In other words, if you got a broken heart and you feel like all the pieces are broken, Jesus is going to come and gather up those pieces and put them back together. He's going to put your put your life back together. Hallelujah. He's going to proclaim liberty to the captives. Well, I feel captive, Brother Jesse. I feel enslaved. Jesus came to bring you liberty. &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord does that. Well, brother Jesse, I feel like I'm in prison. I'm bound up. Jesus is coming to open up that prison. &gt;&gt; That's what the spirit of God does. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, Brother Jesse, I'm mourning. I'm I'm so sad. He's here to comfort all your mourning. &gt;&gt; You know, you might say, uh, I feel like I'm laying in the ashes. Like we heard like with Job, right? laying in the ashes. He'll give you beauty for those ashes. So in ashes, right, you're all dirty. So he's he's Jesus will say, "Get out of those ashes. Let me wash you. I'll make you clean. I'll make you beautiful again." &gt;&gt; He'll give you joy instead of mourning. &gt;&gt; He'll bring back the joy of your salvation. &gt;&gt; See, now here's how you know you're depressed. You can't praise God like you want to. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus takes away your depression, now you can praise God. really say, "Thank you, Jesus. Y'all, you're so good. You're so holy. You've done so much in my life. Hallelujah. I give you all the praise." Now, why does he do this? So you can be a tree of righteousness. In other words, he can make you like you're a tree planted in the house of God. And David speaks of that in the Psalms. Uh Paul calls it in the New Testament. He said, "I'm I'm going to make you a pillar in the house of my God." &gt;&gt; Right? We don't have pillars at this building, but at my house, I got two little pillars outside of the house, right? You all seen where and they just kind of hold up the front the awning there of of the front porch. And God said, "If you will let me set you free, if you'll let me restore your joy, I'm going to make you a pillar to hold up the rest of the house." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's what we all want to be. We we should all want to be pillars that can hold up this the church here in Akran, Ohio. &gt;&gt; And also the the the church of Jesus Christ around the world. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Jesse, that church is struggling that I understand, but our church doesn't have to. We can have pillars that are holding up the house of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't I don't have to accept uh depression. I don't I don't have to accept mourning. I don't have have to accept being a slave to sin. I can be free. &gt;&gt; I don't have to accept a broken heart. I'll let Jesus heal my broken heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did I tell you this one time? Uh I was speaking with somebody and and they they had lo I think it was a wife that lost her husband. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. It was a Catholic woman and and she said, "Brother or she she didn't call me brother Jesse." She calls me Jesse. She said, "Jesse, that hole in my heart where I've lost my husband, that hole never gets small any smaller. But she said, "The love that's around that hole gets bigger and bigger and bigger." I thought, "Wow, what a statement from a Catholic woman." In other words, there's always going to be pain, right? There there's always going to be uh some some scar, but God will give you love that overwhelms that pain. &gt;&gt; How many believe that by God's grace? In other words, you have so much more love that that pain won't feel so big anymore. And lastly, charity never fails. &gt;&gt; The Bible plainly says this that Jesus when he washed their feet, the Bible said he knew it was time to depart out of this world. and having loved his his own which were in the world, he loved them until the end. Church, what did he do? He he washed their feet. So remember that when we have the Lord's supper, I think it's in January, that is that is you getting a chance to show love. In other words, if I get to wash Mercy's feet next time or Jose's, that's me showing I'm going to love you to the end, Brother Jose. Right. Put the water on there. Brother Mercy's feet. Try to scrub it between those toes. Get it real clean. That's my way showing I'll never fail you. As far as what I mean is by God's grace, I'll never fail you. I mean, I'm going to make mistakes, but I'm going to love you to the end. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, that that's that's another scripture where charity doesn't fail. Charity doesn't run out. You're going to love somebody all the way to the end. And I like just I just put a few extra thoughts in there. His His love never failed. When Mary and Martha thought he failed at all, if you were here three days ago, he never fails. Even if he's late, he's right on time. Hallelujah. He never failed Paul. Paul asked three times, "God, heal me of my eye condition." And Jesus said, "No, my grace is sufficient for you in weakness. This is to keep you humble. I'm denying your request. But can you imagine Paul? He'd say, "God, I'm a scholar. I I I'm writing the Bible. I've written the Bible. I need my eyes to see." And Jesus says, "No, you need my grace. That's what you need." Well, that must mean if he's not going to heal me, that must mean that part of my life is over. That's probably what it meant. God doesn't heal you, then God's not going to use you in that realm anymore. God's going to use you in a different realm. Jesus denied his request even though he prayed it three times because he said you need to grow in your humility. Now don't raise your hand but I'm pretty sure all of us need to grow in humility. Praise God. And you need to understand that having perfect strength is trusting God in your weakness. Hallelujah. So, because Paul says, "When I'm weak, that's actually when I'm strong." &gt;&gt; In other words, when times are tough, that's when I pray more. &gt;&gt; When I'm sick, that's when I really focus on God more. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's what Paul experienced. Okay. Now, so I think that's I covered the life of the Lord Jesus Christ, right? Can everybody see Jesus had all 16 love attributes? &gt;&gt; Amen. Try to cover that. Now, let's get into this section. Now, I'm going to bring some different thoughts in here, and I trust it to be a blessing. I got about 15 minutes on my hour if I'd preach an hour. Now, here's the next thought. Uh after Paul says, "Charity never fails." So, after that thought, he breaks into this. Now, whether there be prophecies, they shall fail. Now, that doesn't mean a prophecy is going to fail. Like if you're a true prophet of God, if you say anything in the name of the Lord, it's going to come to pass. The only exception was Isaiah where God told Isaiah, "Go tell him, thus sayith the Lord, set his house in order." Right? Then he says, "Now go tell him, I'll give him 15 more years." That's the only time, right? But that that's God that's God's fornowledge. God had fornowledge of the perfect will of God and the permissive will of God. But it didn't fail. God just gave him the permissive will of God. Uh so whether there be prophecies, they shall fail. Now remember this is a church where they had so many tongues and interpretations, so many revelations, so many songs, &gt;&gt; right? This was a rich church, you know, financially and they had all these gifts operating. Paul sets it in order in the next chapter, but they had so many gifts. Everybody had some revelation, some inspiration. Now, we could use a little more of that. And the church said, like, in other words, I wish I wish I said it more. I wish you said it more. Oh, God gave me a revelation. Or God gave me a new song. Would that be nice? Austin seems to get some new ones lately. Hallelujah. Or God showed me a great revelation, the word this morning. I was in prayer. But either way, you know, he's talking, he's telling this group who has all these supernatural experiences, love is the only thing that won't fail. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And whether they be tongues, they shall cease. Whether they whether it be knowledge, it shall vanish away. Now, this word fail, it means in inactivate. So, there will come a time when God will inactivate tongues and interpretation and prophecy. It's no longer active. We don't need it anymore. Okay. Now, not while the bride's here. I hope everybody caught that here. While the bride's here, all nine gifts will be operating. And Paul will tell us later when these gifts will cease. Now, here's what Paul's saying. For we know, we have knowledge in part, right? We have human knowledge and then we have divine knowledge. And we prophesy in part. So there's a human element to prophecies and all nine gifts of the Holy Ghost. You want a good example? Go listen to uh go listen to questions answer 64. They asked brother Bram. They said, "Brother Bam, didn't you say not to eat eggs at the end time?" You remember that, brother Jose? What does what does brother Bam say? Brother Ram says, "Well," he says, "I don't quite remember." He said, "Oh, yeah. The prophecy was uh don't live in a valley." uh because of the the runoff and brother Ram said it's because of the runoff of all the pesticides and everything like that. He said don't eat eggs and don't live in a valley. And they asked Brother Ram, "Did that come to pass?" And brother Ram doesn't really tell for sure. He says, "I think it's already come to pass." He says, "So church, what does that show?" He prophesied in part. In other words, he partly understood it, but listen, God is the one who will interpret that. &gt;&gt; It's just like Elijah. How many remember when God told Elijah, "You're going to anoint three people." There it is. How many did he anoint, church? What? Elisha. And all he did was just throw the mantle down, right? Elisha anointed the other one. And then a son of a prophet anointed the last one. But God told him, "Thus sayith the Lord, Elijah, you'll anoint three people." So, we got to we got to understand God interprets his word however he wants to. And so the prophecy about the eggs and living in valleys, this is a good example of that, brother Ram. He just prophesied what God said. And now I believe it was a local prophecy to the people right there in Jeffersonville. But it doesn't matter what I believe. It's what God believes. Right? God's going to bring it to pass. Or maybe he already brought it to pass. And church, this is also important to say that we do not emphasize gifts as much as the authority of the word of God. And this was the answer to one of Rod's questions. I don't know if he asked in front of everybody or not, but he said, "Brother Jesse, if he said, I I love I love what you say." He said, "But are Oh yeah, I went through all those 40 prophecies of Brother Brandham." He said, "Are those equal to the Bible or not?" That's a really good question. So my answer was all the ones that are in the Bible or just explain the Bible, they are just revelations of the Bible. But what about the ones about the eggs and the in the valley? That's a pretty good question, isn't it? But I know what the Bible says. The Bible said, "Don't add one word. Don't take one word away." So this is my answer to that. Anything that's not in the Bible, it can't be made equal to the Bible because we can't add anything to it. &gt;&gt; So, it's an impart manifestation. It's not as authoritative as the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because this, we know in part, we prophesy in part. &gt;&gt; Okay? Because church, you and I do not want to be guilty of adding anything to the word of God or taking anything away. It's quite a balance, is it not? &gt;&gt; It's a That was a excellent question. That's probably one of the most in-depth questions I've heard in a long time. Now, here's how Brother Brandham explains it. Remember, I read this a few weeks ago. He said, "The gifts are just not to be trusted too much." In other words, you you can't when gifts operate, you can't fully make them on the same level as the Bible. That's what brother Brandham calls them little sensations, tongues, interpretation, prophecy, dreams, right? Visions, words of faith, speaking to the mountain, all these things. There are little sensations that we have. &gt;&gt; Thank God for sensations, though. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're getting sensations from God and not from the devil? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; But see, Paul says, All these things will fail. See, every one of them. Oh, yeah. This is what people say. I got a revelation come to me. I have a song. I have a new song. I have a prophecy. In other words, don't anchor your soul on something that's not in the word of God. You never you never place as much emphasis on something outside the word of God as you would the word of God itself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because brother Ram says, "Where's your anchor?" Your anchor is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So we don't trust upon sensations. We don't trust upon revelations. We don't trust these things. Only we trust Christ. It's by faith that we move out there. Okay? So I don't understand that last line, but our anchor has to be in the love of Jesus Christ. Right. Our anchor has to be in the word of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, here's uh well, we're almost there. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. So now, now we know when our gifts no longer needed. It's when the perfection has come. Paul says, "When I was a child, I spake like a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish things, right? Like when I was a child, I thought, I'm gonna grow up and be a millionaire. I'm gonna be in the NFL. Well, I put that away when I become a man, right? I put away that foolish dream. So, when will the perfection come? Paul tells us next. And church, here's the point I want to say. It kind of goes along with that last quote. We don't trust we don't trust the gifts too much. But spiritual gifts here are elementary compared to the reality of the heavenly paradise. So anything you get in a dream or vision or tongue or interpretation or speaking to the mountain, a word of faith, anything you get through that is elementary. It's minor. It's childish compared to what's in heaven. Because whatever's in heaven, you know that's rock solid. That's that's where you got a new body, a new understanding. Nothing's going to pass away in heaven, &gt;&gt; right? But things we need down here, that might pass away. We won't need that anymore. &gt;&gt; Now, Paul tells us when the perfect will come. The perfect comes is when we see Jesus face to face. So, I like that song. He's saying, "What a day that will be when by Jesus I shall see." He That's really good. That's really timely because you didn't know what I was going to preach, buddy. That to me, that's a witness. Amen. I look for God's witness in things. For now, we see through a glass darkly. So, we're just And that's of course the word for a mirror. In those days, the mirrors were not nice like we have today. You could just barely see a little bit of your reflection in the mirror. But then when perfection comes, we will see Jesus face to face. Right now, I know in part that's all of us. But then shall I know even also as I am known. So Jesus knew you before the foundation of the world. He numbered your days. He knew the hair of your head. &gt;&gt; He knew all those things. And when you see Jesus face to face, then you'll know more. You'll know perfectly like he knows you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now we know. And people today, you know, it's not really in message circles, but some they'll say, "Uh, oh, we don't need gifts because the perfect word has come." You're deceived, my friend, is what I would say. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because we don't see Jesus face to face. And they'll say, "No, no, we do. We We have the picture of the white cloud. That's Jesus' face. You deceived person. You s your poor deceived soul." Now this is important in one way because you might come across it. You might come across this quote and maybe Jose has talked to people about this. Brother Brandham actually agreed with this to say that we have the perfect word. But now notice he doesn't say thus sayith the Lord. So, some people, I'm going to read this in a moment, but before I do, some people use this quote to say, "We don't need gifts anymore because we've already got perfection that's come to us." And they'll say, "We don't need preachers anymore because we've already got the perfect word." Now, look, Brother Ram agrees with this, but he doesn't he doesn't apply it the way false teachers are applying it today. That's why going through every chapter of a book is very important because you have quotes from brother Brandham on all these verses. Paul says when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with. So all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tonesues trying not actually speaking in tonesues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things amen I go to preaching and then don't get to these things now that's all he said about 1 Corinthians Ians 13. He did not elaborate on that. Now, if you say, "Brother Jesse, do do you agree with that?" Well, to an extent, I do. &gt;&gt; I agree. We have the perfect interpretation of the mysteries of God because that's what the Bible said. What did what did the seventh what did the seventh angel finish, church? He finished the what? Mysteries of God. So, I believe that is perfectly revealed to us. Right? Which includes the Godhead, the rapture, hallelujah, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the mother harlot, the Roman Catholic Church. &gt;&gt; I believe in those areas of the mysteries, we have the perfect revelation of God's word. But I do not believe a man should take this quote and say, "Oh, we don't need gifts anymore. You don't have to pray for gifts anymore. &gt;&gt; We already see Jesus face to face. If I did, I'd sure be a lot different than I am right now. Praise God. If I saw him face to face, I don't I would not be sick right now. Praise God. Because he'd heal me if I saw him face to face. Now, here's a quote to balance this out. Don't forget these quotes. God has reminded me of these quotes recently, and I made videos about them. What says, "There may be times I may not be able to set it together, but all these other people are saying, "Oh, it's perfect, brother. Every word is perfect. &gt;&gt; But what about this quote? &gt;&gt; I don't believe there's any mortal in the world can correctly set every word together. Oh no, it's perfect. Brother Jesse, we'll show him this quote. &gt;&gt; How many believe brother was mortal? He died. Was he mortal? &gt;&gt; But we can only do it as the Holy Ghost inspires us to. Many times it's contrary to our teaching. So, we got to be careful not to be pulled by one or two quotes. There's always other quotes that we have to balance out by God's grace. They asked, "Brother Bram, uh, do a Moses and Elijah have to die? What about Enoch?" I don't know. I don't know. I'm just going to tell you I don't know. I don't know all the answers, folks. I don't know. And if I don't know, I'm going to tell you I don't know. If I do know, I won't tell you till I do know about it. I don't know. I've often wondered that myself. Eight times he says, "I don't know. I don't know. I don't know." Yet people say, "Oh, he's got he brought the perfect word of God with vindication. We got every answer in the Bible." No, you've misunderstood what he was saying. Isn't it ridiculous how people Look what evil spirits do to people. It's so sad what evil spirits do to people. And the and these are quotes. Brothers have brought the this one to me. Brothers brought this one to me and say, "We don't need the gifts anymore. Brothers have told me that to my face. We're in the bride age." All these things. Said, "No, you misunderstood that." And they're just really they're just really zealous about their own uh man-made revival, their own man-made creed interpretation. But church, we got to have a backbone. Hallelujah. We got to know where we stand. Thank God we know where we stand. How about this one? Brother said, "I'm not a preacher. They're preachers. They've got a higher office than I have." What preachers have a higher office than Brother Brandham. And what does he quote? He quotes the scripture. Ephesians 4:11. Look at this one. Brother said, "I'd be daring to stand before these men with the word of God, the ministers." In other words, I would not dare stand before a minister in in uh San Jose, California. Yet, they'll tell me the opposite. How dare you, Brother Jesse, uh trying to correct one of Brother Bram's minor doctrines. How dare I not? We want to be right. Brother Ram didn't have all the answers, &gt;&gt; right? Well, yeah. Brother Random says, "How dare I try to stand before these preachers?" Doesn't this prove how humble brother Random was? &gt;&gt; And brother Ram realized, "I don't have all the answers." &gt;&gt; Now, did he give us the major revelations with us saying the Lord? Absolutely. But he was also humble to know, "I don't know everything." &gt;&gt; And I love this. They preach. They know what they're talking about. All you preachers don't know what you're talking about. Brother Ram said we do. I just listen to what they say and say, "Amen." I love that. And I go on because they're men of God. I follow them. Now, here here's what if an honest person who loved the tapes heard this, here's here's my idea of what they would look like. Huh? What? What? Brother Random just says amen to the preachers, sits down, does not dare stand before them, and follows preachers. I thought we're supposed to follow the seven church age messenger. Now, that made me laugh because I like that. That's a chat GTP generated image. Isn't that true? &gt;&gt; Everything these tape worshippers are saying is opposite of what brother Brandham just said. &gt;&gt; They're saying, "You sit down, preacher. You say amen. You follow Brother Ram. Brother Ram's saying exactly the opposite. Uh, I just got over my hour, so let me see. I might stop there because this gets into a deeper thought here. Yeah, let me close with um I'm already at I'm already over an hour. I feel like I'm just getting warmed up, but my throat don't feel like I have a whole lot here. Yeah, let me close with this. Um, last last few thoughts here, maybe five 10 minutes. Let me in this last chapter. I'm sorry. In this last verse here of 1 Corinthians 13, I just want to remind you uh of just a few things that you you'll find important. Brother Cam and I were talking and he really enjoyed this. Verse 13. And now abideth faith, hope, and charity. These three, but the greatest of these is charity. So there's three great attributes of God. faith, hope and charity. Charity though is greater than all of them. Right? And brother Ram said Jesus represented these three attributes through three different men. Peter represented faith. James represented hope. And John represented love. Okay. Brother Ram said this. Look here. Jesus taken Peter, James, and John. Faith, hope, charity. Don't you see those gifted people? Them three, the hope, faith, and charity. Now, I preached this when God gave brother Austin that large sum of money a couple years ago. I was preaching this series uh on the love of God. Okay. So, Brother Ram said, "Every time you see Peter, James, and John, those were Jesus's middleman, we say, or not, maybe middleman is not the right word. um his chosen ones or his special small group of special preachers. We'd say hope was James. He was the only he was the one that set the church in order. Faith was Peter. Charity was John. Faith, hope, and charity. It was God's representatives on the earth. And the people laid in Peter's shadow were healed because he represented faith. Oh my friends, don't think I'm yelling at you friends. You think I'm excited, but I'm not. I'm trying to get my point to you close enough so you'll see what I'm talking about. Now, here's all the um here's some of the beautiful times where Peter, James, and John were together. They were there when Jesus when Jesus raised Jarius's daughter from the dead. So, what did you need to overcome death? Faith, hope, and love. &gt;&gt; So, why am I saying this? Because this will remind you if I want to see God move, I need faith, hope, and love in my life. &gt;&gt; And if I'm struggling with faith, say, God, bring my raise my faith. If I'm struggling with hope, God, give me hope for the future. If I'm struggling with love, God, help me to forgive people and love people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you'll see God move. Then you'll see Jesus move in your midst. &gt;&gt; At Mount Transfiguration, Peter, James, and John went up with Jesus. Right? So if how many want to see a revelation? If you want to see a revelation, you need faith, hope, and charity. These are the greatest. And then they couldn't even pray one hour in the Gethsemane, but he only called them to pray and they couldn't do it because of the weakness of the flesh. And then there's some other ones too there. Yeah, they're recognized as pillars in the church. Uh Paul recognized them as pillars in the church. Now, God always had a small group of believers, right? Moses, Aaron, Naab, and Abaiu. They witnessed the visible glory of God in Exodus 24. We just read it at home. Or wait, did we? Yeah. Yeah, we did because we're in chapter 31. Yeah. Yeah, we read that a couple weeks ago. And then God had Moses and Joshua together. David's three mighty men were in a special class above everybody else. In other words, Peter, James, and John had gifts that were greater than the other preachers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So some preachers today, they'll have greater gifts than others, and God can use them in a greater way today. So we should just be thankful for what God has called us to be. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be happy for the preachers. And I'm I'm saying I'm the least of the preachers. I'm not putting myself in there. But some preachers are so gifted, God will use them in special ways. Doesn't mean they're perfect, but it just means they have a greater calling, greater gifts, and God will reward them for that. Thank God for that. &gt;&gt; But let's pray for them. Let's rejoice when one part of the body rejoices. Let's rejoice with that part of the body. Hallelujah. So for me, I got to be happy for the popular preachers, the preachers who have big ministries. I got to be h and I am. I'm happy for them. Praise God. But God, let me be faithful with what you've called me to do. &gt;&gt; And Jose asked me when I first preach on charity, what about that quote? And I'm going to close with this. Thus sayeth the Lord, it'll take perfect charity to put you in that place. He's speaking of paradise in heaven when he went beyond the curtain of time. For that's all there was there. No matter what money, how much religious demonstrations, how many good deeds you done or whatever you've done, that won't count nothing on that day. It'll take perfect charity. So whatever you do, you lay aside everything else. Lay aside any divisions you have against anybody &gt;&gt; because God's trying to unite us until you're just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you. Let's stand to our feet and don't switch over. I just want to show those 16 attributes again. I'm going to go fast. Musicians can come. It's thus sayeth the Lord. If we don't have these, that's here's what I want to get to. We're not going to make it to that place because that's all that was there was the love of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Did you enjoy the word today, saints? &gt;&gt; I love the word of God. It just all flows together. Praise the Lord. Let's look at this list here before we pray. Thus sayith the Lord, you have to have this or you won't make it there. You must suffer long. You must be kind. You must not envy people. You must not exalt yourself. Must not be puffed up. You must behave yourself seemly. Amen. You must seek others needs rather than your own. You must not easily be provoked. You must think no evil. You must not rejoice in You must hate iniquity. I'll say it like that. You must rejoice in the truth. You must be able to bear all things. You and I must believe all the word of God. You and I must hope for all the promises of God. We must endure all the trials that God has for us and we must not fail. Praise God. We must go and love all the way to the end. Praise God. How many want a testimony like that? Let's bow our heads as we pray. That's quite a list, church, by God's grace. Quite a list. With man, that's impossible. But with God all things are possible. Praise God. Remember church, the Bible said the love of God was shed in their hearts. Let me look up that verse. I believe it's Acts 2. No, it's Romans 5:5. I always get that mixed up. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. As we finish today, let's pray and ask God, Lord, pour out your love in my heart because I want to be there on that day. I want to run up to brother Brandham and say, "My precious brother." You left your your wife and your children to preach in Ohio. And then I heard later, the next generation, I heard your message because you left Jeffersonville, went to Ohio. They started a church in Latin. I got to go. Thank you, my precious brother. We don't want the devil to divide us and bring in some root of bitterness. That's why roots of bitterness are so dangerous because bitterness is the opposite of love. Love can forgive people. Love can bear with your brothers and sisters in the church. Love can endure all things. Love will never fail. Father God, as we bow our faces to the dust where we came from, Lord God, we're reminded today of the amazing love of God. How rich and pure, how measurless and strong. It shall forever endure the saints and angel songs. Lord, more than anything, I want to go to that land beyond the curtain of time where Jesus is, where you are. Lord, I'm today. I'm laying aside anything, Lord God, that would hinder me from getting there. Lord, just show me if there's something I need to lay aside. Lord, I've tried to lay aside all these things. I'm trying to be united, Lord, with your people to have the same spirit, the same love one for another. Lord, one day we'll see you face to face and then we will know as you know us. But Lord, until that day, Lord, we we understand in part. We use gifts in part. We're grateful, Lord. We see through a glass darkly. At least we can see, Lord. So, we want to also express our gratitude to you and our thanksgiving for the gifts of God. But Lord, we ask today, Lord God, that you'll help us to lay aside any sin that easily besets us, especially bitterness that would take away the love of God out of our hearts. Lord, when it seems like you're late, you're right on time. Hallelujah. Lord, you love to the end. Help us to love people all the way to the end, forgiving our enemies. As brother Ram said, loving those who hate us. If there's anyone here who doesn't have that type of love, I pray you'd shed it in their hearts by the Holy Ghost today. Lord God, grant it, Lord God. Hallelujah. Just pour it out on their heart, Lord God. In my life, I want to see these 16 attributes, Lord God. Your people here want to hear you say, "Well done, my good and faithful servant." We all want to hear that. It'll take the love of God to do it. Give us love. When our enemies think of us, may they know that it's love. When our family that doesn't believe the message thinks of us, may they know that they love the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. May the world know that you came because of the love that we have at this church, Lord God. So we bless your holy name today, God. Receive our worship. Make our hearts tender, Lord. Fill with the love of God in Jesus Christ's name.
