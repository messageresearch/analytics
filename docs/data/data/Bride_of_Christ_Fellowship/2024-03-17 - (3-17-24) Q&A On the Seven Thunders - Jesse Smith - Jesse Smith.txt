hallelujah hallelujah God bless you let's take our Bibles here today by God's grace I kind of feel like singing more but uh I kind of know that want to make some progress here on this topic here today I'd like to preach on uh questions and answers on the seven Thunders we had some uh questions after the service there Wednesday so I'd like to try to answer those by God's grace so let's go to Revelation chapter 10 verses 3 and four by God's grace Revelation 10 3 and 4 and of course remember this is a great topic because it's all about the Rapture praise God hallelujah this is all about the Rapture and we all want to be ready Hallelujah I believe we will be you know we're given numerous Clues you know from brother brandham and of course the scripture uh you know there's many clues that we can see brother Bram talked about perhaps the dead in Christ will rise and will see them for a month or so like they were seen when Jesus rose the Old Testament saints were seen for numerous days before the resurrection I'm sorry before the Rapture of that day Hallelujah and so we we have that confidence by God's grace Hallelujah there's numerous other things we can see in the scripture we see the the the father coming down in the marriage of the son Parable Matthew 25 he comes down there one more time to greet all the guests before the ceremony starts so I believe that's like a latter rain that's another anointing that's another visitation from God to make sure all those who are going the Rapture already ready Hallelujah with the wedding garment on right and then the parable the The Virgins they all heard heard the shout they all heard the the voice at midnight right and they all got to get up and trim their lamps but one group had prepared oil that's what we're doing today we're preparing make sure there's oil in these vessels hallelujah amen Revelation 10 uh verses 3 and 4 Hallelujah Revelation 10 3 and 4 make sure my Bible is in the right spot okay appreciate those songs brother Aman really enjoyed those appreciate the special there brother Jose Hallelujah let's read that verse 3 and four ready 1 2 3 and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders of and write them not amen let's have one more word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you again for today Lord God we've sang the songs of Zion we've Worship You Lord God your name is Holy your name is life your name is power it's healing it's victory hallelujah it's a strong tower and Lord we run into it today we know we're safe in the name of Jesus Christ today so we ask Lord God you anoint me to speak Lord as the Bible tells us the five-fold ministry will bring us to maturity Hallelujah will bring us to a Unity of the faith so I pray that the great Holy Spirit would speak now Lord God and direct Lord God all the answers to the hearts Lord by the grace of God by the word of God and Lord we thank you for each and every soul that's here Lord bless your people Lord let your anointing be upon them make your faces shine upon them we pray Lord God hallelujah we want to be ready for thy coming dear God and Lord God we're looking Lord again for you to minister to these seven major needs Lord as as we have all these friends and contacts around the around the world Lord we'd say and we ask that you would move Lord for your glory Lord hear our humble prayers today Lord hear our humble cries Lord God hallelujah while on others Thou Art calling around the world do not pass Us by this morning Lord God we would like a visitation from the Holy Spirit we pray today in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated there praise God so you want to follow up you know uh from Wednesday service I did not make that one public uh because there were some personal things I wanted to share but if you need to listen to it let me know if you haven't yet I can give you the link to that but I'd like to just do questions and answers on the seven Thunders we had eight questions after service so I appreciate uh those questions and we'll try to answer those and then I just want to review when we review I'll just go over I'll hit the highlights you know of the quotes about the seven Thunders uh I found there's about 70 quotes now there could be some more there's about 70 by God's grace that I've looked at prayed about and uh studied on and uh so after I do the questions and answers then we'll just kind kind of review those Wednesday night I left off at the end of the seventh seal okay so I looked at most of the quotes from 56 all the way up to March of 63 and then Lord willing today we can look at April of mar April 63 all the way to the church age book uh by God's grace I want to say this as I said you know on Wednesday you know um I'm trying to be in a neutral spot you know some people believe the Thunders are going to be revealed right before the rapture some people believe the Thunders have already uttered I'm on the side I I believe the Thunders have already uttered right but if I'm wrong I want to stay in the middle and I want God to be able to move me uh into the channel of Revelation uh to receive if there is a seven Thunder Revelation but as we saw on Wednesday brother Bram said the seven Thunders have to be spoken by a prophet so that would mean either brother Ram's going to come back which I don't believe he's coming back except for the Rapture right just like all the dead in Christ but that means you know for people looking for that they're looking for a prophet to rise up so just keep that in mind you know if they think the Thunders are going to utter well they're looking for a prophet who's going to rise up and be the prophet and then they got to be so conclusively a prophet they've already had statements that have come to pass and prophesied in the name of the Lord that have come to pass right that that everybody can agree the whole bride of Jesus Christ will have to be able to say that person's a prophet so that means their prophecies that have already come to pass are going have to be spread around the internet all around the world right it's going to have to be spread so that's why I believe my conviction is they've already uttered through brother bram's Ministry okay but I want to remain in the m in the ne neutral in the middle because either side we don't have thus sayith the Lord and if we don't have thus sayith the Lord then we need the Lord to give us God's grace right we need him to give us a revelation Hallelujah so I just thought I'd share that uh by God's grace and we do it with all the love in my heart here uh by the grace of the Lord I just wrote down a 1 two 3 four five six just brief statements I want to look at okay uh well uh some of you might know too it's St Patrick's Day so I thought I'd read a little bit about St Patrick Hallelujah uh we don't celebrate it like the world of course his real name was s sakat and he's uh a saint from the pergami and church age and so he held on to Jesus's name and kept his faith he was robbed of his childhood I have this in my book here from 2021 uh he and his two sisters were kidnapped and sold as slaves Patrick was taken to Northern Ireland to herd swine and it was there God spoke to him he repented he got converted by the Holy Spirit through dreams and visions and hearing God's voice um Upon returning home to his mother in France of course remember he was taken from France to Ireland and then he came back he enrolled in his Uncle Martin's Bible school and Martin was the church age messenger talk about a wonderful family member to have amen the church age Messengers in my family Patrick could say that Hallelujah and that's the same Martin of Tours who was the star messenger for the church age so Patrick in the school he grew in Grace and Faith he shut in with God he studied the word of God had experiences Revelations with Christ and then he heard the voice uh say again go back to the ship and I got a I got a ship to you to go back to Ireland and so he followed the leadership of the Holy Spirit um he took the gospel to Ireland where he once worked as a slave and he and other ministers did just that and witnessed the Holy Ghost to do many miraculous acts one barbarian Chief witnessed so many miracles through Patrick's life that he and his entire household repented and received Christ and just as Jesus promis in Mark 16:18 there was a lot of serpents on in Ireland uh Patrick would take up the serpents he would get bit by the serpents and he would be healed just like Paul when Paul got bit by the Viper he laid his hands on the sick and they recovered by Jesus's Faith just as his uncle Martin did um he was once approached by an embassy from Rome so Babylon came to him to to visit Rome but he refused because he knew their wickedness and it was through the pure Gospel of Jesus Christ that St Patrick preached that nearly the entire Island received the gospel but then of course um you know uh many years later the Roman Catholic Church came back Jesuits came back in 1640 and slaughtered lots of the Christians there uh but their genuine faith in jesus' name undoubtedly undoubtedly provided them a place in glory because of their martyrdoms that was all because God used St Patrick for that in that uh Pam paman Church age by God's grace so happy St Patrick's Day Hallelujah we don't pinch each other actually we should pinch ourselves and wake ourselves up amen the Rapture is coming Hallelujah the r God is whether In Our Lifetime or the next one of these Generations the rapt coming like brother man said Shake Yourself the world does a bunch of nonsense but uh we're Holy Ghost filled Saints Hallelujah so question one are the Thunders and seals the same thing yes or no so no not exactly they're not the same thing uh the seals uh were were were placed upon the scroll right and the seals had to be broken and when each seal was broken we got symbols right the Thunder is what the voice said about the symbols okay Thunder is a voice of God so a seal was something was a mystery a seal was a mystery upon the scroll the lamb broke the Seven Seals and each time he broke it a a a symbol went forth and the voice of God said what that symble meant so not exactly the same thing but very closely connected okay does everybody understand by God's grace it's a great question all right number two and maybe this won't go very long hopefully why is fear and uncertainty connected to the seven Thunders I said that uh oh because brother ran when he talked about it he said I'm I'm afraid of what's going to happen he had the vision of the Seven Angels visiting him uh in December 62 and he said I'm afraid I'm scared I don't know does this mean it's time of for the Rapture does this mean the pyramid's going to be capped off remember went over that on Wednesday night in other words he thought he thought it could be his death he thought that vision of seven angels visiting him might be his death so he was afraid but then he told the people uh he told the people don't be afraid cuz Jesus will work it out so the same servant he said said I'm afraid but then he said don't be afraid um and I guess there's fear and uncertainty because no man knows the day or the hour and nobody wants to miss the Rapture right and that's connected to one of the the later questions I'll just answer now it's normal for us to feel nervous right about the Rapture because there's part of us that doesn't want to miss it right there there's there's always a human element there's always questions there's always wondering like brother Ram said I can't prove to you my name is on the Lamb's Book of Life he said but by faith I believe it and that's why the Bible said make your calling an election sure that's why Paul said I beat under my body I bring it into subjection so I'm not a Castaway I'm the one that's preached it but I I don't want to be a cast away so I got to be extremely dedicated and disciplined to the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen okay so that's another great question there um and there's also uncertainty because you know some of some some of our faithful Saints you know some of our precious friends you know our our our Holy Ghost filled Saints they they're looking for seven Thunders to utter and we're not so that makes it just a little strange you know just a little there just differences amongst the bride members so there that's why there's always uncertainty right now as I said we're looking for the latter rain right which the Bible describes in Joel 223 through 26 will overflow with wine oil and wheat another words we'll have every spiritual blessing Revelation the Holy Ghost the word of God we'll have all that praise God now we enjoy what we have now but God said there's more and we all know we want more Hallelujah we want less of this world and we want more of God hallelujah this world never satisfies and never uh gives us any peace like that song says the only real peace I have in this world is you Jesus Hallelujah all the uncertainty so that's why there's an element of fear because we don't want to miss it and then there's also uncertainty well are we going to have to have a prophet rise up and uh give us a revelation on the Thunders uh or or not so there's uncertainty because we don't have thus say the Lord on either side all right great question number three what's the difference between Thunders and rapturing Faith well brother brandom said Thunders was the voice of God about the seals and brother baham said then that would cause rapturing Faith so the revelation of the seals would give us rapturing Faith so that's the difference okay the Thunders were God's voice telling us what the seals meant and then that Revelation turned our hearts back Hallelujah and as our hearts dra keep drawing closer to God I believe we'll receive rapturing Faith now there's another element as well the Bible says once you've got the Holy Ghost you're already glorified and brother Bram said that means the Rapture is already in you praise God hallelujah it's like all the saints who died Paul James Peter Brother brandham Martin Luther you know uh Patrick they've they they had the Rapture inside of them already Hallelujah they had a portion of that rapturing uh Faith already in them praise God but we're talking about the rapturing faith the latter of rain will be the rapturing faith for the living bride who does not have to taste death that's what that's what we're we're believing and every believer always did believe it brother Ram said I I've always believed I wouldn't be too old enough until the Rapture would hear and we'd see Jesus in other words he always believed he wouldn't goow to the grave but he went to the Grave so we see that every believer lives like they're going to see the rapure praise God but we don't want to get overtaken by fear and we don't want to get distracted right we don't want to get uh tempted by the cares of the world we also don't want to look for things that would just maybe seem religious but not exactly right we just want to be walking in spirit and in truth praise God because remember any false Doctrine will then uh multiply itself amongst the uh will will be leaven amongst the dough and if it's not repented of will produce some sin now we're going to see it amongst us others or ourselves or whatever we're going to see it in the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life right in message churches like ours now the one that's probably going to impact most of us if we're born again is pride of life right because the comforter will keep us from uh adulteries and and evil sins like that lust of the eyes now we I've heard preachers say the lust of the flesh battles them that's why they're overweight we've heard two preachers say that from this Pulpit okay so that that's another obvious one like pride of life and then lust of the flesh also the flesh might lust after all nice new clothes all the times so they overspend on fancy clothes or fancy jewelry or fancy glasses I don't know you know it's a lust of the Flesh and so that's how it will manifest now if we're really Holy Ghost filled Saints we should not have any major sins among us just minor and I was surprised I got lot I put those videos out last week and I had a lot of good support but I had a few uh people disagree with me on that I'm like well brother Bram said it and Bible says it and there's got to be some difference between the wise and foolish virgin there's got to be there's got to be a benefit to being born again Hallelujah there's got to be hallelujah or else why did why did Jesus s the hly why did Jesus say go wait for the Holy Ghost if there's no greater power to overcome sin Hallelujah that's right I'm just I'm just passionate so I'm not upset I'm just passionate so great question that's the difference between the Thunders and rapturing Faith Thunders tell us what the seals are and this revelation of that gives us rapturing Faith Hallelujah uh question number four do the books from brother brandham have some Revelation from the Bible yes or no yes they have a lot of Revelation I've said it before like maybe I don't know I'm just making a number in the 90s 99 98 95 I don't know you'd have to do some scientific studies because brother R has a human element right we we understand he has a human element my list is now at 90 things I found where brother clearly either made a mistake or it was his own opinion and later it was wrong okay so like I I found one where brother Braham said uh uh Jesus saved my soul from burning eternally in Hell brother Ram said that okay brother Ram said women I'm just going to get into real Basics or real real plain brother Bram said women have sperm brother Bram said that 1965 or 64 the year before he passed and so these are just things he says right and and so we can see well not every word is thus say the Lord but then he'll give us thus sayeth the Lord and so we have a unique experience um never in the history of the world has a prophet's all of his personal thoughts and opinions been recorded on tape so we can enjoy it right the closest thing was the Jews when they uh did the uh what's it called I can't think of it now they had they had the uh Jesus talked about it in the the gospels they have their extra books and it's tradition what was it mishna there it is bless your heart there it is I'm not surprised not surprised I forgot either the mishna in other words in the days of Jesus the Pharisees had all their extra books outside of the Bible and this is what they thought Moses meant but they should have just did what Moses said see they had their own man-made ideas about the prophet's life and that's exactly what people do today they they make the mistake of making every word on tape of thus sayith the Lord okay get yourself into some really deep Waters uh of sin if you do that okay so great question uh very uh a very high percentage of the books and tapes from Brother brandom are from the Bible very high percentage we don't know the percentage but it's very much and that's why I said when I first listen to brother BR I cried like a baby I was a sinner or a denominational I wasn't a sinner I was a denominational person but I never heard a man preach the Bible like that and still of this day I've never heard a man preach like that God's prophet question number five were the seven Thunders uttered on Earth or in heaven since Heaven is quiet about it well according to the Bible um well we know there's thunderings going on from the Throne of God if you read the book of Revelation it says that many times and then there was a thunder in heaven when uh the one thunder on the first seal when Jesus broke the first seal in heaven so there's thunderings and one Thunder there in heaven but then when that revelation of the seals gets brought down to earth then it thundered on Earth so you have thunders both places you have thunders both places okay does that answer that yeah there there's thunderings often at the Throne of God there's the Thunder for the first seal in heaven in Revelation 61 and but then those seven Thunders regarding the Seven Seals happen on the earth Revelation 10 3 and 4 that was our text great questions uh question six so John knows the second fold of brother brandham but was forbidden to write it John that's a good question John that's a really good question I never thought about that um John heard what the seven Thunders uttered and he said write it not so um I think folds is the second fold I think what she's trying to or what the question is asking is about brother random had a vision of just the seventh seal and he said there's three folds to it John wasn't connected to that one so John wasn't connected to the seventh seal Vision John was only connected to the seven Thunders Vision okay so that's a great question that's a fantastic question U so John knows the second fold I don't I don't know if John knows the second fold of brother Brandon's Vision I don't know brother BR said one was in unknown language the other one he said went by so fast he couldn't make it out so I I don't think John knows brother brandom's seventh seal Vision but John did hear the seven Thunders utter okay John knew that but he said don't write it so think about that the revelation of the seven Thunders could be written down amen and brother BR preached it for us and then it was written down I believe that's my conviction I believe it was written down in that seven seal book out there if you want a free copy they're yours to take Hallelujah great excellent questions there wow six seven are the apostolic fathers the fathers of Faith yes that's my answer yes does that include God uh no it doesn't necessarily include God it in it includes the fathers of the faith in other words the writers of the Bible now for us it's the apostles it's the Apostles of Christ Jesus so now let's prove that of course uh okay that's Malachi 45 and 6 let's go Malachi 45 and6 and then we'll go to Luke 11:7 uh case you want to pull that up Malachi 45 and 6 and this is one of the main scriptures people that leave the message attack uh but they're actually denying Luke 1:17 they're actually denying what the Bible says behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children now just stop right there this right here is John the Baptist now look it says he's going to send John the Baptist before the great and terrible day of the Lord that's been over 2,000 years in advance right so God was saying there's going to be the spirit of Elijah come and it's got a two-part Ministry before I pour out uh before I just send fire after Armageddon right the great and Dreadful day of the Lord the day of the Lord is Armageddon so 2,000 years in advance God said I'm sending you John the Baptist before because he's dealing with Daniel 70 weeks weeks right he's dealing with those 483 years that Israel has left and then God's going to cleanse it all Jesus going to cleanse it all and he's going to be the anointed one in the temple of Jerusalem hallelujah amen but remember he's going to after after that after those 69 weeks he's going to take a break and he's going to reveal himself to the Gentile church amen he's going to get himself a bride he's going to graft that wild Branch into it amen aren't you glad you a bunch of wild branches have been grafted into the holy Vine Hallelujah and now I'm not wild anymore amen now the Holy Ghost can control me hallelujah amen so see he does Elijah does two things he turns the heart of the fathers to the children now that's what John the Baptist did John Baptist turns the heart of the fathers to the children and so the only way that makes sense is John the Baptist was one of the uh one of the uh Apostolic leaders of that time of course in the New Testament because God started the New Testament there with John he finished it with John right and he pointed all the people to Christ he said I'm just a voice of the Wilderness he said follow Christ amen so John pointed everybody the fathers uh to Christ and then all their desires all of the desires of Paul Peter and James and John and Matthew Bartholomew all the apostles all their desire was to the coming of the Lord the people that would live at the coming of the Lord that's the only way this makes sense how could John turn the hearts of the fathers to the children because John pointed everybody to Christ right there's the Christ and then their heart was then to see the coming of the Lord and that's why Paul and Peter always right about the coming of the lord they're always like the coming of the Lord is at hand and John says the same thing the coming of the Lord is at hand be ready there's already many Antichrist but you'll know the Antichrist he said uh by The Works of the Antichrist but you'll know Christ because we've got the anointing of Christ all right now uh now brother BR fulfilled this and the Heart of the children to their fathers so John the Baptist pointed all the apostles there his his Spirit of Elijah appointed them to Christ so all the all Paul all the apostles had a heart for the children but now at the end time Elijah has to come but he came through brother Ram's Ministry and he's got to point point all the children the people that are here at the coming of Christ back to the fathers now most denominational churches maybe amen's heard this maybe bang most most denominational churches I've had friends I've had friends use this verse in a Bible study I've sat in because I teach Bible club and they use this to say it's just with natural Fathers and Sons like like Malachi and I like and and and they're actually preaching you know the spirit of Elijah is on me so I'll have a heart for Malachi and Malachi will have a heart for me right I've literally sat in Bible studies and they can't see that this they don't even mention John the Baptist if they can't see half of it how they going to see brother random amen but the Bible interprets this for us uh Luke 1:17 this is excellent question great about the apostolic fathers and this is in my book as well I WR wrote a whole thing about this in the book and he shall go before him in the spirit and power lies to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children so John pointed he was the first one to point everybody to Christ and then all those that received him they had a heart for the children the heart for the the people that would be alive at the coming of the Lord the second coming of Christ right and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord now God used brother Simon was it last week to do a wonderful job of showing us how there's numerous Witnesses in the gospels that say uh John the Baptist Was Elijah but he wasn't that Elijah he fulfilled the first part of Malachi 45 and 6 but not the second part there had to be another Elijah come to turn the hearts of us the children back to the apostolic fathers so that's a great question let me make sure I got does that include God no God is not one of those fathers or children but God is the father of all those fathers and children Hallelujah so that's a great question does that help hopefully helps by God's grace and last question then we'll get just to we'll review some quotes here is it okay to be a little nervous for the Rapture yes and then remember uh yes we have to we have to remember to keep love in our hearts because as I said he'll appear to all those that love is appearing so we got to have love right we got to have the love we got to love that he's coming right uh now it will cause some seriousness night right we'll shake ourselves and say I want to be ready oh God help me to stop playing games and help me to get my first love back and anything like if you're you're in that position it's going to help you do that by God's grace but yes and then remember brother R says there always has to be tension in our lives there's always got to be problems or issues if not you said you'd be a jellyfish with no backbone you just drifted along in life and this is okay and this is okay and that's okay but what if it's your sin that's not okay the Holy Ghost will never lead you to sin right it'll try to keep you from it right but when you grieve the Holy Ghost the Bible said confess your sin and then he'll cleanse you of all unrighteousness amen amen all right uh great questions those are wonderful wonderful questions there by God's grace okay now um now I want to go through um nine I think it's nine reasons I got the I I believe the Thunders were already uttered here so let me uh you can uh switch over now hun and I recorded a video on it yesterday I'll probably put it out tomorrow um I might have to add a few things here and I know this is small I'm very sorry this is small so I'm very sorry I forgot to make this bigger um but right now I have nine nine or 10 reasons one of them I might take off the video because I'm thinking about it meditating on it this morning but anyways the first reason I believe the Thunders were already uttered is brother brandham said uh seven times they were already fulfilled or revealed or already history seven times now I know there's more than 10 times brother brandom said they're going to going to be revealed to give us rapturing faith I know that so there's actually more quotes saying they're going to be revealed in the future we'll have rapturing faith but the point of those seven is that thereafter he preached the Seven Seals or the seven seal okay so it's it's almost as if he grew in his Revelation and that's my that's that's my understanding during the church I'm sorry when brother man was preaching the Seven Seals he still thought the Thunders were going to be future but after he preached them I believe it was revealed to him that he realized oh the Thunder already uttered because they were the revelations contained in the Seven Seals and so he never afterwards he never ever talked about us having to uh get the revelation of rapturing Faith with the seven Thunders okay all right so that's the first reason uh there's seven quotes where brother Ram says after he preached the seventh seal there's seven quotes saying they were Thunders were already revealed their history they're fulfilled they're opened he said that open is another word I could have put that one on there number two brother R never mentioned the seventh seal Vision with the threefolds after preaching the seventh seal sermon and again makes me think uh it was already fulfilled his vision was already fulfilled and he knew the Thunders were the revelations of the Seven Seals now that's just my my humble opinion in other words if this Vision about the seven seal was so important why wouldn't brother R and and we had to get the Revelation for the Rapture why in almost two years did Brother Ram never ever even mention that Vision one more time it's not mentioned one more time but then afterwards seven times he said that they're open they're fulfilled they're history it just doesn't it doesn't make any sense that this Vision was so important and then he's not even here now he's gone off the scene he's not even here to get the interpretation of that Vision if the vision is not fulfilled right and then who is that who's going to be that Prophet that we all know amen and sister Naomi Jose bang well all know that man's a prophet and he'll give us thus sayth the Lord on the seven Thunders and that will give us rapturing Faith who is that man I like to meet him I'd like to get to know him pretty good that gu's good because if he's anything like brother brandom he might lie to the IRS he might disobey uh the angel the Lord like down in South Africa and and take the denominational agenda itinerary rather than God's itinerary and he might get amibas for six months and almost die in other words he's going to be human right he's going to be human and we're going to have to look past his faults and see his prophetic gift just like every Prophet Moses Abraham they all had faults none of them were perfect oh but there was one perfect that was Christ Hallelujah manam said he's the unveiling of God hallelujah he said all the prophets were apart he said but when we saw Jesus that was God unveiled Hallelujah number three the third reason when they asked brother Ram directly about the seven Thunders he said they were already fulfilled his home Church asked him over 300 it might have been almost 400 questions in the questions and answers series uh from August 1964 and of all those questions he got asked one time about the Thunders I wish I could talk to those people why didn't more of you ask about the seven Thunders maybe they did they just only gave them that one question I don't know I just say that as a joke but he said they were already revealed and then he quotes Revelation 10:7 the mysteries of God are finished which we'll show in just a moment so if somebody asked you directly about it wouldn't you saywell I'm waiting on the the two other folds of the vision to be fulfilled wouldn't you say that if you're a prophet and you've got a vision that's not fulfilled wouldn't you remember wouldn't the Holy Ghost Quicken that to you I would think so so that makes me think even more he realized they were already spoken in the Seven Seals okay that's my humble thought number four brother random put in print he put it in print in December of 1965 that the Thunders were the revelations contained in the seven seals he read it over a couple times and his daughter Rebecca confirmed she said she read it five times brother Brandon while they would drive around so brother brandom knew it seems he knew very well what was in the church age book and he allowed it to go into print that the Thunders were the revelations contain the Seven Seals and that would literally turn your hearts back to those Apostolic fathers amen so number five if the Thunders aren't revealed then our hearts are not turned back to the apostolic fathers right if your heart isn't turned to the fathers Peter Paul James John and so forth then who is your heart turned to my heart's turned to the word of God in all my questions I search brother Ram's quotes and I ultimately go back to the Bible the Bible is my last word the Bible's my absolute okay and it seems like from the Bible you can only have two conditions either you have a Heart of Stone or a new heart a heart of Flesh so if I've got a heart of Flesh if I Repent of my sins have been baptized then I got a heart of Flesh and my heart is turned to the apostolic fathers because that's the age we're living in I don't know about foolish virgins but uh I don't know who their heart could be turned to they got a they got a new heart but is it it's not turned to the apostolic fathers is it right they're not really trying to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are they like the apostles they'll still sprinkle they'll still sprinkle babies and sprinkle adults Presbyterian churches even you know their hearts aren't really turned back to the apostolic fathers but they got new Hearts if they're saved all right number I'm going to try to speed up here now this is the one I might remove um because I don't know it's just as I think about it it's just maybe hard for me to understand in Revelation 61 it says a thunder sounded at the first seal when the lamb broke the seal a thunder sounded now to me that proves each seal had a thunder or else there are eight Thunders so this is what I'm I believe might be a mistake of the movement that's looking for the seven Thunders okay because they they're looking for seven but the Bible said there was a eight there was an eight thunder in in in the first seal right so are you looking for seven or eight right because there's seven but if if if the seals aren't open if the Thunders haven't uttered their voices if we don't know the Thunders well there was a thunder in the first seal so what it say you don't know it because it's a voice of God it's still mystery I might leave it up there now okay I I said it a little better there by God's grace thank you Lord amen so but I we got to do a new a new recording I hope this is recording because I'm not recording on my phone help us Lord help YouTube to have their servers not break down okay number seven again there's still no thus sayith the Lords on a future opening or revelation of the seven seven Thunders um but there is a vision right there is a vision about it but again he never mentioned that Vision after the seals and I'm open to correction if he did ly someone let me know this morning I searched fold uh Seven Seals seven seven Thunders I never found it after the seventh seal and I went and looked directly in the Rapture sermon December 4th 1965 3 weeks before he went off the scene he only said the word Thunder one time and it wasn't even revealed to the seven Thunders but in that sermon he said at least five times the Seven Seals are revealed God's finished he said all the mysteries of God are finished amen am you would think in any sermon where he's going to bring out this this Vision where we got to get this revelation of the Thunders for the Rapture so we can have rapturing faith you would think that he would put this Vision in that sermon but he never did now I know he was under pressure remember the uh the host of that in the hotel they were trying to get him to close the service but he just kept preaching anyway as long as he could until he probably didn't hurt their feelings but again there's there's no mention of that um that that vision and there's no thus sayith the Lord on it we don't have a thus sayith the Lord now thus sayth the Lords are important because it's God brother Braham said he said I have my opinions but he said you'll know it's God when he says thus sayith the Lord Lord okay so we have no thus sayith the Lord like how are those seven Thunders going to be revealed who which continent are they going to be revealed on first who's the first church to get the revelation of the seven Thunders we we have we have nothing to go on it right it's just what we have on that one sermon uh the seven seal sermon March 1963 okay number eight if the seven Thunders are still Mysteries then the mysteries of Revelation 10:7 are not fulfilled okay which and then there's lots of quotes that are wrong then that say all the mysteries of God are finished and then Revelation 107 isn't history like brother Bram said and what is the attraction on the mountain and that opens us up to all these strange things do we still need a seventh angel messenger then brother can't or is he going to come back and he's going to be the seventh angel messenger again see so it just opens up this whole what do they call a Pandora's Box what they call it I mean all these questions oh my goodness who's going to be this Prophet who's going to be the seventh age brother Ram wasn't the prophet to the age now did you know there's a quote brother Ram said brother Ram said somebody in his church hung this up and he said uh I forget the name of the brother he said the brother put my name by that Elijah he said he said I don't believe I have anything to do with that man did you know there's a quote that says that in the church ages brother said I don't believe I have anything to do with that now how can that be thus sayith the Lord dear precious friends that worship the tapes how he said I don't think I have one thing to do with that man that seventh Church age messenger that's called humility that's called a humble servant of God and that's and that's what all the all the people around brother Ram that's what they say brother Ram said I just didn't want to come out and put myself in there I wanted God to reveal to the people that I was a prophet that's what Perry green says he said I wanted God to show them that my Ministry in the scriptures he said all I can do is point to the scriptures I never wanted to magnify myself now that's the one thing that's different when the angel Lord was there he said Do you believe me to be God's Prophet right and then the angel or leave and he's like I never called myself a prophet is that true I mean I I've he said I never call myself a prophet and yet he says do you believe me to be God's Prophet because it's different when God's there it's different you're not your regular self and your own human thoughts now there's a holy anointing there things are different right now right he wasn't lying he wasn't telling the truth I'm sorry he wasn't lying he wasn't uh misrepresenting the truth he was telling the truth but it just shows the presence of the angel of God is different than just being without the presence of the angel of God right we all know that now uh my ninth reason is the order of Revelation 10 seems to fit what has actually happened in reality since 1965 so the order seems to be Christ comes down in that cloud in Arizona in February 28th we just passed it Jose sent me the anniversary Hallelujah happy anniversary to the Lord coming down Hallelujah and then the Thunders utter their voices other words in other words God gave the Revelation to brother brandom about the the Seven Seals brother Bram preached the Seven Seals marriage and divorce anointed on at the end times all these Revelations the mystery of God is finished brother R goes off the scene and now John the bride's got to eat the book and take it to Every Nation right and there's still there's still Apostles doing it right now Simon is he said I believe we still have one we we have one message believer right now in Thailand one one uh brother uh Jason dears is trying to do work there in Egypt right trying to get more believers they got a real small group they just meet in a hotel room they're trying to find Believers they're still doing missionary work brother Maxwell Lee last time I talked to me he went down he uh boated on this tiny little boat he went down the uh the N River down there in South South Africa down into Brazil to try to win souls for Jesus Christ I'm sorry not Nile Amazon sorry there I go I was thinking of Egypt you know South America what did I say South Africa I'm sorry forgive me I'm glad I got some help out there by God's grace that's I need God's help so brother Maxwell Lee is going down the Amazon river in South America there we go South America I appreciate my wife helping me on that thank you h I don't want to say the wrong thing Hallelujah so we you know we are in you know I I believe history has proven Revelation 10 the order is chronological because the now think think of the other side think of the other side if if the Thunders H are not revealed yet this prophet's got to Rise Up from Among Us give thus sayth the Lord and then we got to quickly spread it to the Nations Every Nation Jesus said this gospel must be preached to Every Nation then the end comes that means we got a lot longer here which it might be it might be I'm trying to be neutral but I I just have this conviction I feel like this has already been happening these last 59 years since brother R went off the scene as far as John eating the book uh uh missionaries today apostles today taking this message to Every Nation all right all right okay now let me uh get out of that one oh yeah so then my 10th one would just be uh if I had a 10th one I don't know if I kind of mentioned this earlier um in the in the Rapture sermon from December 4th 65 brother Ram never mentioned the seven Thunders that might be a 10th one like if you're ever going to share something there you know that would have been a great time to share it right because for the Rapture apparently you know he once believed we got to have this re revelation of the seven Thunders that will give us rapturing faith and then the Rapture can happen Okay but you know I believe the truth is very close to that we got to get the latter rain because that's what Joel 2 says that's what James 5 says James 5 says God is very patient for the former and latter rain to pour out we get impatient but God is very patient Hallelujah he sees the beginning from the end all right so if I had 10 that's what I would have 10 reasons okay uh now let me go through these quickly here oh yeah let's start with after the seals okay you know I felt pretty good until I made that goof up on South Africa and South America man I felt pretty good what's that yeah you're right brother South [Laughter] a I like that brother thank you now I put red stars by the seven quotes where brother Ram says the Thunder already fulfilled revealed opened or history I love you brother Jose thanks for having compassion on me buddy all of you too all of you have compassion on me now 19 days after he said the Thunders got to be spoken and then we'll get the Revelation 19 days after he said the seven Thunders happened the other day something happened the other day you read or heard on tape the seven Thunders what time is it sir see it happened the other day so the seven Thunders happened all right uh now this was earlier in the morning yeah this was a this was the evening service God hiding himself the morning service was world falling apart so in the morning and I got these out of order sorry the Seven Seals were opened at the Tabernacle the other day so I'm including that because he says they're open right and if the Seven Seals are open then that's the rapturing faith of the seven Thunders the revelations are what the voices said Hallelujah hope that's not too confusing right because the the the voices of God's voice God's seven voices or seven Thunders are the revelations of those Seven Seals and brother Ram said the Seven Seals are open and then the next day I'm sorry then that night he says it happened the seals are revealed and it the seven Thunders happened already that's pretty clear to me now here's one um here here again now here he's he's making it sound like Revelation 10:7 is in the future so see this is I'm just being neutral this is a quote on the other side now to me it's brother man being humble because he's in his home Church okay so brother man says and at the sounding of the seventh Angel's message all the mysteries of a God would be made known then come the seven mysterious Thunders okay so this one is more on the other side right but again remember I got seven that say thunder already fulfilled revealed okay so this was what three months after after he preached the Seven Seals okay so that one and then he doesn't say anything else the rest of the sermon he doesn't say anything else about this remember this was the sermon where he had to realize um I got a complex against the people he said I want to move up in Colorado get away from everybody and I just want to stomp down like an Old Testament prophet and say thus say the Lord and then leave him because they kept getting more paint more makeup uh more dirty jokes more men smoking cigarettes and he lost the feeling for the people but the angel said if you do that your wife will leave you he said I thought I was a prophet and the angel said you're an Apostolic Prophet many gifts right and that goes against these preachers today that or these internet prophets say that say I'm a prophet I don't have to go to church how do I know because I just emailed one and then he rebuked me on the on the video I said well you don't match the word of God every prophet in the New Testament stayed with the churches went to church why because there's accountability in church there's no accountability sitting at home you don't answer to anybody but I got to answer to you you got to answer to me and the Bible said they went out from us because they were not of us hallelujah so somebody's got to be gathered with the Holy Ghost Saints Hallelujah I'm glad I'm one of them amen and time will prove what kind of character you are Hallelujah amongst the people of God remember Church we're all like iron we're all sharpening one another right so all your good stuff is sharpening me all my good stuff is sharpening you now don't look at my bad stuff I I won't look at your bad stuff right we got to let all of our good attributes sharpen one another when we come together look past our faults Bible said if you see somebody overtaken go to them with the spirit of humility unless you get or else you'll get tempted by what they're battling okay so see that one is I'm just trying to I'm trying to give you all of them so you can see what a preacher has has to kind of pray about right rightly divide the word of God Christ The Mystery of God revealed now here's what I mentioned earlier some people think these are the other two folds of that seven seal Vision right the first fold was the seven Thunders and we don't know the last two okay but here remember I told you on Wednesday some people believe the threefolds were Thunders how and when Jesus will come now this is not very popular I'm just I just want to show it to you because it's another seven Thunders quote okay and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of a half hour the seven Thunders utter their voices and John was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't okay yeah so I just want to show that to you as a followup remember I I I shared with you uh there's there's at least three different ideas on the shout I'm sorry on the the three folds of brother Ram's seventh seal Vision the one the one thought is shout voice Trump the other one is seven Thunders how and when and the other one is seven Thunders and two unknowns okay like that's what brother Ram says in the sermon there's seven Thunders and there's two unknowns but then I believe that brother R realized it was already revealed after he preached it because the revelations of each seal was the voice of God telling us what the seals meant all right so that's what I believe that's what it seems to be like brother BR is telling us okay next one Christ same sermon now here's another one he says now the coming of the Lord is in a mystery we don't know when he's coming or how he's coming but we know he's coming so see those people will say we know he's coming the seven Thunders and there's the when and the how there's the three folds so some someone shared this with me years ago precious brother and he said there's the three folds and I said I like that's fine you know that's okay it might be but one thing I know if I got the oil I'm going praise God I don't know anything about the vision I didn't see it but I know the Bible if I got oil if I got the wedding garment on I'm going to be a part of that wedding supper Hallelujah if I got the righteousness of Christ and not my own righteousness I'll be there Hallelujah when the r Called Up Yonder I'll be there Hallelujah huah thank you Jesus so some people use this to say here's the threefolds we know he's coming which the seven Thunders would utter and tell us the revelations to know he's coming when he's coming right we we won't know the day or hour but brother said we might know the week month or year it's possible I mean it's possible right I mean think about the saints that were alive when the dead in Christ raised at Jesus resurrection they had to know something's happening here I imagine they were really sincere don't you imagine I saw Abraham today I mean we wouldn't joke about memes like right like we wouldn't say oh I don't like that song like we do you know we'd be like the rapture's coming son I know Dad let's go pray you know what I mean like we would be we'd be we'd be different right we would be uh just as sincere as possible and that's why I love God is a god of Grace and he even gave them 10 days to get the Holy Ghost 10 days that's how gracious God was now somebody had to cook some food in that time the Bible didn't say they were fasting so the sisters had to go out get some uh food some fish you know some bread so they God is gracious God got them ready for the Holy Ghost and so God will get us ready for the Rapture yes he might give us a month 40 days I don't know but if God was gracious to them he'll be gracious to us praise God that's the kind of God I serve God of Grace he's rich in Mercy okay in the same sermon now later in the sermon but in the last days the reason that was such a tremendous thing that he spoke of it here and showed those seven Thunders showed he showed them he said and then he goes to Life Magazine I left the magazine in there but I was going to bring it up and he he talks about the vision where the seven angels met him and said go back to the Jeffersonville and open the Seven Seals for Christ because Christ was going to show them the revelations of it okay uh yeah showed was past tense he showed them seven Thunders I thought they're mystery no they're showed and you're going to hear him say they're already revealed they're already fulfilled now I haven't been keeping track of the Stars I don't want I mean you don't have to keep track of them I'm just let you know there's seven of them okay 1964 now think about that that was what that was June no that was July five more months he never even mentions the seven Thunders five more months doesn't mention it so I you know for me I would think if this Prophet had this major Vision about all of us we got to get the seven Thunders before the Rapture I would think he would preach it more often don't you but if he thought that's what the Revelation was in those sermons he could relax oh they just got to drawn out to God and that's why he would say in 64 he's like if you ever get a tape he said I'm not a tape salesman but if you ever want a tape of anything I believe that was inspired he said if I ever preach anything inspired it was those Seven Seals amen glory that just struck me I didn't even that wasn't in my notes amen if I ever preach anything go listen to those Seven Seals Hallelujah that was probably well that's probably the most well I don't the church age book and the Seven seal book were probably the two most important books I've ever read in my entire life outside of the Bible if you want a close walk with God if you want to know the word of God read the church age book and the Seven seal book I know you've heard me say that before I just want to share for the live streamers anybody else that's young here you uh little pre-teens and teens get into that church age book by God's good right AAA amen all right sisters thank you sister Hallelujah the unveiling of God now this is almost a year later almost a year later he finally mentions it again back in Jeffersonville everyone has come to me and said brother Braham them seven Thunders The Voice uttered he said write it not but close it up that'll be seven Thunders that'll be revealed to us in the last day see seven Thunders that'll tell us now don't that sound real good see but watch what you're talking about when you say that so I I don't know if I have the quotes but a person was saying brother Bram you can write your own new Bible that's basically a tactic of Satan just like the Mormon Church wrote their new Bibles so brother R tells us the devil's trying to tempt him to write a new Bible like an addition to the Bible he said well see see that you write it not see the seven Thunders utter their voices don't write that see it's to be be sealed up in the book until the last days and someone has been many has been saying to me brother brandom if the Lord God with your experience that the Lord's given you with for his people humbly saying this you would be eligible to write a Bible yourself your word if God manifested I said that might be true he see but he was trying to catch me and I said but you see I couldn't do that why couldn't you you have all the qualifications I said but look one word cannot be added or taken away see I'm sorry that covered up the word away but you you know and he said well then them seven Thunders you see wouldn't them seven Thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation give to some man in order words in other words to write a new Bible right I said no sir it would be adding something to the Bible or taking something from the Bible now look it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened already opened up the revelation of what that seven Thunders was come on church I just to say that I'm just I'm just excited sorry come on brother Jesse amen it's already opened up the Seven Seals already reveal what those seven Thunders uttered hallelujah oh write a new Bible brother B you got all these qualifications no it's already in there it's already it's already been preached that's what it was see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word I love that it won't leave the word and God's spirit will never everybody say never God's spirit will never leave that word hallelujah it will never lead you away from the word of God it'll lead you to the word of God I'm just getting some boldness here by God's grace I just that blessed my heart it'll stay right with the word blinding some and Open the Eyes of other it's always doing that so in this one quote he says the seals are revealed the seals are open and it was all three are past tense it already was already was already was Feast of trumpets is this the same sermon no I'm sorry that was unveiling God this is Feast of trumpets okay now notice Revelation 10 1 to 7 remember the seal the Thunders are in there it's verses three and four all the Mysteries are to be revealed to the bride by the messenger of the leosan church well if someone's expecting another Prophet to rise up are they the messenger and brother BR wasn't the messenger see he has any anybody got a revised Bible version if you have you'll notice where the angel it says the eagle uhhuh the messenger to lean Church Revelation 1017 and he said this in that day that he seen him come down and eat up the little book he put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and swore by him that lives forever and ever time shall be no more and when he did seven under Thunders uttered their voices when the seven Thunders uttered their voices John said he was about to write he said don't write it uhhuh see and he sealed it so in the same in the same quote this doesn't maybe add a whole lot but in the same quote he's talking about the Thunders he says all the Mysteries are revealed by Brother brandom by my Ministry not by someone else rising up but brother Brandon okay Feast of trumpets U next quote Oh yeah this was oh yeah they ask him brother Bram those Seven Seals brother Bram that will be revealed in the last day some great mystery how do we get closer to God no sir it cannot be so in other words they're talking about well if the SE a revelation you got to write a new Bible but he said whosoever shall take one word from this Bible add one to it his part will be taken from The Book of Life what it is is a revelation of of what's been missed back there to bring it so past Generations missed the revelation of the Seven Seals because it wasn't God's time to reveal it Hallelujah see it's already in there it's wrote in there it's in here it's to reveal what already has been written because you can't add one thing or take one word away from it and then three paragraphs later he says this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ I like that that's a new sound we don't hear too much right this is a complete revelation of Jesus Christ and the seals had the Mysteries hid of what it all was and it's supposed to be open the last day at the leene age at the end time thanks be to God that finishes the message to the church that finishes it finish not something extra but it finishes it brother man's Ministry finishes it and then again now here this a few months later I already read this or mentioned it one month later have the seven Thunders which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but not yet known to us in the Thunders yet no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about so a thunder is a voice of God so the voice of God seven times told us what the seals meant they was to reveal right the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make it out what it was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed so what does he connect this to Revelation 10:7 now look we got a quote and we got the scripture and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seven Church age see like I said on Wednesday see can everybody see I see by God's grace now here's a few things that you know some people ask about in the quotes in 1965 brother raham in each time he talks about wanting to preach the seven Thunders along with the vows and the trumpets okay now to me that that doesn't mean like the Thunders weren't revealed yet it just means he was going to tie them all together that's the word he uses tie he's going to tie everything together okay and really church if you think about it if everybody's really spiritual here or try to be if he would have preached the vials and the trumpets he would have been preaching the Sixth Seal again because all those things happen under the Sixth Seal because the Sixth Seal is the Tribulation seal right and that might have been helpful right it might have been helpful to understand the six seal but did God allow him to do it no God didn't allow God wanted us to have to pray about something right God wanted us to search the scriptures God wanted us to man manifest love Hallelujah so you'll see three three or four quotes in here where brother says I want to preach the seven Thunders but don't forget what he's already said and don't forget what he's going to let be printed in the in the church age book all right everybody everybody Hanging On by God's grace all right how many got a tighter grip now that you're hanging on that's that's how I feel okay I can't I can't forget this one so before he even says he wants to preach on it he again says it's history the seven Thunders are history God already fulfilled his word now to me that makes sense why he would never mention the vision again because it's already fulfilled the vision of the seven seal I'm talking about with the three folds I know we're getting into some deep Waters what happened on Mount Sunset now Sunset was where brother B got the king's sword remember it would have been uh February of 62 no 63 February of 63 it was prophesied in December of 62 but he went out there to Arizona in January but he had the experience in February if I'm not mistaken okay now this sermon is beautiful brother R says he shows how God fulfilled all these scriptures on mountains amen like God told Moses you'll come back and you'll know I'm with you because I'll meet with you again on this mountain Hallelujah and then Jesus he got to meet Moses and Elijah on the Mount of transfiguration Hallelujah and then when Jesus comes down on the donkey right Palm Sunday we're coming up on that next Sunday by God's grace it was fulfilled on a mountain Jesus was coming down the mountain hallelujah amen and so brother ends the sermon by saying God has fulfilled his word on a mountain with me Hallelujah glory is that something brother Austin my goodness that something sister Lena God would fulfill more scripture about a mountain in our day I just look at you because you're kind of new to this and it took me all these years to understand this so I feel good for you I had to wrestle with this a few more years you know maybe than others have to but people might still it's okay if you wrestle with it like I said it was so good for me to so it's a good question it's so good for me to go back and read every single quote about it it was very good because then I get the full picture on it now he again then he goes through his oh I'm sorry I didn't even finish reading it he says that's what all this noise is about it's God fulfilling his promised word again Revelation 10 1 to7 so three and four are the Thunders and in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel message that's verse seven the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelation 10 1:7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age Luke St Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed he talks more about his ministry and then right before they pray he says these notable words and the god of Heaven promised that evening time would have evening lights three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir now let me pause right there when brother am preached what time was it sir he told the vision of meeting the seven angels and then he didn't know is this is this the end of my life he said is this something awful is God calling me off the scene or is it a furtherment of my Ministry Hallelujah and then when he preached the seven seal he said now I know what it was the thing I wanted my whole life now I know what it was it a furthering of the ministry I was to go out west to get Commission on a mountain to go back and open the Seven Seals for God hallelujah hallelujah and brother said Moses was driven to the Wilderness to get the Revelation Paul was driven to the Wilderness to get the Revelation so brother Ram had to be driven to the Wilderness to get the Revelation Hallelujah Glory but now it's history he says it's passed the prophecy is fulfilled what time is it sir what's the attraction God fulfilling his word now remember I showed you the quote brother Ram said another name for the sermon title of cers the end time is seven Thunders it's another name for it's a synonym right so brother Ram says in other words we could say seven Thunders what's the attraction it's God fulfilling his word that's why I love that after the second seal brother Ram got done crowd's kind of quiet you can hear him closing his Bible he stands back there's a little pause he says that's thus sayith the Lord hallelujah when did a man ever say that Hallelujah we've never heard that and then the Crowd Goes they just go wild worshiping God and he say if all these other Revelations it if all these other dreams is hit so will this also that's thus sayith the Lord amen oh wish I could have been there amen hallelujah so if this is history then the seven Thunders are history that's what he says here it's history so they're open revealed fulfilled showed history now here's here's some that you know we wonder about this is why I try to be in in the middle now I don't sound like I'm in the middle because I'm all excited but if you ask me I would say I'm trying to be neutral but this is my conviction right and was not allowed to have the auditorium so brother BR was trying to set up meetings right he said we could have one service but they would not let us pray for any sick well that's my Ministry to pray for the sick so I refused it and I said in doing this I've come here for the purpose of teaching the last vials so he came back to Jeffersonville teach the vials which is the Sixth Seal and the seventh vials part of The Sixth Seal and the Seven trumpets six seal and the last seven Thunders which were not in the tribulation period they got to be in the Gentile Church ages to file the opening of The Seven Seals and seven Church ages so see the other side will say look uh brother ramam says the seals and church ages are open but not the seven Thunders well don't forget in the previous year brother Ram said they're already revealed okay so it's just something to keep in mind that's why we want to be humble um yeah tying okay there there's yeah so tying so see that's the word to use I don't know why at school I do that all the time so because I got the projector so here I just I'm in the I'm just got these habits time so see he wanted he wanted to tie everything together the seals the church ages that's what we get to do amen hallelujah the trumpets the vials the Thunders let's tie it all together but did God let him do that no God had to have something for the bride to do praise God uh next week is that the next week yeah two weeks two weeks and he said there be hideous sights upon the Earth Locust like hairs a woman this is uh the fifth trumpet in Revelation N9 Locust with hairlike women long hair to haunt the women that cut their hair think about that they'll be haunted because they cut their hair God will haunt them and how about color their hair like pink and purple and all kinds of fuchsia whatever they got to haunt them this is what God wanted your hair to look like it's going to haunt you for however long they they're haunted I think it's five months teeth like lions Stingers in their tails like like scorpions they would torment men months just wait till we get into opening them plagues and seals and them seven Thunders now look I already showed you quotes where brother said the seals were open right and I've already showed you quotes where brother said the seven Thunders were already revealed so which one are they well you just got to make a choice right and just be keep a Christian Spirit whatever you decide right and keep seeking God whichever part you go on right that's why I was praying up here God give us Revelation no wonder brother R said we should pray for Revelation more than anything else God make your will known to us unveil something so I can see it plainly with eyes that have isav on it holy ghost I isow by God's grace oh brother better get to Goan now goam was when the plagues were falling that represents the tribulation period right see while you while there's time to get to gotion don't pay any attention to this outside so again he just he just mentions it in passing the rest of the sermon he never never mentioned it so again it seems like he wanted to tie the Thunders together with the seals tribulation events vials trumpets of course God did not allow it because God is all knowing god is all wise God has a purpose for everything uh the next week Christ revealed his own word the last T week's tapes I think will reveal to you the great hideous things we're going to speak on one of these days when we get a place sufficient of the opening of those last plagues to be poured out upon the Earth those vials rather pouring out the the seven vows and the Seven Thunders and those hideous sights that's come upon the Earth okay man now and people today are in such a neurotic condition the whole world okay so now this is just uh interesting to me the Thunders are spoken in the context of the Great Tribulation what about the rapturing faith context that they were preached on so I I don't understand that but again it's a quote I want to acknowledge it but we can't forget all the quotes you've already heard right okay that's the last time he mentioned it so think about that he lived for four more months he never mentioned the seven Thunders one more time now you you can I think you can prove this I I think I tried it one time people around brother brandham felt like he knew he was going to die soon in 1965 and there's quotes where they kind of tie it together he said is this my going home time and all these things I know he said I'll ride this Trail again I got to make a video on that one sometime at some point um but I would just think again I would think if he knew he was going off the scene and he knew these Thunders had to sound to get rapturing Faith and he thought the Rapture was so soon I would think he would have mentioned it in one of those four months you know before he passed away but he never does so again to me that's another sign it's probably already fulfilled it's already history it's probably already opened it's probably already showed so the church age book chapter nine brother BR is going through uh the his ministry the messenger to the age he quotes the the seven Thunder scriptures what was in those Thunders no one knows right because John didn't write it but we need to know we need to know and it will take a prophet to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural Revelations except by a prophet the word always came by a prophet and always will I don't know about you brother van and brother Jose but when I hear someone around the message say I'm a prophet my ears go like this what I'm going to watch you for every red flag I can and we should do that brother BR said a Shepherd should watch over the Sheep right usually they're self-exalting themselves most of them have been false prophets that I've seen but again if you're on this side where you're looking for the Thunders what are you going to say about this you know you it has to be revealed by a prophet someone's got to be a prophet and then every bride member is going to be able to say well yes that person's a that man's a Prophet he's got thus sayi the Lord yes this and this is producing rapturing Faith so either brother Braham has to come back and reveal the Thunders which but I believe he already did reveal the Thunders or a future minor Prophet he's got to be a minor Prophet right because we already had brother Ram come as a major prophet to give us thus say the Lord on the entire Bible revelations all the Mysteries they're called Mysteries have been finished uh and this and then then to me if another man's got to rise up and be a prophet and then reveal seven Mysteries wouldn't this be a sign of the Rapture right it would have to be that's I never even thought about that till right now that's another reason that's 11 reasons right there if a man has to rise up and say thus sayi the Lord here's the revelation of the seven Thunders and that brings rapturing Faith wouldn't that be a sign for the Rapture but what does brother R say brother R says thus say the Lord my Ministry is the last sign to the Gentiles amen Hallelujah there it is brother Jose Glory I love that while you're preaching the word of God God gives you Revelation now I had it on there but I didn't really understand the significance of that glory amen because you got to know these Mysteries to go in the Rapture that's a sign the Rapture is here but God already gave it to us hallelujah I think the spirit of Revelation is here brother Hallelujah the Holy Spirit I hope this is recorded I'm going to forget all this yeah because brother man said there is not another sign to the Gentile that goes higher or greater than this I would think if you bring rapturing Faith that's greater because that's going to change our bodies but said it may grow back limbs that are missing like make them appear put eyes that have been poked out put eyes back in there I mean it can do anything God's spirit can do anything with a rapturing faith faith and the last quote uh okay there's one more yeah now this messenger Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and remember if the Thunders aren't open then your hearts our hearts are not turned yet but my heart's on the word of God number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals so that goes back to that first question are the Seals and the Thunders the same not exactly the seals are the symbols of what happened during the church ages and then of course after with the Jews and then the tribulation and then the Rapture he says it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so he let this be written and and printed before he went off the scene so the Thunders are not revealed our hearts are not turned back that would be awful for me to think of my heart still isn't on the apostolic fathers yet I baptize in the same way they did I've seen these signs file them that believe in Mark 16 I've seen those same signs I preach through all those books of Paul's gospel you know Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians now I'm on Romans I'm preaching Paul's gospel yet my heart's not turned back to Paul's gospel what is my heart on my heart's got to be on the apostolic fathers Hallelujah or else I wouldn't care what the apostles said our whole lives prove we care what the apostles said remember now here's I brought up to this false prophet on the internet uh he actually lives in Ohio too um but brother brandham said thus sayith the Lord in 1965 in anointed ones at the end time he said thus sayith the Lord Malachi 45 and six was already on the earth and the newspapers were already writing about it now that just struck me too if someone has to rise up that means they got to fulfill Malachi 45 and 6 because our hearts are not turned back wow that's another one that's that's 12 reasons I think I'm at 12 now 12 is a good number government of the church 12 New Testament Mysteries 12 tribes of Israel Hallelujah 12 uh Stones Elijah had to put the altar back up there look at that that it just struck me now he's here amen I believe that by God's grace amen you don't hear me say that too often but those those are those are in very very powerful thus say the Lord's statements and that's why I told this guy on the internet he said I've got a double anointing of brother brandham I got a double portion of brother brandham and I'm turning the hearts back I'm like you're crazy dude you're crazy if I I said you can't turn the hearts back because brother Bram already said thus sayith the Lord he was turning them back right and that then and then his ministry with a double portion would be a greater sign than brother Bram now you break that thus sayith the Lord you got a double and I said the Bible interprets itself double portion produce double Miracles so I said you better get started on your prayer lines like brother BR said Joseph would do double times double everything brother BR did that's four times he's got to speak 28 squirrels into existence that's a lot of prayer lines that they got to catch up on they don't have much time to do it Joseph got to do four times and then this supposed brother has got a double anointing the Bible interprets itself he's got to do Twice The Miracles see that's it's just nonsense these people talking about these false prophets nonsense they're deceived but you know what somebody's got to stand against them praise God didn't Jeremiah have to stand there and say fine let believe zedekiah believe haniah whatever you want but God will back up his word hallelujah amen sometimes I wonder why I'm in this Arena all these people blaspheming me call me why am I why I got to stand here well every other man of God had to Hallelujah everybody else had to be mocked and made fun of they made fun of Jeremiah and he suffered way more than I've suffered being thrown in pits and chained up and thinking he's going to die these men suffered greater things than we've suffered but the Bible said he promised in the last days he sent the spirit of Elijah and will call the people the children of God back to the original Faith like it was at the beginning of the word that word was confirmed the son of man the last days is the same as it was at Sodom yesterday today and forever he promised to do it it's God's promise it's thus sayeth the Lord notice they did the same thing just as Moses did till God got enough from it remember so he says it again remember it's thus sayith the Lord it'll come to pass in this day now search the word over take every C take every Clan well we got a lot of them today don't we a lot of cson Clans out there they call themselves message Believers take every man take every church I charge you in Christ's name to do this you preachers I charge you to read the newspapers or take consideration anywhere you want to and see if it isn't on the Earth right now see thus sayeth the Lord twice he tells him and this guy says he's Elijah or he says he's the Elisha of the Elijah I'm sorry there ain't no Elisha after Elijah Malachi 4 sorry see so Malachi 45 and6 is already fulfilled nobody else is going to turn our hearts back because if if they got the revelation of the Thunders that would reveal the seals to us that means the seals aren't even revealed yet my goodness I I don't know I just feel I feel something here today the holy spirit's here today praise God like I didn't even realize that that look at all the if if people miss the truth look what it does it makes the word of God not fulfilled and it makes us looking for somebody else who's and then it makes all these thus say the Lord's wrong but I believe God has proven them right no one's Ro risen up with a uh a Ministry half as brother random maybe a fourth I don't know maybe less I'm not saying I know what I'm saying is nobody spoke like brother random Hallelujah with the thus sayi the Lord in the Bible so Malachi 45 and 6 has already come to pass if the second part of the church age book is the second part of that church age Book quote about the Thunders uh if the first part is fulfilled as well I'm sorry if the second part of of that church a statement is fulfilled the Thunders then the first part is fulfilled as well because you need the revelation of the Thunders in order to have your heart turned back because remember he's got to do two things so he can't turn your heart back until he gets the seals opened everybody see that so if the Thunders haven't sounded yet then we don't have the heart nor do we have we don't have the heart nor do we have the the seals right because the Thunders tell us the seals and the seals turn our hearts back I need to make a graph of this brother amen and put it on the the internet according to this you got to have the Thunders first then you know the seals now you can have rapturing faith and your hearts turned back amen if and if you say the Thunders have not been uttered yet then you don't have any of that you're still way back here oh but let's be right up here where we got rapturing Grace Hallelujah I got the Holy Ghost I'm already glorified Hallelujah I'm looking for the latter rain Hallelujah I got a portion of rap if you have the Holy Ghost you have a portion of rapturing Faith but we're going to need an extra anointing for these change these vile vile bodies and these vile Minds amen all right well I'm glad I Was Here by God's grace um I've already do in about an hour and a half okay um I want to got something else on my heart here let me see here help me Jesus Lord let me look up I want to look up a quote real quick this might help you ah okay so I was looking for a quote um this is and then came Jesus in 1964 B's talking about the Rapture yeah he's said maybe there's a little boy in here tonight or little girl was born in Seattle Washington now that book holds her name he's talking about the Lamb's Book of Life he come to redeem th whose name was on that book redeeming bring back from where it fell from and in the human race she was fallen or a child and she can't accept it right now she's too young so brother brother R was basically talking about getting the last person 's name on The Book of Life to be born again and then the Rapture can go right but remember it's a whole world thing every nation it's got to hear the gospel and have a chance to be born again now here here's what he said you've heard you maybe heard me say this before it's been years brother so the so the church WIll slug right along you ever seen a slug lately we're going to see one in springtime so the church WIll slug right around yet there's other quotes where the church has the power and the authority but to us both work right because we got we have the power we have the authority but it seems like scripture being fulfilled it seems like everything's going real slow we just keep going service after service month after month year after year we keep slugging along until the gospel gets to every single person whose name is on the Lamb's Book of Life so the church WIll slug right along just play along I think play means dance in the Hebrew so that's the way I'm going to interpret that I'm going to dance and praise the Lord hallelujah will you have meeting and so forth till that last person is brought in then that book is closed there's no more added then it's all over until that time will be none of us know but let just keep doing all we can to his glory until the time is over we don't know who that person is it who that person is it may already be in we're just waiting for his coming we don't know it'll never be revealed to man the time of his coming because not even the angels of heaven know when it's going to be but we're just looking for Anytime and waiting watching for his coming and the church said let's stand our feet I better stop right there musicians can come okay so further further things have seemed to open here uh maybe I won't put out that video I was going to put it out maybe this evening uh more implications but I hope everybody can see you know why I I have my convictions where I have my convictions by God's grace and I'm going to share this sermon and if I get the video out I'll share the video with others as well so everybody can kind of critique me if I'm wrong I just want somebody to show me right is that how you feel Bible says you rebuke a wise man he's going to love you he's not going to say you devil I curse you he's say I love you thanks for helping me out by God's grace um can you just play you got a song on your heart brother okay can you play uh Jesus breaks every feder I want to have a time of prayer I first want to see if anyone here wants prayer and then I want to pray for these people um and live streamers love you all God bless you
