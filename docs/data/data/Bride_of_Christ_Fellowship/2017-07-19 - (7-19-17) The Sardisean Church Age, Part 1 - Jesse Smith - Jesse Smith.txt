[Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Revelation chapter 3 verse 1 like to begin the starlit Sardis church into that region Church partner so our ancient church age we look at that tonight about the grace of the Lord I think you'll be blessed I really enjoy preparing this morning over be a blessing Revelation chapter 3 verse 1 I believe it six verses it's a little bit of shorter to church age far as the number of verses they set the timer here after tonight that grace of more just so you're aware I don't know if you noticed earlier but we had things a little different Wednesdays and next Thursday on the midweek we're trying to do all you little youth group the children be able to order now and Sunday mornings it's a hard for everybody to get here so we're just gonna try to be a little youth group like a little Bible study for the kids 5:30 to 6:30 on Wednesdays but next week we Thursday so if you come here though early and we're in here that's probably what's going on by the grace but John I had never talked it we thought that might be a good thing to get the young younger people okay growing up turn into teenagers minister directly to them so we got a good time today in the Lord enjoyed that by the grace of Lord so Revelation chapter 3 it's the first one let's just read verse one together because we're not going to really get as far as I have been planned to get to any other verses just the beginning the first one revelation 3 verse 1 let's begin on three one two three and under they the church in Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know that it works that now has a pain that now within us let's go for Lord another word of Prayer you know your heart just maybe even if you got heavenly father we love you tonight Lord we are your chosen sea though we believe that with all of our hearts Lord I believe what all of us can say we need not go looking for you or you came looking for us yes there was a little hunger in our hearts to find you but the Bible says really no man who seeks God it is God who seeks after and it is God who leaves the 99 to go get the one dear God thank you for coming to get me thank you lord each of us could say that thank you for coming to find us to choose us and bring us back to the fold that we might bring forth fruit in this season of our lives more we're grateful Lord I think the jose starting another year Lord of his life and my daughter Lauren at each of us Lord God you have all we have Lord for the kingdom of God then it's increase our love increase our worship and dedication Lord God let us give all we have for you are so great and gracious to us Lord you rescued us you went and found us that's O Lord we want to give you all of our lives yeah help us to be a hundredfold as we heard Lord from the scripture be with us and I administered every need Lord God even and these are those services where we're teaching on Church ages true they can mean everything Lord God we're mindful of that we're aware of that I listen to our heart and have faith and pour on the Word of God in Jesus Christ's name sir said mrs. Benson praise the Lord now if I'm ready I have some I have all the quotes I believe I'd like to mention tonight ready to go this week I just finished Revelation chapter 1 so I don't know I got a like from a demonic patient on Facebook sent somebody else gave me like so I appreciate that so if you I'm going to do a review of every chapter the book of Revelation so I've already got some good feedback on the Surrency one brother from salvadore emailed me and said Oh Jessie our pastor was in like a little debate it was another pastor did believe Surrency and he said when you posted your sermon see video it was just what he needed to go meet this gentleman in debates I don't know if I don't know if he convinced to get rich or not but he just said it was very timely so I thank the Lord that it was time I just want to be right on time I know he's always on time even when I'm late he's on time Adam I just cruciate that testimony somebody overseas said you know thank god you're anointed for this hour at each door praise the Lord what else could I do what else what else what I want to do other than stay in God's Word it's all very thankful for that let's do this tonight July 19th here very thankful for another opportunity to be in the house of Lord we just did verse 1 we're not going to get down there probably not the grace of the Lord so I like to start with the summary Graham just gives a brief summary so it's on the Ephesian Church age he said the Church of Sardis was the Reformation in so just keep down your minds the age of the Protestant Reformation he said now you corrects himself he started saying great missionary that was actually the Philadelphia Church he said or not he said but the hidden names they had their own names this was an age of Reformation but notice it wasn't restoration but Reformation right not not restoration everything wasn't restored that's our day aren't you mad living that day I'm glad to live in this day I'm glad to live in a day a full restoration of the Word of God but they just had some reforms some things were changed major things like idolatry of course was changed look at that tonight some of those things but this is how program summarizes Reformation and they had their own name so a lot of the church age people started following different ones like John Calvin Martin Luther and they said I'm a loser I'm a Calvinist so that was part of the mistake this is a age where they didn't have a full word so they still followed men they still denominator around men after a while the church age did so but they had some pretty off pretty amazing rewards white raiment which the righteousness of Jesus crisis its eternal life it's the clothing of eternal life the name of the book which we know a huge portion of the church age book is on the book of life I think it's like 20 21 pages I think it's the most doctrine is the doctrine that has the most pages in all the church age book is the book of life and then yeah okay then they said okay now he talks about the book of life down the fifth church age Sardis went from 1520 to 1750 eighty-two messenger Luther and you live from 1483 to 1546 there's your star close up then there's your your circle of light they're very little light and there's the full picture from the church age book of the search ages so I'm pretty happy now I've already pre-selling to see it and now I'm on the fifth one so I only got two more to go really I'll probably to preach a brief review sermon of that once and try to bring into today again to look at those things we preached throughout later see in 2015 these are 2017 so we got Sardis and Philadelphia hopefully we'll finish it in 2017 unless we can let that go some other direction so this is just the overview I have ten years run alone here so if you ever see something wrong please correct me but I had these years wrongs had to fix that here and easier so this age was not even 250 years so it's around a short shorter age compared to the fire to your church age now show this one last week I just worked on this one you have all the church ages down here all the names all the messengers how long the church age lasted but here's what I added I added all the major attacks of Satan so sake will first get you to do deeds without a doctrine right and then he'll get the church to become a synagogue of Satan and then they'll have their own false doctrines and then the spirit of Jezebel comes in there which is a false prophetess seducing sphere a woman dominating woman spirit lead the church and then it brought a dame than living a name with dead they had a Danish but not the life of Christ the full life yet the synagogue of Satan in Philadelphia and it ends with people that go to church but Christ is outside the church right so that state is greatest deception to get people in a house of what they think is salvation but they themselves don't know salvation they're not saved and the annoying things last about this love the way the only thing sorry my deleting laughs it's about here because this is where rom 3:12 this is where Satan gets power of church and state and he can start killing people you know the Pope's can kill people because they control the state government and that lasts until right around here where they start the indulgences is pretty heavy that's the kind of church capturing the wealth of the world did they still kill yes they still kill but the focus was off of the killing and now more on the money naturally in the wealth of the world because you have scale balances you know and then of course all three of these spirits evil spirits white red black combined into the pale horse rider but all God's holiness combines into us amen the flying ego praise the Lord now the city of Sardis was the fifth city here in modern-day Turkey now we've spent a little bit of time on Sardis just sort of a type because some of these things aren't interesting there was a capital of ancient Lydia it passed from the hands of Lydia and monarchs to the Persians and that's the allocator the great so you know we know those Babylon meets a Persians Greeks so this was controlled by the means of Persians and the Greeks the kings of Pergamos then succeeded to the Dominion until the Romans took over cleave in Rome in the type of Tiberius was decimated by earthquakes and plagues today it's a heap of ruins and other than habited the city was at one time very important commercially I skip that whole paragraph because it didn't really relate to the things that I felt led to preach tonight I want to look at the religion of Sardis this is really interesting I think you'll I think you can understand it a little better if I go through this a little slower the religion of this city was the impure worship of the goddess side Elms just a side note Cybele because I don't know how to say I'll say stop felt like oh who's it the massive ruins of the temple may still be seen you'll recall that the pergamene age I mentioned that the Babylonians concept of mother and son known as semi radius and nightís became the Sai belly and do iose of Asia the attributes attached to these two are most enlightening as we view them side by side so you say let's put these two mother Sun worship patterns let's put them side-by-side I noticed he the man or the sudden was the son of God was the Sun God she was the moon goddess he was lord of heaven she was the queen of heaven the son was the revealer of goodness and true she was of gentleness and mercy he was the mediator she was the mediators now how about those because those are exact words the Roman Catholic Church uses for Mary how many understand that is it's the exact word she's called the Queen of Heaven she's called the mother of God even and the Bible says God has no mother right let's see they don't have a revelation of message so they can't understand that but we did amen thank God for the message he was the key that opens and shuts the gates of the miserable world that's actually Jesus stole that from Jesus and she was identical keep doing likewise he has the judge of the Dead she is standing on the side he being killed race and ascended into heaven she'd been carried their bodily by the Sun now those are the those are the things they have in common those two mother son worships they have those in common and they all have them in common with the Roman Catholic Church now in role this same God is given the title of our Lord he's called the Son of God why he's while she has called the mother of God so the words all the Roman Catholic Church did was take those same attributes and apply them to Jesus and Mary okay but would Jesus and Mary good of course no one was good to Jesus right he's the one that was really good so they take true characters of the Bible Mary Jesus but then they give them pagan identifications right so they put pagan definitions on true characters godly people of course and Jesus is not in flesh now and that is what we find back in our the other two ages where the mother and son concept on such tremendous proportions but now I notice that even as it was back in Babylon that the worship of the Suffolk and to lose out in favor of the worship of the mother so she literally began to take the place of the son oh mercy they started out worshiping the Sun you see that but slowly over time Satan wasn't content but he slowly changed it to where the woman gets worship that's why you and I have to be able to see now it's our lives falling away from anything slowly we have to be a look at our lives and see as my life changed for the better the worst in the last six months there it's my life in the last year am i closer to Christ or more in love with Christ in the last year we have to be able to see that because these people could not see the slow gradual move and just as the pastor's deceive ever slowly that they just went right along with it we can't have that we must let no man deceive us I hoped I would never use me to deceive but if I would say something wrong don't let me know believe it right no matter who does the prank comes in here or sign thinner you know man end of in we're going to make mistakes but our your hearts we say the right thing believe it with all your heart but if there's anything that's wrong then don't accept that pray and bring it before of us because we all want to be right I want to be right I've got to stand before God to answer for this church and I want to say everything I've preached that I knew was the right thing don't you husband's want to answer for your families and your wives and say Lord I let my wife as faithful as I could notice when I do that oh my how I want to do that but see over time it was tied tied deceived them so we have to see our lives becoming more like Christ in time we see in this age of the pagan worship of Sardis was the worship of the woman so we have that even increased today it is cybela alone that side belly and do a house the mother has literally taken the place of the Sun and down with the merits of the Godhead because now she's the mother of God she's abode continent all we need to do is go over her various titles to recall that lovely attributes accorded marry by the Roman Catholic to understand where the religionists age came from now can I take a break and I show you about a little video real quick on Mystery Babylon has everybody watched it yeah my children wants to be good much my children have him okay I want to show it then by God's grace I didn't know if I had no watch it but I want to I want to show it again on the grace of God I think it's good for all of us to see them sorry okay I want you to see these titles again 65 verse 2 says shall all flesh cup the CCC specifically teaches okay so see this is the number you can the book is all by paragraphs you can go right in that book and there's the paragraph that said that saying pray to Mary to have her talk to the son for us she no nothing like that Jerry spit but this is as they make a name to see over almost 2 million people or the Roman Catholic Church and they're deceived because they don't even read the Word of God right now see that's that's why we're thankful doesn't that make you thankful that you are not worshiping a woman goddess tonight but that make you think oh my goodness my parents and I'm sorry I might get my parents used to go to County church my brothers were baptized and sprinkling as a babies in the Catholic Church I'm so glad God had called us out of there I think I caught us a Pentecostal church because it had less abominations yes it had cutting hair and makeup and they cross-dressing and abominations like that but they got it was it to this level because this is the mother of abominations she has the most of hominins now let's go a little bit a little bit more here on Mary Jewish protection that fateful fly they may fly to the mother of God what the Bible teaches that Jesus alone is able to save us with his intercession Hebrews 7:25 wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them the worship of the Virgin Mary the CCC truly defines Mary the mother of Jesus which is another form of idolatry the CCC states that Mary is the building and it was preserved free from all stain an original City everybody see how that's to lie down treat all holy one that's only Jesus it can be nobody else but they they put taking these pagan goddesses and given all their ideas about the pagan goddess isn't applied to Mary Mary's not the problem they're the problem right the demons that are 1902 do this they're the problem right and then free from all stain of original sin I mean she she never had to send her members when there's no scripture for that because all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God amen this is my enemy so it's so important static at the church they have the steam on experience of women worship in their church that's why we harm that's why I mean rarely go in there let's we have to do for a wedding right that's over another week we just go behind their guests that place is full of unclean spirits Jesus the CCC exam area our God for she's a tight Oh God and Queen over all things she was also said to have a saving office and programmatic or intercession continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation she's to be incorrect under the titles of an advocate for benefactors and mediators God is the only Savior there is no scripture for Mary saving anyone at any time or any place I'm gonna stop right okay my God's grace I'm not I just want you to hear that a fresh all holy one mother of God mediator she's invoked that's nothing but a straight-leg you listen it's not against the individuals writers we love individuals it's against the system and the demons behind that system I want you to see that again this is what people and they call themselves Christians right and they're sweet people aren't they there's they're wonderful people they're against abortion I've been there gets murdered praise God they got for that most of our against homosexuality right there sweet people but they're very deceived so if our eyes are open and say let me should pray God use us as a light the witness amen like I said across the couch for my mom - Sarah's gonna said mom don't you ever go into that room we count the church she's the one that's gonna write the Beast I said mine was your is your denomination with the Word of God and she said she eventually said this my denomination is following away from the Holy Spirit I thought my church let's look at our church now is our church following the way for the Holy Spirit are we being obedient to the Holy Spirit for what I've seen about what we're preaching a living we're obeying the Holy Spirit praise God if not somebody come to tell me about it I need to know praise the Lord see we're following the leadership of the Holy Spirit we need to be more consecrated yes we certainly did we certainly do but God would help us do that because that takes it death to self now just say no so listen this is they're they're giving us a up they're getting us a chart here mother son worship in Babylon was the semi rammus tinnitus in agent with Cybele Ian and di offices which is Sarris now but Ramsey says this two things really struck me with force as I looked into this worship upside Valley one was the fact that she worked like janus which gave her the same authority as Janus Keita had a nerve from the mysteries and the fact that the worst FERS whip themselves up to blood spurt spurts from their bodies which thing is done right today by the Catholics who feel that are suffering like the Lord I've ever seen that where the Catholics hurt themselves I was listening to brother Craig give his missionary report from the Philippines and he said he was there over Easter and he watched Catholics go down the street and whip themselves carry crosses and their bloody and they're going all down the street they're trying to partake of the sufferings of Christ the wrong way what is this where's they want to do it's another form of male worship where the male worshipers cut themselves God doesn't want us to cut ourselves God wants us suffers are hearty not our bodies that wants to cut off the circumcision of the flesh David head the excess flesh of the heart that's what God would say then a hard guy would be able to be cut it and form and shape and make more like enemy men but see they take it natural when Jesus said it me needs to be done spiritual sees that same female experiment that woman worship and that Sun worship that gets in the people to cut themselves and hurt themselves and make them suffer like that the fact that this is the age of the first real break with power ohms you know that sorry this is the first real break from papal Rome the other ones were going to mix he said it that actually flourished this is the first break that flourished because Martin Luther's work flourished Lord no doubt caused the Jezebel prophetess to consolidate and emphasize her doctrine of Mary Allah tree in the sighted opposition to the Protestants who denied her any part whatsoever the plan of salvation apart from her favor with God as the virgin chose to bear the babe as Luther crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith they held to work spent prayers and other unscriptural meetings so this is the first age where the Christians really broke free from the papal system and because of that she's I'm okay then let's let's make our empire stronger than ever we got all those people out let's make it stronger let's go full bar with bear that's what they did that's the free Christians glorified the Sun that's what we did right you are my Christ the Roman Catholics increase their deification of Mary until the 20th century saw in opposition to the most high rate enrollment theologians Pope Pius literally exalt Mary's a glorification resurrected but this happened during brother Graham's life it was 1952 look it up it's called the Assumption of Mary Pope Pius Day the new assumption he made a new doctrine that Mary never died she was raptured that's basically what they mean look it up you could leave nothing look it up on Wikipedia the Britannica in 1950 that Pope without a rule said this is the truth Mary was fractured that there's not a bit of evidence for that in the Bible there's nothing in the Bible about that that doctrine is absolutely the Babylonia SH one of the Sun carrying the mother bodily into heaven so that's about that morning idea mother carrying the Sun to heaven that's really get that idea and I told you about this next slide look at this this is from Twitter I'm not on Twitter but this is the Pope on Twitter this is the Pope space seem down there and this is from my house browsing the internet today and I had this thought this was at 11:38 this morning on September 2nd 2014 the Pope said this the Christian who does not feel that the Virgin Mary is her his or her mother is the orphan remember I preached that if you don't feel Mary as your mom then he said your fatherless like to say your father misspoke because you're rejecting the true father right you're having a parent that's outside of God the Father and the very first comments are these men they're like where exactly does the Bible teach that like that that's one thing I like about Twitter I'm not on it but that's one of the you can tweet right back to them and they can either ignore it or you know I'm I like that they can remake it reject somebody's idea and he said it's Jesus through the Holy Spirit who will not leave us as orphans I like that jesus said is it more than I go away that the Holy Ghost would come so the Holy Ghost can be with you even in you that's our parents our parent company doesn't stay away our calm down and listen up say dad how did the video just like I want my teachings of Linda Malachi I want my teacher to limit Lydia the case show and I'm part of my life to live in them same thing with God but God's is much greater amen because if my life visit them it have to be the Holy Spirit amen that's how we want the Holy Spirit to live it up so I show you these things are not made up these are true they suddenly put these things out there and then they make a man of the year and then every Protestant and remember Rick Warren says oh he's all of our past you know he said he's all of our Pope my whatever when I show that video my wife caught that I missed it Rick Warren says our Pope I like to say publicly he's not my Pope I have one Pope and if I have a vote the father that is Jesus Christ God the Father we have a father Pope you'll be the Godfather his PO means father right so jesus said call no man father Paul desert that's why our heavenly father is the only father we have amen you see that's you see the perversion here they hide behind this mask of holiness just so pure but behind it is that same demon spirit that was in jessabelle exactly right the same gods she worship and the goddesses that same spirit is in them because they teach the same false doctrine that's right no wonder this fifth age comes right along with the other ages and will do so until ends in the lake of fire come on listen this is the false church now we're the horner children are killed the second death there it is Mary Allah truth the worship of Cybele II by the way my man sir this did you know it know that Cybele ii was done and start teeth and Jezebel was priestess to and caused his gonna stumble by the license just rights and she conducted yes that is who she was in the Bible so got your Bibles go to first Kings 18 if you got your Bible I'll come back this first Kings 1819 we'll come back to that I want to show this why you're in there first Kings 1819 so this the base of this chart shows the same thing the same demon that Babylon worship names Maris was the same even at the the Saints are the sinners of Sardis worship in Asia outside belly that's the same demon that Jezebel worship in the goddess called a starchy I think I'm saying that right if I'm not forgiving and I couldn't find who a starchy son was when I read it on Wikipedia is said that she had like 77 or 80 sons I don't know I couldn't find this the promised son that came out of her but I know for sure the Bible says that that's who she works because I'm gonna show it to you now just so you know the Mayo was the major male deity of the Phoenicians in Canaanite so we're gonna read a scripture that talks about fail and the Groves what grows means Astarte so I'll explain that just a minute there's nothing up here if you go into the Greek lexicon so if you're reading revelation 2:20 and you click on jessabelle here's what it says in the lexicon Jezebel means chaste look at that Jezebel would've been such a nice name for Christians but because she didn't live her name now we can't use that name anymore that's a good name then the Bible say we're gonna be a chaste virgin to Christ that means totally consecrated Christ I like it I believe I have a chaste virgin to Christ but too shady that just about took that name and I've heard of that name because now we don't want that name because spirits go with names that's my good name of Ricky and Elvis and all kinds of nonsense like that because the meanies names have meanings we don't want patty needs of names so Jezebel being chaste was the wife of a I'm king of Israel she was a Phoenician princess the daughter of a king of the zygonians in her hands her husband became a mere puppet look at the first effect of her influence was the media establishment of the Phoenician worship on a grand scale on the core of a half and her table no less than 450 prophets of male and 400 of Ernest Astarte let's remember that she had 400 prophets of Astarte a woman goddess so these prophets would pray to that woman God is just like the Roman Catholic priest pray to Mary I read speech first can you see the head can you see that they're praying to the same demon gonna race you think we all say amen amen they're Catholic priests when they pray to Mary or any Catholic when they pray to Mary I actually tried to this demon goddess we'd say this this unclean spirit that goes by the name of a star teeth and Cybele knee and his tardiness charge another name of this floor okay so here's our scripture you got your bodice you can read your Bible now therefore sending gathered to be on Israel in the amount of caramel and the prophets of mail 450 and the prophets of the Groves now that groves means that star T and we're showing that next 400 which eat at Jezebel's table so that's what Elijah said you've got 450 from Vail and you've got 400 from the groves and here's the Hebrew word for groves right here look who it is this is a Greek word ash a rah-rah which is Babylonian for a start T so brother said that's exactly what it is the word growth can be translated as these words give me a starchy it can be goddesses images or sacred trees so that's where my dad said did you know he said that side Valley that was worship in Sardis was the same evil spirit that Jezebel worship so see how to eat with number nine Church I'm so glad the Holy Spirit doesn't die Amen because it's living to me tonight by God's grace amen how do you how do I know because I'm led to the word this year we'll never gonna settle never take you out of the word amen right let's see the same demon in Jezebel now in the Roman Catholic Church and Jesus said that woman Jezebel right called the Roman Catholic Church and woman Jezebel okay so now I'm going to close to this and I got about 20 minutes so I that's my closing pretty minute right close the look at the age of the messenger tonight by the grace of the Lord now I've never preached if so to me it's you I've read the book before but I hope it's new to you I hope there's some sense oh this is kind of new unless you just read it but even if you just read it it's a good refresher crazy for example I never came to my crib and I never came Church and regretted come I've been thankful every time I've ever come gosh and why is I know God's grace is here amen amen and though the ages of God are here and there recorded by a thoughts that they recorded my prayers make out for that and also crisis receiving my worship even in glory so this we know that age lasted from fifteen twenty seventeen fifty is the age of Reformation ours of the ancient restoration amen the measure of the age is the best known messenger of all time can you believe that I had a hard time believe that was sin Paul but he said he's the best known messenger of all time that's shocking to me but Lorraine said it I believe it he was Martin Luther Martin Luther was a brilliant scholar of gentle disposition he was starting to be a lawyer when the lingering illness and death of a dear friend caused him to become serious concerning the spiritual condition of his life he entered the Augustinian convent at your firt in 1505 there he studied philosophy house for the word of God now I want to give you a little look at his life okay here's Sardis Philadelphia later to see it okay he was born a little bit before the age and you see that he was born 14 14 83 so before the age start a little bit before the age started but he lived into the beginning of the age now John Wesley is the same way John Wesley was before was born a little bit before the folded up from an age started but brother Branham was born right with the age started he was born exactly right his three years after the age started right right right you're there so so we can see the pattern throughout the church ages now the church age messenger generally came at the beginning of the age when you see that general remember it was only Columba that was born even died before the church age started but right before and so his influence directly went into the church age because he he converted the whole nation of Scotland so his influence was major he had a major influence there now am Arthur lived the life of the severest penance but all of his outward actions could not banish his since he was a Roman Catholic but he just always felt sinful he said i tormented myself to death to make peace with God but I was in darkness and found it not the vicar general of his order stop nits helped him to gain the inside that his salvation would have to be the experience of an inner work rather than a ritual with this encouragement he further sought God later he became a priest as yet he was not saved this is this interesting church he did all the studying of a priest he did all the rituals of a priest yet he never felt peace with God in his heart praise the Lord you can go through all the motions you go through all the religious acts but salvation is something you can feel don't worry forgiveness is something we should feel are you with me turned on you should feel it tonight if your diary should still feel I feel happy not forgiving right even if we're worn out from the day we should still feel peace with God amen we shouldn't feel a war between us and God we should feel peace with God amen because he could have filled that he couldn't feel it because he wasn't justified yet oh I just think this is powerful to me now I already read this one right on his return military yeah looks like a copy yeah I can't be IKEA so I copied some of the same stuff there okay so yeah this purse was copied sorry sorry here he became an avid in deep student of the word and then the great theological works extent he was sought out as a teacher preacher for his depth of knowledge and great sincerity to fulfill a vow he had made himself he went to Rome there he saw the futility of the churches imposed works that were to bring salvation and the Word of God struck to his heart hope in his heart and said the just shall live by faith on his return home the evangelical truth of this scripture flooded his mind and he was set free from sin and born the king who got how many know how many times the judge saw that my paintings in the Bible more times the just shall live by faith is listed four times in the Bible once in the back and three times the New Testament the Josh under by page so he must been readin Habakkuk and he must have read Romans and Galatians and Hebrews because those are the four books you find that in the just shall live by faith amen soon after this he was elevated to Doctor of Divinity and commissioned to devote his whole life to study and faithfully expound and defend the holy scripture this he did and with such a fact that his heart and the hearts of those around him were deeply fixed upon the truth of the word the word soon came into open conflict with abuses of church creeds and doctrines I don't know about you but when you first got saved how many felt like a brand new person I did I let me just share my testimony and justification can I you know most of you know I've shared it I went to a ethics and action conference and they had all these people worshiping you know with a colleague on the screen and I saw a six foot six redheaded Ohio State football defensive lineman raising his hands crazy guy and I felt this big I felt so ashamed of myself because I knew I should have been serving God and I was running from God I ran from God for 19 years and I looked at that man I started crying so shame on me I'll never do it again and I left my way to the boundary right there by God's grace as soon as I got hold back to Akron Ohio I just rolled by Snoop Dogg and country music and I took not all my Jennifer Lopez pictures and Jennifer Aniston and I threw everything away and I was sold out for Jesus from that moment amen and I went home to Liberty center and I was so on fire that at least two or three people gave their heart to Christ just because I became a Christian one of them was Tim Byers glory he's still preaching the message today because I because I knew what it was like and you know what I'm talking about if you're saying you know it's like to have all the burden of sin leading you and now you're forgiven and you feel peace with Almighty God and then another one a Scott Overmyer he was the bestest for a while but he's not the message anymore but we're praying that he comes back in by the grace of Lord he still goes to church and another I forgot the other but they called me and said I can't believe you're a Christian I want to become a Christian because you are and that as the same thing happened to Martin Luther he got so on fire for God that's that initial can I say that the initial I just say justification fired can I say that because it wasn't a Holy Ghost fire so I'm still doing things I shouldn't have done that a Holy Ghost cool person that won't do because it's been added so that first justification fire was so hot that it brought other people to Christ and that's what we should see in our lives our love and our joy in our peace toward God should be so inspiring to us that people should see the love of God in our lives amen don't worry just like last Wednesday remember the poor fools of God love the height of God's love the width of God's love the depths of God's love right and the deepness of God's love in them the length of God's love God's love is so great we should be overwhelmed with the love of God I know the realm of God's love is I think then you should feel God's love in your heart like it's not make peace with him and repent get it right we should feel the peace of God and I've enlisted this week you know Mom summer vacation so I have a lot of extra free time so this week what I've been traveling I've been listening to people that have left the message they have a whole new website where they do a what's it called a podcast that's the word so it's like a radio and they do an online radio and they interview all the people that left a message like Geoff Jenkins and everyone and I've been listening to these people all week and some of them say things like and one of them got interviewed that even be used to be a part of our church is on there it used to come to our church but I want to reach out and love to that as well I already have you know some of their family I've reached out in love but what I'm hearing from different people not somebody's do but different people are saying oh there's no love in the message churches and then they don't even rejoice in salvation and they don't even rejoice when people get saved but church at our church we should rejoice in the love of God I can't I can't I can't be in other message churches but I can be here and I'm the one that preaches the most here so I'm gonna preach that Jesus Christ died for sinners of whom I am chief that we might be sanctified and filled with the love of God amen and then we in our love should have such a love for people we should long to reach out and share the gospel in hey then we should love our enemies we should love those that leave the message like these ones I'm talking about I've reached out to them we should love them we should reach out to them we should have bag off them and bash them now that we have to rebuke that demon spirit yes I've got to rebuke that aside that least fear I got a rebuke that very Allah tree spirit but my prayer for doing that is that sinners will come out and be saying amen that's why we do that so sinners can see the spirits behind their actions that's why we do that but this were not any of my experience the Word of God flooded your mind amen the message of the hour flooded your mind and it costs you to burn with such a light that people start wondering what happened to you amen that's the real gospel it's good news to you right the gospel is good news to you glory under the video it was the best news I ever received him in the gospel Jesus Christ glory now he says thus when Leo the tenth became Pope and John Tetzel came to sell abilities of her sin Luther had no choice but to rise up against his anti scriptural teaching first he thundered from the pulpit against it and then he wrote his famous 95 pcs which on October 31st 1517 he nailed to the door of the castle Church right so look he was trying to stay in the church but when the church got outside the word what he had to do again to leave the church so even he had the experience come out of her my people than to be not partakers of her sins in plagues praise God she tried to reach out love he tried to change the system from the inside that's exactly right okay this is the real reason to celebrate October 31st not for Hallows even but for the Reformation amen that's the day you got you got to be happy on October 31st now for Halloween before the day Martin Luther the best zone of all messengers took a stand on the Word of God amen and started what we're joined today he started but we have today religious freedom and religious truth about salvation I have you got your salvation amen it started on October 31st when he come out of there and stood against the Roman Catholic system amen that's why I told the woman had told my secretary after school I said if they've changed and they get rid of the Halloween name and they caught harvest day I'll dress up as Martin Luther I'll do that because he was a godly man I'll dress up as the Lord Jesus dressed up as William random and they'd just get rid of Halloween and all the evils that go along with that and they want to have a harvest a celebration I'm just like a month you have to do that because that's remembering a godly man that's for a minute that's remembering a star in the hand of Christ amen born or Luther had his faults we know that he was against Jews he'd have a revelation of the VRC good Robyn and he did some other things that were off we drank wine and they're great to be here whatever but for the word that he knew he got annoyed by the spirit for what he could know in his day and then he shined it as a light and people's lives were changed by the gospel that he preached amen and that's what I want that's why he's my preaching those two it changes hearts to love the gospel of Jesus in it I don't see the whole lot but what I do I thank God for it amen hallelujah now a short time Germany was ablaze and the Reformation was on now let it be remember the Martin Luther was not the only one in there protesting the Roman Catholic Church there was a lot of protestors he was just the most successful one and probably the most famous one there were there was a lot of people that went against the Catholic Church and thank God for all others he was one of many yes others had denied the Pope's their self granted temporal and spiritual power and even amongst the Pope's there were minor temporary reforms yes there were many others who raised issues but in the case of Luther God's time was right for Deford and move that would be the beginning of the restoration see he was the ending of the restoration of the church une outpouring of the Holy Ghost at a much later day aren't you glad to be men brother branham said open up said this in the rapture message do you remember it he said if Luther was alive today he'd be in our church Noorie John Wesley was alive for those a he'd be sitting in this church he probably preaches you know because he preached at 5 a.m. every day there's a real fan of God dedicated and committed like that MA why because they believe the Holy Spirit for their day they get it crucify the Holy Ghost for their day they believe it so that means they would have believed the Holy Ghost Farrar day that means they would have said amen to brother Branham amen just like my brother preaches the word out when he preaches that word we can say Amen and that's exactly the true interpretation of the word of God Jack you're right but now remember not every word brother ran was dusting the Lord okay not every word and I think we don't have to be were mature enough to know that but when he preached that word and it's right there in the word that's God talking to a man and so we stand upon that pathetic word hallelujah remember I know he's a prophet because three of them happen to fulfill in our day right the first one is rock and roll the previous a bride the American church dance and half-naked smoke and he says it's cigarette smoking where they cut their hair dancing rock'n'roll we can see that today the second one he said he says don't never be a greater minister to the Gentiles thought saith the Lord look at that none of these guys can compare though these TV preachers didn't even come close to mother man the third one he said thus saith the Lord there would never be a denomination break up this denomination and come back to the word and that's fulfilled they won't break up in fact they keep getting more than they keep that letting more Synod they people anymore comes in they keep raised in the bar so that more goats get in the church with me alright so he was the beginning of the restoration so Martin Luther start the Reformation brother Branham glycans and unto a seed like a plant Martin Luther's little sprout that shoots out of the ground he's the sprout before that it looked like the church was then right in the Thyatira church ain't but now springs forth and sorry got life good now you can see life aren't you glad we're not we're not the shoot though we're supposed to be the seed we're supposed to be that original seed how that I did that went down in the ground where that original seat made live again amen now Martin Luther himself was a sensitive spirit-filled Christian he was definitely a man of the word for he had not only had a profound passion to study it but to make it available in all I'm sorry to all in order that he that all might live by it Marvo to this he translated the New Testament and gave it to the people this laborious work he did himself correcting a passage as much as 20 times he gathered around him a group of Hebrew scholars amongst whom are Jews and translated no Testament does anybody ever read a book that's this thick before Martin Luther wrote he translated a book this this thing that's how much that's how badly he wanted to have aware you go to have the word write for a greatest day that's how bad he wanted the Jesse Smith of his day to have the Word of God now what should we do if we've got the word we should send this unit me like what we're doing we should that's why that's why I make video and that's why I go over the same things burning up but just try to pack it write it out and preach it in a way that people can understand I'm the woman well a recent woman said I never understood modesty until you taught it she said it took your teaching for me to understand she said this should be taught in every church and so see he had a deep cause to the deep years ago to know about Bible modesty nobody was in the Holy Spirit preaching it to her until I got in the Holy Spirit to teach that it wasn't me but it was me getting at the Holy Spirit no other person could teach that to her it took some nobody on the YouTube to do that just like Martin Luther it was using nobody God just took a nobody somebody who has a burden to do a work for God and God bless them that's my church if you got a bird for Christ's great about it give yourself wholly to it no matter how hard it is no matter how many years it takes do it because it's God's work for you to do amen it's your labor I can't imagine writing a book this thick but this is what he did because he loves the people and if you love and if I love other people will labor for other people such a great testimony that such a man of God he would labor to get the people who heard of gun this vital work of Luther is still the work upon which all successes work subscription sure can't arrest me because I miss that means this book rests upon Luther's Luther's book is not at the bottom here and then we lay this one on top right this is the first one in the English I'm sorry I'm sorry the first one in German he got the Word of God in German to the people and then you've got up on that with John Wycliffe and all these guys here we come King J and now King James is on top and now we got in their own language but Luther is the foundation are too bad for her foundation I believe it was blessing rose guys love that in him how firm a foundation we have holiday via now these words really small I'm sorry I had to make them fit on here I'm sorry we just talked about the life of Martin Luther he was a mighty preacher teacher of the word and insisted especially in his first years of public evidence that the word was the sole criterion got to be the word thus he was against works as a means of salvation and baptism as a means of regeneration he taught the mediation of Christ apart from man as he was the original I'm sorry as was the original and Pentecostal concept he was a man given a much prayer and had learned that the more work had to do the more solely he was pressed for his time the more misguided gave to God in prayer in order to ensure satisfactory results isn't that a pretty to less than you learn and just like the lessons of the Thyatira church age the more you have to do the more you need to pray right as time goes on what programs say the secret to serving God was increasing your service these are secrets and these are things church I thought my heart listen these are things these things just fly over people's heads most people because they don't increase their service to Christ and they don't increase their prayers you can everybody see that that's why I think these are so Lord that's why the church ages are so hard he drives all these little nuggets and secrets in here that if we apply these to our lives will become more like Christ we won't become lukewarm Wolf's a hawk on fire is behaving what's easy kept again like these sermons these little Wednesday night you know turn tape sermons you can't let these two become common because we'll miss with the Holy Spirit saying to the churches Oh Graham said if you can't hit you know other things he said a little right over your top of the head and all the other he said the rapture will way over top your head if you can't catch it in these small little things like oh I'm more busy I better make sure that I'm praying today I've got the busy day today I better make sure I pray now how many would say help me learn my hands up we all say that well I'm gonna try with there oh I got a lot of work today we should all raise our hands say God help me man help me to put prayer first I've got more work to do lord I pray for the results right now bless me as I go on this busy day bless me Jesus be with me an audience a nice service you know he has such a zeal to do prayer to Christ martyr do it was to battle with the devil and said the Satan one day visibly appeared to him and he flung the inkwell item bidding him go tonight another time to fanatics came to him to induce him to join with them in banishing all priests and Bibles he discerned the spirit within them and set them off Simon and cam I was talking with Simon this weekend when he was here preaching they both remember seeing demons at our house growing up and I remember them telling me as boys I remember them telling you they saw demons in our closet and I remember I remember them telling you that was 30 years ago and I remember them so God has even let my brother see demons and be able to withstand the cameras going to people's houses pray for them and been able to sense the demons around him his sermon oh by the way around September September 17th I told you guys that he'd be out so we have new coming in September by God Gracie looking part of that by the grace of the Lord let's see this is what we have to understand that our prayers will move the demons back so we got to pray right away in the morning how many believe that time it'll move the demons back and he got so bad he threw into the devil MA I like to throw it's written at the devil it's rented it's regular anyone throw that at the devil the blood of Jesus Christ stands between you and I saying today amen that's what we needed throwing it to that's okay if you threw but we want to throw the Word of God it's written man it's recorded knock dr. Martin Luther and solvers in history 93 page 406 he was a prophet evangelist speaker tongues interpreter in one person and now with all nine gifts of the Spirit all nine that's why I believe somebody here may have you the gift of tongues interpretation that's two of them you know someone might have wisdom I know God has healing in my administer I believe that gift is probably present in my life cuz that seen so many people healed should say so many but numerous people get over the years and we started up pretty soon church and we get this appear we could have all night here by God's grace and that's what we want we want to see God we want to see God and then the other man said you gotta come you know gotta come and sacrifice and primarily yeah and then come on y'all create home gotta pray ask for the whole leading of the Holy Spirit so god help us to do that help us to learn that still my prayer for the church and we can learn to come early pray sanctify ourselves pray more o Almighty that he did the busier we get make sure we pray now what stirred is heart by the Holy Ghost and which was the little green shoes now here's her program says Luther was a little green shoot it was that truth was coming back to the church as it was known at Pentecost was the doctrine of justification salvation by grace apart from works forgive me I recognize that dr. Luther did not believe only in breach only justification but that was his major theme as the knees it had to be for that is the basic doctrine of the truth booth of the word he only forever known as an intern at the hand of God who revived this truth he was the fifth messenger his message was the just shall live by faith isn't that amazing that God has a different man for every age what was brother Brandon's message Church his message was turned the hearts of the children back to the Apostolic fathers any of it Martin Luther was the just shall live by faith brother Branham was you're getting rapturing faith with Pentecostal faith of the Father amen that's our cry amen we we desire that Apostolic Faith of the Pentecostal others not just for the backs of all your sweet now to have that but we want the rash of the body and then the body change amen yeah the just shall live by faith we got the just should be baptized with the Holy Ghost that goes around Stricker Amen thank you Jesus surely we admit that he knew and did teach that we are to go from faith the face he drew even he people even growing in grace not just justification he pleaded going on with God this marvelous understanding of the sovereignty election predestination no true show him to be a great man the work yeah yet I say again as doing stories God used to bring the people to God's standard against works to just Chum there by faith as I mentioned already this age was called by the disoriented period of Reformation it's exactly right that's what it was it had to be for Martin Luther was reformer not a prophet I know that history books calls him a prophet but it doesn't mean that the history book is right there's no record of Martin Luther qualifying as a true prophet of God in the grand scriptural sense of that word he was a fine teacher for some of the manifestations of spares life and we praise God for that not only amen so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as when a man like the Apostle Paul who was both apostle and prophet so that's why and that's on these uh you know sites that leave the message that's one of their arguments when their arguments is Oh Martin Luther believed in the Trinity so how could he be a real light ayam rainiest didn't believe in serpent seed they said now even if that's true I've another research but even in that's true that wouldn't bother my faith because none of those men now all those men were just messengers they weren't prophets only father brother Brandon were prophets right so i rainiest martin Columba and martin luther Wesley and I guess I'll remember all those those five days those men were not prophets because they didn't stand there and say thus says the Lord so to me that doesn't stumble my faith if Martin Luther worshiped God is the Trinity because I will say when God doesn't reveal it the Bible said he winks at their ignorance right that's what the Bible says I can show you that the book of Acts the times they were Scientologists me get your hater it's like okay it's not revealed to you that's okay I'll meet at that that's what the Bible says I can check out in Scripture he winks at ignorance when people don't the Bible said where there's no law there's no sin and people aren't aware of something they can't be held accountable for it but when God reveals it now we are gone now I leave to understand by the rhythm said this he said the time is coming when we can't stand on it anymore he said Trinitarian is of the devil he said that's the state the Lord he had to say that to the people because at the time this is the last age this is the age of restoration so all the sin has to be on the church the true understanding of God has to be delivered back to the people so he says the Titus come or we can't believe that anymore we've got to leave all the word amen right Noorie so paul brother branham were prophets they have the truth they had all the mysteries but in between these five men did not there's my house so I gonna finish then you don't have a few more slides let me check it okay yeah okay oh man what I thought I had time for was to take you through all the times the Bible said justification and so here's these all these slides right here one two two three four you would think I would know after a while about how many slides I could get moving I thought I'd be able to get through all those but I won't so to finish with those four quotes and then I'll go right to that last scripture that's what you one scripture on justifications you can see in terms the reason I think this is word is that Satan's gonna battle us to not feel justified in other words he's gonna make me feel dirty he's gonna make you feel sinful right I mean we can all we can all say that right Satan isn't trying to make us feel like we're not forgiven but we got to go back to the word and the Bible said we're justified when we're baptized before I should just look we're baptized as soon as we repent we are justified and so church for what I want to know what I want you to understand the me to is we need to feel that we need to feel like Martin Luther we need to feel like we are justified God has taken all my sins away and just that just that memory just that thought in our minds will help us to have so much more joy so much more light so much more freedom in Christ you understand what I'm saying because if you don't feel justified you're gonna feel you're gonna feel condemned you're gonna feel guilty all the time and we've got to feel free in Christ I'm gonna feel free in event I don't feel for you in Christ like I said where I got strengthened in there man I just want to go up and witness and pray for somebody that's how we want to feel we can't feel that way if we don't feel forgiven we've gotta feel for you that's why I feel like we can preach justification any time because we all fight Satan every day so you trying to whisper it and God the Bible says he's accusing you before the throne of God day and night so today Satan took some time one of his demons and accused a burrito and Malachi and each one of us and all the conferees name it no said he took time and this demons accused all of us before God and so what what do we have to say we'll either feel that accusation or we gonna say God forgive me I believe my syndrome of the blood of Jesus Christ I feel forgiven again I feel justified I feel like I haven't sinned amen God has forgiven me Gloria now it's time when all we find a great change in the way he conducted the affairs in which he was involved at irsie event so gentle so fearless so patient I'm going to skip ahead of this towards the end of his life got more involved with the politics and affairs of the world okay and that's even in Britannica I can show you that to pretend so it just shows that you guys he got instead of his life he started you know getting above the things he shouldn't have got involved and but the granddaddy thought most of violence in history maybe it was leave a toe found some history that even peasants and Lorenz died because of something he said I don't know I did find where he had control or he was trying to end right to peasants I do identified that in Britannica this morning I was reading I never found any fact where he caused them to die it's possible he did obviously leave me almost a thousand history where he calls people who died but I'm just letting you know I didn't find it but it's probably enough to imagine it's the pre nice team council so here's the last words on programs last words on Martin Luther but for all that even all of mistakes God used Martin Luther let it not be said that his intentions were wrong let only be said that his judgment failed truly if the Lutheran's could get back to his teaching and serve God as the gracious brother served him then that people would surely be a credit and praise to the great God and Savior Jesus Christ amen the beautiful if the Lutheran Church could get back to believing like Martin Luther they would be a what great credit that means that most of terms are not living like Martin Luther Lynch they don't believe the same things he believed is that they got back to that they didn't get help to the kingdom of God now the just shall live by faith it's in Habakkuk chapter two right if I almost said it his soul which is lifting up is not upright but the just shall live by faith this is letting my faith produces an upright soul and that means everything feels right between you and the sins Oh feels right I've confessed everything I feel right with God the chops live by faith no I don't I'm living by faith is a life of righteous actions if item says it's Romans one they just shove it by faith because God's wrath goes against those who live unrighteous lis so if you have faith you live righteously right faith produce what faith bruce's works right now these are some Oh spiritual I might even take next Wednesday and preach all these scriptures on because they were so they were so refreshing let's stay in our feet good job get on your feet there these were so refreshing for that and they proposed it to me I was like wow what a beautiful and just took me back to when I first got saved don't you like those like to go back to that feeling sometimes that's how I felt when I first got saved that's that enjoy that initial joy and that first love that I had here's what the Bible says I'm sorry for the Hebrews the Greek says on justification it's the word night I yo ah that's the Greek word for justification it means to render righteous or such as got to be to show exhibit one to be righteous to show these righteous to declare pronounced one to be just righteous or such as he ought to be so when God forgives you your sin he said Hosea is just how he needs to be in my sight Adam is perfect in my sight he's righteous he's not unrighteous he's righteous Lydia in case you got baptized last year bad guy when if they really repented God said you're righteous in my sight you're just as you need to be in my son let me love the Lord for that man now closing there's so many great scriptures but the last thing is remember we need to rejoice the angels in heaven rejoice over every person that just gets justified yeah we have to have it down here we got to get the Holy Ghost down here actually I'm sorry that you never came up we need the baptism the Holy Ghost down there but I just want you to remember and it's a good reminder to me angels shout and rejoice when somebody's spirit just is a new heart right because that's what a new heart means the Bible said I'm gonna take their stony heart away remember 2zq I'm gonna take the stony heart away I'm gonna give you a heart of flesh and the Bible said when one sinner repents angels rejoice in heaven can I say like this angels rejoice it with a foolish virgin just like the lies praise the Lord as far as the God's eyes we're no better we just have a higher calling right we just have fire in our soul where they go but they do have pure hearts they do have a heart we'd say of justification where they now have a heart for God now is it going to be difficult to live adjust my life in this deck yes it is because the Bible said the foolish virgin worked pulley Birds into the work and program said that means everything they heard they live in nothing you think about the people you know that the churches you left think about the churches you left how many of those people do you know are living everything the pastor's say I would say the churches I left maybe a handful maybe that are actually living everything the brothers preaching so what does it make us know it makes us know we're getting close to the end right we're gonna coast in who Jesus said very few will find this way very few Evo deceivers get worse and worse to worse that's why it's good to come to church every time and examine your life because the deception is so great it's just going to get worse but worse and worse deception people are going to be deceived thinking I'm ok with God I'm right system of God I'm justified we've got but member Judas thought he was too and he fell away from it because of transgression Judas had his name on the book for the RAM said but it got blotted out because of his he said that being a traitor a transgressor that Scripture I can prove that by description remember what did the nd from you their names blot out from under heaven there was the guy that bought it out for idolatry remember they set that calf do you remember that the scripture how to treat it next action they lived far away from Troost and you remember that Dannan Ephraim so somebody had the idea let's set up a golden calf and let's go worship at this place instead of all the long drive to church look at people then oh I get go to church is too far away we'll be careful yourself an idol and that's what I think that's what that you would taste maybe 10 no no no no everybody some people I can't drive to church I just put on a taper I can't even join a church it's too far away well careful about that the Queen of Sheba traveled across the desert you get in church we got cars now that might pass from camels right Church I mean we are gonna have given so much we have to live such a high life but church if you love Christ you want to live that I wanted to live everything I freeze I wasn't I do believe I do you know I can grow like I can come a churchgoer Leah I can do that yes I grow my gifts I can grow consecration but I'm living everything I know anybody anymore I'm not a hypocrite preacher right for each other you shouldn't smoke and I go smoke I shouldn't shoot the back when I don't you come back barks you drink and I go drink in my free time I'm not a hypocrite preacher I'm living what I'm preaching man I got all these seven other witnesses a home to make sure I'm doing it which I appreciate that they vote for that but you know what I feel I feel like this when I'm alone I feel more like the eyes are on me when I'm alone than I do it around my family why is that because I Holy Spirit with me I feel like when I come to here at church and pray eight in the morning I'm all by myself I feel more can I say like this more careful my actions that I'm doing the one on that home because I'm in God's house and because there's no voices and I can sense his presence like that when you're all alone it's almost like Oh his eyes are on them even closer I want to please not right now I don't want any temptation to get in between me and the Lord I want to do exactly what's right I don't want to take any days off I want to take any time off from serving Christ because I know he's watching me amen so see when somebody gives their heart to God the Bible said they get a new heart and angels rejoice with the stony heart and when their conscience is lined up with God's Word their memory reason affection imagination even if their soul isn't quicken and they can believe all the Word of God even they don't have that if they just have this just like Martin Luther God said you're one of my own the just shall live by faith you're one of the just and you will not be hurt of the second death all right glad tonight for the word of God man let's get more around cause it this is to be a spy justification is so powerful because I've already experienced it and now Satan wants to move me away from that where I don't feel clean I don't feel righteous but we've got to stay in the word we've got to humble ourselves and make sure we go back to the word to remember that we are justified that there's nothing against Lydia Florence because she's been baptised she's repented there's nothing against Malachi race minute because he repented of his sin to the bathtub and so what do we do we must just walk in the light as he is in the light confess our sins there's nothing against Acacia Tamra Smith God doesn't want to yes sir because she's repented she's been baptized and she's justified in the sight of God amen God doesn't hold against me and so when I get convicted I say Lord forgive me and he forgives us right away aren't you glad for God's forgiveness God thank you Jesus let's just for a moment [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] let me take aim at these things always always love to go back to remember what it was like to cross over from death into my heart to think about what Christ has done in my life how he's changed my passions and desires oh I just just fall more in love with him all the time maybe man and let me tell you this is Martin Luther would have been alive today he'd be here but if I have any more visitors day other than three come backing him up man I wouldn't preach it right out of your hand other than right around here are said that's exactly right the just is why [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all of us I say sir because your love is so great your mercy so great your Spears like he is my life I don't know how to be messed up my god the muddiness bureau good tonight justified by the grease anybody talk about justified anybody no one just I can't think it's got just the confidence I have to think of one you get anybody think someone let me know I God's grace by Shirin like being justified amen do you clear righteous praise God declared righteous through up our faith that he gave us that's proposal Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord that's what I love when you turn back the clock and we can look back at soldiers in the past like Martin Luther not perfect by any means not a prophet by any means but Lord a star burning with the fire of God his fire that others to you Lord and that's what we want today the same fire the Holy Ghost and justification and what we believe you haven't stopped with us there we believe you led us on the sanctification and now into the baptism of the Holy Ghost then our lights burn bright dear God and then it's remember let's never forget for signal accuses date night let us never forget that we are justified by grace through faith the Bible says justified freely it costs us nothing you're it cost you everything Lord guide it cost you your life it cost you your son it cost you the blood and the brokenness of the body it cost you everything Lord God but it cost us nothing it was justified free I want to say thank you again for the free gift of grace Lord God I did not earn this salvation it was really given to me and because you would Lord everyone here we could look at Christ and say there's no fault in him he was God's lamb he took the sin upon him because of that arson is imputed on him and his righteousness comes upon me O Lord the sacrificial lamb the substitutionary that I had the perpetuation Lord for my sin Oh God how we appreciate it tonight Lord God thank you lord the Christ is our mercy seat took our place our sin was thrown upon him and we were protected by His grace by the mercy seat Lord God we thank you Lord for your love thank you for Christ Jesus thank you for this night unless your turn that came out to the house of God may they leave in their hearts on fire remembering how justified they are overcoming we didn't get to the scriptures but the just shall live by his faith let us remember be thankful what Martin Luther started it because we are at the end of this we've experienced that and nor now at the end of this restoration Lord God so we say thank you more god I think this word now Lord let me playing deep in our hearts let us remember tomorrow so we can be a light of righteousness to someone tomorrow warmed up shrinker this now the lord help us to be a church is led by the Holy Spirit Oh beat into the Holy Spirit I ask those all in my heart let me be a true pass-through and I'd be a true man of God but every heart here we sought out to you a hundred fold Lord for your glory in Jesus Christ name the
