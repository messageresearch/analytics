[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] like to look at reviewing modesty again tonight I think this is part for the grace of Lord and I'd like to take a text here just a moment I think its first Peter 3 let's go to first Peter 3 I think I'll take my text here I like to look at Christian liberties tonight there's three Bible defined Christian liberties and I want to look at jewelry again we covered that this summer but I think I just want to revisit excite read some more scriptures on it so I want to review that it's not on the mics no no but forgive me I thought it was on excuse me thank you so let's look to this here tonight first Peter chapter 3 verse 1 yeah I'm learning you know like I've been doing a lot of reading and learning about different things and trying to balance it all by God's grace so trying to rightly divide the word of the Lord and tonight we look at this topic and some areas here and I'll trust me a blessing to you first Peter 3 verse 1 would read down 1 through 4 and I think we'll just have a word of Prayer after verse 4 likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands and if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chaise conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and the wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God great price that's just about heads and word of Prayer you have a need on your heart just make it on into God here tonight how many father Lord you are awesome you can move the mountains Oh God Lord you keep us in the valley you hide us from the rains and storms Lord and you give us a foundation a rock Lord our lives being built upon the rock of the Word of God thank you Lord for this rock we stand in your grace tonight Lord we're standing on your side as we sang Lord God we're happy to stomp and wave and sing and clap on your side Lord God I pray Lord tonight you'll speak to us through thy word anoint me Lord anoint your people Lord Jesus with the sweet Holy Spirit dear God and give us such a balance in the word Lord and help us rightly divide the word it might be Lord a better Christians as we leave this place later on the father will give you all the praise and glory in Jesus Christ name the church said Amen God that she's being seated praise God so this is part 4 I think we did part three on Sunday night by God's grace I kind of want to update just real quick on the book I'm writing here I finished chapter five yet actually today so now I got 25,000 words here so far and I think I got three more chapters chapter six someone knew the fashion history all the way down as far as I can do it chapter 7 I want to do all the questions and answers from you the YouTube videos some of the interesting questions answers then chapter 8 I want to do just the conclusion and show how everything we believe is not just our idea it's actually the perfect will of God because Paul said you can prove the perfect will of God and so but what do you need to do that church need a transformed mind our minds have to be transformed washed change enlightened our minds have to be totally illuminated by the truth of the Holy Spirit and then you can prove the perfect will of God so we're grateful for this opportunity now chapter 5 I just called a jewelry makeup tattoos and hi I just caught it that so we'll see if that changes let's start if we can now now that we read our scripture here let's make a few comments the emphasis for Christianity is the inward adorning of the Christian that's the whole emphasis that Paul's getting at Peter our text is Peter tonight the most important thing you can put on is Christ on the inside the character of Christ the responses of Christ the attitudes of Christ the most important thing to put on every morning is Christ him head upon your thoughts and your words your thoughts and your your actions and and everything you say and do that's the most important thing you can be dressed up in is the character of Christ the scripture does say though we our focus should not be on the plating of the hair which we was we learn was expensive hairstyles sometimes wrapped with gold and the hair and the wearing of gold or the putting on of expensive apparel so we we know more emphasis should be placed upon the inward than the outward and so I think that's I think that's a very practical application if we spend more time in the morning getting ready naturally then spiritually learn maybe we can do something about that maybe we can say well I need to spend more time with the Lord or I need to I need to dress up my spirit I need to adorn my spirit with more holiness or more meekness we need to spend more time dressing up the inward man than the outward man I know it's a race for me every morning it's a race I like to get up and and I like to race and get everything ready outside and then I like to go just rest it at the Bible rest at the computer as I study and then get on my knees and pray I like to spend I like to get all that done rush to get that done so I can get right to prayer and spend most of my free time with the Lord that's what I like to do by the grace of the Lord because I found if I did the opposite I was rushing too much if I just went right to prayer and study I felt like then I was I was sobered and you I would rush and I'd be late to work and I didn't want no I don't want to do that so I found I'll just rush and get ready and then I get into the fellowship with the Lord now you remember of course first Timothy 2:9 where the Bible plainly teaches that we must have the adornment of the Holy Spirit and I want to now look at Christian liberties I mentioned this little bit on Sunday and I want to make sure I go through this so let's start it with first Corinthians 8 if you have your Bibles there let's go to first Corinthians 8 and we look at all three that the Bible names the Bible names three errors of Christian Liberty I'm gonna throw jewelry in there as a fourth because I believe jewelry fits the definition of a Christian Liberty so let's go to first Corinthians eight there are two chapters dedicated completely to Christian Liberty in the Bible and first Corinthians eight is one of them I know Christian Liberty is not really a shout and maybe sermon I don't know if I'll be shouting tonight at the Christian liberties as I was on Sunday you know with putting all demons under our feet you know but it's important and you're gonna see it's important because it affects our attitude how we think about others and how we treat others and it can be very important too if we're causing people to stumble then it's extremely important that we make sure we know our Christian liberties first contains eight verse eight I just want to start with that one so I'm defining Christian Liberty as this it's a carnal earthly action that's not a sin but at the same time they don't make us any more spiritual so it's just an action you do and it doesn't make you more spiritual but it's not it's not a sin either so first Corinthians eight eight now hide you and read that buddy okay so here's an area of this is one example meat if you eat meat you're no better if you don't eat meat you're no better it's just it's a it's an it's a neutral so liberties are like neutrals you're not going to get any closer to God by doing this but if you don't do it you're not gonna get any closer to God there's just areas of human life and decisions that we are given that we have to make next the main thing now let's go to Romans 14 where we flip him back between first Corinthians 8 in Romans 14 I imagine for the first few minutes kind of going through some scriptures here Romans 14 6 now this is where we're going to get a little bit in the attitude that we have we got to we got to have the right attitude towards people that may do things differently than us and remember this is again on liberties where it's not a sin it's not a sin to make certain decisions so Romans 14:6 liddie you can read that for us okay you see the pattern both people if one person eats meat they say thank you Lord for this burger thank you Lord for this steak the other person doesn't eat steak said thank you lord thank you Lord to see the Liberty is you have freedom on either side now notice the Bible didn't say well I give thanks but I hate that person who doesn't eat meat thank you Lord and I'm I could eat meat but I hate that person who doesn't act like me both people so whichever side you're on you can say praise the Lord now we're gonna get to the observance of Holy Days which i think is really applicable for our church in the message especially with Christmas and Easter because a lot of people on the side of no Christmas they just you know if you celebrate Christmas you're a pagan and you know and it depends which parts right it's just like with wine and meat it depends on what you do on that day because you can just like with jury you can go overboard or you can have the wrong spear with jewelry you can have the wrong spirit trying to celebrate Christmas you have the wrong spirit observing this day so we got to make sure we have the right spirit now whatever you do with the Liberty you must make sure it's done in faith in other words you have an assurance in your heart that this does not hinder your walk with God and that's in Romans 14:23 I'll read that one and he that doubted is damned if he eats because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever not of faith is sin now this is this is a Liberty now if you have a Liberty and you can go either way then you have to be fully persuaded in your mind it's okay that I do this it's okay that I don't do this now these things don't apply to the Word of God like smoking that's that's not a Liberty that's a clear sin in the Bible like cussing it like adultery or fornication or evil this doesn't apply to that because you should be condemned if you do one of those right you should feel the conviction you should feel a short-term condemnation because that's what the Bible said there's no condemnation to them they're in Christ Jesus you should feel a slight condemnation of slight conviction until you confess and get it right now it seems like and now since we're there let's go to verse 22 right above it it seems like in these areas of Liberty if you have any concern that this might cause somebody to stumble the thing you should do is do it when no one else is around that's what verse 22 hostile faith have it to thyself before God see happy is he that condemneth not himself in the thing which he allows me so as we get to these three areas meet holy days and wine which I've had two questions on wine lately which I thought was really good it's good to have those questions I've been studying on that a little bit this week and there's any question if there's any question well this person might this person might stumble if I do this then the thing to do is do it all by yourself in your own home so you don't cause somebody to get weak praise God that's the thing to do have it between you if you have faith in it but yet you might call somebody stumble and join with you and God just you two don't cause somebody's stumble because of pride well I don't care I don't they should be stronger than that well now you've got the wrong spear now you're not a servant now you're making yourself a lord and the Bible said we should all serve one another in fact none of us are great unless we're serving other people praise God now go to Roman's 15 1 we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves so this is right after Christian liberty chapter oh I'm so strong in the faith I'm such a mature Christian well then your job according the Bible's not to please yourself with your liberties then your job is to make sure you're pleasing other people you would think the OP 0 I'm such a mature person I can do whatever I want no ma'am no sir now it's just the opposite if you're so mature now you should be more sensitive to the needs of other people you should be more sensitive how is my behavior impacting sister so-and-so or brother so-and-so the more --mess the more mature and spiritual you are the more you care about how others are influenced through your life amen it's not oh I can get away with this or I can do this and I don't care what anybody says you should care what people say you should care what people think about your liberties in Christ amen then every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification for even Christ please not himself but as is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me so who did what did Christ do to Christ serve himself or serve others of course Christ served others alright so now we can see that now there's main text romans 14 the whole chapter and romans i'm sorry first corinthians 8 the whole chapter can we have the younger people read again Elijah Rebekah Lydia and Malachi you guys can you guys read stuff it's okay yeah Bibles okay alright we appreciate your participation okay there's three air food is the first area holydays and wine those three areas let's look at those three areas of Liberty tonight so let's go maokai you've read right Elisha can you read romans 14 - okay so the first idea with eating is vegetarians versus meat-eaters you know that's the first idea and of course you know the Bible said you can do one or the other you know but you have to be careful it doesn't cause people to stumble now the way meat eating would cause when the stumble was interesting in the days of the Bible so certain first Corinthians eight in the days of paw at least in the city of Corinth there must have been restaurants or public places where they serve food and they must have had idols or totem poles standing up and when the owners of that restaurant or whatever public setting it was when they killed the animal and and cook the meat it was almost as if they were offering it to sacrifice because that's what the scripture says it's so strange but they must have had that type of atmosphere so 1st Corinthians 8 verse 4 and then Lydia why don't you read 4 and 5 risk on the ends 8 4 and 5 all right Rebekah do you want to read verse 6 okay so we Christians know there's only one God all these idol worshipers there they're just worshipping Devils is what they're doing there's no there's only one God now verse 7 howbeit there's not every man that now it's for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is the file so there the file when they're worshipping or they're eating this food that was offered to this idol so see their muscles better than some type of social setting where they would actually sacrifice and then this food this meat is for this idol then they go eat it there must been some type of public worship ceremony verse 8 but meat commendeth us not to God eating meat doesn't get us any closer to God for neither if we eat are we better than either if we eat not are we the worse but take heed lest by any means this Liberty of yours become a stumbling-block to them that are weak so the more mature you get the more you care about we Christians and your influence so for us in this case it would be what the younger children right are those of us who just came in the message recently or something like that we want to be very careful about weaker Christians verse 10 for If any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols temple so there must have been a time where a Christian was sitting in idols that I don't know how that could be possible but it must have been like I don't know I must had a restaurant on the side or something I don't know what but the Bible says shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom Christ died so an a weaker Christian is in the height of a temple sees a stronger Christian the stronger Christian eats the meat that's offered to the idol and it causes this weak Christian to stumble and then perish look at that verse 12 but when you sin so against the Brethren you wound their weak conscience ye sin against Christ wherefore if meat make my brother to offend I will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest I make my brother to offend so the lesson I get here is I don't want to be in an idols temple for us I don't want to be in a bar right I don't want to be in a sports bar either I don't wanna be sitting at the table at Applebee's and saying give me another iced water and give me some of that you know I just don't want to be around it because whatever reason I don't know how this could be possible but Christians and Paul's they would eat meat in the idols temple and you could cause a brother to stumble doing that now I'll say another one sporting event that's why I don't go to NFL basketball NBA we have a LeBron James so close but I could care less I don't want to be there shouting and then the next guy over there he's got alcohol his arm around me saying yeah you know what fellowship does light have a darkness and what if I come home smell like alcohol I got alcohol spit all over what kind of testimony is that are you running to me at you know at that at the gas station and I've got my cab stuff 100 I'm smelling like alcohol and what kind of testimony is that well over the pastor does that well I can go do that but then when you're there you see those dancers at halftime with no clothes on and you stumble and get weak and parish whose fault is that it'd be my fault so see we care mature Christians care what the weak Christian see they want to be the example they want to show them watch me this is how you live your life in other words like Paul said follow me as I follow Christ we care about our example ok so buddy can see that now that's food so you can see whether it's you know vegetarian carnivore whatever you are it's ok what vegetarians do can't say thank you Jesus for this vegetarian meal and the meter says thank you Lord for this wonderful snake both people should be thankful we shouldn't look across one another and say oh you hypocrite or you sinner you know and my wife helped me out too with the meat remember I said I'll meet about bloody meat we talked that my wife told me that they they they usually hang the meat and all the blood comes out beforehand so that red the red blood there's not really the blue the blood the Bloods all come out that's just like the raw meats color so is that right honey did I say that right okay so you have to worry about eating a rare steak Church so thank you darlin thank you I always liked rare steaks I kind of I was concerned about that but she would know more about food preparation and I would I don't even know about that okay let's go to Holy Days now if you have any questions about food liberties let me know afterwards or send me a text anybody have any right now anybody have any questions about food liberties okay now those are the area's vegetarian and then meat and then where you eat your food and the association with your food I think we can see a lot of wisdom in that okay go to Romans 14 five and six back to Romans 14 the next area is observing Holy Days now here's where it gets sticky oh this person does Christmas and this person does Easter they called Easter and Easter is a pagan word I said and it might might be true but with brother branham you know caught it Easter and and God didn't convict him well then we got a tape we got to take that to thought you know we got to consider that Romans 14 five and six why don't man can you read that for me five and six raise the Lord so there's Christian's at mine this day is so holy this day so special and they go to extra lengths to say this day I'm really gonna make this a holy day and other Christians can be just as diligent saying every day's the same every day I serve the Lord every day is a consecration every day and this brother can say thank you Lord this is today is just like yesterday it's Easter but it's just like the day before Easter hallelujah but this person over here saying why we're so consecrated for Easter I haven't you know eat no meat and all these things and and he should be just to be able to say thank you Lord and thank you for my brother and sister that's worshiping here too yeah so it's both can both esteem the law both give thanks to the Lord it's important to have both kinds it's an area of Liberty now as I said earlier the Bible said let's go to Colossians 2:16 and 17 may we have Elijah read this one Colossians 2:16 and 17 like I said earlier I've been you know emailing people about Sabbath days and everything like that and I felt like God give me a a real good scripture but this is the one where it says Colossians 2:16 and 17 where Paul says holy day Sabbath days that was all shadow of what was to come and that was Christ Christ was who was to come amen he's alive amen cautions to 15/16 so I'm sorry sixteen and seventeen so Elijah can you read 16 and 17 thank you amen so don't let people judge you so how do you do that you got to go talk to them if they're judging you you got to go talk to them don't let them judge you because in this day it was a big deal because it was the it was the transition from Judaism into Christianity from law by works by the law of the Spirit right the grace but yet you know with by walking by the law of the Spirit you hate sin right you cast out anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and so we're in this transition and Paul said don't let them judge you about holy days that means you have to go to them and you humbly say you know please don't look down upon me I'm serving the Lord you can't judge me all these days we're typing of the works of Christ the Sabbath day was the rest to your soul right Sabbath the Sabbath day represented physical rest but that represented one day we're gonna rest from our works and we're going to accept Christ works amen by the baptism of Holy Ghost and now Christ will work through us we're gonna rest from our works and Christ is gonna work through us hey man so don't let people judge you in these areas of Liberty you got to go talk to them and say please don't look down upon me for these things and that's what I'd say that's what I'm learning here with with Christmas especially Christmas that's a big one where people get all upset if you celebrate Christmas now that we let's make that an area of Christian Liberty we have to make that area of Christian Liberty but can it easily go overboard yes well Graham warned about giving gifts and that can become a commercial or competitive spirit well I've got to get amen $25 because he got me $20 and now it's come competition and now it's I got to give back and I was just trying to say that money you know he just gone too far God loves a cheerful Giver not an arrogant giver or a disgruntled Giver God doesn't love a disgruntled Giver and then anything with a lie like Santa Claus God is never in a lie right so God can never be in Santa Claus so there's certain things you got a judge each one a mistletoe hanging above for people to kiss under would that be a godly thing to do of course not because we don't encourage especially if they're not married don't encourage fornication right you don't you don't want to model that for your children because they might not be married and they might try to go to a party and do something like that you want a model holiness but like in our family that's our this is our conviction we don't put up a tree that's I just don't sit for me that just my my conviction some people might and I've said it like this before if you can put that tree up and that makes you think of Christ go on ahead I'll be thankful for that Wow that tree makes them think of Christ and my home I put up a manger scene we I don't but the children do there's one that's a real toy little tykes one and then there's a real nice one I think my wife likes but that makes me think of Christ I can do that in my conscience but either way and then we give our get our children three gifts you know a toy a book and then clothes right is that right okay and just to try to limit it so it doesn't become oh I want more that's it then then they get up then they get a greedy spirit like all of us grown up maybe well that's all I got this year I should have got more than that you know right why didn't I get this and instead of just being happy you've got something so these are that's what I believe I can a that's where it takes a Christian Liberty but people over here work you know worship in saying thank you Lord you know the all these presents remind us of Christ thank you Lord we ought to say thank God even I'm thankful those people don't worship thank the Lord anyway but the trouble is over here you know trouble is over here when you just you you're disgruntle with everybody that made me take some of the Liberty the people over here say I'm not going to worship or I don't believe that's worship but thank the Lord anyway they're still faithful Christians now if they're sinning if they're sitting and offending them now the one that's offended has to go make that right or they're going to develop a root of bitterness right or a judgmental spear or a critical spirit see don't let don't let no one judge you in your liberties that's what I see those are the most easily easily seen areas of Liberty that I've seen serving the Lord these last 20 years or so almost 20 years yeah 99 so 19 years been serving the Lord so that's that one okay so any questions on that any questions on holy days that's what I can see okay now let's drink go to drinking wine where did I put that scripture forgive me oh I think it's Romans 14 21 yeah believe it's Romans 14 - I'm sorry oh I put it on the previous page that's where it was okay yeah Romans 14:20 fun forgive me who wrote this book anyway Lord forgive me for heavens at 1421 okay Lydia might you read that case are you able to read to just okay Lydia 14 21 that's okay okay so wine drinking wine is somewhat an area of Liberty now I did I've been reading some researcher different preachers who are pulling different historical things about wine so I think Sunday I said something wrong it seems like wine today is the very same as it was then wine is fermented juice of crushed great grapes and it's an alcoholic beverage that can lead to intoxication okay so I think I was reading it wrong so forgive me what I said on Sunday now there is evidence though that in the New Testament the wine was two parts wine one part water so there are some evidence on that I'm still studying this out this topic is in progression okay so it's still an open topic I don't have all the answers like I like to have enough time this week but here's what I found it it seems like wine always had moderation all the way through the Bible because we find Melchizedek in Genesis 14 Melchizedek his way to congratulate Abraham after winning who what was it give him a own wine now that's natural wine he gave him natural wine his way to congratulate and what was that that was a pre figure of when Abraham's seed get the victory in the rapture and Jesus will serve us oil wine Rightmove wine for communion but what did we see Abraham was a type of the bride Noah was a type of who foolish version what he stumble with he got drunk on wine so Abraham could handle wine with moderation but the foolish virgin get so that's just interesting to see that there's wine all through the Old Testament fact there's over two hundred thirty three verses on wine in the Bible and you have wine on both so you have scriptures on both sides some are positive of course the others are negative when they deal with excess of wine now brother Branham said then this is where I was wrong brother Branham said the New Testament wine has to be intoxicated I'm sorry has to have the power to toxicated because he said new wine has got life in it he says because if you put old wine I'm sorry you put new wine in old bottles they burst so they may have had a little water in them but they still had growing power the fermenting power in them but brother Graham said this building up said oh I'll just take a social drink it won't hurt anyone but the Branham said it's sin the real eagle knows it's sin he says so I believe it is sin to drink in public I believe that is a sin because of all the eyes watching you think about if you're out let's say just out to eat with you and your wife or you and your hubby and this waitress brings you both a tall glass of wine and you get the talk and say oh you're a Christian what church you go to and here you are this big old glass of wine chugging it with your dinner you're gonna drive home after drinking that wine which you might have a level of alcohol blood alcohol content what kind of testimony is that it's not really good testimony I'll say like this if you wanna drink wine the privacy your own home that's between you and God but it better be between you and God only I don't I don't drink wine in my own home the reason is because I know my flesh might start liking it and I don't want to get addicted the second thing is I don't want my children to see me drinking wine at home I only want them to see me drinking wine in the house of God I could I have the liberty I could but at much if my children aren't safe yet or filled all the ghosts yet they could backslide and they could start sneaking some of the alcohol because they see daddy drinking it okay so that's why I don't drink it in public the only well public of restaurants I drink in public you're right here oh yeah you do too right we do that together but it's a sin to do it publicly I believe that it is a sin just like the meat if someone eating meat just meat just hamburger if that could cause somebody to go overboard and then spend more time at the idols temple I don't know how it happened and then get caught up in sin and be lost and then you're kind of a fort how much more easier could someone get addicted to alcohol right alcohol ruin my wife's family growing up because of her father drinking alcohol it ruined the whole family it destroyed the whole family and it's still destructive today so see we must consider the weaker Christians right the younger Christians we must consider them and not cause anybody stumble whether Scriptures about the blessing of alcohol yes there are there is also many people that abstain from John the Baptist abstain from it Solomon I'm sorry Samson abstain from it the Rechabites the Nazarites and the Levitical priests and the temple can never drink any wine because they were holy unto the Lord now Jesus drank wine on the church this is the thing I'm wrestling with right out right now Jesus drank wine because the Bible said John the Baptist came not eating not drinking but Jesus came eating and drinking so the way I look at it now it seems like Jesus only drank wine with his disciples that's what it seems like to me because I can't find any scripture where he had wine with sinners you let me know if I'm wrong that's what I see it right now so in other words Jesus only had wine at communion or at fellowship with his disciples that's what I can see from the scripture I can't see any other way remember Jesus is the example so Jesus drank wine so that's why and at the Lord's Supper he gave bread and wine he actually drank he said I won't drink of this cup of wine with you until we drink in a new in my father's Kingdom so one sip of wine which we take we take one sip of wine now I'm gonna watch you guys make sure you take a sip time not a chug you understand what I'm saying if Jesus had it they shared the cup remember they passed the cup they shared a cup if Jesus Christ God in flesh could handle a drink of wine I can me here not sin then we can do that too we can't let that be a source of condemnation or anything you know the Bible said that you know the Bible said wine Cheers God and man did you know the bat was in that wine Cheers God and man wine made God happy because it was making man happy right so like a communion or like Abraham can you imagine you just whipped four nations and you're all tired and worn out you know you're the leader you just trained all these men and you come home and there's Melchizedek Oh God in flesh and what does God give you he gives you a hug you know my son and then he gives you a wine and he's so tired he takes a little drink of water you see how that would be a blessing how that would cheer God and man oh we just got the victory and God refreshed me with a little wine there's no way we're ham got drunk though because he a lot so he wasn't uh he wasn't no equality he was Abraham see he was Abraham right he's Abraham he's a father of faith so he took Oh baby drink of wine said praise Allah praise the Living God Melchizedek this is my high priest you know thank you for the oil wine so see it has ability to cheer God and men I don't you think God's happy when you take wine at communion don't you think God's happy because you're representing that I'm in drinking in the life of Jesus Christ oh that's my son that's my daughter they're drinking that wine and it's given them some type of a little bit of stimulation and it's representing what the Holy Spirit does to a heart that loves Christ I don't know about you but I like drinking that wine I like doing your mind again I feel a little simulation when I drink the wine of communion and it reminds me that's what the Word of God is supposed to do amen it's exactly right the Bible said wine makes the man's heart glad that Psalms 104 15 the priest would get white off-white offerings drink offerings when offering sacrifices God wanted God wanted that poured out for him because as the power to give life has the power to stimulate you now of course all that was foreshadowing the new wine they got on the day of Pentecost amen that's the most important wine no we can get and if you like drinking natural wine more than that wine something's wrong with you I like the Holy Ghost Rider a lot more than that amen I cash out or cry or pray intercede I get more stimulation of that just by drinking a little wine down here I get a lot more stimulation from seeing God move and bless and bring people to repentance or tears or victory or healing I get a lot more joy out of the new line than I do just the natural line and if you're not that way something's wrong with you because then it's more natural instead of spiritual yeah so this the this pastor quotes dictionaries encyclopedias that said in the New Testament wine was probably cut to parts water I'm sorry two parts water to one part wine that's really watered-down wine that's what this one so I'm gonna search this out I'm gonna try to get more on that especially before I put in the book I don't want to put in the book without really searching it out okay and then of course we know the New Testament Scriptures about be not drunken on wine but be filled with the spirit okay Ephesians 5:19 Paul says do not be drunk on wine so Jesus would a particular wine at just with his disciples here communion he wouldn't have been he would you went on it got a little tipsy you can you imagine God getting tipsy off a little wine no it's just that initial drink that initial stimulation to kind of give you a little stimulation to wake you up and give you a little feeling of the power of life and wine to start making you think about the power of the Holy Ghost amen that's that's right amen okay that's that next area that was the area of third area of Liberty I'm gonna make sure I didn't forget anything yeah so I mentioned this on Sunday night John the Baptist came neither drinking wine nor strong drink so why it is like natural wine we have today the juice from the grapes strong drink is like vodka and what's some other ones no no no no I don't know too many alcohols vodka what's some other hard drinks liquor yeah liquor that's all I know if I were to the store I saw okay I know that name but I can't name him now because I don't have any interaction with them now my wife cooks with different ones we got to buy from the store you know and I don't I don't do anything like that now remember why though can be used for medicines sake because Paul told Timothy try little wine for your stomach's sake and you're often infirmities so that's where you'd use it for medicine I don't recommend you going out to the story on buying wine and then you feel bad you drink a little wine I don't know I don't know I would say seek the doctor first that's a ho dude because again you might get in a bad habit well every time a little tired I'll take a little how cool pretty soon you'll be addicted to alcohol remember there's little weak eyes watching you raise god there's weak little eyes there's weak little ears hearing what you say about these things all right let me know if you haven't remember now the Bible says clearly drunkards will not inherit the kingdom of God it's impossible you cannot be a drunk and inherit the rapture it's impossible so that's how far we got to stay away from wine and member Paul said Paul said I will not drink wine here let's go back to first contains eight I won't drink wine or eat meat or do anything as long as the world stands if I would offend anybody so that's first Corinthians 8 verse 13 that's quite a statement as long as this world is standing I'm not going to eat meat around the wheat Christian who might see me eating meat you know in the idols temple I won't drink any wine around a weak Christian I won't do it as long as this world is standing guess what this world's gonna stand a long time right this is just gonna get a fiery burning on the outside and then God's gonna start all over you know walk out the ashes of the wicked the millennia I'm starting the millennium this world's gonna stand a long time that means Paul said I'm forever dedicated to not causing weak Christians to stumble that's right first corinthians 813 how about Rebecca can you read that one I think it's I think that's it your turn is that okay amen thank you I will eat no flesh while the world stands if there's any question I'm gonna call somebody stumble I just won't do it I won't do it bless you now the main thing is not to judge one another I've kind of gone through that so I think I'm gonna skip past that but I have a whole paragraph on Christians should not judge others and the Bible said the only thing you should judge is yourself judge yourself that you're not causing other people to stumble that's what we should judge so shouldn't say oh I can't believe they know they put up a tree or I can't believe I can't believe they don't even celebrate Christmas what kind of Christian are they don't judge just be thankful just give thanks if they've hurt you go talk to them about it okay next all right let's go to jewelry now this is when I have the most scripture on jewelry now let me say this clearly jewelry is not called a liberty in the Bible but I feel like it is this is my understanding I told you the three that are literally called Liberty's right holy days meat and wine those are literally called areas of Liberty but jewelry seems like it because you have you have scriptures on the good side where believers wear jewelry and then you have sinners who wear jewelry at the same jewelry so that goes to show too that there's a spirit it depends what spirit you have right you can you cannot wear any jewelry and have the right spirit you can also not wear jewelry to have the wrong spirit or you could wear jewelry and have the right spirit or you can wear jewelry and have the wrong spirit so it kind of depends which side you're on now let me say this clearly jewelry should be worn and it must be inexpensive unless it's like a wedding ring because that's the modern-day dowry right in the old days that a member saw he wanted a dowry for his daughter for David what he asked for 200 force or 100 foreskins of the Philistines well usually would have been money but he wanted David to die in battle so he said make it 100 foreskins of the Philistines and all that money in this case the foreskins but in the regular case would have been money goes to the father of the bride well what happened I think just over time is that instead of that money going to the father the father just said you put it on her finger you know just give that ring to the the wife there that's what I think that's what it seems like happening in the Western culture now I know different cultures have dowry still and that's alright that it's their freedom that's a custom customs are okay as long as you don't break the Word of God but if you do wear our jewelry most jewelry should be inexpensive and it should be worn in moderation remember the emphasis should be on the inward jewelry the inward character the inward adorning more than the outward adorning expensive jewelry should be avoided unless it's like a wedding ring because brother Graham said wedding rings are okay how many know that the Graham said a wedding ring is okay he said you Nazarenes I heard it today he said you Nazarene is used to not baptize a woman if she had a wedding ring on he said shame on you the Nazarenes would have baptized a married woman if she had a ring on you got to take that ring off before you can be forgiven you got to take that ring off before you can be saved come on a rings gonna keep you from being saved no got to read your Bible that's it you got it now don't get me wrong can a ring good a ring be an idol of course of course good earrings be an idol of course could any jewelry be an idol can my watch mean I don't yes any item of jewelry could become an idol to a person it depends what the purpose is behind that so let's start with rings so go to let's just go to Genesis 41 42 so my weight maokai and i join you ready rings it start with rings god accepts certain kinds of rings now since I've already said wedding rings there's no scripture where God says don't put on the wedding ring or thou shalt not wear a wedding ring the Bible never says that so we clearly have the Liberty to wear ring and there's three people that wore rings in the Bible that we're good people the first one is Joseph son of Jacob the second one is Mordechai uncle to Esther and the third one is the prodigal son they all wore rings and nobody ever God ever removed them for that now do you know why they warm didn't remember they had stamps on them they were seals so they would put they had like a little seal on it like a little carving that was like the Kings signature or the power authority now to put that in ink and then they stamped that that was so it was like a more of a business thing but did God hate them because they were rings of course not of course not to God hate people they were writing wedding rings of course not there's no scripture that says that does God hate when a woman paints her face and cuts her hair yes God hates that that breaks the Word of God when a man gets drunk and customs and beats his wife does God hate that you better believe God hates that so it's got to be rightly divided so Genesis 41 42 malachi once read it he's a type of christ type of christ ester two three and four okay when you turn there we have Elijah read Esther - I'm sorry Esther eight two and three forgive me I'm all nervous forgive me I'm a little nervous because like I said I I've just been doing a lot of writing and I'm trying to cover the whole chapter but working on for two weeks now Esther eight two and three pardon me okay and Mordecai is a type of 144,000 right he gets restored after Haman is destroyed glory and he puts a ring on and God never said don't put the ring on you shouldn't put the ring on it's for a purpose it had meaning it was part of authority and of course the wedding ring represents your vow your promise you're never gonna break your promise you know how to I was working with a couple this week and the couple was really stressed out one of the couple and they said maybe we should just take some time off and and have the husband or wife move out for a couple weeks and I said absolutely not and I said you should never do that the Bible said if you have wrath don't let the Sun go down upon your wrath that's just making room for someone to me oh well I just met somebody new because I'm not living with my wife or husband anymore I said absolutely not don't do that remember that vow you promised in front of God in front of everyone you promised never leave them nor forsake them that's what was what it comes down to you might not have said those words but that's really what you said now in the case of if like a woman's being beaten should she leave yet brother Ram I heard him say that today separate yourself he said or if a woman is cussing and cussing out a man who's serving God and she's not saved and he just can't handle it and all the maybe she dresses him moral and maybe she's having adulteries and he wants to separate he can separate himself there but he cannot marry again do you understand that Church the woman cannot marry again if she's already married they tend not to marry they cannot do it again because they're bound as long as the other person is alive but there are sins that are so serious if you have to separate yourself the Bible says you can live in peace live in peace if you can't separate yourself you're not under bondage to serve that person but you cannot marry another all right now this is the pretty striking one nose rings you know nose rings in the Bible do you know Rebecca Warren nose ring in the Bible yeah Genesis 24 47 let's go there the Bible said the ring was on her face and earring on her face not head face and if you look up the Hebrew meaning for this earring its nose ring so Eliezer when he went to get Rebecca he had bracelets for her rings earrings and a nose ring now we're getting down to some real nitty-gritty here I see all your faces yeah here here it is with jewelry jewelry for a Christian can never mark the skin permanently damage the skin cut the skin or pierce the skin so whenever nose rings she had on it was a slide on or clip on or something because you'll never find a scripture and that I can say that all the way through the Bible you'll never see God allowing someone to pierce their skin as a Christian or Jew or mark it scratch it or make it bleed or cut themselves you never see that so whatever jewelry all she has it was jewelry that could just be slid on or whatever however however you did it because that's the pattern of God and whose temple are you you're the temple the Holy Spirit amen remember which persons cut themselves in the Bible the maniac of gather wood cut himself with stones right the four hundred priests avail they cut themselves and say Bale hear us you know there's Elijah here I see Russ they're cutting themselves the only time God's people cut themselves was circumcision that I can find and then God stopped that in the New Testament so now I can't find anything in the Bible for the new testing where God ever causes people to cut their skin pierce their skin mark their skin or make themselves bleed ever understand that God has that pattern he never the only people that would have the big earrings right were the slaves the Bible said the slave that wanted to just you don't want to go free oh I just love my master I love being ordered around by my master what kind of hurt what kind of that person have to be insane I just want to just I just want to serve my master and just work for them I don't want to I don't wanna work for myself I don't want my old land I know what my own house and God said take that man down to the temple and put it all through his ear that's the only person that God that would be a believer that God said put a hole in their hear somebody that's so I don't know what the word to use but somebody that's so out of their mind they love slavery more than they love freedom and they remember they didn't want to hear the gospel trumpet of freedom the Jubilee trumpet that's only person that's the only believer that God would ever say put something through their body see that's right okay new tongue rings can do nose rings nothing that goes through the body because that's a sign that you've turned down your freedom because that be permanent W everyone would know this the person couldn't leave layer and say oh you know I do want to go free now no you're permanently art God God never permanently marks any real believer except when they wanted to be a slave the rest their lives that's why we shouldn't have tattoos and all these things does that help I got the grace okay now I think you know the prodigal son I don't think we need to read that but you remember he he said put a robe on him kill the fatted calf put a ring on his fingers give him authority so it had a meeting why would Jesus say don't wear white at wedding rings but he tells a story about a man wearing a ring okay if he's against rings he's against all rings right but you see God God likes rings now Lydia can you read Genesis 24 47 this is the nose ring of looks like Rebekah at a nose ring on earring upon her face not her head her face and that Hebrew word means nose ring now go to Isaiah 3:21 this is a text that has nose Jules nose jewels for the Hebrew nose jewels as they have 321 anybody got it okay can you read it but okay yeah that's a really short Scripture sorry but if you if you read chapter 3 God starts out the chapter rebuking Israel and then he narrows in on the daughters design remember that he narrows in on the daughters design and church I counted it they had 21 accessories 21 outward accessories bonnets head head turbans earrings nose rings they had high heels because they were mincing the Bible's they're mincing as they go shorter steps they're mincing as they go they're tinkling of their feet think of think of think good think ooh all kinds of ankle jewelry all kind so in the day of there Judgment what were they adorning they were focusing more on the outside than the inside but member Rebecca had a nose ring temporary she had bracelets she had earrings but yet all these of her descendants had the same things but they had more then more adornment so they went overboard with it and in chapter 4 out of here I read Isaiah chapter 4 let's go there it's a really short chapter but God said he's gonna destroy all that foolishness of the women out of Israel and the remnant that would be left would be holy so there is a striking judgment against these daughters of Zion with their 21 accessories on striking so see there's the balance you have a godly woman to Rebekah remember they prayed Oh let her be the mother of thousands and millions the Bible said she was such a godly woman a type of the bride of Jesus Christ who had these bracelets now the other idea too is that they might have only worn them at the time of engagement or wedding that's another thought I've read in some of the historians maybe they had these bracelets and nose ring and earrings but they only wore at the time of their engagement or a wedding that was another thought because it was kind of like money so this I got a little more to study on this you know because a lot of times they didn't have the same currency so the countries would they have to trade with something so this was like money to them this jewelry okay yeah Isaiah 4 sorry this is a short chapter I read it myself on Tuesday yesterday and in that day seven women shall take a hold of one man saying we will eat our bread and wear our apparel only let us be called by the name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel to the escaped ones and this should come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remained in Jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem when the Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion see God said they have 21 accessories on I'm gonna wipe away their filth to see the to much jewelry / it was a sign of a moral heart yeah right pride and that's what they had that haughty spirits they were prideful they stretched out their necks they went mincing as they go can you picture these I'm an awful one D you be the picture but they had their bottoms that's what high heels making you they stick out your bottom then they could push out your chest to get your center of balance right to make a stretch out your neck and God said this filthiness is gonna be wiped out of Israel and when the Lord shall wash away the filth of dollars of Zion and shall purge the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning and the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night fro upon all the glory shall be a defense all right now the Bible said they had wanton eyes that means wandering lustful flirt Falaise so can you picture them what are they they're modern-day harlots right modern-day prostitutes they're trying to tempt men with their eyes they're stretching out their necks they've got all kinds of jewelry on all kinds of all kinds of accessories on too much and they had prideful hearts look at us and see the whole time Isaiah was saying repent repent they had a prophet there just like we've had amen a prophet saying repent and they rejected the Prophet and they dress themselves up in their day of judgment just like Jezebel instead of humbling themselves in day their judgment they put more emphasis on the out words than the inward okay so nose rings so see nose rings you got a good one got a bad one see see how there's a balance there must be some area of Liberty then and there is but if someone walks in here with a nose ring I'm not going to say anything but if they ask me about it I'm gonna tell them this it was temporary it wasn't through the skin and did not shed blood it did not make a mark a pearly mark because God put permanent marks upon slaves that rejected freedom that's what God did and even God put a natural mark on Cain number that he said go out for the presence of Lord you're gonna be mark I can't bear this he said you gotta bear it anyway right he said you'll bear it we saw it let no man kill you any man that kills you you know you'll be cursed seven more times to see permanent marks on the skin and body are not usually a sign of righteousness okay there's my hour so I'll give me five minutes I'll just find a place to close necklaces and bracelets I got that earrings and then high heels and tattoos I got those left let's just do high heels since we're that let's just do that one okay Isaiah chapter three let's do that Isaiah 3:16 Moe over the Lord said because the daughters of Zion are haughty that means prideful that means they went their way instead of God's way their ideas and their passions are more important than God's Word and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes flirting eyes walking and mincing that short steps mincing means short little steps and making a tinkling with their feet therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion and the Lord will discover their secret parts in the day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and that why women like to wear high heels makes them feel more powerful they're so powerful in their eye heels I know what happens at my school when I hear that walking down the hall I'm like Oh who's coming down now to talk to me because it in pot they feel empowered what do they feel they feel a lot manly they feel power because I make noise when I move and I'm somebody to be recognized and that's it that is the complete opposite of modesty modesty means pushing attention away that's totally immodest drawing attention to yourself now my shoes make noise when I walked down the hallway because they go squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak but it's not tinkle tinkle tinkle tinkle tinkle you look at me I've got power I'm somebody important I'm somebody special no you're not you're just like all the rest of us all right it's pride its pride and God said I'll judge you for that the pride now let me close with a few more thoughts on high heels so of course the words high heels are not in the scripture but clearly mincing is in Scripture which is what high heels produce and the stretched forth next I was looking at a few pictures from some medical journals online you can look up medical journals and they show how it makes women put their bottoms out their chest forward and it makes them stretch forth their neck that's exactly what it does Church and that's what scientists and researchers are discovering but God already told us about it thousand two thousand years ago three thousand years ago sorry three thousand years ago because the Bible said there's nothing new Under the Sun it's already been done it's just the same demons in a little different perversion it's the same exact thing now and I found articles and I talked to brother Scott Walker I don't know if he and his family are watching if they are god bless you but I called him on the phone I said brother you're a podiatrist so he knows all about the feet he's a foot doctor I said what do you know about high heels and just kind of paraphrase he said in every book I've read all the books say that it's the absolute worst thing a human can put on their feet and yet they still do it because they're insane they've got demons there they're destroying the body that God gave them and the articles I read said this they said high heels puts excess stress upon the foot bones and ultimately leads to a change in the musculoskeletal system if you wear them long enough now as watching a few youtube videos and these women were Jewish they converted their proselytes to Judaism and they were from Brooklyn they got these Brooklyn accents and every day and they're just rejoicing all my back doesn't hurt anymore because I stopped wearing high heels oh my legs don't hurt my ankles don't hurt anymore because I stopped wearing high heels you're damaging your own body because it throws off your center of gravity and then the second one I found was an article that proves that men are more attracted to women in high heels because of what it does it pushes out it changes it changes the curvature of your spine and it pushes out the bottom more and pushes out the front more and it stretches forth their necks it does that and then I think it was 85% of men from their study found a woman in high heels to be more attractive now that's an unconverted man right now the flesh of a man of course all the men know this your flesh is attracted to it but when you get down to your soul you say that person that woman's filled with demons she's trying to loves mother Graham said every program said every healthy red-blooded man when he sees a sexually dressed woman he said something passes over you and brother's you can say men but you don't have to you can't help it when a man sees a woman who's sexually attractive something passes over him because it's in his genes to do that he's made to reproduce by the RAM says that's what history that's what medical science says - he can't help it but brother have said you can help looking back a second time a man you can't help if I didn't mean to look at it but you can help the next time and that's where you need the power the Holy Spirit to look the other way and maokai witnessed the power of the Holy Spirit on memmer Monday maokai we're in the barber shop he's getting my old haircut off you know and we have a TV and there usually it's nice things but they had a news on and they showed two women doing sexual dances at a basketball game it was a dance-off now they're fully clothed maokai what did i do when that came on everybody starts laughing the whole barbershop what did i do I looked down and I got all serious because I knew if I looked at it I'd start laughing too because my flesh would instantly react to it I saw the first thing when they started dancing as soon as I saw it and I don't even know Malik I was looking at me I wasn't trying to put on for Malik I'm trying to be I knew it was wrong the Holy Spirit in me told me to put my head down they don't look at that see because I I've been around long enough I know if I look a second time or look a couple seconds I'm gonna laugh at it I'm gonna get attracted to it because it's sin that dwells inside Jesse Smith and I'm my own worst enemy I hate you but yet I love you there's times I hate and that was all the times I hate you hombre I'm bringing you under subjection put your head down and I did and I'm so happy I didn't even know maokai was watching me but I got the car he said daddy I saw how you put your head down I just said thank you Jesus see because Christ lives the life if you've got Christ in you you live the life all the men are laughing the women are laughing they're all laughing and then it got real quiet because I think I think they saw me put my head down and the woman women cut my hair changed the subject he said oh oh so how did your preaching trip go down in North Carolina and he got real quiet out of that you see because Christ wants the Holy Ghost to be on display wherever you go you're the only Christ that people are gonna see let's say on our feet here by God's grace so high heels should be avoided get and get shoes that have the least amount of heat on them here's mine that's the most I'm gonna do right there men to women get the lowest heel you can possibly get
