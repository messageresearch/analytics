mercy and His grace how many have enjoy amidst the trial we prove our love to God by conducting ourselves with joy in the middle of the battle and we want to be joyful by the grace of God and all that

the Lord well it's good to be back in the house of Lord praise God and I'd like to continue this wisdom series as I said I'm gonna try to preach 45 minutes this morning I don't want to wear myself out for tonight I'm really nervous this is the most nervous I've been in a while you know since being other than you know guest preaching other places you know cuz I'm just a little nervous you know who may show up and and then you know I'm just you know I love people and I would just you know it just burdens me to know that the word I preach is gonna tear up tear them up you know and I don't say that you know in a mean way but it just breaks my heart you know and so we'll see if anybody comes if not but I've been quiet nervous the last few days and I'm quite nervous this morning but just ask God to give me grace and wisdom but I know the Spirit of God will have its way praise God I know that I believe that and just bear with me I'm a little nervous this morning by God's grace so let's look at our scripture Malachi can switch over when you're ready here and I just got some slides here as you've noticed I've been preaching a lot on proverbs and Ecclesiastes so this is part thirteen by God's grace and I'd like to look at today I'd like to look at wisdom expressed in the home so as I read through proverbs as I told you I'm just catching feeis proverbs is not organized by thought it's just all these proverbs that are just thrown in there and you know there are a few chapters that have order you know like proverbs 31 and a few other chapters but most of the chapters are there's just spread out there's wisdom all over the place and so I last week I preached on the poor and I preached Solomon's thoughts about the poor which were God's thoughts right the mind of Christ and I kept picking that up as I'm reading through the scripture and the the next one here was the wisdom expressed in the home life so this one deals with you know parents and and the home and the spirit that we hold in our homes the atmosphere in our homes and all of us have a home aren't you glad for that we heard about this morning how Jose's family don't have a home anymore some of his family members so it ought to make us pray for them but also ought to make us make our homes the best they can be to glorify God so that's the burden I had for this morning I'd like to look at wisdom expressed in the home so the ground in the natural the natural ground must be prepared before you build a building and so this is the wisdom that proverbs gives us about building our homes you know our the life we live in our home is like the building it's like the spiritual building all the things we believe all the things we do all the actions that we allow that's that's the home but sometimes we just we just think about actions rather than what comes before that and what will explain it a little more as we go but the scripture plainly says in Proverbs the ground has got to be prepared first I've never seen the excavators with the bulldozers and they've got to flatten the land and they got him they got to get the roller out and they got to roll over the land and make sure it's nice and and flat and solid because they don't want to lay a foundation if the grounds not settled you not know much I'm not much of a construction worker but but I've seen it myself you know but proverbs gives us this wisdom and this applies to every single person here because you are still building your house in other words you're still living in a house and you still have an atmosphere in your home if you invited open meet my family night over to your home you know today we could go over today and we would walk in and we would feel an atmosphere if I invited you over to my house you would feel an atmosphere and as I said a few weeks ago you know we prayed before a worker came in and he said as soon as he opened the door he felt the wind of love blow past him he said he just felt the Friends of God I thought thank the Lord we want to keep that see because people can have that but then they can lose it if they don't build their home because the Bible said the foolish woman destroys her home by sin by allowing sin in the home or backsliding or something like that we don't want to destroy the home we want to build up the righteousness of the home so the Bible says that I know this is review but it's I'm giving you the thoughts as I said I'm giving you the spirit inspired thoughts that God gave to Solomon and how many believe he was the wisest man outside of Christ and so let's pay it let's pay attention of these and let's really examine our home life because as you remember from our text that's gonna be the whole but I'm sorry that's a great evidence that someone is born again is because of their home life how they live in their home life is their oil the dwelling of the wise you better believe there's oil in the Holy Ghost field home you better believe the Holy Ghost dwells in a Christians home but the foolish person they spend it up they don't have Holy Ghost that lasts all the days of their life so we'll look at that too so look what look at the Bible says prepare that I work without and make it fit for thyself in the field so how many have a work they're gonna do for the Lord how many are doing a work for the Lord you know you might be a mother a grandmother grandfather you're doing a work for the Lord how you're influencing somebody that's your work for the Lord but the but the field must be prepared the ground must be prepared and the Bible says prepare the ground first the field and then afterward build the house and I know this kind of goes back to you know repenting and your your conversion your salvation but we can apply it to fixing how many ever had to fix up your house I've never seen sometimes your foundation needs fixed haven't anyone ever seen that I've seen the construction workers lift up a whole foundation and then re fix something under the house and then lay it back down or maybe just replace the foundation maybe they took the house off that foundation put it on a new foundation so don't don't say this well oh well he's not preaching to me I'm preaching to everybody this morning this is applicable to everybody because before we build we got to make sure our hearts are prepared and understand what we're building in other words what kind of life we're gonna live in our home remember this is not my thought like I said I just I'm read these I've got through it twice and I read through progress twice now in the last few months and just seeing what the Holy Spirit would would illuminate to me so if building is obeying so when you obey the Word of God it's like building another part of your home it's like adding another addition renovating it so if building is obeying then preparing the heart would be giving God your will preparing the the ground will be giving God your will surrendering everything to him in other words cutting off your desires because the Bible says circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more a stiff-necked so preparing the field is like preparing the heart and any desire that goes against the Word of God has to be cut off first then build upon it then Victor foundation let the heart be circumcised first so in other words first get any desire that goes against the word first make sure that's out of your life totally make sure it's all gone like like you like for example you couldn't believe my testimony if I said oh I'm done with cigarettes but yet I keep a few packs just in case I need a smoke right or I just I'll keep a few of my worldly movies that I really liked you know I really liked this person or something like that not really and that good because that really wouldn't be preparing the heart would it it really would be cutting often and separating yourself from everything it wouldn't be a true circumcision of the heart the ground wouldn't fully be prepared so the Bible gives us wisdom prepare the field then build prepare your heart so see that's why I hope you pray this morning did you pray and say Lord prepare my heart for the Word of God see then if you did then you can hear the word and you can apply it to your life and you can keep building the house of God amen hallelujah because remember the Bible says God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you we've all met many people around the message that leave the message they obey the message for a while but when they leave it shows they never obeyed from the heart they never really thought well the word is really above everything else because that's what it proves their hearts never surrendered to the will of God I don't know how they can hear you know brother Graham's tapes for all those years hear I'm crying and weeping and begging people to come to the altar and and hearing the da-- sermons yesterday I was this in a way of a true prophet and women in the prayer line are just screaming out because God is discerning their lives and telling their secrets and they're rejoicing being healed I don't know how somebody can listen to that and then go back to rock and roll and sexy women with high heels on and a rock concert with paint and face and worldliness and jokes and cussing behind the pulpit I don't know how people can do that but the way the way they do is because they never obeyed the word with their heart they never fell in love with the word they knew was right they obeyed from the mind but they never obeyed from the circumcised heart you never can ever say Amen they built their foundation upon sand instead of upon a rock amen it's exactly right and this is why so see Solomon gives us wisdom we've got to prepare the ground first it's got to be a heart that's fully sold out to the Word of God I love Jesus so much I never want to hurt any other Christian praise the Lord I heard last week brother been so inspired right to preach the Word of God to us we must have tender kindness towards one another glory to services of that telling us to show kindness and love and respect if anybody should love you it should be the people in this room and I'm not talking and pretend love or buying your love with gifts that's in Proverbs to people by your your love with gifts and that's not a true friend proverbs says it's not gifts it's the giving of love it's the giving of truth so can I break after you can see how this applies you're like anybody see how this applies okay before you build on to your house before you build on to your character before you build on your testimony you have to make sure the fields prepared the heart is prepared that you're going to obey all the word because of your love for the word that you don't have you cut off any desire to do anything wrong so this is wisdom in the home wisdom in the home the Bible said wisdom is actually what builds your house it's wisdom and so see the foolish virgin could never really build a true House of holy ghost wisdom because they're not born again in other words their life their home life will be different than someone who is born again there has to be a difference there has to be some kind of difference if God calls one wise and one foolish there has to be a difference between how they live in their home praise the Lord there has to be a difference because the Bible said through wisdom is in house builded a member wisdom is skillful living you skilled by the by the leadership of the Holy Spirit you choose to do this and you don't do that you choose to obey at the right time the right way and you reject temptation and by understanding it is established and by knowledge which means the sermon or skill or perception by knowledge shall the Chamber's be filled with all precious and pleasant riches I remember we just preached on the poor where brother Branham said very few poor people I'm sorry rich people are gonna be saved Jesus said very few rich people are gonna be saved right brother Bram's I know brother have said penny heirs they'll be just as many penny heirs in hell as there are millionaires in hell I understand that too but look what the Bible says the Bible says if you have the discernment of the Holy Spirit your house your rooms in your house will be filled with pleasant and pleasant and precious riches amen so you can go into every room in your house and there's some treasure there I hope you had treasure in your closet recently and I talk in your wardrobe either I'm talking about your Holy Ghost prayer hey that's what I'm talking about see even a closet that's probably my favorite place in our new renovation downstairs although I appreciate my study but there must be treasure in every chamber amen how many say Lord let there be treasure in every room of my house no matter where I go can say this is a place where Christ is glorified there's treasure here there's treasure in our bedroom there's treasure in the children's room there's treasure in the family room there's treasure in the closet there's treasure everywhere in other words we can feel God's presence wherever we are this is what the Bible said God's not promoting everybody to be rich he's saying spiritually spiritually rich let me understand that I never set my timer so I'm gonna put it down to 40 minutes okay I'm guessing maybe I preach 10 minutes so far I honestly don't to wear myself up now there there is something to you know having children in building your house we preach this a few weeks ago and preached on Leah love to the Lord because the Bible said Rache and Leah built the house of Israel so there's something to be said of having children and building your house and and and we know that just not having because any sinner can have children so long with this must come the training of the children to make sure the children are brought into a house where there's treasure in every room there's worship every room is a place where we can worship and glorify God and we can feel God's presence in our home amen so we know it's more than just building naturally and having just physical children we know but that's part of it we know that because Jesus said in those therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them is like a wise man which built his house upon a rock so anytime you do the Word of God you're building the house of God spiritually at your house amen anytime you choose to put on a sermon rather than listen to politics or something there's a place for politics don't get me wrong there's a place for it I was listening to the president a few days ago and I was listening to another conservative the other day but that's not what we mainly feed on that's to be a small thing that we feed on compared to feeding on the Word of God and I don't know if you saw but if you got an iPhone they got its gonna hope it'll help some people in the future they got a new app on here with the new software where it'll tell you how many minutes you spend on every app so now you can get it real you can get a reality check what am i doing on my phone it's my phone glorifying God now we should we don't really need that app because we've got the app of the Holy Spirit we've got the application of the Holy Ghost written in our souls amen we've got that app already I've already downloaded that app gods I should say downloaded to me amen but you understand like if that could be a tool to help somebody to say mine look I've spent all this time am i hearing and doing the word like it ought to like I said the Bible said does do everything in moderation right do the news in moderation do this in moderation listen to that idea listen get that education in moderation but education and politics can never become more important than the Word of God it can't influence us more than the word influences us because remember brother Graham says the only way to know you're an overcomer today is that you're overcoming something halleluiah church we should look at ourselves what am i overcoming my overcoming doubt anger fear loss what am i overcoming we should be overcoming something amen now it might be like Abraham you might have to wait 25 years to overcome you know 25 years am I going to receive this promise or not you you might be in the long battle we're probably all on a long battle right as far as the rapture is concerned we're probably in a long battle may be the rapture won't be next year five years maybe 25 years we're all in a long-term battle but the point is we've got to be seeing God's presence in our home helping us overcome in our home today that they find the treasures of God in our home when the rain descended when the persecution descended it can say like that when the pressure descended when the temptation ascended upon each one of us and the floods came in Satan comes in like a flood and the winds blew and beat upon that house it fell not for it was founded upon a rock I don't know about you but every time after I come through a trial and know it's over I just love to get on my knees or raise my hands of God and say thank you for bringing me through that trial I made it through that storm I Amen it seemed like it would never end it was years or or this lasted months and this for so much pressure but God you brought me through it and if you brought me this far I'm going all the way amen we've had a lot of rain storms lately in Doylestown a lot of rain storms our power went out one time last month but it's so beautiful to walk out afterwards the next morning and the sun is shining and bright but the night before there's lightning and and rain and splashing and like a little flood coming off the road into our driveway and it's so refreshing to walk out and say praise God the storms over and we're still standing amen and that's what we must have in our homes hearing the word doing the word that's what wisdom does wisdom takes the word you hear and applies prepares your heart and applies it to your life and builds upon your life in your home glory so this applies to everybody what are you building today today you're gonna build upon your house did you know that you're gonna go home and you're gonna build upon your house today how many understand that you're either gonna go home and obey the words of God something you heard today or Wednesday or something you've heard something you read in your Bible this morning you're either gonna apply that to your life or reject it we've got to make sure everyday wisdom build her house in our house amen look what the Bible says this is a nice now this is a flowchart here so let's read this a wise man is strong how many know the Holy Ghost filled believers are strong a wise man or woman is strong yay a man of knowledge increases strength so the Bible said Holy Ghost though people are strong and then they will keep getting stronger amen if thou faint in the day of adversity thy strength is small you see so if we are fainting it's time to ask God Lord forgive me I don't know why I'm fainting show me why I'm fainting give me strength to overcome in the day of adversity if our house is falling if we feel like our testimonies not where it should be then we should go to God and say God for my heart changed my heart give me strength that I can overcome the temptation and stand in the day when the storms and floods come so see strength I think my I think my flowchart was strength came from wisdom but wisdom came from obedience so it all boils down to obedience obeying the word that you read in your Bible obeying the word you hear brother Branham preach obeying the word that I preach your brother banner brother Joe Adams whoever it is obeying that word when you obey it gives you wisdom and then the Bible said the wisdom gives you strength so if we don't feel strong lately well I've had a tough week I've been weak well here's the way to get back what if we not obey what if what little thing have we left undone where we failed to obey coz once we obey that'll give us wisdom and then that will produce strength I'm gonna appreciate the book of Proverbs I find so much wisdom practical wisdom in Proverbs I like to preach it too I like this now here's where each one of us now especially the men need to pay attention on this one but it's for everybody he that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart now trouble--the means to stir up or disturb or calamity think about how these men trouble their own house right akin what'd he do he was the head of the family he was the father the family he allowed sin he snuck sin in his personal life he brought in the home everybody knew about it they knew where was buried and he inherited the wind did he not you so to the wind you reap the whirlwind I preached on that a few months ago to think about Eli he did the same thing he never removed his sons from serving God they were not fit they were living in sin he never corrected his children like they ought to been he didn't go to the full lengths of discipline can I say like that we've got the fully discipline our children I'm not talking child abuse I'm not talking that I'm talking doing fully what the Bible says when it comes to disciplining children correcting them putting them in a position where they can succeed in or that where they can obey God in is what I want to say are we giving them the position to obey God if they're in other words if they're causing people to stumble are we taking them out of that atmosphere because that's what Eli didn't do his sons were causing other people to stumble they didn't like coming to church the parents should have took him them out of that atmosphere in order to bless the anointing or in the congregation praise God and we all know a lot what he did he looked down there and saw my Sodom looks like a Garden of Eden I'm gonna be rich down there and so he moved his family away from the messenger of the hour right and lived amongst a bunch of heathens homosexuals violent murderers con artists all kinds of things so who is responsible the leader was responsible for that and this is like I said plain wisdom right there he that troubles his own house I don't want to bring I don't want to bring calamity to my house I want to bring peace to my house and who's got the power to do that you and I got the power do that you and I we're gonna bring something into our home amen hallelujah we're they're gonna bring more the Holy Ghost into our home we're gonna bring Babylon Goods into our home we're going to bring something into our home we're gonna bring trouble in or we're going to bring the victory of God into our homes praise the Lord because we all know all works have repercussions right all of our decisions have repercussions so if we see like something's wrong we got to go back and see where did it go where to get off where was the decision I made that didn't please God that caused trouble to come into my house because the Bible said that's what happens we trouble our own selves right we stir up we disturb the Peace of the Holy Spirit we just we stir up sin in our homes by what we allow in our homes we can't point our finger and say well that's you did this and you did that let's point our fingers back at ourselves let's put all ten on ourselves right all 10 what can I do have I troubled my house or my being a blessing to my house now here's where are we got our text from by God's grace and I preached this her brother Samuels a few weeks ago when he had me fill in form there I kind of ended the sermon with this but I I've been mentioned this all throughout but see as I read the book of Proverbs like I said a second time I just catch these things about house and dwelling and home and all these things I want to bring these out tear in the house of the righteous is much treasure but the revenues of the wicked is trouble so if a family is really living righteously before God there should be much treasure in your home and we know that's not physical treasure that's not pirate's gold right that's not a treasure chest of gold from oh you'd see a prawn a pirate ship that's not the treasure we're talking about we're talking about the treasure of the character of Jesus Christ because the Bible said where a man's heart is that's where his treasure is also so our hearts especially the leaders of the family especially as men our hearts should be focused on our home that our home produces the treasure of God in our character but also that in our home we can learn how to store up treasures in heaven teaching our children to pray teaching our children to give to the poor praise God teaching our children to love the Word of God and listen to the Word of God and hear the word of God and sing the songs of Zion teaching them showing them the treasure look at this treasure at sea when when we worship God we're showing the children this is what we this is what we love we love the Word of God when you listen to brother Branham in your home your children are hearing oh my dad loves brother Branham my mom loves us into brother branham my mom loves singing to worship Jesus you see they're they're noticing what treasure are we storing up in our homes what are our rooms and chambers fill with is it filled with argument and debate is it filled with depression and sadness loneliness is it filled with discouragement and hate and fear discontentment wonder what our chambers fill with it ought to be filled with the love of Christ the treasure of God like brother and said go buy me a bottle of love go buy me a bottle of gentleness and self-control go buy me a bottle of the virtues of God it's you can't buy it for money you can only buy it with a spiritual transaction where you sell out the things of the world and you purchase God's love amen buy the truth and sell it not the Bible says it has to be a spiritual transaction and then in the house of the righteous then you find treasure see so many people they make the wrong decision they let things come in their house to make their children happy but if that doesn't make God happy it's not a treasure it's a curse in the house praise God because there's in the house of the righteous godly treasure the virtues of God here's the one we read for today there's treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise but a foolish man spends it up isn't that just like the foolish virgin they ran out of oil they did not have any oil to last into the night because remember they were is waiting out there they're waiting to go in the wedding perception reception rather because you know this I was listening to brother Donny Reagan preached it last week but he was going through the history of Matthew 25 and I appreciate it too but the bride never knew when the bridegroom was coming they kind of knew what time it was but the bridegroom had to get ready and then they cried go ye out to meet him then they knew the bridegroom was coming out and they had to go out and join the procession that was going to the bride's house right and the foolish version didn't have the oil to go out they didn't have a light to - they didn't have a lamp to light their way they didn't have the oil to light their way and Jesus said I am the way men the baptism of Holy Ghost is the way to the procession to the rapture and the Bible said there's treasure and oil and the dwelling of the wise that means a person who's born again will live the Christian life at church and in their home like we preached on Wednesday preparing we've got to prepare to come in the Friends of God we've got to prepare that member from Wednesday it's really had to have beaten oil they had to have beaten oil they had to take time at home and they had to stomp on the the olives until oil flowed out of the olive that they had to catch the oil in the jar after stomping on the oil and then there to catch then they could take that out of the church and then the priest could work with it and they could light it up and they could contact God amen and that's how our lives are we've got to pray you know we're not really you want to stomp on Devils at home that's wonderful you want to stomp when you pray I recommend getting on your knees and stomping on Devils that's what I recommend but it's the picture of stomping on the are on the olives rather to pull out the oil and then bring that anointing that you have bring that feeling that you have about more of God and loving God bring that feeling to church and watch how God's presence is more easily felt amongst us hey man hey man because remember the Nicolaitans spirit is to get all the anointing up to the pulpit so nobody but so because nobody else thinks they have any anointing we want to say well brother just we want you anointed that's great I want to be anointed too but you all should be just as anointed as I am and the church said I can show you a quote Ram said that I preached that before here well Ram said doesn't matter how anointed I am how much I pray in the spirit and get close to God it will do no good unless you're you don't have the same anointing but where does this anointing start if we're not bringing anointing I know where it's got to come it's got to start in your home praise God it's got to start in my home I've got to start having more oil in my home we all do and bring it into the house of God amen it's exactly right I come across some thus saith the Lord quotes on prayer I'm gonna preach those soon if the Lord o let me they have just shocked me I just stood at my computer this morning I said what brother Branham said that it's thus saith the Lord about prayer so God give us wisdom to go forward how many want God's wisdom to go forward amen so this scripture shows the value of saving in the natural I'm not much of a saver in the natural huh I'm more of a spender but my wife's an excellent saver that's why we're perfect for each other because she's my saving side she's a part of me but it also shows the value of the preserving or saving or the maintaining or the trimming or the refilling of the Holy Ghost in the spiritual because the natural is a lesson to the spiritual so in other words the natural man what he's got you know all these bottles of oils you know saved up here he's got you know we can use them he can use them for healing you know like the Samaritan oil pour oil and wine on the wounds they've got cooking oil they don't use the ball or they always make sure they got plenty of oil and that's how we should be we should always make sure I got any of love for God I've got plenty of zeal for God I've always got more for God I want to do more for Jesus praise God I've already I've got this seal of God in my soul and I know I'm sealed to the day of redemption I'm a serving Jesus all the days of my life no matter what comes or goes I am treasure in the house and they can point to the treasure look at the oil and we can say look in our lives look at our hearts look at our desires look at the things that we love and see and worship and how we sing and praise God look at the oil in my house amen glory that's all we all need we should be able to say look at the oil look at the treasure in my home because remember we can all walk in our home and see what we value right what's influencing us what are we getting influenced by the foolish man he doesn't value it well I don't have to listen to brother branham all the time or I don't need to sing all that time I don't know I don't need to pray that much but see they just make an excuse it's just an excuse to limit God limit God limit God and then live in a foolish way now I want to encourage the sisters kind of along the lines where we breach on the proverbs 31 woman have the children having their needs met is an absolute treasure how many understand it's an absolute treasure we know a sister focuses on her her calling in life to bring forth children and she meets the needs of children that's an absolute treasure to them so sisters be encouraged you are doing something great for the Lord you're preparing the next generation amen remember she rises while it is yet night and giveth me to her household and a portion to her maidens she's the one getting up in the middle of night right she's the one man you get up in the middle night and help with your daughter's now I don't answer I'll be the first one to say it's not me see she's got the burden she's got the burden for her her home she's the one that's rising up and that's a treasure I'm thank God for that a treasure she's such a burden such a burden she can rise at any hour and she's all right they're johnny-on-the-spot right I said like this instant in season out of season that's the that's the scriptural definition for johnny-on-the-spot instant in season out of season look at this mother she's so instant see you need I wake up I go fix it I go help someone I go minister to somebody that's a treasure she's not afraid of the snow for a household for Oliver householder Clovis Scarlett she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple member she she dresses herself in a godly modest way the best that she has is the blush she wears she wears the best that she has her family's prepared that's a treasure some people don't have that she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness so see she look is she steak she's keeping a spy on the home right she's spying out how the children doing how's this going how's that room going she's keeping a lot she's observing the atmosphere around the home how many can say amen to that the sisters are looking they're watchin the atmosphere how's the atmosphere look here is it pleasing to the Lord is every room is there treasure in every room where we can glorify God in no matter which room we go in am i watching it closely this is a great treasure how many leave it's a great treasure it's a great treasure now here's something I want to help us out too if anybody's got a loud house it's me at times but I'm talking about the quietness of the Holy Spirit on this one if you want to talk about a loud house when I was growing up I had five boys one girl my four older brothers and I we played literal basketball inside of our house and we would hang up a rim and we would dunk on that rim we would like nailed into piece of wood dunk on it until it breaks the wood and we would play football and so anyhow had loudness in it was our house be I want to come down to prayer you better believe my mom got it quiet to pray whether she had to spray us with vinegar or whatever she had to do and look what turned out of it she got three preachers you know I always use that because that's an example that I've seen I never we never were planning hey cam you're in a grope when you're gonna be a preacher and bro Simon you're gonna be a missionary we were never planning those things we didn't even know about the message but the investment making sure there was treasure the chambers was the most important thing make sure there's prayer make sure God is honored in every room make sure Christ is the ultimate in our house we spend most of the time in our house focusing on the right things the things of God so look redder is a dry morsel or a piece of bread better have a dry piece of bread sometimes I eat those when my children you know I eat the leftovers better is a dry morsel and quietness there with then a house full of sacrifices with strife this is what we're saying earlier a fool will bring controversy he'll bring sin into his house he'll compromise on the Word of God disputes arguing quarreling it's better to have just dry stale bread but have the ease or kind of a life it's the peace of God in your home it's better have a little and have peace of God then have all this meat and sacrifices and all this all this great goods and food and all the things you could imagine it'd be better to have just a piece of dry bread and have the peace of God then all the money and riches and anything else you could want in that a blessing that's such a blessing to me just a quiet just a life of spiritual prosperity I can see the children growing in the faith I can see my wife growing in the faith I can see myself growing in the face hey glory that's the quietness that's the spiritual prosperity we can see we're overcoming we're growing closer to Christ all the time hey hey man the wisdom of the Holy Spirit this is how wisdom is expressed in our homes so see any arguing and he disputes and according we got to get that out we've got our teachers our children to talk out their problems to forgive one another love one another and then we went with our children are busier than we on the phone or we on our emails or we or wherever we are we've got to not have quarrels and disputes and arguments we've got to be children of peace as well blessed are the peacemakers that's what Jesus said blessed are the poor in spirit Oh Lord I'm nothing just help me to be humble now you're getting poor in spirit now I'm getting poor in spirit I've got to lean upon you every hour Lord I I'm a failure at times I'm so weak Oh Lord I'm trusting in the power of the Holy Spirit anoint me for thy will now we're getting poor in spirit amen and those are the kind of people that God lets them inherit the earth hallelujah blessed are the poor in spirit they shall see God amen better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble therewith I wonder how many millionaires would give up their money if they can avoid all the core problems that they have I wonder how many would give it up I've read I forget the the I forget which famous people I read but I read where some of them said they would do that they would give anything if they could just go back to being a regular person said of being famous because of all the the suing and all the all the the greed and lust for their money the Bible says better to have a little bit and feared God better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stop ox and hatred therewith my hot goodness it'd be better to just have a vegetarian meal as long as loves at the table as well and I know our sisters here do that aren't you glad brothers at your sisters when they serve food they're actually serving with love you know I told you I I you you know you know you know and I just you know what a wife was upset serving the food you know what a husband who upset you know coming home from work and upset with each other you want love to be the atmosphere in your home what do you mean we've already had sound three times this week and what works so hard how come you don't have a better meal for me the Bible said it's better have herbs with love than all the meats and steaks and all the chicken and everything you could want love where love is do you feel love in your home do you feel love in your home that's wisdom wisdom will help you create the atmosphere of love in the home not a place of bickering now the place of arguing condemning quarreling it creates love wherever Christ is that's the kind of house I want to live in I believe I live in that by God's grace but I want to keep living in that house this love live at your address here's something that's good for everybody to the treasure of kind words now I'm sure everybody here you know never set a a mean word to anybody at your house right you've never said anything mean you never hurt anybody's feelings at your house I'm sure everybody pretties here it's perfect right this morning the Bible says a soft answer turneth away wrath but grievous words stir up anger I see this all the time at work children will come up to me they'll be upset with somebody else then they'll have they'll be so loud and so and I just say it real back are you sure about that can we talk about that did you ask them to say they're sorry and it did the place like a balloon it just goes like no I didn't ask them to say sorry a soft answer or turn away any wrath in your home how many know parents are like firefighters you always got to put out the fires here's your water right here it's a Holy Ghost soft answer Shh a tender what the Bible call it's a tender weak timid gentle the soft answer turns away wrath it puts out all the fires but the Bible said grievious words so painful words hurtful words offensive words stir up anger and I think you know this too but if you keep giving soft answers the child will eventually calm down eventually calm down or if the person you're within is adult all the time keep giving soft answers eventually they'll cool down but you've got to have a tender weak and timid gentle spirit remember this is how a Holy Ghost filled home looks like I'm preaching a I'm preaching a high life I'm preaching the holy calling of the Lord a soft answer a tender a timid gentle answer turns away wrath how much time they got okay ten minutes all righty proverbs 31:26 this is be another proverbs 31 woman of course she opened her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness so we got soft answers and we got kind words in our tongue kindness how many want that treasure in your house I hope I hope we're not overlooking this treasure this is so valuable church if you can see this this morning it's so valuable in your home to just use soft words kind words pleasing words under God it's a treasure and if you ever lived in a house where there was argument no I other than a few you know there's a few seasons of my life where my parents were arguing a lot and they would yell and they would my dad would you know break things he'd break glass and you know do kinds of things like that you know he sometimes he just he'd do things he shouldn't have done and I I could understand because of that I could understand how valuable kind words are a tongue that always uses kindness instead of rebuke and chastisement an argument and quarrel and strife a were a person who just uses kind words that it's an absolute treasure instead of trying to fight well I'm right well let me tell you about this you're wrong instead of just trying to be right be kind cuz I've lived in houses like that where there is arguing screaming I have gone to bed crying before you know because of the arguing and screaming in the house I have so this is a very valuable treasure and the wise have treasure in their dwellings and ultimately and we know what it comes down to we lose control how many ever lost control he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that's broken down and without walls we've got to control we got to we got to be able to self assess and say we got to be happy we have to be receive the correction the Holy Spirit and say I'm a little out of line here if we get angry easily or if we've got a temper some like that we've got to be able to see oh I'm not ruling over my spirit real well and we've also got to judge the spirits of our children are our children keeping their spirits under control or not if not we've got to be the ones use the law of kindness a soft answer to turn away that wrath it's exactly right some of you aren't there yet but you're gonna get there I know bangs not there he's gonna get Adam embo I know they're gonna get there they got little ones on the way go get there it's gonna take and now's the time to store up the treasure in your heart now it's time say to pray they say God give me the give me the law of kindness in my heart give me the fruit of the Spirit and give me all these things and those of us who have children we know we just want more of it by God's grace we know every day is gonna be a battle Satan's gonna come back and try to battle here and there that's okay because although Satan comes and go God always stays in our house amen he promised I'll never leave you forsake you amen we had that confidence but we've got to rule over our spirits and help the children to learn how to rule over their spirits amen so we know brother Branham taught that we need a family altar so where's your family altar where's the place where your family gathers to worship God everybody should have a place like that praise God you should have a family altar place where the family comes together just like the days of no he gathered his family around there after they got of the ark and they made a sacrifice unto God Abraham did the same thing he went to Egypt he came back to the grier there and he established an altar where he and his family would worship God family worship is one of the most crucial things you can do as a parent establish your altar and that's where problems can be talked about that's where you can give them wisdom and understanding and forgive and pray together and sing together and worship read the Bible together answer questions that's one of things I love the most about family altars answering the kids questions I'd love to hear what questions they have and then being able to try to point them to the Bible's answer so we got to have an altar that's that's up that's certainly a treasure now look at this here this is and this and I'm not preaching on just women today Church to understand I'm I'm not attacked like brother Ben said last week out I'm not a woman beater you know I'm not that I'm not a man beat her either I'm a Satan beater I like to beat up evil spirits amen but I just I'm bringing out scripture because it relates to the house I'm wringing out scriptures that relate to the home for these strings the three things the earth is disquieted which means a jeté 'td and 4 for which it cannot bear serve at humi reigneth I'm sorry when he reigneth and a fool when he's filled with meat for an odious woman when she's married and a handmaid that is heir to the mistress so all for these things the earth is agitated in other words it creates you know a bad atmosphere so a hateful woman now this could be a hateful woman it's hard to live with a hateful wife it's hard to live with that hateful husband could anybody say amen to that and that that disquiets the earth it adds it deserves the whole atmosphere and so again instead of hateful the opposite would be a loving a loving husband a loving wife a spirit of love would please the earth amen is God these all relate to your home a continual dropping is a very in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike so see constant trouble constant arguments constant concert it could be it can be man or woman I'm not preaching on either one preach on both if there's just constant struggle constant battle constant discouragement or or constant arguments something's wrong it shouldn't be constant there should be times of peace there should be treasure in every chamber but the Bible speaks of this constant nagging constant battles constant there shouldn't this constant battle should be should be stopped it should be solved by the power of the Holy Spirit because the Bible said be anger you can be angry you don't sin let not Sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil if we let our argument continue if we let it roll over if we let the children continue to argue and fuss and let it carry over and over again we've given a place to the devil and the Bible said the earth is disquieted for that we've got to get it under the blood of Jesus we don't want continual frustration continual battles continual quarreling continue that should be stopped by the treasure in your house the oil in your house I like this God help us do this if thou has done foolishly lifting up thy self or if thou has thought evil lay thine hand upon that mouth as soon as you have a bad thought I have to cover our mouth wherefore my beloved brother let every man be swift to hear and slow to speak before you judge somebody giving the benefit out well maybe something bad happen to them you don't know why is this person like this I forget last week somebody was telling me something they were complaining about some public figure I said well maybe somebody did something wrong for them and I think it's up and wodsworth I was talking to some stranger and they're like huh I never thought of that like why is this why is this public figure acting out and doing these evil things and I said well maybe maybe God maybe something bad maybe somebody did something bad to them in other words maybe somebody hurt them so they're lashing out on others because their spirits broken so instead of judging them and just persecuting them and condemning them like everybody else might we should lay our hands upon our mouth or give them grace right give them grace speak the truth in love this is how you have treasure in your home houses are riches our inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the Lord now look at this prudent means cautious he's cautious about her decisions she's very circumspect you should you'll make decisions or I'm sure she won't make decisions right away she'll judge things and analyze them and order them to make sure I belong a woman is from the Lord your brothers appreciate a cautious wife hopefully you got some cautiousness and you too that you can wait upon the Lord you can be cautious not jump it the first thing you see or make a quick decision but wait upon the promise of God this is from God Church they say from the devil this from God gives us a woman of caution a woman of preparation and planning a man of planning a man of character a man that will plan things out and be cautious that's from the Lord and where is that exercise is always exercised in our homes always because that's where all the decisions are made right in our homes there's my 45 minutes so let me see how much I got left here oh my hey I like that alright brother I was waiting for somebody to say that I just reset up in a night they shot the brother BAM say he said take all day and the pillar of fire came down at the end of the service mine oh I'm glad the Holy Spirit's here by God's grace god bless you brother let me just I'll just kind of go quickly because this I want to move on past this thought my next thought was dealing with the five W's that solomon stumbled into and i heard a preacher preach it was really good so I'm gonna preach at or willing Wednesday I want to get to that thought okay children listen up children and parents all right thanks Malachi you guys back to go straight there he that passes bhai and medal ahthe with strife belong if not to hit is one like that take of the dog by the ears in other words stay out of other people's trouble I see with my children you know let's say one child did something wrong another one will jump on them and say yeah they did this we don't want to bet on other people's troubles and the church said just let mommy and daddy handle that don't try to condemn them don't jump on the bandwagon of accusation and condemnation you know God help our children and God help us oppress parents too we shouldn't jump in other people's problems we should pray for them also a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity so see that's why God give you sibling so Malachi and Lydia that's that's why you were put here also to help all your little brothers and sisters when they go through hard times there they are and I appreciate how they help so much that's why they're born for the day of adversity to help them out I remember I'd never forgive this is just a silly illustration but I was a senior and I was at my last track and field championship and the year before I won the state title and this year I was hurt I had a little tweak in my hamstring and I was in second place going into my last three jumps and that was so discouraging cam walks over he wasn't even he was a Christian but he wasn't a message leave yet he walks over and he gave me a pump up speech or he pepped me up and he I just felt like I was like a brand-new man I'm like and I had this sleeve on my I was baby in my sword I'm like I take this thing I'm gonna go win this championship and my very next jump I won the championship he was born you know for my adversity and that's just a natural I'll tell you the best adversity I had and I think God my brother was there was when my brother Simon brought the message of the hour to me amen in my hour of adversity in my hour of am I going to go with denominations or where am I going to go how am I gonna serve God God brought me a brother who helped bring me the message of the hour at the moment when I needed it amen that's why brothers born to help you out in the moment of adversity so we need to be help of our helpers to our siblings we need to be helpers to our family the treasure of kur I think I'll go a little bit faster through here I just want to we know how and I've taught on this how you know we need to use correction with a rod we know that but the brand thought that let me show you a balance a little more of a balance to it because I came across this Scripture so see when you correct them with a rod a bamboo stick or whatever you use I used bamboo I don't do it very often anymore because the children are getting so well-behaved that gives them wisdom physical pain some degree of physical pain will give them wisdom the Bible says that the worst thing to do is leave them alone and don't correct them that's the worst thing you can do make sure we correct our children they know they're wrong you were wrong this is the right thing to do correct my son he shall give the arrest yeah you should give him delight into thy soul now here's the scripture now I put that read so I wouldn't miss it so I'm sorry if it you know I don't mean to get out of order but I read this this week and I was so blessed he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at length isn't that beautiful now servants were never supposed to become owners of the the property but the Bible says if you bring up a servant the right way pretty soon you might he want to make him your own son because you brought him up so carefully you were careful look what delicate means you pampered him you treat him delicate in other words you were careful how you treated him you make sure you treat him just like Christ would I thought that was so beautiful this is the balance we've got to use a rod at times or our hand we got to you know use a little bit of a correction but we're course we're not we don't believe in child abuse at all of course not but here's the opposite side if you're careful how you do that the chastening then it'll produce a child that you're very thankful for it'll produce the godly character in them that you want to see how many would say God help me to be delicate as I bring up my children or the future children that you have now this time we don't hear too much it's a rare scripture you don't hear this preached very much but this just means raising them up very carefully was just the right thing to do if I made a mistake I'll go back and apologize my children if it was the right thing praise the Lord I always want to do with the spirit would have me to do like I heard brother Sam hunting preacher one time when I first came to the message he said brother Samuel he's talking about some of my brother to him he said your children are all upset he said you need to spank them and brother Samuel said no it's 12 o'clock at night I need to put them to bed wisdom would tell you they just need to go to bed I could stand here and spank them all day but the reality is they're up too late and that might be the parents fault we need to repent for that or let's say it the late after service you know it's late after Wednesday night at 10:30 if they're acting up you know you don't spank them you got to put into bed you got to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit except I understand you got to have wisdom you got to delicately bring them up I'm not saying every time you know not spank them it depends how the Holy Spirit's leading you now cuz remember the Bible said father's don't provoke your children to anger lest they be discouraged and discourage means they have a broken spear I could never serve god I'm some so foolish I'm so I'm so useless so if we provoke them if so see this is parents who do it on purpose like a dad who would purposely enjoy disciplining his children in the wrong way that will discourage them because the Bible said don't provoke them don't stimulate them too much don't stir them up don't try to get them to feel bad don't embarrass your children right let me can say amen to that well let me show everybody here at the church how great down here come here maokai let me spank your heart you know we're not here to embarrass people we got to be careful our our children don't embarrass each other we can't let I can't let my children embarrass each other because that will provoke them as well I'm trying to get her mad on purpose I'll do this to that I'll get her mad I'll try to get him mad on this or this was that doing tricks like that or you know evil desires and things like that we're not this theorem up we're supposed to be children of peace we don't want to break people's spirits we don't make them feel hopeless and helpless like there's no help we want them to feel the presence of God we want them to see the treasure in our chambers amen the Bible said said he was like a nurse did you know Paul said this did you know he was a preacher and he said we were among you like a nurse cherished her children you ever seen it watching my wife and watch Naomi take care of that baby there that's how we should treat one another is that right that's a Paul said as a nurse so nursing mother as she takes care of that baby that's how we should treat one another oh my keep them warm tender love care C withhold not correction from the child now these are the scriptures where people misunderstand if thou beatest him with the rod he should not die thou shalt beat him with the rod and shall deliver a soul from hell but we don't condone child abuse it's a balance it's wisdom and that's not what the Bible's saying but people take it the wrong way chasing thy son while there's hope let not not thy soul spare for his crying gotta do it early and we've got as parents as adults we've got the model and teach repentance if our husband won't repent we've got a model repentance if our wife won't repent we've got the model repentance so they can see what it looks like so they know they can learn how to repent he that covers his sin should not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy amen train up a child in the way he should go when he's old he will not depart from it I got a new thought on this did you know this word trains only used four times in the Old Testament it means to dedicate like when Solomon dedicated the house of the Lord this gives train a brand new meaning it's not telling you no go clean your room go wash your dishes that's not training train the dedication means the sacrifice so training is when you go and do it with your child you make the sacrifice and you show them how to do it time and time and time again that's training up why don't you listen to me I told you to put your clothes on the right way I told you do your hair the right way that's not training that's fussing training is when you take them and you make a sacrifice and you go and offer sacrifice to God and you take the time and you show them exactly how to do it and you do it with soft answer you do it with the law of kindness in your mouth that's training your children it's like all the sacrifice that Solomon offered one after another it was a lit of sacrifice sacrifice and that's what we do must sacrifice ourselves in order to train the children amen there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel Lord shall stand because foolishness is bound in the heart of a child we all have we all had foolishness in our heart right thank God the counts of the Lord shall stand thank God now look at this even a child is known by his doings whether his work be pure or whether right so see our children if they're not doing right we've got to help them do right that's why if my child wasn't doing if Malachi wasn't in the computer right I neither get him off the computer and I go sit down there and show them how to do the computer which I already did but if he wasn't doing it right I'd do that to him because that's what the Bible says our children aren't gonna be known by their works so they're gonna be known their work show how well we train them so his face faithfully trainer faithfully sacrifice and help them there do it the right way now I'm gonna skip I'm just gonna have to close here I'm I appreciate that you want me to preach all day I do I do but let me let me find ya there's treasure and training yeah let me I'm just gonna close with that mom we stand our feet here I'll just make sure I close that's we're preparing the next generation yeah let's say North Pier because the Bible said there's going to be a generation that curses their father and mother and does not bless their mother they're going to be pure in their own eyes yet they're not washed from their filthiness there's going to be a generation how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids not lifted up there's a generation whose teeth are swords and their jaw teeth is knives to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among men why would a child curse their own mother and father the only answer would be that they didn't follow the Word of God all the Scriptures we just show you soft soft words soft answers kindness spending time with your children showing them how to do a training that making a sacrifice spending that time with them not just telling them telling them telling them but showing them with love in our hearts wisdom is expressed in her home and when like a proverbs 31 woman when we do that the Bible said the children arise and call the parents blessed oh my mom was a blessing to me all my father was a blessed I'm sure Naomi can say that he raised a little heart I know I could say that about my mom and my dad to some degree you know I can say that all there's such a blessing in this way that way but all this must be done first there must be treasure in the house of the wise praise the Lord yeah brother Branham said I didn't get this quote up there but brother Branham said we've got to leave footsteps if there is another generation we've got to train them we've got to show them how to walk and the way we show them is live it in our homes amen let's stop right there by God's grace now Kai if you'll come here thank the Lord praise God let's bow our heads here I like to just help you pray with you by God's grace as we bow our heads let's think about our home life here again this is a you know that came to me as I read through this a couple times and think about our home is is our home a place where love dwells is there more love and patience and forgiveness and mercy or some of our arguments and quarrel and strife bitterness [Music] anger the Bible said there's treasure to be desired and oil in the house of the wise and you know the quote brother branham said there's things we got a kick out of our house because the token cannot be present in our house when those things are in our house the token is the love of God I'm gonna say brother just pray for me how many raise your aunt's they pray for me that my house can be a house where oil is pray that there can be treasure in every chamber or bless those things please pray for me I'll pray for you Father in heaven Lord you saw the hands Lord God Lord it's better to be at a table there's dry bread and love and the table filled with food and quarreling and strife and bitterness
