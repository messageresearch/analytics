========================================

to uh jeremiah 29 i'd like to go back to this little series here just doing a short series on this how to know god's will for any promise of god we'll look at part three today i just kind of look at the thought of desperation this morning i was we drove about a thousand miles this week you know so a lot of time listening to sermons and uh i was listening to desperation i listened to it twice yesterday while driving just a beautiful message just like to bring out some thoughts from there about how to know god's will for any promise of god jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11. the other man read this scripture and he says isn't that sweet about how sweet god is how kind god is praise god jeremiah 29 11. let's all read verse 11 and then i'll read verses afterwards just for myself but let's just read verse 11 together if we can all three one two three for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts i'll read that then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart and i will be found of you saith the lord praise god my god has blessings reading his word i'd like to look at his thought on how to know god's will for any promise of god i'm just going to review just real briefly part of one and two thank you again for the wonderful service wednesday night yeah i asked simon was it monday sunday night i asked him brother do you think you could come minister and i apologize for the short notice it seems like god just has everything right in time praise god so very thankful for what god did praise god so thank you for amazing uh so we looked at you know a few uh i have some quotes here uh whenever you're ready we looked at some numerous thoughts here on this uh subject here skip down here we've mainly looked at how to know god's will and it of course involves a lot of uh waiting on the lord praise god so i we started off with looking at divine healing and and we kind of went through uh brother graham's suggestions on how to find the will of god for divine healing and so brother and has confessed all sins that's what the book of james says confess your faults one to another pray for another that you may be healed amen so it all starts with confessing and uh sins and you know asking for forgiveness and forgiving others and then we're to ask for god's perfect will in being neutral we're not to tell god what to do and god's not our air and boy god doesn't do what we want him to do god does what he wants to do and so it takes a lot of humility to learn that that we don't we don't tell god what to do you know we have to be patient you know in fact my brother man was preaching a statue of perfect man uh when he got to patients he said let me start with patience he said patience with who patience with god yes so the very first thing he says about being patient is you and i must be patient with god because we feel like you know sometimes we treat our our heavenly father like our natural mother or father like i need it now i got to have it now but god god is divine and god is eternal and god knows the right season when you need that praise god of course you know earthly parents can have a measure of that now that's good brother rams first statement is have patience with god hallelujah and then if god reveals it then you just accept it and you act like it so brother and says even if you're sick and god reveals that you're going to be healed act like you're well that's what i like for jose's testimony amen i've already got a new heart amen i'm already my heart's already back to normal praise god that's beautiful now if it doesn't come or even it does come you have to wait and seek the channel for it to come in it might be through you know the laying out of hands it might be through anointing with oil it might be through a prayer cloth might be through a prayer or a dream uh it might be through a sermon you never know when the answer is going to come praise god but you've got to be patient and wait for the will of god amen so i just want to just briefly hit a few of these here and uh so promises are to those who god ordains in his perfect will and we saw that uh we know we know salvation and divine healing are offered to everybody but not everybody will receive it right amen that's what brother hannah taught us we know we say it's for everybody he says we offered everybody but we know not everybody will receive it yeah right and so you know in my pastoral ministry uh i preach it like uh you know god's promises are to you and god will ordain them in the perfect season of your life amen praise god in other words i wish every time everybody came up for prayer you got exactly what you needed right when you come up yeah right it make me feel good as a pastor but that's not how god works amen god makes us wait praise god god makes us all sweated out a little bit praise to trust him and learn to be patient with him praise god so we're all learning that um and uh i'm just going to skip down here to hit some of the highlights here brother matt says some people have more struggle than others when waiting for the promise of god that's what we're looking at today with desperation i thought i spent more time on that one and then we also looked at love and charity and things like that we're going to look more at that today uh in part one we looked at uh how even if you have the love of god you can hope for any answer to prayer you should you should hope in god the bible said hope maketh not ashamed so we never should feel bad when we're hoping for god to move we should never be ashamed of that praise god in fact the bible says if we're hoping the right way the bible says the strength of the lord will be renewed in us like an ego amen amen praise god amen that's when the strength comes like an ego as you're waiting as you're learning to trust in jehovah god amen right that's when it comes praise god and we saw all the great miracles god's been doing among us lately the testimony three four five six just seven of them right there and then also my wife oh she's not in here uh did i tell you this did she testify about god healing her knee okay so when brother brian was here my wife and had uh brian hawkins my wife had knee pain for a while and uh was just concerned about it and i said i said something been passing like maybe we'll go to the doctor or something like that that's what i would do you know what normally most of us would do and we got a pain and go see what the doctor says he'll give you the natural uh remedy right but then god would give the supernatural one praise god nothing wrong with going to the doctor but in fact you should first go to the doctor but iran says that you should go to the doctor but then anyway you know my wife was listening to brother brian preach and this truly is i would just say this is truly a blessing as well because you know if you have little children it's even hard to hear any of the sermon any moms can say man out there we got the little ones i mean the real little ones well anyways in the very few words that she actually heard of the service brian ryan said something about divine healing she came up for prayer and she said it hurt you know just even to sit down and just sit in different positions it would always hurt and she said after brother brian prayed the next day it was almost gone and now all the pain's completely gone so i could add an eighth uh eight testimony up there thank you for that right now [Applause] so again it's in god's time and season right it's in god's time in season i'm just gonna uh you know we prove our love to jesus by no matter what the situation we give them glory and then we looked at last time how we must get in the spirit right if we want to know god's will get in the spirit and we found that seeking god is actually the answer to every question in our lives how many can say men do that you know as a preacher you know you always want new thoughts like fresh thoughts you know for the people but ultimately it's always going to come down to this praise god it's always going to come down to if i want to know god's will if i want to hear god's voice i've got to seek god i've got to set my face towards god and i must seek god amen that's really what the answer comes down you know we talked about over the years you know the different special meetings churches have uh the conferences they have the youth meetings they have and people have all these wonderful supernatural things but ultimately ultimately it comes out of this each person has to repent of their sins and get and seek god and then in seeking god now many times god will answer those requests because people make such great sacrifices to go to those special meetings right right they'll cross states they'll cross the nation they'll cross some of them will go continents uh like that one uh florence sherlock uh foreign talked about what's her what is that full name of that foreign i can't think of the name but anyways the woman who's like a skeleton on the picture right her family had to take her uh was it south africa or it's nightingale sherlock yeah that's right of course that's right thank you and then the picture of her she looks like an absolute skeleton she was 30 pounds as a woman and brother brandon had to make a stop in england and they brother brother ram said tell brother bosworth i can't go see her there it is yeah yeah hold it up can you everybody look at that that really skinny woman right there who was dying brother jose he's always got the pictures good job he probably got an eagle belt buckle on this morning too right now yeah yeah that one did too i think it was she's from south africa we're not mistaken brother was in england that's when he prayed for the king of england oh wow yeah she was 30 pounds and then six months later she said brother branham can you come to south africa and he's like i can't because he had all these meetings scheduled there in uh in england and uh so her family paid for her to fly up on a cot yes they flew all the way from south africa across the continent up into uh england right and you know the story man goes out to pray for her he goes to the window i guess and a dove comes by you know yeah amen i've had that one time i'd come vibrate and i preached there in uh trinidad and we had a real holy ghost move that was just a real it was it came the night before so i knew what to preach the next day priest on the holy ghost tremendous move of god i still got the video of it actually but a dove came down and brother man got the word of the lord she's going to be well and look since she gained over 100 some pounds she was dying i think it was tuberculosis and i was thinking god really gave brother man a favor with tuberculosis you know in terms of god will give us favor with different issues as well maybe it's for divine healing or miracles or or deliverance from addictions you know god will give us special miracles as well praise god because god gives us gifts and gives us those gifts to benefit his people the gifts are not for us they're for other people praise god amen but we find then the answer as we looked at to finding any promise of god was seeking god the bible like god said when it's time you will go out and seek me now that has to mean go out and of course go out of babylon in this case but for us it's gonna have to go out of our normal routine of life and as i said not miss church right but don't skip church to go out and see god because god wants you in church amen that's where god's going to speak to you as well praise god but in your in your time between church that's when you go out and seek god and that's when he'll be found of you and we found our brother and in three cases went and sought the lord and he got answers the first one was where why are these visions coming are they from the devil and he went out to the cave and the angel lord showed him the scriptures how this is how visions come visions come from the lord and like jesus he said i do nothing except the father shows me first amen amen amen so that answered that he sought god and you know he told his wife meeta he said i may die i'm going to stay out there if god don't answer me i'm going to die and that's desperation i have to know why these visions are happening so god had allowed god to allow the course of his life to just have such situation after situation where he he's desperate it's life or death and god had allowed that but many times we see those situations that's when god will show up amen that's right amen that is part of your testimony then if god's bringing to what we would call a breaking point if god's bringing you to a breaking point then that's part of the purpose of life amen that's your time to know that god is going to be there god's going to help you and god's going to guide you and god's going to show you the answers to your heart amen [Music] because god amen you there your footsteps are order of the lord hallelujah amen unless you're choosing your own path and then repent praise god then get back in god's path amen very easy to do and so the second one then uh was when he went to the mission walker people when he saw two men speaking in tongues and interpret one was a real man of god one was an adulterer yeah and i said i understand this and we saw it three times the wind blew the bible open to hebrews chapter six i wonder why the wind's blowing i'll just read this okay oh go back to hebrews six and the third time the third time he got to hebrews six he said there it is yes he said it's like thorns right it's like goodly herbs and thorns both receive the word of god both receive the blessings of god amen and then his question is answered amen now he can discern he said the rain falls on the just and the unjust then he can preach anointed ones at the end time amen a great revelation from god and then thirdly was with the seven seals for a whole week he started with god at brother banks woods house and all he did was eat light and he would just study and pray and he said i would have made a horrible mistake on the seals if it wasn't for the holy spirit coming in about noon time amen church how many times would we make a horrible mistake if god doesn't intervene in our lives that's right he was filled with the holy ghost he was saved he's a prophet he had numerous visions yes but he was going to make a horrible mistake if god didn't intervene but what he had to do he had to shut himself in with god seek god and then the holy ghost came to direct him amen amen so seeking god is always the answer it might be seeking god up here in prayer right it might be seeking god in your home the more the better i'll just say it like that the more you see god the better off you'll be the more answers you'll have to your questions praise god because remember in that sermon now i'm going to just look at a few thoughts here god allows the struggle to bring out your true character okay so you're you're going to have trials you're going to have difficult times and you wonder why it's happening but really we shouldn't wonder because god is he's just allowing you to manifest what's on the inside of your life that's right amen praise god that's right he's writing his story hallelujah he's the author and finisher of your life story praise god amen and he's writing a story and so the the the trials of life to know the will of god to not make sure you're obeying the will of god that it's a story and god's allowing the trials to bring out you know whenever the stressful times the movies come or the shows that's that's the most exciting part now for us it's not exciting to go through the trials i wish it was i wish we heard an instrumental in the background like oh it's building and pretty soon we're going to get the victory but sometimes it's years sometimes we wait years today we think the crescendo is pretty soon oh we're going to get the victory that's going to be this special meetings going in sometimes they come and go and we're still waiting but the idea is to trust in god oh you know i was looking at brother graham he waited eight years to get his promised joseph i believe joseph's off the word but he's still a good good good man it seems to be eight years and he had uh he had a child in between there sarah yeah so after about four years he thought oh here it is she's pregnant oh it's gonna be a boy and then it was sarah he's like i love her with all my heart and then at that time he thought well maybe billy paul is my joseph i got it on tape yeah yeah he said well billy paul's my joseph because there's not the lord's going to come soon there wouldn't be enough time for this child if it was a boy to raise up and preach anyway but four years later hallelujah glory four years later and people made further around the country and mocked him and said oh you met josephine you know that he said that man died that said that yeah that man died at my ground but four years later she's pregnant again she's like bill is it going to be a boy i don't know i don't know all i know is god's going to give me a joseph eight years amen i was telling brother amen you know with our church i told him this last week i'd always wonder why is our church so small i wonder that for many years probably since we started 2006 all the way up to about 2019 if i'm not mistaken so 13 years i waited why would we have such a small church why is there something wrong with me something wrong with me and that's when god brought in brother ray to give us that word of the lord god brought him in and said i got a word of the lord for you god's keeping your church small to protect you and your family and of course all the saints and god gave a vindication to his sister lydia that it was right and now i can see that god is protecting us right guys god has been very gracious to us praise god let me just say this i'm just going to add a little personal i'm going to add a personal thought here i'm glad we have our own church because some of the churches around here i love a lot of people and i love i mean there's a lot of denominationals around here but the church is within you know numerous hours of us as i've learned to grow as i learned the word and things like that i just couldn't agree with some of their teachings i just couldn't agree i i don't know how in the world i could sit under that some of the things they believe now maybe that's just because i'm dogmatic maybe i don't know but what i just thought yesterday i'm so thankful because some things even like with interracial marriage bro that's one example can you imagine i mean i could not sit under that i'd have to i started my own church that's what we did but we started before we even knew we needed it praise god we started it for the sake of family members getting saved like who amen she's the very purpose we started this church right so our family members would get saved amen amen and because it was hard to drive three hours with one with children crying in the car the whole time every sunday it's hard to do that but as time has gone on i've seen different things and i love everybody and i'm respectful of it but there's just been so many things rise up i'm like i'm thankful we have our own church praise god because when you look to the word of god i see certain things and people might not see it and but all i can see is the revelation god gave to his prophet in the bible praise god hallelujah and so our trial so i waited about 13 years to get the answer for that one at church i would lay here i would lay there i would lay and cry and say god what's wrong what's wrong with me and the whole time nothing's wrong with me god was trying to protect me for 13 years i discussed it like that 13 years i sweated it out is it me am i wrong maybe maybe i shouldn't make youtube videos right maybe i shouldn't do that am i wrong maybe i'm off the word and the whole time it wasn't me wrong it was god wants to protect me so i can serve him with my full focus right so we can be on fire for god amen so we can do what's right and god wants to protect his people and we want to be in the center of god's nail scarred hand amen hallelujah because if you have big churches big problems big problems little church is little problems so thank god for that but you know brother adam says it you know in in desperation it brings out the real thing that you are it shows what you're made of in the time of desperation it usually pulls out all the good things that's in you now we had a desperate moment on vacation poor haven haven was just playing with the horse or not playing with the horse loving the horse and the horse head butt haven and as she got five stitches right there and you should have saw i mean her shirt was covered in blood i had never seen anything like that and you know we were all shook up but you know what right before i went christian got her in the car i said let's pray you guys remember that i said it's a moment of desperation all right let's pray and we didn't know which exactly which hospital to go to but we went with the one that was highest rated on on the internet that's a good suggestion maybe next time remember that my god's grace go to the higher rated place because they're real professional amen so they got there after an hour driving there and walked right in there was no waiting line at that hospital got in there the doctors were really good uh the woman who did the stitch has been there for 35 years but it was a moment of desperation like what happened is she okay we've never seen all this i mean the blood was everywhere i mean i got the pictures i'm going to see it afterwards i actually want to put it up there but then i seen in that moment that we had we had the leaning to pray not get all upset and all angry but i saw the holy spirit give us a leadership to pray and then god provided for all the needs amen now we're tested on that constantly are we there's situations we go through every week where this is emergent it seems like an emergency but all these happen to us to bring out what's really inside of us amen praise god amen now uh i just had this thought uh if you would go to first corinthians 13. i want to lay this in here before i move on first grab these 13 because we end up with this thought and then i'll get to the next one first three is 13. now what happened shirts in the moment of desperation our minds are going crazy our human thoughts are like well what about this what about that what about that what about this so we've got to be still for a moment and start living and start thinking from the soul if that's the best way i can say it we have so many thoughts what's going to happen oh no i mean i had lots of thoughts about haven't but thank god she's okay no concussion no vomiting and there's all god's breaks all god's face about all these thoughts is she injured forever you know what's going on i mean all these thoughts but then you gotta like stop and pause and and realize okay i'm thinking with my mind what's my soul say i need i need to know god's word amen right and so that that that's uh our desire as christians to mature so in those moments of emergency we can be settled amen the holy spirit can settle us and we can look to him for help praise god for his inspiration now we know verses 1 through 3 really well in other words you can know all the mysteries god said brother but without love doesn't profit you know yeah yeah it doesn't mean you're saved you know yeah i heard brother say yesterday on desperations oh no i'm sorry it was uh the token uh but random said you say well i believe everything you say but i said that's good that's just being able to read but that's still not having the token right you can believe everything he said and that doesn't mean you're born again yeah right right because you have a wrong slant to it or you could have your own selfish motive or to believe in that way you can worship brother random more than jesus that's a sin awful sin of idolatry yep right so we're familiar with that but verse four now here's what we're getting to with waiting to know god's will for your life charity suffers long now my suffering of 13 years is small compared to some of these people that suffer they're starving like in uganda they're starving so in other words my spiritual suffering is nothing i don't think compared to the spirit the natural that's just my humble opinion because when was the last time you went without a couple meals how did you feel most of us have never done it right i just want to say that some of these tests we have i mean we call it suffering but it's just a small degree of suffering let's be humble praise god let's be home amen right but charity suffers longer so if you have the love of god you can suffer long and charity is kind hallelujah charity end me if not it doesn't look on others and i'm gonna have what they have that's not god's love see because you want to know the will of god right charity vaunteth not itself it doesn't prop up itself it's not puffed up or prideful that's why i'm glad we're preaching on overcoming the sin of pride amen but william i showed the church a few months ago or last month all the pre all these major preachers calling themselves the greatest of all time brother ram said don't you never do that it was shocking i shared with cam they were camp church they were shocked because that's what everybody wants to be the greatest but that's selfish jesus never said make yourself great jesus said make yourself a servant praise god hallelujah verse 5 does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own that's that's that's a real spirit of love there love doesn't seek its own desires or interests love seeks other people's interests but see but we got we still have our own needs we still have interest like we still need a house in life we still need a car we still need a job we still need all these things but love will seek others interests as well amen we have natural then we have to have the spiritual we must spiritually try to meet the needs of other people as well and natural needs now notice it's not easily provoked and thinketh no evil [Music] so let's use that like i'm seeking god's will we have to remember will god allow this obstacle not to have evil against me but to teach me something gotta allow this trial in my life not because it's evil not because god's angry with me i've repented of all my sins i'm trying to serve god the best i know how but god allow this trial i'm not allowed for my good as we saw on wednesday our last sunday praise god god allows everything and always for our good amen always the bible says in deuteronomy always everything is always for our good hallelujah it's always working out to make us more humble more like jesus more more spirit of god flowing through us amen amen it's always working out that way it's always working out that way the love of god is gonna we're gonna learn to surrender more and the love of god will flow through us hallelujah i love verse 6 rejoice is not iniquity but rejoices in the truth see the love of god wants to know the truth whether it hurts me whether it humbles me whether it rebukes me i would know the truth praise god that's the love of god verse seven now here's here's where we got to you last lesson love will bear all trials it will believe all things it will hold all things it will endure all things praise god so when life gets hard and you wonder how am i going to make it through how am i going to make it through this how in the world can we get through this how in the world am i going to get through this love is the answer hey man i'll say it again love is the answer amen your love for god and what's greater than that is god's love for us amen amen that will get us through the hard times amen amen god's love gets us through that then we can know the will of god right god's making me wait well it's cause he loves me if i had it now i'd probably squatter right god's making me wait because he loves me like i told you something from last sunday i'm waiting for my mom and dad you know different times i pray for them i'm still waiting for those prayer requests to come to pass some of them are 30 years old prayer requests i've been praying for them since i was a child amen we're still waiting on it praise god but i can remember even though god hasn't heard my prayers i can remember god still loves me god's working this out for my good he's trying to teach me something praise god i love this charity never fails i'm going to pause i'm going to move on then from that one now i got a scripture let's go to galatians i believe it's galatians i'm going to look it up real quick because this thought just came to me yeah galatians 5 6 there it is thank you brother i made a statement in the desperations he says uh the love of god will make you desperate brother brahma says i know that quote on here but um but says if you have the love of god it will make you desperate for god's will yeah right for god's will now i'm gonna get to this but i gotta get to the balance like for example i shouldn't be desperate every single day like pray for me lydia it's monday morning pray for me pray for me brother eight minutes wednesday night you know so we gotta have a balance so i've got to have some maturity if you listen to desperation you would think like you got to be desperate for everything like desperate for a meal yeah we know we're going to go order it on chipotle or something like that but oh god i need a meal like you know there's a balance to it because it's all about god's time and season for desperation uh galatians 5 6 i'm sorry for in jesus christ neither circumcision avails anything nor uncertain uncircumcision but faith which works by love amen so the first thing we got to have is love love for god and brother anderson i like how he says it he says love will go grab a hold of faith's hand and say come on let's go out and meet the enemy [Applause] i love that amen because love or faith works by love so love will grab a hold of hey we trust god let's now let's let's take some faith out there let's take some trust right we love god we can trust god now we'll go act on the word of god now we'll go out to battle the enemies praise god that's work faith works by love so love grabs hold of faith dancing come on let's go out to the enemy let's go out there oh my you got faith and love together praise god something's gonna happen the works of god are gonna happen again that's how works happen in your life that's how you do good works it starts with love love moves faith and faith causes you to work hallelujah the problem says the love of god will make you desperate but of course again it's not every single minute an hour of your life but there's seasons and times of your life that can i say like this you were born for that's right nobody else can do it just you amen you were born for a certain time there are certain times of your life scenes of your life nobody else can obey this word or nobody else can bring this word to fast except you and it's your purpose in your life god has a purpose for everybody and when god brings you those moments of desperation that's the time to trust god that's the time to cry out to god that's the time to see god amen that's what they always did in the bible amen brother list many examples i'm going to show just i'm going to briefly show you something he just listens all these girls it's like from boom boom boom boom he's going to give you some bible examples of desperation right he could have used every person in the bible right you could have used every every single person every godly person in the bible but let's just define this so brother brahm defines desperation as a state of emergency or urgency now we're going to talk about desperations usually it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation it's too bad it has to do that but human beings are so slawful in their mind and the church said amen amen right i'm saying amen too brother jesse is lawful in his mind many times that it takes an emergency so god knows brother jess probably is going to move here so i've got to bring an emergency in his life then he'll move hallelujah right many times that happens in our lives we won't make a decision unless god kind of pushes the issue a little bit something will arise and when they do it throws them into that desperation and really in doing that desperation it brings out the real thing you are as we read this earlier that part it shows what you're made of in the time of desperation usually pulls out all the good things that's in you and then he says later until you get to that place until the whole church gets that place that's between death and life you've got to have it now or perish then god will move on the scene it takes desperation to bring god on the scene now we know there's a balance of that too as we said on wednesday sometimes god answered prayer without much desperation but there's going to be times in our lives where god is going to bring us to a place where we feel like it's either life or death i've got to have it now and that's the time to seek the lord so this is our program defines desperation it's urgency it's an emergency i've got to have it and many times it's in a case where we want to know the will of god like the bible examples we'll get to like jacob and ruth and different ones down in the bible but i want to also bring out this balance just to show the sovereignty of god in other words god is the author of your whole life god is the author behind everything that happens in your life that's right that's right so brother said god has to ordain the desperation and the faith you need in the desperation praise god that's right that's right god has to get involved amen that's right in other words this should make us trust god more yeah this should make us love god more hallelujah and god brought me to this court because that is with moses god brought me this red sea again god brought me here if god brought me here he'll make the way through amen [Applause] that's how it is for every desperate situation we go to that's right now we don't always get the answer we want right but god is bringing us to desperate places so we'll seek after him in those moments of desperation because church is not even your faith that's going to move the mountain glory it ain't even your strength all right brothers we're so strong it ain't even your strength you can't do it praise god i can't do it right it's not going to be any of our own faith it has to be jesus faith amen right remember paul said in galatians i don't live by my faith he said i live by the faith of the son of god we're living by jesus faith right now amen hallelujah not my faith my faith will fail because it's intellectual human faith the human faith is well i know my car's gonna go start i'm gonna go with the key and internet it's gonna start that's human faith right but supernatural faith is god's faith taking over you just trust something's going to happen you just believe something's going to happen that's god's faith take it over so this means church if god ordains the desperation the urgency and the faith in the urgency that it's god's ordination for certain seasons of our lives that's right for desperation healings salvation of souls god ordains that so look at the yellow there can we read that you can't be desperate until god speaks to you you can't even do it because you're you and i are so slothful i'm gonna put myself because you and i you and i are so slow so so so slow in our minds slow so slothful we can't even be in a state of desperation until god moves us there god has to orchestrate the situation to move us in there and he says oh church shake yourself pinch yourself and he doesn't say he said something's coming from the lord thus saith the lord he doesn't say what it is you better get desperate between life and death maybe it's the uh laying down or the mark of the beast maybe it's a squeeze i don't know what it was he said but it'll pass through and we won't see it because that okay she wasn't selfish okay that's speaking of hannah we'll get to that in a moment here now again he says this idea of god's going to bring you to it but i said let us pray in desperation watch for the kingdom of god it will come to you see god's going to bring that you to desperation god's gonna bring the kingdom to you amen praise god amen the disciples didn't go looking for jesus jesus came looking for them amen amen praise god paul did not go looking for jesus jesus came and found him amen the kingdom of god came to him in church either whether you were raised in the message or not raising the message the kingdom of god came to you hallelujah amen hallelujah thank god now brotherham says faith this is scriptural faith is a revelation from god now faith is revelation that's where i want to stand there just for a moment it's a revelation he's revealed it to you by what your works by grace it's something you did no it's nothing you did all she did now church really all we do is just surrender and say god i surrender right i repent and then god gives us the gift of faith i mean as far as salvation is concerned you just have to repent and then the gift of god comes and now this speaking of course divine healing you didn't work yourself up into faith you ever have faith it was given to you by the grace of god amen hallelujah god refuses you therefore faith is revelation the whole church is built upon the revelation can i say this that's given by faith and given by grace amen hallelujah amen so see god ordains the the desperation times and he also ordains your faith for those times i'm going to skip down here she's talking about a crippled man the doctor will say there's not even a chance to be healed but if something can tear away them weeds the doctor puts in there you know if god if god by his grace not the preacher well i'll say amen to that amen good oh it's not it's not on me to help everybody get their answers to their request thank god i couldn't do it anyway i failed you a hundred times out of a hundred it's not the preacher it's not anybody else but god can place into your heart a revelation that i'm going to be well there isn't nothing to keep you sitting there there's nothing can hold you there you're going to be well but until that does happen you're going to sit right there where the doctor says you're going to say until that happens it has to be revealed it's the grace of god amen hallelujah praise god just like with paul paul three times heal me in my eyes jesus said my grace is official my grace and submission my gracious division therefore i'll glory my affirmative glory i that i'll be happy amen because the author and finisher of my life is allowing me to go through this to keep me humble amen until it happens we're just gonna wait on god and if we're waiting we might as well be happy rather than angry and bitter and fearful and afraid we might as well be happy praise god because god's in control he's writing my story i'm here for such a time as this amen [Music] and he promised you the same thing if you could believe that it would happen if you can't believe it it just won't happen now see now this shows you got to hope you got to hope for it now i can't make you believe neither can you make yourself oh i wish brother brown was here then i'd believe the third bowl no you've got to believe it god's got to give it you know god's got to give it i'm sorry you can't make it either god's got to give it god has to give it to you it's a gift of god to believe not your faith god's faith hallelujah your intellectual faith might believe it's fine but unless the faith of god is down in your heart see your intellectual faith can accept it do that and just believe in it with all your heart until god does see yeah hear this just keep believing it with all your heart until that's why i said if you don't know god's will just hope for god's will just hope that god's going to do it the way you're desiring it until god does reveal it just keep believing it until god does reveal it so brother man breaks into this sermon here and he goes through these are just the first few there's a bunch after this as well because then he breaks into the new testament believers these are the first few jacob's all-night prayer was in total desperation he was trying to take his family back home to see his you know his his original homeland and then he gets word esau's coming the man who's going to kill me brother graham said it threw him in desperation now look look at the coward he was now we are all cowards i'm not down in jacob but we're all cowards he sends his children first to meet hisself the children who can't eat now they can't even defend themselves so he knows the man's a murderer and so he sends the kids out and then he sends his wives out and then he's all by himself yeah but he was a supplanter he knew he he wasn't israel yet amen he still needed to be born again amen spiritually speaking that's right because the holy ghost cannot be given until he's glorified but see in doing that in the coward state that he was he he find himself god allowed it because he found himself all alone with god that's right then god said it's time for a wrestling match god come down in the angel form amen god come down as an angel and said it's time to wrestle and so he starts wrestling you imagine what god would do like a headlock or something like that ah i got you now jacob you imagine how would god wrestle a man somehow he just he readjusted his hip right right at the end of it all night murmured said he didn't pray he didn't rest him for five minutes he wrestled all night in prayer at church i've never prayed all night in prayer now the one time i was sick with a strep throat i prayed all throughout the night i was saying i'm saying god send me that's the night i passed out i read the other church i passed out and right before the sermon and i was i was trying to speak faith i was trying i was hoping i was going to be healed all night with strep throat it was the worst night of my life i kept saying god send healing i believe you're proud i tried quoting the word of god in and out of sleep all night i woke up i'm like i'll go to church anyway i'll just speak past the symptoms and i got to church and right before church were praying and all of a sudden i'm praying and all of a sudden i saw the light start closing and like 9-1-1 come get the preacher he didn't want to preach today i didn't want to preach today but i'd strep throat and i pushed my body too hard thank god john was there he preached for us i sat in the bed for next three days getting over that strep throat but jacob wrestled all night with god in prayer now this is the very highlight of his entire life because he meets god's face and face and then god tries to leave he said i'll beat you around and i pushed you around a little bit i'm let's go it's about a day break and jacob said no no you're not leaving you're not leaving till you bless me amen i'm finding the presence of god i want a word from god i need to change amen amen amen my friend i'm going to get killed look life and death i'm going to die if god doesn't do something in my heart to take away my fear of my brother and so finally can you imagine you got the angel down the gun bless me angel bless me he said i bless you i'm changing your name to israel amen [Applause] that's the moment of desperation from his life did he have other desperate moments sure he was when the first time he was leaving he had to meet god and he saw god that's jacob's ladder he saw the angels going up and down oh surely this is the presence of the lord here surely this is the house of god but that one moment was the moment of his entire life and then from that moment all the entire genealogy and descendants after him will be named after him amen amen his whole family after him would be named israel praise god amen but god had to bring him to that that's right god had to give him the faith what faith would you need to wrestle an angel all night i get tired after three minutes or two minutes of sparring now kind of had to tie point up i get tired for two minutes i'm like i can't go anymore when's that bell gonna go off give me some water this guy wrestled the angel all night i don't even know what that's like i've never stayed up recently if you stayed up all night anybody just ever stayed up all night a couple people three people four five glory but all night wrestling match that's a different story see the anointing of god was upon him that's the only way we can explain because a normal man couldn't do that and then he finally pins the angel down like you got to bless me this is life or death i'm going to die my family is going to die i need you to give me something and notice he didn't give him a cadillac he didn't give him uh two billion dollars he gave him a name change he gave him a new name he gave him a power authority with god that's what he gave him and he gave the word amen amen amen that's all that's really that's all we need is god's word amen amen that's all we need is god's word to know the will of god for our lives that's right you've been called jacob supplanter deceiver but now you're a different person now you're a prince with god amen that's why i came that's why i wrestled that's why god brought me this desperation so he could change me give me a new walk and now i'm not afraid of my enemies i love my enemies oh god help us amen to love our enemies the man talks about hezekiah sickness now just so you know brother man says you can prevail against god in this sermon other places he says nobody can prevail against god so just say you know right because all a lot of our friends you know worship brother branham or all of our message friends worship brother brandon nobody tells us 1965 god does not change his mind you can't change god's mind he does that and god does not change his mind right he tells us that plainly so brother adam grew in his understanding so what happened with hezekiah he lived such a life of integrity he couldn't he couldn't see himself dying uh he he said lord i need more time to set my house in order and brother ram said in that sermon uh god changed his mind god doesn't change his mind about his work that god got angry after hezekiah stayed because hezekiah opened the door to the babylonians he squandered his extra 15 years but because of his desperation god looked out of desperation and said i'll give you the permissive will if you don't want the perfect will of god just because of desperation now church we were i mean uh remember two sundays ago when we were at the point this sweet little mother i'm just as an example crying out to god the sweet mother last time i was there in may she came up and she prayed for her lost husband that was a year ago so she comes up again this year and she said my husband still hasn't returned i said sister that's right we prayed for you last year right she's like yeah she said my husband and my son have not come back i said have you confessed all your sins she said yes and i started crying i said all i can do then is cry out to god that's right all i can do is be desperate and so i screamed i said what's the name of your husband and what's your name you something you might remember i said what's the name of your husband what's the name of your son so and so i can't remember my name will say jim and joe i just started praying and when i just felt the holy spirit i just screamed out as loud as i can god bring them back because that's all i can do in the moment of desperation god just wants you to hear you cry out now they haven't come back yet but there's been two cases where we have there's more and more than that right three now that austin's back praise god we've tried it there's been three cases we've cried out for other people and they've come back amen like austin i know there's a time i at least cried for you buddy to come back i know that it hadn't been over all those five years the one time was brother randy burton's wife he preached for us that's when eating got healed uh of the fever a beautiful testimony his wife before they got married went out in the world his mother came up for her mother came up for prayer when i was preaching in iowa and she said uh let's pray that god will bring my daughter back she i went out in the world she was a flight attendant so she she was flying on all the planes just enjoying the world and she left the message i said well let's pray right here i remember it just like yesterday we sat on the front row the hotel they were at a church in the hotel and we just prayed we wept and cried i said in the name of jesus christ church within two years she come back to the message and then when brother randy got one said lord let me know if she's the one to marry he said if she's the one let me buy this dress for her and let it perfectly fit her he didn't even know her size now that's desperation and the church said amen you have bought this beautiful dress i'm not sure what can you imagine all the ones on the rack you know they have like small medium large or whatever i'll choose this one and they went over to her you know this and he they only quartered for like two weeks i think one week so he was really led by the holy spirit and he said lord the way i know you're with me is this this will fit her perfectly so he just went over there they'd only been courting a week he said can you try this on i just would like to see so she went there you know the parents are there she come out she's like it fits it fits perfectly that's right and he says okay will you marry me that's how i went say that almost like that desperation but see the mother and i pray to desperation amen we prayed in desperation and she come back hallelujah now she's married to a preacher in texas amen uh valerie i always see your mom i said always remember that moment sister i forget her name now do you remember her name dan is her husband's name i can't remember her name i just call her sister or i call her mom but that's a moment of desperation praise god you pray you cry out to god so that's all we know how to do confess sins cry out to god god will answer his children we just got to be patient amen amen the other time was uh beth sister barb we're at that other church there near jose's old place on mon drive remember that brother jim schumacher he's coming in two weeks yeah glory he people he said i don't know why i'm preaching this i'm preaching on abominations he preached a sermon on abominations i've got a youtube video on that if you like that one but anyways at the end i'm just i come up and i'm like well that you know i didn't really know i didn't really know how that applied to our local church at that time i just said anyone desire prayer come on up sister beth comes up simon's wife that's when simon was a part of our church and i just gather around and she's like i want my sister barb to be saved she's got these abominations in her life and i'm like oh there it is the whole time see that's the pastor i'm like is this sermon for me no they're all they're all for me right they're all for us i'm like who particularly needs a sermon about abominations like everybody has all the women have skirts on nobody's a homosexual uh i mean all these things you know just as a pastor mother like what is the sermon for and the whole time god was orchestrating it god was bringing up sister beth and i remember church i remember she started crying i remember the drops of tears falling on the concrete and i just was crying there i didn't know god was gonna answer but we just prayed we cried to god god say sister bar in jesus name she wasn't even a believer at that moment a couple years later simon was like hey bro just pray uh sister barb we're starting bible studies at sister barb's house and then the bible says get going and then she starts coming to church cam had me come preach i started preaching about deliverance you can be freed you can be free from satan and you don't have to be addicted i gave my testimony about how i was addicted to cigarettes and dirty magazines and all these things and she come up for prayer and i prayed for her that she would get deliverance over cigarettes she said she went home that night smoked the last cigarette through the rest of the way and she's been free from cigarettes ever since but it was best desperation amen it took a little desperation and a little bit of patience amen hallelujah and nobody else in that service come up signing crying for the abominations no i'm just i'm just letting you know because there's a different time of season for everybody yeah but you see how god orchestrated brother sister beth to come up for prayer at that moment and then lindsay's mom at that moment god brings us to these moments of desperation we've got to recognize when we feel like it's between life and death that's the time to seek god cry out to god and perhaps that'll be the moment perhaps if not it'll come eventually right by god's grace i see i'm gonna go be really long today by god's way brother phil did you know i preached three hours sometimes did you know that i've uh i've heard of preachers doing that okay would you have come if you wouldn't know i was gonna preach three hours let me set a little timer here so that's why i bought this thing to give me a physical don't wear out the people don't wear other people uh ruth's decision brother said she was in desperation her husband had died orpha's husband had died and naomi's like go home go home i can't even if you have children i you know even if i have children get married by the time they're old enough to marry you it's it's over it's okay and norfolk was like all right i'm going back to moab going back to the world right but ruth is like wherever you go i'll go amen in other words i've seen faith in you even though she's backslidden in the church naomi was backslidden out of the promised land might have been her husband's fault actually uh now that i think about it might have been russell's fault but she followed her husband out of the promised land and ruth says wherever you go i'll go that's right whoever god you serve that'll be my god amen your people will be my people brother that was a moment of desperation i have nowhere to go i'm clinging to the one person i know who has faith hallelujah desperation now look she could have went out and got any of those sexy men out there she could have been a prostitute or a harem for a rich man she could have done any of that but something inside of her was drawn to follow this naomi praise god she was just drawn because of the godly character and the church said see you're just we're just drawing the people a godly character amen and god orchestrated that amen in other words god knew there was a soul down there named rude she was amongst a bunch of worldly people so god had to send the family god had to let the man backside to send believers down there and paul is the believer and she become married to boaz the lord of the harvest amen as a type of jesus christ getting a gentile pride for the rapture amen amen that decision just that decision was a moment of desperation and god directed that moment god brought her to desperation there's no food there's a famine oh it's just it's all everything was awful everybody's dying husbands dying death all around me they didn't see boaz they couldn't see that but god saw it amen church we don't see all the although we don't see the boaz coming but boaz is coming hallelujah amen hallelujah jesus is coming praise god many times you don't see the blessings coming on if we'll just persevere through the desperate moments amen you can't say like this past the tests if god brings to the test let's pass it with grace let's pass it with love let's have charity i know charity will pass the test now i could probably go on this for a long time help me god happy jesus i preach long enough lord help me to humble myself uh i'll skip past those go to the first really is nine i'd like to yeah i can preach maybe on those later just trying to be cautious boy it felt like a long time since i've seen everybody so man it's been a whole week i haven't seen the church my goodness i can't wait to get to certain church and see everybody hallelujah it's good to be in the house of lord today first good is 9 22. so brother ram uh talks about how he had to constantly battle to know god's will for his life and so he took the he took his inspiration from saint paul which is a great one to use because paul said everyone will be judged by my gospel by jesus christ right paul's new testament letters are going to judge all of us right either the judgment seat of christ or the rightful judgment let's make it to the judgment seat of christ praise god that's where i want to be judged because there's only rewards there hallelujah 9 22. to the week became highest week that i might gain the weak see what's our desire our desire is to gain souls to heaven we're trying to gain other souls i have made all things to all men that i might by all means save some church we just want to see some people saved out of this awful world just some verse 23 and this idea for the gospel sake that i might be partaker thereof with you no you're not the they which run in the race run all but one receives the prize so run that he may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate that's self-control in all things see we need self-control in our diets we need self-control with our bodies self-control with our words how about self-control with our emotions and the church said amen we need self-control in every area of our lives with our bank accounts amen our credit cards everything everything paul said that's that's how i know i'm fully submitted to god when god has control of every area of my life hey now they do it to obtain a corruptible crowd but mean incorruptible like i heard that last week can you imagine this do you ever remember who kobe bryant was he was a famous bastard he of course died in that helicopter crasher so awful his daughter and other people but one thing they were saying about him was that he only slept four hours a day and yet he would go play basketball at the highest level possible now he's an example of being temperate in all things for the sake of a natural crowd like a basketball champion crowd not that now that's what i wonder how can that guy get my four hours and i get tired if i want to get five and a half or something i get cranky if i only get five now what's wrong with me i think i need to work out more that's what i need to do but just as an example a athlete can do four hours of sleep and compete at the highest level because he's trained his body with the right diet that's really something the right amount of sleep right amount of rest and he did meditation and things like that for a natural crowd what should we do for the incorruptible crowd something i need to pray about for sure help me jesus verse 26 i therefore so run not as uncertainly so in other words he knows where he's running we're running to heaven praise god we're running to jesus's throat right we're trying to run to meet jesus so fight i not as one that beaten the arrow i know i'm fighting the devil and i know i'm fighting my sinful members in my flesh i know who my worst enemy is it's that ugly guy in the mirror every morning right verse 27 but i keep under my body that actually means physically hit i physically hit my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i preach to others i myself should be cast away see paul didn't act like even though he had many visions of jesus he didn't act like he was the greatest person he actually said well i could fall away because god can do whatever he wants yet yeah he's been filled with the holy ghost and yet he said i wish i could be cursed so that my jewish friends could be saved he did not think very highly of himself he says i'm the least of the apostles and he said i'm lisa the saints that's right now look what brother says he said i want my name wrote on the last book of life i want jesus to remember me on that roll call amen remember me jesus like yesterday we were uh yesterday we were at a stop on the turnpike in pennsylvania and a guy had a shirt that said jesse smith like a tattoo artist i'm like hey that's my name what who do you know jesse smith and he's like he's like oh he's a famous tattoo artist he said you like tattoos i said no i don't have any tattoos i said but i want the lord's word tattooed on my heart [Applause] see i want to be all that just made me think of that i know it's i want my name on the last book of life amen written with the blood of jesus christ amen that's what i want my name tattooed there praise god or written there yes lord i want him to remember me so because brother man doesn't want to be lost he says this will throw me into desperation like paul said after i preach the gospel shall i be a cast off he said it could happen remember in the seventh seal brother william i just showed this a few weeks ago and the seven seal brother said you forget anything about me he said i'm not fit to live and he said i'm not being that i'm not he said i'm not saying that to be humble in other words none of us can earn salvation none of us by any good works could ever merit god's revelations it's not by human works it's by grace amen that's what he's saying here we cannot have self-confidence we gotta have confidence in christ again so what is it so because god could just throw me away it throws me into desperation to think of all these years of preaching i could come to a place where i could fail him what is the next move what's the next move for you brother i can ask jose what's the next move for your life you could ask me well just what's the next move for the church uh time to pray all right i don't know none of us know unless god showed you and if he showed you it's by grace what must i do next it throws me into a nervous stage and what can i do it throws me to the mountains and to the bathroom because i so when he needed to know god's will what'd he do all right see amina thanks for ironing my shirts love you time to go on a trip right that's what he said he said he would get home unpack the bags his wife would have bags ready and he'd leave and go back out to the mountains and see god sometimes and it's hard because when i'm with the people i've got to be all things to all men that i might win some to christ yet with that token always before me the holy spirit so paul says i might be a castaway i might be reprobate so see that's the worst date anybody could be is a reprobate mind that means you pass from uh you you pass between the line of grace right i can't exactly remember the exact words now the line of ju was it a line of mercy line between mercy and grace bless your heart you're my second memory see so when they cross that line and they're rejected like many homosexuals like many not all many because some of them can repent they haven't crossed the line yet they didn't know about it so here's the three reasons brother graham gives that you and i should be thankful we're not prophets said amen over brother jess i'd like to see visions well sometimes i would but sometimes i guess i wouldn't three reasons brother ram says don't wish you're a prophet first you see things coming up and you can't tell the people so god will make you keep a secret yeah have you ever had that where you want to tell somebody something but yeah you're doing everything not to tell that's how it was when you got that money buddy i was like yeah god bless you awesome see ya see you see things and you're forbidden to tell god to don't tell somebody and the visions they'd be sorry if you did tell them and you know better to do it so you would have visions you couldn't tell people because it would make people sorry make them sad think about it some people might be lost church in people's families that would crush them but with a new mind and divine divine eternal body it might be it would be different on the other side i know it's hard to say but that's that's the reality second then you go so far in visions oh i wish i had salvations until everything becomes a vision and it throws you into a nervous stage like brother i said look right now am i in a vision is this a vision where am i really standing at you don't know if you're in a vision or not where am i you ever thought that where i mean i don't usually know where i'm at right we usually know where we're at my brother phil might not know because he's from chicago right but most of us know where we're at praise god yeah and then you overwork yourself you over tax yourself so you're all worked up is this a vision this is vision i can't tell people things and third then you find out things about people you wish you didn't know you ever had that you ever heard that where you find out some things oh we shouldn't know that it's always going to be there now or it's always going to be there i wish i didn't know that now he would know it on an extremely larger level right but ram said he would see visions break out all over the audience can you imagine that my goodness like little tv screens a few screens above every person like the people that desires these things to know these things they don't realize what type of ministry it costs you don't know what goes with it then it throws in desperation lord god i'm going to have to answer for all those jack moore told him one time i'd hate to have to answer like you at the day of judgment now that's actually a very uh negative kind of perspective right because we're all going there by great we're all going to be there by grace anyway but in other words he's saying you have a huge responsibility and he does god put these people in your hands are going to give an account for everyone and you're going to answer for your ministry that's been about 15 years ago and since then i've been in desperation and what will i do let me say only what you say lord let me tell them the truth or don't say nothing and the church said amen see i see visions i know all these things help me not to talk unless you want me to talk tell me not to say anything except what you'd want me to say though so now church i don't feel so bad being a small pastor again paul said here he says i am not verse 12 not as though i had already attained either were already perfect in other words paul says i haven't arrived yet i'm not i'm not the best christian of all time i'm not complete i still have room to grow i can still learn things can our church say that i can still learn things i don't know everything he said but by any means i want to attain to the rapture amen whatever the cost is i want to make sure i'm at the meeting in the air praise god amen and i'm following after jesus so i can try to apprehend what's already apprehended me so see that's the thing god apprehends you first and then you're trying to apprehend him praise god that's the order god snatches like the cup in the in the chicken yard right when that when the person picks up that cup says that cup's mine god has apprehended you god has grabbed the heart of your cup god's gonna clean out your coffee man he's gonna clean you up wash you up fill you with the holy ghost and use you amen just be patient sometimes dishes to wash sometimes those stains go pretty deep especially out of the chicken yard we saw chickens this week boy they are messy oh my goodness and i guess that's what we want to get into right haven but i've already said i'm having nothing to do with that i'll mark my word right i'm probably saying different later but see god he he uh he apprehends you first and then the whole rest of your life i'm trying to apprehend him i'm trying to understand god's ways i'm trying to know god's will i'm trying to grasp what god has for me if you're like moses you had to wait till you're eight years old or if you're like you're like abraham gotta wait till you're 75 see he says i count not myself to have apprehended i don't have everything i don't understand god in everything but i'm gonna press toward the mark i'm going to seek eagerly there it is again i'm going to see god's face to find god's answer to all the questions about the promises of god i'm going to seek i'm going to earnestly seek god to know the answers to my questions and all of us that want to be perfect how many want to be maturing here he said be be like-minded just like me glory there it is in other words don't consider yourself you're the greatest of all time consider you're still learning i'm still growing i'm still trying to grab a hold and understand what's grabbed a hold of me to praise god amen glory i'm going to get past that now let me see how many i got here because i could probably preach all day here let's see i'm at 31. this is kind of i want to get to right about there so 52. okay i'll try to go through this quick here yeah i think this will help you here by gotcha because i find this in my life anybody find that sometimes tension builds slowly through the day most school days it starts off sometimes it starts off before the school day you get emails like boom boom boom boom boom usually though it's right when the kids walk in at 8 50. mr smith this mr smith that they were doing this in the hallway they get emails the teachers stop in and pretty soon i'm just it's i feel like my head's spinning praise god anybody ever feel like that before has anyone ever been asked 18 questions at one but time builds many times if we're not careful tension will build throughout the day right right and so see what does it it kind of brings us to a it's about desperation right i'm either going to explode in anger or i'm going to fall on jesus like we saw a few weeks ago praise god amen either i'm going to explode and go off on somebody or i'm going to throw myself at the feet of jesus god break me forgive me humble myself god guide me through this day help me to get through this moment i'm just talking about uh i'm talking about desperation that's a part of every day right but ram said the result of tension is you did something wrong and you act out of place so really tension is whose fault my fault whose fault attention your fault we do something wrong we act the wrong way see if we act the right way we would have tension right we'd be cool as a cucumber they say because we handle the situation the right way it'll make the poor act that way it'll make the middle class act that way to make the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way it'll make the good act that way because it's tension steam build up got to blow it out somewhere see you don't you blow the boiler up if you don't get up the pressure now we fight it builds up as the day goes you talk to your boss if you're working oh so-and-so and if you speak to the kitty come in here mama see there you are it builds up oh my see you feel like you're going to your head is going to come off i've literally felt that have you ever felt that before yes there's been times like one time somebody uh sent me a text and said i was a demon preacher i was a satanic creature i thought my heart brother william was going to jump right out of my chest i thought all these years i've tried to serve god and they're telling people i'm a demon inspired preacher thank god for prayer that's all i can say hallelujah you know because you just have good intentions right you just want to help people yeah there's been times at school i thought my head's going to fly off you're trying to teach a lesson that person got to use the restroom that person spills water that person's uh throwing spit wads or that person i mean it's it's crazy it's just a craziness just to get through a day it's crazy just to get through a day praise god he said there you are builds up you feel like your head's going to come off i know the brother says i know i'm with it every day so i know what it means it builds up that's when brother ram lied to irs that's what he said he thought his head was going to spin off because all the pressure come back for another interview more more interrogation for the irs more documents more trips to the bank more more more more don't tell them i'm not even here live so i want you to see that church so you can understand that we are going to have desperate times throughout just regular days so there's differences between moments in your life where they're just desperate moments life and death but then there's also this daily tension this daily desperation that we go through as well how many appreciate god's grace to us amen in our daily desperate moments our daily attention that we have but then also these moments where they're life-changing moments they're pivotal moments but i like this quote program was ultimately thankful for the i'm sure brother william remember this brother jose uh if you've listened to it lately he was thankful for the tensions of life one of the main things that always hurts me through life has been a nervous condensed hurts hurts remember i preached it over there i appreciate it here too i appreciate the point brother graham said the worst feeling of a demon is the nervousness demon a nervous demon is the worst feeling you can ever have because fear is paralyzing right so when we let fear come in our house it's like can i come in i want to make you afraid sure war in ukraine nuclear war is going to destroy us all food shortage inflation you're not going to have enough food your kids are going to starve yeah come on in come on in yeah i believe yeah and it binds the strong man so it finds your faith and it ties him up and now your faith can't do nothing you can't speak anything you can't believe anything you can't even hope anything you can't do nothing amen you're not even in charge of your own house amen in other words your mind is not you're not even in charge of your own thinking lord those are not your thoughts those are satan thoughts amen all you gotta do is expose that enemy hallelujah confess that and that will wake the strong man up like samson amen it'll wake him up praise god and break out of those bundles every day get out of the house amen this is my house this is god's mind i love the law of the lord amen hallelujah so worst feeling is be nervous about something fearful about something it's been one of the things that's hurt him in his life now how many raise your hand say it hurt me it's paralyzed in my face it's true when i get so warm so see when i get tired and weary i kind of feel like nobody cares for me you know you have it too so you don't have to raise your hand everybody sometimes feels like nobody cares for them yeah but let's be honest do people care about us yeah god just showed us again today someone will drive what do you say 500 miles just to meet us he's not in here drive 500 miles anything's 85 just to meet us but ram said that's exactly what he would do too he said the devil would whisper and say nobody loves you nobody cares about you he said that program would realize oh yeah that one p that one family from georgia just drove eight hours for one service but i said i would take that eight hours one service i'd stick that in the devil's face and say see they do love me there you go down like that there's [Applause] you feel like nobody loves you i like this i just happen to have a real overdose of it lately that's why i love my wrap he's so he's so human he was so i get to feel like he he could be my friend yeah like yeah i can't believe that brother i've had some overdose of loneliness lately thinking nobody cares i can relate to that it gets real bad sometimes i can't hardly it's tension and that's what it does i get to a spot especially with some of these visions it just gets me i look at a person i said this is a vision no no no no yes no is it not you see you don't realize what price goes with that and so you wonder then you get to thinking uh well you're then you get off your side and say well what have i done here i am i'm 50 years old i haven't done nothing for the lord now how many have ever thought that i don't do nothing for god yeah the devil gets me with that one too you don't do nothing for god he says then you just get what we used to call the blues some of you brethren about my age remember what they used to call have the blues pop used to talk about it i wonder what he meant i sure know what he meant now so then you get feeling that way which is none of it's true i'm gonna read that again we feel that way but none of it's true i am loved people do care about me i have done something for the lord praise god might not be much but i've done something amen praise god amen like i tell my wife sometimes we talk about it we laugh about it but i'm like well we fed the kids today that we got a victory there by god's grace they're fed nobody's hurt hallelujah we got the victory amen so see god does love me god does care about me the people love me i love the people i am doing something for the lord so brother let you know it's just you and i doing that to ourselves we're just doing it to ourselves we don't know the will of god but if we're not careful in the waiting time we let the devil try to trick us and say you haven't done nothing well yeah i have i've given him my whole life like brother amen he's left everything he literally got kicked out of the house just to come to the message praise god amen hallelujah glory i've left everything reminds me of peter well lord what what will we get we've left everything amen there's a great reward for leaving everything amen speaking of tension i was praying about it what would you do if you didn't have tension just think of it tension is part of living what kind of what kind of encouraged me when i thought of that if i had no tension you'd be a ragdoll you would have no feelings there would be nothing you could work on see that's where people they come to church and they don't take anything away from the service we have got to take everything or something away from every service just take like malachi doesn't notice you at the top he always puts a tape away can i show that real quick so at the very top you guys all that's a lot of notes but again that's more notes than i did no it's getting he always happens to take away at the end of every service one thing he can take away from every service i like that now when you're young it's like angel's food angel's bread you can take everything away for you you've never heard it before but you start hearing things well brother just use that quote yeah i remember last year yeah yep yep yep well sheep need reminders who doesn't need a reminder right who doesn't need a reminder to pick up after themselves who doesn't need a reminder to do all these little minor things in our lives that's why we got a reminder app on our phone i mean you should know to do that but you make a reminder to do it right we need reminders we're human praise god without tension you'd be ragged out there be nothing you can work on like a husband and wife maybe if she wants to do something and you're trying to work together especially christians the other one wants and then you come together to find out what she's done and she finds out see the tension really brings you closer together and that good for marriages praise god the hard times actually after them it actually brings you closer together and somebody tells you what just just think of that little wife that went under a lot of tension when you wasn't so good or the husband went under some tension when you wasn't so good then when it's all forgiven look how you feel about him see you've got to have tension that's all see after you go through hard times and we're upset with somebody when we get forgiven then we feel so much better about it we actually trust them more right when you have a difficulty with somebody or something like that when you go through a trial and you get through it you talk about things and work through it you actually like them more afterwards is that right that's brother said that's what happens in a marriage now if you don't it's time to repent it's time to get time to get right with god amen and just think of feelings what if you didn't have any feelings no pains or nothing what there was no pain at all you have no feelings at all see if you had no feeling then one of your senses would be gone so see everything's just right anyhow so god just give us grace to stand up to it that's the thing so in other words we're gonna have tension every single day but then there's gonna be times of our lives when the tension it becomes overpowering right and these might be moments of desperation moment says cry out to god moment so go seek god right lay yourself before the altar i've got to do that from time to time i usually work it into my schedule usually it's saturday morning i'll just come to church and pray and i'll lay her at the altar and weep and cry about all my problems and have a little talk with jesus that makes it all right i feel better afterwards david but it might be during the week but we're we're going to go through tension so we can learn better right we can learn how to serve god i like this if i just stand up with that grace and stand there and say we know that when this life is over the great ones on the other side where we're looking to go to and now we remember that all these things that's attention that some people try to introduce christianity that you're free from worry no you're not they say you're free from tension oh no you add tension when you become a christian yeah because why because before he was a kind of happy-go-lucky whatever you did out there you didn't care what you did that's true but now you're a real christian every moment how many can say amen to this this is how i feel brother phil all the time every moment i'm wondering this am i pleasing to god lord don't let me backside lord help me not to get in the flesh almost every moment i'm wondering that tension is only added to my life that's why i like to laugh sometimes with you guys it kind of lets out the pressure and i think well then i have tension like am i being too silly as a christian you just have this natural tension am i pleasing my lord if i can hear from him see we want to hear god's voice we want to know that today i'm doing what's right amen glory we don't want to waste one day praise god which if you want to waste i was on vacation i don't want to waste any days amen then i'm under attention there well do i rest or study or it's supposed to be vacation so you're he says it puts you on tension put you on guard that's what it makes what you are see after all tension is a blessing it's just the way that you're looking at it see if you just look the other side no matter how thin you slice anything you got two sides to it so you want to see both sides so attention i think oh my what's this tension if i could have been born without this tension well if i wouldn't have had this tension i wouldn't have been what i am i wouldn't have been a christian perhaps it was the tension that drove me to jesus christ it's been a blessing thing to me now um i think i'll stop yeah i have to preach that might say okay let's stand musicians can come and i want to go through a few scriptures so uh let me close this thoughts we're looking at how to know god's will for any promise and looking at desperations also looking at tensions when you're ready hold up psalm 32 8. and i preached along church i appreciate your patience couldn't ask for a better audience by god's grace let me close with these two scriptures here we started off if we seek god with all of our heart we'll find him and let's look at some of these in each child of life in each tension of life in every desperate moment of life god is trying to teach us something that's true and we just have to be able to learn from god in the way i read your sermon years ago called worship while we wait right while you're waiting on god that's the time to worship i've been years of 2013. the bible says i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go so lord what's your will how do i know your will for this promise we have to trust god that he will teach us the way that we should go i will guide thee with my eye now that means god is looking church that means god is looking right at your life right now and my eyes gonna guide you in other words in other words i know the right path that you need to choose and trust me and follow me i've got it all under control i see everything in your life i see everything that's going on i'll guide you with my eye i see everything the right way i see it clearly so let me guide you psalm 86 11 teach me thy way o lord i will walk in thy truth unite my heart to fear thy name teach me teach me when i've got tension when i've got desperation teach me those moments to cry out to you because i want to know the will of god for my life how anyone know the will of god for your life any promise whether it's souls being saved like we said earlier divine healing miracles for any promise of god god has ordained us the the faith and god has ordained us the desperation and god's ordained everything we've got to just walk in his ways and that's what we're doing we are doing that by the grace of god let's bow our heads here heavenly father we thank you lord for this wonderful day lord it's just been a highlight day lord god 2022 has been an amazing year lord god we've seen brother austin return with lena i've seen you pour out many blessings dear god brother williams returned [Music] these last few years have just been wonderful lord god many baptisms i just put up those eight testimonies just for the last few months dear god you are gracious hallelujah you are good you always work everything to our good always all the time all the time so i want to say thank you for my heart dear god thank you lord and lord i just want to pray for our church lord in the tensions of life as the tensions build lord god may we learn to cast our cares upon you when we feel like our head's going to spin off when we feel weird or worn out may we find an oasis can we find a secret place lord god may we find a cleft in the rock that we can go high to lord [Music] and lord in these defining moments of our lives when we come to desperation like life and death we will trust you that you brought us to these times you ordained these desperate moments and then lord you've ordained the faith that we need in those moments my god you give us the words to say you'll give us the prayers to pray lord god hallelujah you'll give us the faith we need lord god in those hours we trust you with our lives god [Music] for lord we want to do all your will so teach us the lord to do your will teach me god teach me that i'll do your will [Music] as the scripture so beautifully says instruct me in the way which i should go guide me with your eyes that's our prayer lord as we've heard the word we've rejoiced in the word thank you for a patient congregation that loves god loves me [Music] hallelujah jesus teach us instruct us and thank you for reminding us that your eyes on this pharaoh lord your eyes on the sparrow how much more on your children dear god hallelujah you will guide us with your vision you'll guide us with your predetermined paths of righteousness for your name's sake [Music] we thank you for these blessings in jesus christ's name
