here we'll have a word of prayer and we'll read our scriptures for tonight rid me of myself i love that song lead me to the cross praise god and when it all boils down to it's really not about us it's all about jesus praise god amen so we thank god for leading us to the cross where he poured out his glory poured out his heart amen thank god for that and thank god the warriors alive today i'm talking about jesus amen the real warrior jesus christ is alive amen let's just read our uh verse for tonight i'd like to go uh to ephesians chapter three i want to start the new series on the next mystery i'm down to three more mysteries and then i preached all 12 to you in their fullness at least in what i could write in about 26 months by god's grace so ephesians chapter 3 and they'll read our memory verse brother jose gave us by god's ephesians chapter three and we'll remember we have numerous requests tonight so we want to remember those as well try to keep it about 40 minutes or so 45 we'll kind of see how the lord leads it's a real joy to be in the house of the lord tonight amen thank god it's three we'll start at verse one and imagine tonight we'll read a a little more than we will in the future kind of like how we did for the the fourth mystery start ephesians three verse one i'll do a little bit of reading myself and i'll let you know when you can kind of join in your voices here i'll start at verse one for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles what a statement he's calling himself i'm a prisoner for your sakes now church we can all just get that revelation you are a prisoner for someone else right you are here to serve someone else for christ's sake praise god we can easily see with the mothers they're here to serve their children raise the next generation right wives are here serve their husbands right but paul says i'm here he wasn't married didn't have children he said i'm a prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles which were before the dirtiest people on the face of the earth verse two if you have heard of the dispensation that means stewardship of the grace of god which has given me to you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote a four in a few words whereby when ye read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ so i like that how are they going to understand this mystery by reading paul's letter amen praise god how are we going to get the revelation reading the word of god amen you can you know you can go off and pray and that's a good idea you know you can see god revelation that way but paul says you're going to catch this revelation by reading my words praise god hallelujah what a blessing verse 5. now notice this which in other ages was was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power anyone who has a gift should rejoice in the giver of it christ jesus if any good came out of paul's preaching which much did it was because of god's grace giving him a gift and he became a prisoner that gift made him a prisoner it didn't made him it didn't make him independent from everybody else it actually made him a prisoner to everybody else praise god so your gift makes you a servant to other people amen now let's go to the memory verse uh uh psalm 24 here seven psalm 24 7. lift up e gates perfect song for this text here tonight praise god we see the church arising praise god it is time now it is here now the kingdom of god is here amen there's a kingdom done that's the millennium and there's a kingdom to come that's the future home but the kingdom of god by the holy ghost the power of god in the souls of believers it's here now and i'm glad it's in me praise god and it shall be in you behold the kingdom of god is within you amen hallelujah thank god what a what multiple layers that has right the kingdom of god you millennium and then all eternity in the new jerusalem what a layer what layers it is to the kingdom of god verse seven let's read uh seven to ten together one two three lift up your heads o ye gates and be lift up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads o ye gates even lift them up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory god now just remain standing for a moment just real briefly a few requests we have an unspoken request from brother amen a really important need here for me and his wife actually let's remember that in prayer uh my wife's not here zion uh uh just an accident got his finger stuck in the door so it was all purple and bloody and i shouldn't say bloody but just all purple on the inside it looks a lot better after a little while just kind of a strange accident but thank god uh seemed to

every need bless your saints that press their way out to the house of god in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god hallelujah we'll uh try to get to this thought here by the grace of the lord i just want to pull up a few things so i want to start this new uh series here we'll we'll just call it the mystery of the jew and gentile church of course it has a longer uh has a longer uh title if you remember brother branham reading it in uh is this the sign of the answer as a really long title he actually calls it the mystery of the new testament church composed of jew and gentile so it's a much longer title right but i don't kind of want to shorten it for the sake of just maybe remembering it the mystery of the jew and gentile church so uh we read our text uh we get this mystery out of ephesians chapter three let me set a timer here so i can have a good idea about how long we're going and uh we want to just uh briefly kind of uh background and remind you of the covenants okay so i want to just revisit those briefly remember there was there's eight covenants now brother bram didn't say that i always want to uh you know share that that i brother ma'am never said how many covenants there were uh i felt like there's eight after going through it so i'll just go through those briefly first you had the edenic covenant in genesis one and two god gave the covenant between adam and his wife eve before sin entered after sin we had the adamic covenant right where adam was to rule his wife and have dominion over the earth but yet the ground was cursed for his sake then you had the noahic covenant was that was the third covenant that god would never flood the earth again you had other changes you know about eating meat and so forth afterwards uh but the the fourth covenant really started a a real personal covenant towards israel because the fourth covenant is called the abrahamic covenant and that kind of narrowed it down before god had just given the three covenants to all mankind but at this point god narrows it down to one family god saw how the whole world was corrupt right even after even after the the flood in the tower of babel it was he had to spread it all out and shortly after that he called one family out of babylon basically they were they were in the land of shinar he called he said i'm gonna find one man that i'm gonna just start a real a real nation out of a real spiritual priesthood and he found abraham the bible said remember the bible said he god called him away from his idols so he was an idol worshiper and he said i'm going to start a new uh priesthood with this man abraham and he was called a friend of god amen because he was a man of faith hallelujah and he said i'm going to use you and i'm going to start with you and i'm going to bless everyone else amen and it's a it started this great uh covenant here with abraham and his seed and we know there came out you know isaac and ishmael there kind of came out two lines out of there one by the the uh the bondwoman the slave woman one by the free woman and we're children of the free woman today praise god amen we have a connection to this covenant church you always have a connection to abraham because the bible said the children of faith in jesus are children of abraham amen so i know whoever blesses me is blessed amen hallelujah i know whoever curses me is cursed amen right whether some degree right some are decree a curse more than others some permanent some temporarily because i'm a child of faith i have faith in jesus christ he's my lord and savior amen he died for me i'm i'm a son of abraham praise god now after that after 400 years later god kind of narrowed it even more down to the mosaic covenant praise god and this was the giving of the law here uh through moses on mount sinai and this was the the blood sacrifice and and then the uh the aaronic priesthood came out of this covenant praise god and then 500 years after that came the davidic covenant uh where god has god promises israel i'm always going to have a king from out of david because he was a man of integrity we always say a man after god's own heart that's true but i saw in scripture this morning what made him a man after god's own heart was his integrity right in other words uh his honesty praise god he's an honest man amen uh he was a faithful man now another word is pure man he was an innocent man praise god and that's what he had he was a man of integrity he wanted to love god he wanted to serve god he wanted to please god he wanted the heart of god amen like we just sang about praise god he he was after the heart of god that was his you know he made no shame about it he was wanting to do god's will and god said i want a king like that i'm going to have a i'm going to make a covenant i'm always going to have my people led by a king out of the family of david amen now we know it lasted for a while right lasted for about a thousand years uh or so well maybe about 1600 years and then god had to put it on pause because of israel rejecting the messiah and then came our covenant we say our specific covenant the one paul's writing about the new covenant praise god where god said instead of writing the covenant the promise on tables of stone like moses i'm going to write it on the fleshly tables of your heart say amen hallelujah i do that way you know that way church no man can get rid of our covenant they could take the stones and they you know people could throw them away you know titus could destroy their oh they were their covenant was all kind of messed up ah but once you get the holy ghost nobody can destroy your covenant amen because it's written on your soul amen they can't they can't knock it down they can't destroy it it's forever sealed in your soul by the holy spirit amen hallelujah jesus said destroy this temple in three days i'll raise it up is that right hallelujah that's right they can destroy this body but they can never destroy your soul hallelujah because your soul is god's property amen that's the glory of the new covenant before it was stone and building natural natural but now it's spiritual and it's not natural it's eternal praise god now future church coming coming closer that was uh uh the fifth one right no i'm sorry that was the seventh one already yeah that was the seventh one yeah the seventh coming i'm sorry the seventh covenant was the new covenant the eighth i believe is the eternal covenant because he said behold i'll make all things new and you won't remember the former things anymore oh thank god one day brother amen the devil will never be able to tell you those things he used to do right one day church the devil will never be able to tell me well jesse you did that remember that one day i'll remember it no more hallelujah that's the new covenant these former things will re we remember no more praise god all the struggles and all the all the mind battles some of these awful things that we have to go through the persecution for being forsaken being rejected and mocked and and just thrown out his trash all of that will be forgotten and we will glory in christ for all eternity amen now that's a covenant to me praise god that's the covenant i want to be a part of amen where i never have to leave his side i can serve him for all eternity amen oh that'll be a real joy there praise god uh you can't even put words to it it's so great you can't even put words how joyful this eighth covenant is praise god but we gotta accept the seventh to have a part of the eighth hallelujah now so now as we get into this ministry i want to just uh read a few things i thought was important here uh the the the confusion about the jew and gentile church is whether or not god would allow a previously unholy or sinful people like the gentiles would god allow them into his holy separated family that's kind of the mystery here now to us church i realized this and and and you and you and i you really you realize this too to us this isn't a big mystery but if you were a jew it'd be a huge mystery right that's why for us it's not a great mystery but in the bible this is a huge mystery because this boils down to discrimination that's what this boils down to it's the elimination of discrimination amen i committed my title amen the elimination of discrimination praise god because through abraham and moses those covenants god was discriminating his people away and yes they were more holy the bible said remember the bible said the the the sacrifice of the heifer did purify the flesh because they had the animal sacrifices and they followed the law they were more holy than the gentiles and god separated them for them on purpose god separated them and made them holy and so to some degree they were more holy in the flesh the bible says but the bible said they can never be purged or purged rather in the conscience of their minds because those animal sacrifices could never take away sin oh but thank god we have one sacrifice the bible said one sacrifice once and for all that he forever sanctifies the those who are sanctified by faith in christ jesus amen hallelujah oh what a blessing to be a part of this this covenant church amen so before god god discriminated against the gentiles now he did it for a purpose we know why now right we know why because showing he was a school teacher to bring us to grace right god was going to use the jews as a teaching lesson yes you can be holy through the flesh but you'll never earn it through your flesh it's going to take my intervention it's going to take my sacrifice it's going to take my spirit i've got to provide you a sacrifice to make you holy praise god you won't have you won't accomplish holiness on your own but you will accomplish it through my sacrifice amen not through yours i'm going to provide you a sacrifice amen yes so this is the elimination of discrimination that's a good title there huh thank you holy spirit praise god that's what this is all about and so that's the confusion could god do that could god take a dirty sinful people like the gentiles unholy and make them holy when the bible says keep it up deuteronomy 14 2 lydia i may have you a little busy here in the next few moments we'll see deuteronomy 14 2 says for thou art and holy people unto the lord thy god the lord have chosen thee to be a peculiar people and himself above all nations that are upon the earth so god was saying israel i'm separating you you are far above everyone else because i'm calling you to a more dedicated walk i'm calling you to a holy life a clean life would god would god make the unholy people that were so low would he be able to bring them up to the level of israel would he do that now we know the answer right we'll get to that here now god would only do it as israel obeyed the commands there were conditions on the commands deuteronomy 28 1-2 can you pull that up there this was only going to work if israel kept the commands and now you know it did they keep the commands no they didn't they got kicked out of land they got scattered right they didn't they did they couldn't keep the commands for very long he said it should come to pass that thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all his commandments which i command you this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth he did for a while right there was a certain time they were so like joshua right david solomon for certain periods of time hezekiah right ezekiel uh not ezekiel hezekiah usia for certain times josiah certain times asa right another coming to my mind asa there were certain times where they were highly lifted up but when they sinned they they failed the conditions and they were brought low right and then uh it was what about 400 or 600 years or so before christ they got totally separated out of the land and it was just awful they fell from this exalted position so could god would god or would would abraham's god raise up other nations to the same honor and blessing as israel because it seems like it was just going to be israel right is he like it's just going to be abraham isaac and jacob and jacob's 12 sons it seemed like it was only going to be them and if so if god could raise up in other nations could the jews and gentiles become one family with the jews and entitled to the same benefits and inheritances praise god could it could it happen so this is the revelation we know it the revelation of the mystery of one church composed of jew and gentile is that every born-again believer no matter their nationality is a part of god's family and entitled to all the rights benefits and future inheritances amen it doesn't matter what nation you come from right because the bible said now god's looking for a holy nation amen before it was segregation right it was discrimination in one way now god did it by favor and by grace but he said i'm only dealing with israel but now god is bringing in every other nation into this holy priesthood amen this may not seem confusing to you but this was a major issue right we're living in a judeo-christian society that's been christian for 400 years right so think of all the generations how many generations 10 generations in 400 years right if you take 40 years as a generation so we're like 10th generation judeo-christians so in other words we're used to we're used to gentiles go being accepted at church and and god will hear the gentiles god will hear the gentiles but for 2 000 some years before this god didn't hear the gentiles right they weren't his people and it was hard for the believers at first to think how could god accept them remember jesus parable the good samaritan they those jews walked on the other side of the street i mean it was just they were so dirty they were so they were so wicked they were so immoral and they were most of them they would actually go to the other side of the street in discrimination but god was saying i'm gonna eliminate the discrimination amen i'm gonna i'm gonna tear down this the walls of separation and i'm gonna make these people who are who are segregated and who hate each other i'm gonna take away the hate and i'm gonna bring unity in love amen that's a great mystery it doesn't seem like it to us but it was it was and still is in many cases a great mystery now most of this chapter i go through how god used paul and peter to break down these walls which they do but tonight i'm going to focus mainly on how westerners like us we're westerners right uh we we're kind of surprised and maybe confused uh now now it's switched right for us because we've been 400 years in judeo-christian uh culture where christians yeah christians are always accepted yeah jew genta mostly gentile gentiles are always accepted by god yeah but before this it was only jews right before the the new covenant and so now we've got to get our thinking thinking well could god bring jews into our church right could god bring jews so it's actually switched for us we we need help understanding how could god bring a jew into this grace and the answer is christian liberties that's how god can do it hallelujah so get your bibles ready it's confusing to us because we're accustomed to gentiles only gentile oh every gentile yeah no matter your your skin color no matter your background uh no matter how tall you are you don't know how short you are you know it don't matter we're used to that but to the jew it wasn't that way you had to look a certain way dress a certain way act a certain way observe so many days and that's how you got favor with god so our life is totally different from theirs right we don't we uh we don't feel like we've got to have to do all these things we're just thankful for grace now we want to do something for god but we're not under the same school kind of education type of requirements and constraints that they were under so we have a different mindset praise god and i'll say like this we need a better balance right especially message people because we get so lazy see the jews were legalistic right now some churches due to legalistic they go all the way back to the law but we need a better balance of being more diligent like the bible said over and over give more diligence be fervent in spirit be so so you see we need to be zealous with the right attitude i want to do something for jesus amen i know i'm saved i know the great god has caught my heart i know he's led me to the cross now what can i do for jesus amen because i'm so happy and i'm so thankful what can i do for my lord but it's not the fear like oh if i don't do anything if i don't do something quick i'm going to go to hell we're not under that remember that was all to point you to christ where you can't earn heaven jesus earned heaven for you you must trust in his sacrifice he made the way to heaven he's the way the truth and the life he's the only way we're getting to heaven praise god and god just gives us the grace god gives us a little job we just got to be faithful with our little job but the destinations already determined we're already sealed into the kingdom of god amen amen we just got to be faithful with our little job here on earth can i say this your little assignment just just do your little assignment right we already know where your destination is it's heaven right we are going to heaven because it's not by our works it's by the blood of jesus christ but we must be faithful with our assignment and we know as we said on sunday with those false prophets many times when people uh when when false prophets uh twist the assignment see they're supposed to prophesy truth in the name of jesus but when they twist it and they lie in the name of jesus then we know they aren't going to heaven right because the jesus said you'll know them by their fruits see see so we we have to we have to have that balance too well i've got to be faithful with my assignment which we want to be right we want to be but we also have the guarantee that heaven is assured for us praise god it's because we're doing our very best to do the assignment right like i love that parable of the tales the the two come back and say lord ah you gave me five here's here's ten he said well done buddy see he he knew what he was doing i knew exactly i did invest in that praise god now and i heard a good uh idea look at that one talent man who buried in the land he didn't commit adultery he didn't murder he didn't blaspheme hello he just had a fear of god and he had the wrong idea about god well god doesn't deserve it he takes things that don't belong to him everything belongs to god my whole life belongs to god i have nothing good except god gave it to me amen my whole life is a gift from god my breath right now is the gift of god he deserves everything amen i deserve nothing he deserves everything and because of that i can invest with confidence i'll do something for jesus because i know he gave me something amen he's just he can do whatever he wants because this is his earth it's his creation he's worthy of all praise she looked just having two more people amen look how it makes me feel you know that's why every lick of fire is so important you know you just you know just more people you have more poll but look at that he never blasphemed he never married 12 women all right he never killed anybody but jesus said throw him into outerness where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth because he had a fearful attitude in other words he had a very evil attitude towards god well god's not fair god don't do nothing right why did god give me this gift you ought to be thankful for the gifts you got just use whatever you got like like like mo like moses use that staff you got right like you've heard of david just use the sling whatever is in your hand that's what you do praise god if all you if if all you've got is a voice that's all i've got i can't sing i can't keep the beat in fact my wife and i were laughing i was trying to keep the beat the other night and i can't keep the beat so i got to stop every few seconds and then start all over because i i lose the beat okay let me start over i only got a few gifts right but i got to be i got to be faithful with that gift praise god all i've got is a voice that's all i've got it's not much but that's all i got some of you gifted with the music and the psalm specials that's great gifts we got to be faithful with what we got we can't complain we just gotta invest in amen just gotta be faithful with it remember don't get your eyes on anything else just get your eyes on your gift and say lord i'm gonna do this better uh bless my efforts here and this is gonna increase this is going to be more fruitful because i'm giving it to you bless it lord bless it lord so see now we we're having more trouble understanding how could god bring jews back in it's been so free for two thousand years right there's been a there's been no legalism right as far as with real believers now satan always tries to get people to be legalistic right but with real believers there hasn't been legalism and oh you have to you have to worship that day you have to worship you have to have special services that day you know the the the five feast days and the two holy days of israel you know we don't have that right but we have to understand how god is gonna he has to bring jews into this because the bride must be made out of every nation that's right all right now get your bible here let's uh get a little thought here i just want to go through a few scriptures here tonight now what's happened church is brother adam taught this this is a beautiful thing brother brown said the gospel always travels across the earth in 500 uh 500 years ago god started a revival in germany by a man of the name of martin luther praise god the holy spirit traveled west to england right 200 years later john wesley had a revival because the holy spirit moved on right they didn't they crucified the effects of it so the holy spirit not not martin luther but his f the people after him crucified the effects of the holy spirit so the holy spirit's always moving on like the major revival right that was in the uh so martin luther was in the 16th century uh john wesley 18th century the 20th century 200 years later it came to california usa azuza street praise god see how it's moving west right it's moving that's how it started in jerusalem right so jerusalem started moving paul brought paul took it west just like the sun right traveling starts in the east goes to the west see and then it just keeps going now uh listen to this here america has crucified the revival there's a few of us still gleaning though thank god for that amen but the revival overall has been crucified right by the denominations they've crucified not us we're crucifying our flesh but they've crucified the revival they don't want the revival they don't want jesus in their church but that's right we want him here amen and he's here tonight praise god amen he promised to be praise the lord but now if you notice in the last few years it's continuing to go east i'm sorry west it's continued to go west so it went across the ocean right and i don't know if you've seen this but the council of foreign relations says china is having a major revival because it crossed the ocean and it's hitting china this council says china may have the largest christian population by 2030 that's only nine years away because the revival you can see it on youtube have you seen it they'll have people they have people's cell phones now they got to go they have to go hide out to do this they have to go hide out in houses they have to have watch people so the government doesn't get in there and rest them and kill them and take them off the slave camps but you'll see them they will scream and cry and sing like days of elijah amazing grace they will scream and cry for hours and getting salvation amen it's just it's it's and that's what azusa street looked like that's what you look like when you got saved amen hallelujah that was your revival and it's going across west and next did you know the voice of the martyrs they're a christian organization their canada outlet now middle easterners are coming to christ by thousands upon thousands so see how it's gone now china now it's moving either further west now to the middle east back to jerusalem and the next revival will be the hundred forty four thousand amen i don't know because the holy ghost is going back church it's going back but thank god we got the revival here amen amen both man called it revival fires so it went from germany to england to california it moved on but it left some fires around here amen some holy ghost and fire amen that burns in our souls and heals the sick amen when we pray for them and saves the lost amen thank god it left some fire behind for us oh where would we be without the fire church hallelujah thank god did not our hearts burn within us after we got the holy ghost right the main fire moved on but it left some of these dead pieces of wood to continue burning that's me amen that's me that old sick of wood there that got the fire of god going thank god so see the fire don't already pass through us so we're like how could the jew be a part of this they rejected the fire but god's got to save some of them god's got to bring some of them in god's got to eliminate the discrimination ah thank you lord amen see there's no nation glory there's no tyrant or military or leader i don't care how powerful that guy is in china he cannot stop the fire of the holy ghost hallelujah your god said my word is like fire amen he said my word is like a hammer i didn't know you he said my word is like an axe that chopped out the elect amen he can't stop it he can lock him down he can point guns at him that's okay the fire's gonna move on praise god because it's the pillar of fire hallelujah he goes on and on searching for somebody to baptize with his fire amen glory he's looking for some dead sticks to burn thank the lord amen see they can not stop it they've never been able to they never will they can try to legislate it they can try to cancel it out but you can't cancel god amen he's the king praise god you can't stop him all you hope to do is just get on the side you will not cancel the king he's the king of glory amen you won't cancel jesus hallelujah impossible because jesus said i am the door john 10 verse 9 if any by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture ah aren't you glad you found it church we're not starving today we're feasting on the pasture of the holy spirit hey man we got all the food we want we got all the water we want we're just grazing and feasting why because we went through jesus christ the word amen and we're in the kingdom of god we're in the blessings of god don't you enjoy it praise god church i've never i've never ever felt like we were dry and had no food starving i've never felt that spiritually we've always had something to chew on we have we've always had meat to eat amen i've never come i've said this before god i've never come to church and ever felt like we were low on food or low on water god has always provided it because we've gone through the door and we're feasting here on the meat of god and we're feeding in green pastures amen it's not dead it's not withering away it's alive it's fresh it meets all of our nutritious requirements amen all of our needs are met when we feast on jesus christ the word amen hallelujah i preached what not for 17 years i've been preaching 17 years and i've never ever ever thought i could even scratch the surface of this because there's just so much there's so much to teach and so much to in the word of god and i forget so much that's the big problem i forget a lot i've never ever felt like we ever get close to running out of work because i can go listen to a sermon i go listen i find something fresh i never understood before we are constantly just feasting on food you think those uh horses out there you think those sheep are ever going to run out of food out there you ever see those big mountains in those hills do you think they wonder boy like the brotherhood said the fish you think they're ever going to wonder am i going to run out of water it's impossible you're surrounded by it amen we're surrounded by god's love amen it's everywhere we look again it's on our phone it's on the tablet it's on the computer it's in the bible praise god god's food is everywhere hallelujah amen like i said i can listen to some of those false preachers and false teachers and i can get i can glean little things out of them right when i've tried to study and see what are they preaching i can glean things out of them that are actual truths right oh my so jesus assures all who come in the door will be saved the bible said if you enter in you will be saved jew gentile whatever you are whatever religion whatever whatever religion whatever skin color you are whatever your nationality is if you just come in you'll be saved fed taken care of there's no discrimination he said if any man oh i love those three words if any man hallelujah that's everybody it covers us all we're all welcome in christ jesus chinese muslim hindu you name it that's just getting really saved right now that's where the revival is because the holy spirit's burning over on that side of the earth but don't don't let your fire go at yours don't let it go out you keep it burning praise god keep feeding the fire keep putting your dead habits in that fire right burn your dead habits that fire's gonna burn it'll grow right repent of any repent of any dead habits throw those dead sticks in there the fire will burn up real suddenly praise god put some dead stuff in there put some of your dead ideas dead thoughts right dead habits say jesus forgive me i'm gonna do better and that will grow and burn praise god the fire will come back that you once had thank god amen yeah the fire will come back how many believe that amen they can't stop the fire of god no one can stop it god's gonna keep burning saving and they're seeing huge revivals as the holy ghost left uh i'll say like this left north america coming around asia and now coming back to the middle east where it started that's right on the day of pentecost amen that's where it started praise god jerusalem went around west coming back east here we are coming back for the final revival the 144 thousand the final revival but you know we'll be having a revive up in a revival supper i should say like that the marriage suffered the lamb by god's grace now get your bibles here let's hit some of these liberty scriptures so we can see them here now this is one of my most important ones colossians 2. you probably remember this uh i was preaching about the sabbath not long ago colossians 2 16 but we'll probably read a few before that let's uh and i think the the main idea of this mystery is that god loves variety and he's bringing all nations into the kingdom of god but he still allows for a variety of expressions right a variety of different ways to worship and live and express themselves and yet they're all still entitled to the benefits and blessings of god praise god you could like you can eat meat or not you can still be filled with the holy ghost either one you can eat plants the rest of your life and you can be filled with the holy ghost right you can eat a kosher diet the rest of your life now that's of course you can still have some meat and kosher you can eat a kosher jewish diet and you can still have the baptism of the holy ghost you can wear some jewelry and still have the baptism of the holy ghost or you can shun all jewelry and you can still have the baptism of the holy ghost amen man you can drink a little wine for your stomach's sake right that's a tough one that's a tough one especially in america you can drink a little wine for your stomach's sake and you're often infirmities and still have the baptism of the holy ghost have eternal life in your soul your soul can be so can you imagine that sisters brothers your soul can be so free and eternal life in your soul and then your body's just weak and tired you can drink a little wine at night now you don't want to see you don't don't want to show that to your children right i don't i don't want to show to your children maybe you could if you have mature children but if you got wayward children you probably wouldn't want to do that because they might get drunk or they might model after you but you can have the baptism of the holy ghost and have different areas of your life that are a little bit different than other people but god's grace still smiles and said that's my child amen they're forever mine and they're entitled to every blessing that i'm giving my other children that maybe decide things a little differently i'm eliminating the discrimination amen hallelujah praise god amen i love jesus don't you now there's certain doctrines that are absolutely necessary a holy ghost for a filled person has to do this but then we know there's liberties colossians 2 and i love the guy who's writing this is the guy who used to be a pharisee of pharisees amen he used to be the the most discriminatory i'll say like this he used to be the most racist of all of them races against christians especially but you know gentiles too he's embarrassing of pharisees no he would he would have had all the coats he would have been like don't touch me he said leave me alone he'd have been telling those guards keep the gentiles out of out of the court of the women the court of man keep them out please keep them out one got in last week and he kind of defiled our sanctuary our fellowship and now god's using that guy the most racist and the discriminatory of all of them he's saying come on in boys come on into christ come on into grace amen come on into acceptance you're welcome in the family of god amen come on in boys i love it before he's keeping him out now he's saying come on in come on enjoy this grace that we have the blessings of god now it's not grace to sin you know the bible said shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid but there's areas of liberty where you express yourself to god differently colossians 2 and that's why people today in the message some of them can't understand it because they don't have the revelation of this they've got to have certain lengths of their sleeves and certain lengths of their dresses and the church said they got to listen to certain preachers they've got to have certain meetings and eat certain foods and do this that's fine they can have that expression but if they condemn everybody else that don't act like them they're condemned maybe not eternally but at least temporarily because they don't have the revelation that god accepts more than just them praise god he's a god of love and grace amen so see this this this uh this revelation closes the door on legalism right it says we're not in the legalism anymore we're into grace and we're allowing expression of peoples all kinds of different that's why music's so important about this music's so important uh diet so important how you present your your physical appearance is so important because god is a god of variety amen i know it's right because i've studied the scripture i know it's right because god has approved i've studied myself approved unto god god's approved this in my heart i believe it colossians 2 16. i'm just trying to get there still i just can't stop talking uh let me get here colossians 2 16. going the wrong way now remember verse 8 he told them beware foolish traditions of men philosophies of men rudiments of the world people that are after those things and not after christ in verse 8. now remember verse 14 he's blotting out all the handwriting and ordinances that were against us he took it out of the way nailed it to the cross so all those legalistic requirements man the waters of separation that's great stuff but you couldn't go to church for seven days man that about killed me right because i send i might send the day before church then i have to sit out what if i spend the day before going to church the next time i never get to go to church i don't even know how people went to church in those days to be honest with you i don't even know how they went but god took all those uh legalistic requirements that was a teacher to train us how jesus fulfilled all that righteousness and jesus was so he kept it all amen and because of that he deserves our highest praise amen and then our text for the god's receipt sermon was verse 15. he made a show of them openly verse 16. so he said because jesus christ made a show of all these demons that were trying to condemn you and make you a legalistic person because jesus condemned all these all these ordinances and man-made things right man-made ideas he said let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or respect of a holy day or of the new moon or of the sabbath day now i'm the type of person i don't know about you but i'm the type of person many times i care what people think right i'm a people pleaser i want everybody to be happy right and if i know somebody's got somebody against me i'll do everything i can to make it right but when it comes down to this the bible said don't let anybody judge you in meat drink holy days new moons or of sabbath days in other words don't let it bother you there's certain christian liberties that we have if somebody judges you just tell them that's fine brother don't let it eat away that you're not pleasing people that are criticizing you aren't you glad you got this blessing you don't have to our church doesn't have to be exactly like another church and other churches don't have to be exactly like ours god accepts us in our liberties right our freedom of expression and god's not cutting us off because maybe certain days we consider more holy or maybe certain things we eat or drink right or we have certain days that are extra special to us you know god's not god's not cutting us off paul's saying he's saying jesus christ hallelujah took all those man-made requirements away amen jesus christ fulfilled all of it praise god so you'd have to worry about uh keeping all the legalistic things he said you have freedom of expression don't let a man judge you christ is your judge amen in other words i'll say like this christ took your judgment so there's no condemnation for you amen hallelujah so whether you eat meat or not you're not condemned thank god whether you drink this or that or a little wine or no wine you're not judged whether you keep certain days or not you're not judged it's a liberty in christ and he said verse 18 don't let no man any any man beguile you in reward in the voluntary humility look how these deceivers there they try to be so humble worshiping of angels intruding in those things which they've not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind so see all these false teachers they're so carnal they don't have a spiritual mind but thank god we have the mind of christ in other words what that means is when you hear something preach you run it all the way through the bible your mind's like a computer it's running all through let's run that genesis to revelation can you imagine like a light going through like a search engine that's what happens when you hear something preach oh i gotta let me run that through the scripture let me pray about that real quick here see it's gotta run down through and make sure it lines up with the word of god right because you can sense when people are not sincere as we said on sunday you can watch those videos those people are not sincere they're putting on a show they're pretending to be holy but they're not holy because they're lying right and any christian can pick that up i like i got some good feedback on that sunday morning message i appreciate that some people are like i like how you're bawling them out i like how you're rebuking them i said well praise the lord i i was a little nervous about it but i'm uh someone's got a call right and wrong right someone's got to call it right wrong someone's got to warn the people so in closing here let me try to close here and give me a let me set a little timer here give me 10 minutes we'll try to close so holy days right meat drink so wine and meat and sabbath days right we know the seventh-day adventists are big on saturday right big man they're so big on that's that's their major that's fine i don't think that condemns them i think they're really often false doctrine but i don't think that condemns them because the bible says right here they got a right to make that a holy day they're just going overboard with it you know and of course they're not born again they do all kinds of sins you know they keep them from being sanctified all the way but they they want to make saturday of the day go ahead that's fine make saturday your day that can be your your sabbath day but remember romans uh romans 14 let's go romans now that was colossians romans wait a couple more romans 14. now the whole chapter is on i believe meat the freedoms of meat eating and wine now he says we have to be careful about those who are weak in faith now again this doesn't apply to us right but we got to think about think about new converts are coming think about what they might look at our lives and say wow they're pretty look how they're christian but they're doing this now for us it'd be the music many times we listen to how we eat how we treat our bodies right because that could be a stumbling block if we go out to eat with people and we just gorge ourselves and that person will gorge themself is that a good testimony for them if they're weak in faith no that's not a good testimony so see i think as we go on the holy spirit is going to show us more things where we have to be careful how we live i'll say like this we especially got to watch our words when we joke around it's okay to joke sometimes but we got to be careful what we say right because some of our words can be close to cuss words right and how we say it we got to be very close we got to be very careful with our words not like oh you're going to hell but we don't want to cause anybody stumble like you said we got to keep our assignment right we got to we want to follow our assignment right the bible says we want our word seasoned with what salt so that means they make you thirsty i want to be like you now we want that to work for the right way right for holy words not unholy words so see our our culture is different because we've been under christian culture gentiles for 400 years so we've got to be a little more thoughtful about well how does this apply to us new christians coming in i love you know we've talked to uh benjamin and austin over the years the different ones that have come in and they just think wow they've told me and some maybe some of you wow you guys live such a holy life and i don't know how you could do that we don't know how you could do that like benjamin told me one time he told his friend he said pastor jesse does this and this and that he's like no way like yeah that's how i live my life you know i mean now it's nothing big to us like it's just maybe prayer fasting and not drinking wine and you know not doing video games i forgot i can't remember what it was i think it was in the other sanctuary we were talking about that and benjamin was like no come and meet him you know he never came but he's like yeah you can come see that's how that's how they live so we would never want to live in a way that would cause somebody weak in faith to stumble right and look at verse five uh romans four five one man esteemeth one day above another like some people really reverence brother brahms birthday which just passed this few days ago right some people really reverence easter which is great that's a great day another esteem is every day alike so every day is just the same let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind see see uh you know a man that thinks every day is the same he's probably seen people get real excited for easter meetings but then the next sunday they don't even come to church so he's like well why should i get excited i'll just be steady every service see so so no matter how the person feels they're just steady in the house of god they might not show a lot of zeal every sir or just you know on holidays but they're just steady every time other people they're down they're not pulling some services but you bring a guest preacher in there they're shouting it down they're like what happened to this person right that's what the pastor of the home church thinks what happened to this person mercy but see they now they could still be born again and saved right but they just esteem some days above others now that's likely they might not be saved if they only get excited when the guest preacher comes with then are they feeding on the pastor ministry or not so just a point to make so so paul says some people are just the same every day every day's holy every day is christmas every day is mother's day right every day is thanksgiving some people just like that other people like oh brother jess oh this day is really important thanksgiving's really important to me you know not no one said that to me fourth of july is really important to me you know people can have their own their own convictions but just be fully persuaded in your own mind now i want to uh go to verse 23. here's what we really need to understand and he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not a faith is sin you just want to have faith in whatever you're doing praise the lord whatever you allow paul said have faith i know this is right because this is okay because paul did this or because paul taught that okay 1st corinthians 8 1st corinthians 8. oh i love that this is such a beautiful chapter meats and christian liberties meat and christian liberty talks also talks about wine i love this chapter because this last verse oh my now now here's a very interesting verse 9 says sometimes we can have a liberty and it'll be a stumbling block to them that are weak and the example he gives is a christian eats food that was sacrificed to idols now for us that might be like i said before you eating at us can i just say like uh you guys are at applebee's i'm not gonna but like a sports bar i know you didn't eat there right but i've eaten there before and i look at the people drinking at the bar well let's say i'm a christian i go there i just eat at the bar and i'm watching the game and then a young christian walks in and sees that now you guys would never do that we i'd never do that but let's say somebody did that that could cause somebody to stumble huh that christian's out there he's watching the game he had a beer well maybe i could have a beer and that would be a stumbling block to a new christian that don't happen at our church happens in denominational churches right that'd be an awful stumbling block right now we know better than that we know birds of a feather flock together so we get it to go right or if you do have to go in there you sit way back far away from the bar right like i go to restaurants all the time and i have to sit in a place where i can't see the tv because i'm just i'm just a as a man my eyes are just i got to be very careful what i look at i purposely will try to you can ask my wife on our dates we'll go to this certain restaurant i like baja west it's a like a taco place you know awesome many times i'll say i'm not gonna sit there because i'm starting at the tv and it might be a cooking show but they got a half naked woman on there you know or in the commercials in between they show half naked women i'm like well what you know or they got the old basketball game makes me want to watch and i'm supposed to be talking to my wife i'm supposed to be uh you know being a good husband that ain't going to help me the basketball game you know so we have to use wisdom on how we live our christian lives now here look now look at verse 11 this can be very serious like i said especially with the alcohol right the alcohol and maybe the sexual things coming off across the tv because that could cause somebody to fall fornication adultery homosexuality right this day people fall to that people in the message i've met numerous people the message that struggle with homosexuality because it's a spirit it's been around for ever it's been since abraham's day right before that so people in the message struggle with it verse 11 and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died that proves you can be saved and then lose your salvation just like jesus said if you don't if you don't repent i've bought your name off the book just like the parable a sea can fall in there satan can snatch it out you can believe for a while and then lose it we don't want to be the people that live so loosely that we stumble other people right and that's what this revelation now this revelation was open up the liberty but inside the liberty there's responsibility just like you got the liberty in your car you're going to drive home tonight but you better control that liberty right don't be driving 75 don't be driving 70 you know dude don't be driving too fast because if you misuse that liberty you're going to get an accident did i tell you this i got a ticket last summer did i tell you i was all in this big hurry oh i got to run but i got to deposit the church giving or something like that i drove a 45 and a 25. and i had to pay the fine i used my i didn't i didn't take care of my liberty if i tell you i felt about that big guy you know he's like oh you're you're a teacher and a pastor huh yeah yeah i was in a hurry sir and he didn't he didn't let me off the hook oh then we went with brother brooks or brother brooks oh i mean i should say that i'll tell you afterwards in other words brother brooks got off the hook it was god's grace he was turning and he turned and it was a two-lane turn a two-lane turn he wouldn't mind if i told this and he was in that we were in the inside lane and he was talking to me maybe i distract him he went to the outer lane and all of a sudden a cop slammed on his break he would have hit the cop so the cop pulled us over and he said i'm sorry sir and the cop said i'm not going to give you a ticket this time i'm just giving you a warning he almost hit a cop and i was right there in there that's grace that's grace when a cop lets you off the hook see that's one of those blessings of being a christian oh yeah i forgot about that love you buddy i love brother books i love he probably will watch it anyway we just gotta be honest you know we just gotta be honest now when you sing it when you sin against the weak brethren you sin against christ now i love verse 13 wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend while this world's standing now church you know how long this world's going to stand it's always going to stand it's going to stand for eternity so paul's saying i will never ever do anything in my christian liberty that includes your words some of our jokes our food our physical appearance our hobbies what we eat all of those things i'll never do any of those if it would cause a weak christian to stumble now is that love or what that's love so in his case maybe he would say i'll never eat meat publicly because i don't want to cause a christian to stumble wow now for us it's for brother jessie it's i'll never drink wine in public no i like to taste the wine i don't know some my kids have talked about they don't like i like the taste of our wine but you know what i'm not i've never drinking one drop outside the house of god you know why i do that for the week's sake for the benjamins austins people that come in and fall away because i would hate to give them an excuse to leave because of my liberties that i'm not keeping i've never done it now i know people that do because their stomach hurts that's fine that's what the bible says that's okay but never do anything that would cause somebody to stumble and the church said amen now we're closing with this we're going to get to this revelation this revelation breaks down all the discrimination it's the elimination of discrimination peter battled this he was racist for a while with the baptism of the holy ghost racist in the sense that i mean he wouldn't eat with gentiles we don't know how long this lasted but god had to send a holy ghost-filled prophet and rebuke him right to his face and say why aren't you eating with those spanish or mexican people can i say can i just bring him make every why don't you eat with those half spanish people why don't you eat with the asian people why aren't you eating peter oh my goodness i didn't realize that that church let me tell you the racism that we battled today james talked about it he said a rich person will come in and you'll treat him really good see how racism sneaks into the church have you ever smelled some people that come into the church sometimes they don't smell very good like visitors we've had visitors that don't smell too good do you think people want to sit by them do you think people want to talk to them it ain't easy but that's a form if we purposely separate ourselves from them because they smell they don't have as nice clothes as brother jesse or brother sister so-and-so that's discrimination and that's not the christ in fact the bible says the opposite you're supposed to go to them don't make a special trip because somebody's famous is here somebody that we know someone that's rich don't treat them any better than you treat the poor person or the person that don't have as nice as clothes as you or the person who didn't brush his teeth i've seen that the person that didn't floss the person don't get me wrong you don't want to get too close to those people right they might have germs but you still have to show them god's love right and are they going to have gingivitis they might are they going to have you know they can have cavities and lose their teeth they might but our attitude it can't be anything that exalts us above other people the love of christ has to constrain us to love all of god's people that jesus christ is the door and he said if any man we have to remember this man or this dirty man or woman they might come into the door of christ and we've got to be there on the other side saying come on in there's nice green pastures over here come on and feast on this one i'm beasting on you're going to love this that's the end of our feet praise god aren't you glad for the elimination of discrimination musicians can come by god's grace i love how the word of god is constantly opening to us some of these things we never we never would have considered unless the holy ghost would take us that direction how we sometimes battle discrimination right we think we're better than other people we must never think that can you stop the live stream god bless you i just want to say a few things
