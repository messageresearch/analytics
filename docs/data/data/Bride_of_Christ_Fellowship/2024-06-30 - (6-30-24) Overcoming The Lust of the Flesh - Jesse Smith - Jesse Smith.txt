========================================

so looks like we're live by God's grace so God bless all the live streamers and God bless the Saints here in the house of the Lord today uh Wednesday just for the live streamers uh you know we uh didn't have internet access on Wednesday it wasn't working we looked at uh the third sermon on the seven dimensions maybe have one more sermon on that but if you'd like a copy that or recorded the audio just you know email me or something like that uh so we'll be able to share that but today we want to look at a different topic I guess you know I'll share why but this has just been U kind of on my heart these last few weeks I want to look at overcoming the lust of the flesh healthy eating so it's more of a a message you know that we would say this is a sanctification message but it really involves the leadership of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives it really does uning to the holy spirit so 1 Corinthians 6:20 let's read that if we can on three 1 2 3 for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods amen so if you go now to Luke 21 you know Jesus prophesied that we'd have to overcome the lust of the flesh here of course at the end time now we know of course the lust of the eyes and the pride of life as well but this area you know impacts us a lot you know in America where we have so much Prosperity uh naturally and so forth so it was prophesied by Jesus that it would be a snare OV eaing and over drinking would be a snare that people would get caught into and uh the only way we can overcome it is by watching and praying the Bible says so watching and praying of course the Bible says praying is building up the spirit of God in your life right it's Jude chapter 1 building up your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost so in in a country where we have so much naturally uh we have so much spiritually it's a snare Satan sets a trap that will feed our flesh too much and of course in this modern day feed it the wrong food and wrong drink so I just want to uh preach on this this morning as I I'll share why in just a moment but uh I'll read uh I'll read 34 and 35 and then we'll all read 36 Luke 2134 and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting now that means headaches headaches so sometimes people get headaches you know from overeating and so forth and there's all kinds of uh all kinds of uh we'd say uh problems that come by not eating the right Foods or not having the right diet and drunkenness of course we life too much alcohol and cares of this life so and so that day come upon you unawares so Jesus says the natural food and then the cares of life will make people forget about the Rapture verse 35 for as a snare shall come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth this is a worldwide battle right that we're going to have to overcome how many glad you can overcome it by God's grace let's read verse 36 brother amen mentioned this verse to me a couple weeks ago I thought wow this tied in really good with this so let's read this PSM 3 1 2 3 watch ye therefore and pray always that he may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man God bless you you may be seated may God has blessing to the r of his word uh you know I had slides to show but I'm not going to show them today because uh you know Wednesday we had problems I don't know why we are having problems I turned it on and it was you know instantly showing like uh cable stations it was really awkward and really sad so I'm going to wait you know for the second service I'll probably preach a part two on this this afternoon um and then I'll you know between Services I can kind of play with it try to get it on the right setting so we don't see like any like they had you know a late night talk show on there it was just cartoons and nonsense so I don't want to have to go through that this morning so I I'll just not I'll just avoid that and then I can show the visuals you know this evening by God's grace so I want to look at overcoming the lust of the flesh that's the title and the sub topic is healthy eating and drinking um as far as I know brother Adam never preached a full sermon on this topic but he did of course mention it quite often and I guess you know the reason this has been on my heart the last few weeks is because we've had numerous uh deaths you know in our friends and different ones we've uh you know been associated with and I was tell my wife yesterday just you know uh our mortality has been more apparent recently you know with we had three friends lose their spouses in the last few weeks and you know I lost my coworker 54 years old and uh I was extremely sad she had breast cancer twice and then uh oh you know beat that through chemo but then this last time I forget the name of the cancer uh but she passed on because of that then you know brother mua's wife you know lost his wife with a heart attack and then uh Wendy you know uh Austin Lena friend her husband passed on and he was in his 50s I'm not mistaken so you know that that's been kind of all my uh I me we've been praying about that a lot right we've been praying for that every service we've been praying for these people that have lost spouses and uh you know then my wife's been having some health events which I like hearing about and she tells me about and I actually got to speak at one last year that was a blessing uh and I'm going to share a little bit about that you know today as well of course and then you know brother irin Miller the the uh he's the Elder he's not the pastor but he's the Elder down there in Junction City you know they they've had a few visitors recently and uh you know the the visit one of the visitors was trying to bring in the spirit of legalism into the church and he was saying you know you can't eat pork you can't eat shrimp you know he's basically trying to take them back to Jewish laws and I said brother that's the demon Spirit of legalism I said do not accept that he said Hallelujah he said the same verse I gave him is the same verse God gave him Hallelujah we'll look at that and so food has been on our you know Minds then I've listening to different preachers there's a preacher uh who has stage four cancer and he was saying you know how sugar feeds cancer so he's had to stop eating sugar which is a good thing right and that that's one of the main problems here in America is sugar intake so I heard him say that I thought this weekend I thought wow I'm getting all these thoughts on this and um uh and so and then you know I was listening to different things uh just sermon and it was kept coming up about you know taking care of your temple the Bible said your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and so I just thought I would take a Sunday on this and uh I felt you know numerous things kind of pushed me towards this so if you have your Bible you know we're starting in 1 Corinthians 6:18 where we were uh we read our text now in the context of 1 Corinthians 6:20 glorify God in your body and your spirit which are Gods the context is sexual immorality because in ver Verse 18 He says flee fornication sexual sin is a sin against your own body so somehow God will punish people in their bodies when they uh sin sexually so there's awful repercussions to that and so especially our young people uh it's so important to have the self-control of the Holy Spirit to save yourself from marriage in other words don't get involved with a man or a woman you know the opposite sex don't get involved with anyone until you are married by God's grace in the Physical Realm Of course before marriage is courtship Hallelujah and we've had a lot of good questions on that over the last few years and you must follow God's courtship guidelines before you get married but I just love what Paul said you are bought with a price your body is not your own you can't do whatever you want with your body right you have to do what the Lord says to do with your body and because your body is not yours you you must glorify God with your body and your spirit and your soul which are Gods amen and so often you as I've told you I focused on as a I think all pastors have to do it we focus on the battle of the mind right we focus on glorifying God with your mind yes because once you're born again your soul is sealed right and what you've learned what you need to learn to do after that is to listen to the spirit of God in your soul that's why prayer is so important and uh reading the word of God you know we've all felt it you read your Bibles and it's like something strikes you it's like something just strikes up it comes up and that's right I need to do that you know it's God speaking to you through the soul but the trouble is or I say the battle is I shouldn't say trouble I mean our whole lives are trouble sometimes but the battle is that we get in the flesh and we get our we get our minds thinking about our flesh too much because remember brother R says your soul has a thirst that's that's that's scriptural Amen in the Book of Psalms David or David says my soul thirsts after the Living God amen and then in Ephesians chapter 2 uh the Bible said you have desires of the Flesh and of the Mind mhm and so it's a great Revelation it struck me a few years ago but all three parts of your body your being are calling out for something so all day long your soul saying feed me the word amen all day long your body's saying feed me food right well most of the day and all day long your mind is like give me something to think about give me something to learn about right and you're either going to give it something or not give it or give it too much but we want to have the right balance of the holy spirit amen you should want to learn that's the Bible said desires of the mind you should want to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord amen right your Soul's not going to grow that way your Soul's sealed your soul is the uh it's it's the it's the home of the Holy Spirit hallelujah it's the inside of the inside it's your nature hallelujah amen but it needs fed the word of God as well it needs strengthen Hallelujah but you know so often you know uh you know we got to be careful especially in America to make sure we give our body what it needs it's very important I learn it the hard way and I I'll say like this I still learn it the hard way um and so you know it's very important to review this from time to time now if you have your Bible uh 1 Corinthians 3 already in six if you go to chapter three know you not that verse 16 know you not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwells in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy we know lots of people die prematurely because they misuse their body either sexually or what they eat or drink right drunkards dying in car accidents right that's an easy example people overdosing on drugs and dying right they God allows them to be destroyed because they've chosen to destroy their own body right for ye are the temple of God and the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are amen amen now the word defile means to ruin or corrupt amen so God doesn't want us to ruin our bodies they're they're slowly you know once you hit 21 it's slowly downhill so enjoy it before you're 21 after that you're just trying to maintain I'm 43 and every day I wake up like oh I got to maint I got to stretch out this this body it gets tighter every day right so I got to stretch it out every day and every day I'm asking myself why do I got to get old you know I don't like it used to feel so good so much better I don't have to stretch out so much but uh we don't we don't want to ruin our bodies purposely ruin them right we don't want to purposely corrupt them right because it's God's Temple hallelujah amen and we cannot glorify God if we're destroying our bodies right it it actually it does a dishonor to God and you've heard me say before you know people will treat their bodies the wrong way and uh eat the wrong things drink the wrong things they'll get sick and they'll say the devil did this to me no you did it to yourself right because of the lust of the flesh I'm talking about now the main thing is too much sugar in America they just overeat sugar right like I said these last few months I've had preachers we've had preachers come in and say that's what they battle is eating the wrong foods and they uh God's trying to help them God's showing them that they need to eat the right Foods right so we've had preachers admit that over the pulit that that's where they battle you know lust of the lust of the flesh is their biggest battle but there's also lust of the eyes and there's pride of life and we battle all three but there's times you know Seasons we battle one more than the other right but we cannot you know so the preacher is basically saying Lord Lord help me and Saints pray for me because I need to overcome the lust of My Flesh amen right and who doesn't need prayer sometimes we all need prayer when I'm down I want somebody I want Jose to come pray for me amen when I'm struggling I want Haven to come bring me another verse amen hallelujah I'm happy now that's why I can say it with a smile when I'm struggling I can't really say it like that I'm angry or frustrated you I saw another YouTuber got he got his account hacked too so I didn't feel so bad he said for three months he battled an angry spirit I said I can relate to that I thought wow I'm glad I'm not the only one devil tries to make you feel like you're the only one battling you're not the only one there's Grace and but God's grace is efficient to help us overcome Hallelujah I want to look you know of course at gluttony and drunkenness of course now for us it's not going to be drunkenness like you know most of us don't come to CH none of us would ever come to church drunk I've never seen a person come to church drunk uh for well maybe met brother yeah there's a brother that used to come years ago he came maybe once or twice he came to church drunk I just had to bear with him but you know uh the the first uh instance of of drunkenness of course was Noah but then the first case of gluttony is Deuteronomy 21: 20 and they shall say to the Elders of his City this is our son he's stubborn and rebellious and he will not obey our voice he's a glutton and a drunkard so you know this is not just one problem in This Boy's Life right Glutton is just gluttony is just a uh it's just a outward uh expression of what's happening in his life he's he's got a rebellious spear right he's disobeying he's got a prideful Spirit he's not listening to his father father and mother mhm and so because he's rebellious he's stubborn and he's uh drunkard and Glutton and the Bible said in case like that a a little or sorry a son that wouldn't do that he gets stoned now we don't have any records of that of that actually happening but that was God's punishment under the law and what was the law the law was a teacher to point you to Christ in other words if you got a rebellious Spirit take it to Jesus amen got trouble with gluttony or drunkenness take it to Jesus hallelujah amen amen then we see it again in Proverbs 23: 211 for the drunkard and the Glutton shall come to Poverty so we see people that Focus too much on their flesh and give their flesh the wrong thing they end up poor many times and drowsiness shall close a man with Rags yeah so drunkenness and gluttony brings poverty many times not always you know we see a lot of rich people that are overweight or get drunk and have trouble with alcohol but it's just a it's just a proverb right it's a likelihood this is likely what's going to happen a person overeats over drinks and of course you know we get this in uh we get this from 1 John 2:16 for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world Hallelujah so this topic again of course has been on my heart and mind and you know we've seen these young people people young people 54 59 seeing these young people pass away just makes me want of a good reminder I want to treat my body the right way amen amen hallelujah I don't want to I don't want to defile what God has given to me because I have defiled it before and I want to uh I want to see all of us treat our bodies in the right way praise God hallelujah it's a good reminder Hallelujah you my wife would just tell me you know I used to go just a few last year I used to come home and most days after school I just get out that organic bag of blue potato chips and just eat half the bag you know but then I found out all the ingredients aren't very good in there but I stopped doing it I did not do it this whole since January maybe before that so what I'm saying is that I sometimes I have bad habits but God helps me to get the better habits Hallelujah I've been eating more meat and cheese you know healthier things by God's grace and my wife taught me just cuz it says organic doesn't mean it's healthy right I I can't take you very deep on that but that's true because what I mean is you know you look back on the back of the package you know there's soy and bad things for your body in there and I'm no doctor but I am a preacher Hallelujah if the Bible says don't destroy your temple I can tell you that praise God then you can search for some more help on the details of that Hallelujah and so you know we see this and this is what you know I preached uh at the health event you remember where that was was that Orville or Kindred so uh it was April 1st and it was no April fools it was April 1st in 2023 I taught just an hour lesson on uh eating healthy and living healthy just straight from the Bible and it was nice it was encouraging one woman come up and said or she wrote a letter and said I was her favorite teacher that day so of all the classes so I was sent to that one person that that that event had hundreds of people but one person needed to hear that and that's how God works you know it might not be for everybody but there's one thing that you need that encouraged me but uh my my main point in in that was that we're in a a generation of excess of everything and all these Temptations of the flesh but we've got to have the Holy Ghost to Turn Down The Temptations for the Flesh and it's called Temperance so second Peter 1: 15 says giving all diligence so if we want the anointing of the Holy Ghost we got to be diligent about casting down Temptations amen add to your faith virtue so first we need Faith which is Assurance Hallelujah so first we have to have faith which also is a revelation it's anointing of the Holy Ghost and after that you need virtue which is strength strength to publicly lead the I'm sorry to live the word of God so see when a person gets saved you know they they have the Holy Ghost anointing a little bit of anointing but they're not filled with the Holy Ghost because they'll still go to school or they they'll still go to work and and they can't really live all the word of God in front of their co-workers but when you get the anointing of virtue now you can live it in front of people amen and that's like Ruth Ruth lived the Hol the Holy Spirit anointing of the Old Testament she lived in front of all those men out in the field Hallelujah all those women out in the field and their dirty jokes and the complain about the weather all those things the Bible said the whole city knew she was a virtuous woman Hallelujah amen see CU she could live it she could live it in front of the Sinners hallelujah amen that's how you know you got the virtue anointing and then knowledge which is understanding then you got to have understanding of why women don't cut their hair why men don't uh wear shorts you need understanding because we don't show off our nakedness the Bible says and just you know understanding about all these uh sanctification teachings why we don't smoke cigarettes why we don't drink alcohol in public all these you need understanding on the word of God amen amen and then after that you need the anointing of temperance which is self-control over bodily passions right so preachers that you know will get drunk it shows they don't have the anointing of temperance right uh women or men that'll get drunk or uh or even uh sexual immorality all these have you seen these last few months all these preachers are fallen in sexual immorality it's because they never got the anointing of temperance or I say like this they had it but then they lost it yeah right because you can lose the anointing in just like you can gain the anointing you can lose the anointing anybody knows that Hallelujah someday your mind just thinks about God all day amen it's like you're walking on clouds amen go the next day you wake up with a evil spirit right an angry Spirit or something like that or you got a Creek in your neck and then that makes you angry like the other day I woke up and I got this back pain what happened you know it can make you cranky but you got to cast it down but see that's where many people fail in this area and Jesus said Satan would the snare in this day of too much eating too much drinking right it's a snare for this day so we can see Satan is trying to get people to stop at Temperance right yeah and so Satan's working really hard so people don't get self-control and what's after self-control patience people get a impatient with preachers impatient with churches impatient with their mom impatient with their dad they're just impatient so if you don't got that anointing of temperance you'll miss patience and then you'll miss godliness being like God right which is loving the unlovable loving the Sinners right and then you won't get brotherly kindness which is the anointing to treat others in this church with extreme kindness and love amen I just read this week where Paul said Paul said when I'm amongst you I'm like a nurse that cherishes her children I've ever seen a real sweet everybody had a real sweet nurse before when you went to the doctor I mean a real sweet nurse that's what Paul said Paul said we were gentle among you like a nurse would cherish the children Hallelujah that doesn't mean there's not a variety sometimes you got said there's real dogmatic people you know sometime uh there real strong strong willed people there there there can be a variety not everybody has to be that we're not cookie cutters all the time but just the idea of having brotherly love and patience and and goodness and kindness to our church family we should have it if we got the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen and then after that brother bam said and the Bible said God caps you off or seals you off with Charity which is the love of God hallelujah amen for if these things be in you 1 Peter 1 18 and abound they shall they make you that ye shall be neither Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so see all these anointings make you a fruitful Christian people can see the fruits of your life hallelujah amen and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ that makes people can see your knowledge wow you really understand the gospel Hallelujah you understand the word of God Amen because you constantly have these anointings anointing you and and guiding you what's the anointing to do the anointing is to break the yolks amen hallelujah amen people see your life is free from bondage amen they see you're free you're a a Christian you're an eagle who's flying above the world Hallelujah they can see that this person's free indeed hallelujah amen see the anointing bre breaks the Yoke of the enemy Hallelujah Glory now it's a worldwide snare as I said like all other Temptations eating and drinking right so in order for us to eat and drink right we need sincere prayer because Jesus said watch ye therefore and pray always in Luke 21:36 and we have to remember Satan has set a a trap to try to give us this surfing this headaches and this uh I would say I think a modern term might be all this results of inflammation all these uh attributes of inflammation now I'm no doctor so don't don't consider me a doctor but you know I've gone through the some of these effects I know what it's like you know the headaches and the uh for me it was rashes and things like that stomach aches and all kinds of things and uh feeling uh uh no energy you know MH and so that's a trap Satan is uh setting and it's to get the people to stop praying to stop watching for the coming of the Lord and then if they're not watching for the coming of the lord it's just like well we might as well eat drink and be married the Bible says right remember that verse oh if the Lord's not coming we'll just eat drink and be married we'll just eat up and drink up and no we've got to live like he's coming Hallelujah remember brother amen had that dream he's coming and and every I saw that in the scripture every generation should have that Paul had that Paul thought Jesus was coming in his day Hallelujah so did Brother random you know so did the uh the early church they they thought he was coming so we have to live like that amen so see it involves sincere prayer and Lord I want to escape these Temptations I don't want to be caught in these Temptations I don't want to be caught in that I want to escape Hallelujah it takes sincere prayer Lord I don't want to be caught up in uh feeding my flesh too much I want to I want to crucify the lust of the flesh amen I want to bring my body into subjection to the word of God hallelujah Paul said if I don't do it I might be a Cast Away Hallelujah that's exactly right and look at these preachers falling away you know they're Cast Away in one way right they uh they fallen off the ship right because the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life Hallelujah because they didn't uh they didn't they didn't run the race the way they're supposed to run it hallelujah amen you can't run the race giving into the flesh you can't run the race giving into Pride you can't run the race giving into the lust of the eyes you can't run the race that way we've got to escape it by watching and praying hallelujah amen glory now it's a parallel passage in Matthew 24:37 but as the days of Noah where so shall be also in the coming of the son of man for as in the days that were Before the Flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered the Ark so we see the same thing eating and drinking right and of course we know the other aspect of Luke 17 was days of Noah and days of lot now thank God most of us don't battle with the days of lot but there are such things as homosexual Spirits right we know that there are uh sodomite Spirits I met a few I prayed for a few people that battled that but we can't act like uh these things aren't real that's it's the it's the sin of the hour it's the temptation of the hour and we must have compassion on people hallelujah to know that they're just they're wrestling against spiritual wickedness in high places but we can help them wrestle amen we can help them overcome by the grace of God hallelujah all these spirits of people are battling yeah but I found you know uh as as a pastor and I told you this before but you know we start off how many how many start with a lot of zeal for the lord well a little time goes on and time your Zeal runs down a little bit and the church said you know we all can't live on the mountain all the time sometimes you know God allows time just to test us right and we have to make that choice like I just KN emailed numerous people this week we you got to the the sister said you know brother Jesse I don't like listening to the message anymore I I don't I don't like reading my Bible anymore she said what's wrong with with I said nothing's wrong in one way you just left your first love in other words you're not having lost your salvation you just lost your first love you know what I mean like I'm not going to tell somebody they're they're lost just because they don't like that anymore what happened is they got their mind off the word of God I say this that God caught up in one of these snares amen and that person doesn't have to tell me what they're battling or what you know but they have to think about that before I used to give my time to God I used to give my mind my body my soul to God what are you giving it to now yeah right cuz the Bible said his mercies are new Every Morning the Bible said that becomes new every day Hallelujah the Bible said your mind can be transformed every day Hallelujah right your mind can feel renewed every single day if you take the time to do it Hallelujah I told her I said you just got to repent and Jesus say it's very simple just go do your first Works do something about it church amen that's right just do what you used to do Hallelujah bring your body subjection the way you used to and you can get it back hallelujah amen amen so I'm just using that as an example if you used to use read the church age book I'm just say as an example and you felt really close to God well read it again or if you if you used to pray for 15 minutes in the closet or used to go to this one certain place or read your Bible for this many go back and do it praise God Amen Jesus said if you go do the first works you'll get your love back hallelujah amen hallelujah oh it's a reality Hallelujah now brother Ram quotes this scripture about Noah's day he said Noah the prophet of righteousness going forth with his message there was an episode of immorality so brother calls an episode of immorality when people eat too much and drink too much right as the Bible said eating drinking marrying giv in marriage we find out brother man says gluttonous and immorality and so forth taking place in that day the world fell apart because they people rejected the message of God for that day amen now honestly Church think about this most churches have rejected brother an's message of the statute of a perfect man have they not if they would accept it they'd get some real Holy Ghost Temperance that's right and they wouldn't drink alcohol right when they go out to eat right they wouldn't do that because it's not good for them most of that alcohol goes right to their what do they call that they go right right to their midsection right it's going to go to fat right that's right right it it's just they're not under the anointing of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah right so see they rejected the message of this day they rejected brother's message on the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes like most people that left the message you know accus their brother Ram they now believe you got the Holy Ghost as soon as you're saved What a Sad deception What a Sad state that is all you've done is all you've done is thank God but you just got saved you don't have your habits cleaned up you don't have your mind cleaned up right you don't have a a Godly life you don't have the all these anointings of the Holy Spirit there's so much more anointing they're missing out on the anointing of God but we've been taught we can have the anointing of God hallelujah in other words they're still yoked up in many ways but we can break the Yoke hallelujah amen hallelujah amen remember church this was a time when their imaginations were only evil continually so think about this they only had an evil imagination about food that's right right so that their all their approach to food was an evil approach well I want this this and food so it will do this to me other words I only want to eat the sugar I'm say I'm going to apply it to our day they only want to eat the food that tastes good yeah and the church said amen that was their approach to alcohol I'm only looking at alcohol with this we look at it like well we only use at Communion time that's the way you should look at it Paul said I won't drink wine or do anything while the world standing Hallelujah if it would cause one person to stumble praise God Amen so see their their their attitudes towards food their attitude towards uh alcohol it was only evil they they only saw as a way uh to give into the lust of the flesh amen butam also said he was talking about I may have read this years ago I can't remember but man talking about having a Revival in Oregon and he says I think what the people is let the spirit of the Lord lead we don't know what he will have us to do but if we'll just keep ourselves prayed up don't overeat or eat the least you can and pray call people on the phone get somebody to come attend every meeting you possibly can and I'm sure with all that effort everybody say effort effort it's an effort not to eat it's an effort to invite people to church right amen I invited brother M to church I don't know if it'll come but I I invited him I said want some fellowship you can have some fellowship with the Saints here Allelujah he said with all that effort God will meet us more than halfway on the ground he said I believe that so how many want to meet God halfway now that's with your health too I want to meet God halfway in other words I want to do my part and I know God will do his part [Music] hallelujah amen can't say God do everything for me that's a calvinistic view calvinistic uh they they they major too much on the sovereignty of God right well if if God wants me to do it then God will make me do it right God wants them to be saved and God will save them and you don't do nothing about it you don't pray about it what about all the other commands in the Bible where you should pray you should witness you should be alive they that are wise win souls hallelujah what about all those verses so see they major now brother calls it the extreme of Calvinism there's some truth in Calvinism as far as the sovereignty of God but brother said the sinful part is the extreme of it yeah like I showed you one time we had a brother coming here he don't come anymore but his excuse for not coming to church now is uh well it's predestined anyway if I'm going to go in the Rapture I'll go whether I stay at home or not that's a lie right cuz the B said if you if you're a part of the church they went out from us because they were not of us amen and the Bible said gather more say see the day approaching so the Bible tells us you've got something to do about it praise God that's the sinful extreme of it now the Other Extreme of the Armenian ism is uh you save yourself well I'm saved because I go to church no you're not amen I'm saved because I pay tied no you're not you're saved because of the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah see TR to meet God halfway not brother said I'll go with the Calvinism out on the branch as far as the Bible goes on that Branch amen he said I'll go as far as the Armenian uh arminianism I'll go as far as they go as long as I stay on the branch of the Bible but see they go too far and they fall off the branch that's right so B says you know if you want to have Revival he said don't overeat or eat the least amount of food you can brother said in 196 usually Fridays a fast day for me I eat I'm sorry I don't eat sometimes on Tuesdays and Fridays till sometime in the afternoon so catch that and he tells us what time he eats about 3 p.m. so on Tuesday and Friday brother R want to eat until after 3 p.m. is that something that's what doctors say is good for men to fast in the fast all night and fast in the morning of course you're going to fast while you're sleeping I've never seen Malachi wife sleeping chugging down the uh the chicken or whatever more cheese he said Till sometime afternoon that that's not a regular fast that's just a couple days a week to fast so B said it's you should get in the habit of fasting a couple days a week at least till like the afternoon you know because the Bible says there's great benefits of fasting read Isaiah 58 I preach on a few weeks ago or a few months ago after brother McBride kick brother Ram said but a long fast comes in more days so if you fast past 3 p.m. that's called a long fast or if you go into a second day of fasting that's called a long fast according to brother Brandon he says when the Lord puts it on you ever felt that the Lord put a fast on you you need to fast see the Lord will put it on you when it's your time to fast amen hallelujah but that's just in respects and honor look not for salvation that's your respect and honor to God's Great Memorial to us the fasting a command fasting and praying and giving of arms is a memorial that's what the angel told Cornelius amen remember I just preached that last week I didn't see that to right now Glory I like how those those little connections just fall into my sermon notes somehow amen the angel said your fasting and prayers and giving of alms are come up as a memorial before God hallelujah amen in other words God wants to see you fast pray and give arms and God Honors that up in heaven you know our sister Melinda got healed when I prayed for her I know I was fasting that morning cuz we at the hotel and I really wanted to eat some of that hotel food some of those sausages smelled so good they my wife shaking her they probably weren't healthy sausages were they I have some MSG inm or something like that well you know my flesh wanted to eat some that morning but I said no I'm not saying that's the reason to Sister God he I'm just saying that I wanted to keep my regular routine of fasting and so God heard my prayer and that's just God's grace but I'm just letting you know like we're all tempted at times but there's times God will put it on you Hallelujah but we should fast as a memorial to God we should fast out of a respect to God that's showing God respect Hallelujah brother said and so after 3:00 you should have something little like he said like a sandwich so on his fast days he wouldn't eat till 3:00 and then just go get a sandwich that was Tuesdays and Fridays were fast days now this is just interesting brother Ram said a uh a friend of his named brother Roy it might have been Roy Roberson he said one day you overe eat on corn and when you did you fell violently ill and your mother put you on bed and started you with and that started you with epileptic fits and he said you've had them ever since and then brother BR prayed for him so I don't know if the overeating was causing the epilepsy or not but I'm just saying it was part of the story okay so I looked up the overeating quotes brother man said now when a person gets overfed gets drowsy or lazy we can all say Amen to that right eat too much at the buffet or eat too much at home you feel lazy and so we know it's a snare it's a trap to try to get us lazy for the Lord right brother even said this himself he was he went traveling and preaching up in Arizona he said I I ran myself down by overeating with overk kindness of the people down in the mountains I got sick so I haven't felt good this week and the brother makes a joke and said you ate too much a possum brother brandom and brother BR laughs he says brother Carl Williams with his sense of humor he he says I think we read need it right now because he wasn't feeling good and brother R said no well he said uh I don't know about that brother Carl but a whole lot of squirrels and then brother random laughs but look what brother says so I want you to pray I'm sorry so if you want to pray for someone this morning I certainly would appreciate it if you pray for me because I need it now let us go quickly to the word so brother Ram admits I overate because the people kept giving me food but it's now made me sick and I need your prayers right but you can have a little humor in there EA too much squirrel meat but look look what it he he experiences himself right that's why the Bible said have Temperance have self-control praise God now my outline and I I'll show this this afternoon I probably preach two sermons on this I didn't even set the timer so um my fault but my outline was just to start with Grace you know if I'm going to teach on health through the scripture you know eating healthy doesn't get you saved right eating healthy is a wise thing to do but that's not what saves you right cuz that's legalism well I'm saved cuz I eat healthier I'm saved because I don't get drunk now you're a legalist you're saved because you repented of your sins and you're trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ to forgive your sins the last thing I want to do is bring to these uh Amish people or some of their menite people the last thing I want to do is bring them into back into legalism some of them are already probably bound to it but I want to show you this is a message of Grace amen the Bible is a message of God's favor to you Amen in other words God loves you so he's given you wisdom on how to treat your body hallelujah amen right we're saved because of John 3:16 because God gave us his only son amen and then we have we're saved by grace through faith it's a gift of God not that any man should boast it's not by works that we're saved it's by grace that we're saved amen but then the Bible said you're created unto good works so see you're God's workmanship said you're God's Masterpiece and look at the Bible said you're fearfully wonderfully made I told one of my girls that this week I said honey you're fearfully wonderfully made who was it was it Haven all right well all of you are fearfully wondering made you're all God's Masterpiece and God created your body to be used by his Spirit to do something right to glorify him not to destroy your body but to glorify your body or I'm sorry glorify God through your body living a Godly life amen am and here's the verse many people forget you know the people that I you know I get people all the time accuse me of being a legalist right I get people all the time or they call me Pharisee this one internet preacher calls me the Pharisee from akan well there's a lot of Pharisees in akan but I'm not one of them amen because I don't teach Commandments of man I teach the Commandments of God you know why I called me that cuz I said you don't have a pastor and you don't go to church like the Bible says oh you're a Pharisee okay I see as a real Pharisee he's the real Pharisee cuz he's now created uh loopholes where he don't have to go to church and he don't have to have a pastor see the devil always does that whatever he accuses you of that's what he's guilty of right always like that always that's right you can always whatever they're accusing you of that's what they're guilty of like I had people accuse me of years ago they accused me of money things I wonder if they were using their money the right way why are they so interested in the money cuz some maybe they got lust of the money right maybe they're lusting over money maybe they got the Love of Money is the root of all evil amen and the church said I should have asked him about that if I got another chance I'll ask him about that but the the people fail to see the preaching on sanctification look at 2 Corinthians 7:1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved now look beloved you're God's beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all everybody say all all filthiness which is defilement yeah so if we know defiles us now for me fast food I found out fast food defiles me I need to cleanse myself from all defilement of the Flesh and the spirit because this perfects Holiness in the fear of God Amen in other words I Fear God I don't want to defile the body that God gave me and so I'm going to grow uh in how to treat my body and my spirit in other words especially for for us I'm not going to look at those websites I'm not going to listen to that YouTuber I'm not going to listen to that podcast anymore we got to be very careful what we do with our flesh and our spirit right none of us here thank God none of us are going to Soul or sell our souls to the devil like these evil celebrities they they actually say it right uh who was it Bob Marley said he sold his soul to the devil uh Katie Perry said she sold her soul to the devil m Snoop Dog said he sold his soul to the devil none of us are going to do that right and and look at their lives their lives prove they have but look at our lives our lives prove the spirit of God's in our soul amen CU I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I walk after the spirit and not after the flesh Hallelujah right but see the Bible says see we need to be mature in other words let's clean out all the defilement in our bodies and our spirit because we want to show reverence to God we want to show fear of God Amen I heard brother man just say it yesterday brother said the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom that's just the beginning he was emphasizing that I've been listening to the message of Grace 1961 I thought I was going to preach it this morning but I thought I'd preach this instead brother said that's just the beginning so when you when you and I finally get to the spot like oh I better not eat or I better not drink this or I better not do that when we finally when we finally get to that spot like I maybe I shouldn't do this because God might not like it now you're just at the beginning of wisdom and the church said that's just the beginning now what's the advance the advanced day is you deny yourself of it eternally or forever right what I mean by that is uh I won't uh you know I used to smoke cigarettes as a sinner I used to chew tobacco and now I won't do it anymore I I will always deny myself of that I thought about it today I just realized the last Pop I drank was in 2012 so I've been free from pop for 12 years now and that was only because they had nothing else at the church I was preaching in Guyana it was like 100 degrees well at least I felt I'm probably exaggerating right I preached two hours straight and I'm like you guys got anything to drink and they hand me a can of pop I said do you have any water okay I'll drink this just cuz my throat was burning and dying I felt like I was dying but see you you cleanse yourself from that's the mature State I'll never drink that again as long as I got the choice cuz I got a healthy pop now it's called Kucha that's the reality of it it tastes better than b Hallelujah but see God always has a better choice Hallelujah but see we have to be committed to that and we have to be willing to grow in Grace amen and grow in knowledge oh now I've grow now I understand understand why I shouldn't eat this I shouldn't drink that I shouldn't go there I shouldn't think that I shouldn't say that so see it's it's all part about you know why don't the churches when when they call me uh a Pharisee why don't they look at this scripture they they won't right right because they're willingly ignorant of the word of God the Bible said you need to perfect Holiness think about it you should be mature in Holiness you should have an advant state of maturity you shouldn't just give yourself over to the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life you should be ring against Satan hallelujah amen glory you shouldn't be a baby where you can be pushed around right or a child push Satan can push you into all these Temptations you should have a backbone brother Ram says and stand up to the devil Hallelujah and know where I'm standing Hallelujah you should perfect Holiness in the fear of God Amen like the angel told Brother randam don't smoke or drink or chew or defy your body in any way there's a work for you to do what about us there's something God's called us to do hallelujah amen you know I'll just say this my grandfather died because of the complications because of diabetes he lost years of his life because too much sugar and too much fast food I prayed for him the one time he had numbness in his leg because of diabetes I prayed for him and he said all the numbness left him I don't know how long that Victory lasted imagine if he went back to eat his favorite was White Castle hamburgers I wonder if he probably went back to White Castle hamburgers he that numbness probably came back but he had to live his the final last Decades of his life as a diabetic yeah and he just lost out and he even told me he lost out he wanted to travel to preach but the diabetes kept him from that See You Know The Enemy tries to rob us of the Ministries God has for us remember our our dear precious brother the late brother James I told you this you know I asked him brother you know what what's one advice you give me as a young preacher over there on Waterland and he said uh he said I ate too much fast food and I didn't take care of my body I never exercised he said now I have heart problems because of that and he just died a few years after that so I'm trying to take these to heart you know that we have a limited amount of time and I want to apply my mind to wisdom I want to fear God Amen now Church let's be honest sometimes Temptations come your way and you will turn down a Temptation because you're afraid but it's Godly fear right amen right a temptation's say let's say a Temptation comes around for you to lie or steal or cheat yeah and it's good if you're afraid to do that amen cuz that's Godly fear hallelujah thank God for Godly fear hallelujah amen like what would happen if if uh what would happen if I did this oh then that would happen it bring reproach upon my family it bring reproach upon the Church of course thank God that's built into us hallelujah the spirit of God puts that into US amen I'm thankful for we ought to be thankful for it Hallelujah sir to keep us from bringing a stain upon the the body of Christ that's right but when you got that that's just the beginning of it amen that's the beginning of it Hebrews 12:28 wherefore we re receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear so acceptable service to God is having reverence and godly fear towards God Amen Hallelujah so I so in my case you I've even heard my brother talk about it uh diabetes if if it runs in my family my uncle's had it my uncle my other uncle died of cancer that's on my mom's side on my dad's side they're all addicted to either alcohol or cigarettes or all kinds of all kinds of addictions if I know that's those are the spirits that are about me well I better have Godly fear and not even give any of that an inch Hallelujah of course I wouldn't because I got the Holy Ghost but I'm just talking logically Hallelujah logically that runs in the family see and that that and I'm glad that does scare me I don't want to be a diabetic right I don't want to be uh filled with cancer because it's my fault you know right Hallelujah I love 1 Corinthians 10:31 whether therefore you eat or drink or whatsoever you do do all to the glory of God Amen so the whole point of this and this is the word I should have youed sooner but the whole point of this is stewardship you're a steward or overseer of God's body that he gave you everybody understand that so it's not really yours right it's God's body he purchased it with his blood and you're just taking care of it Hallelujah you're a steward of it right and the good example is I'm a school teacher so who's the steward of the school the superintendent the superintendent is the steward you know I I the last time I looked I think our district I can't remember now but I'll just give a broad number our district gets $50 million of taxes every year and he's got to decide where does that 50 million go he's a steward of it yeah right now now we know how all these politicians they're bad stewards because they fund all this money to themselves and their friends see that's a that's a bad Steward yeah I'm a steward right I'm a steward as a pastor tithes and offerings I'm a steward of that y right each one of us are stewards of what God has given to us and each one one of us will answer the Bible said for the Deeds Done in the body so we all know Jesus said we all know we all got to stand before Jesus and give an account what' you do with your money he's also going to say what' you do with your your health right what' you do with your thought life what you do with your marriage what you do with your children the church said all the talents all the things all the blessings he G you what' you do with it amen hallelujah amen it was yours anyway that's why I'm going to I'm going to serve with reverence Hallelujah mhm I'm to serve with Godly fear cuz I know one day I've got to answer for it praise God so it's stewardship your health is stewardship your time is stewardship y amen right remember that story brother cam he told him when he was here when he first became a pastor there was these uh there was this couple that just kept stealing all his time wanted to talk to him about every single thing right and he said as soon as he uh tried to correct it they left the church right maybe that's not the right way right way but anyways as soon as he brought some correction to it like you know I I can't give you this much time I can only give you a little time that person left and brother cam took it as a learning experience I've got to protect my time I've got to be a steward over my time God's got to have my time first yes right and all preachers and all dads got to learn that right all uncles all aunties and Grandpa grandmas we all got to learn that we're stewards of of all the blessings and gifts that God gives us praise God Amen so see a good Steward takes care of what God they've been given and we've been given a body Soul and Spirit along with that we've been given money time food drink all these things now at that point in my talk I went to self-control as a fruit of the spirit uhuh and I just I say this if we're eating and drinking in an unhealthy manner we forsaken the anointing of the Holy Spirit and that means we're feeding the lust of the flesh so we got a we got a evil spirit like we're just giving into it maybe it's laziness or maybe it's uh something like that but it's not like you're possessed by a devil right but it just means that we we're we're surrendering to the wrong thoughts right we're accepting the wrong thoughts remember the Bible said neither give place to the devil I just looked up this week Ephesians 4:27 you're giving the devil a thought or a place in your mind you're thinking the devil's thoughts but we don't want to think those dirty thoughts amen amen we don't want to think those filthy thoughts we want to think the pure thoughts of God the the fearful thoughts of fearing the Living God hallelujah amen that's right and church you know we've all been guilty of you know brother said I think I said I texted this to brother not brother Nia maybe oh brother uh brother Howard I sent brother Howard a text Brother R said the devil always fights me when I'm tired and overworked that's when I get the hardest Temptations right and we all know we're tired or something like that that's when we'll compromise on our diet right or or sometimes maybe even sin right so we have to we have to know that we can't give the devil a place right like I said we got to speak the word of God we got to rebuke Satan Hallelujah got to say Satan get behind me get thee behind me Satan Hallelujah in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah now self-control is a fruit of the spirit we saw in uh second Peter 1:6 about Temperance Paul calls Temperance a fruit of the spirit Galatians 5 22- 24 Paul said I have to have it in 1 Corinthians 9: 25- 27 or else I'll be a Castaway uh we're gearing up for the Summer Olympics right no not us but the people are gearing up for the Summer Olympics any Olympian knows you have to train 20 you have to train 365 days a year for years if you want to be in the Olympics if you want to be the best of the best you got to be diligent that's why Peter said give all diligence Amen to make your calling election sure Hallelujah and that's natural Olympics and Paul said they do it to to win a you know a gold medal that they can take a picture and they can bite it like this they that's why they do it to gain a piece of gold but we do it to gain eternal life Hallelujah a white robe Hallelujah that's why we do it amen amen we do it to gain a white robe by the Holy Spirit remember the Bible said God would Prosper I'm sorry God would that we prosper in health even as our soul prospers we can't Prosper if we're not fearing god with what we eat and what we drink hallelujah hallelujah remember lust of the flesh this this scripture here now I just want to give a few things here now I'm kind to get into some uh just some generic statements here but you know in the Bible days they didn't they weren't living in the days we are we're living in the industrialized Society right so in the Bible days they only had real bread but today most of the bread on the store shelves is not real bread right it has bleach flour preservatives it's not fermented long enough and there's many more problems in the bad bread right church so the Bible diet is different than today's diet unless we make efforts to have the right diet and they had of course real meat now we got to be careful with the meat we buy today mostly the worst meat is fast food meat right like I was looking at something online and um even Chick-fil-A they put this coating on their meat it's all chemicals and they inject sugar into their meat but if you go to the store and buy meat you know from the the poultry Department there whatever they're not they don't have they don't inject sugar sugar into their meat so we got to be selective about what we eat right so have to remember they had real bread they had real meat and we must do our best to have the right Foods Hallelujah you know most of today's fruits and vegetables are sprayed with pesticides we got to be careful there too right and they also have less nutrient content right because they're uh they're genetically modified so they can sit there on the Shelf longer right so they don't get they don't ride out faster yeah that's why it's good to get fresh produce right so Hallelujah do I understand everything I'm saying not exactly I'm just trying to learn from my wife IAH think about the Bible days you know Bible days didn't have all those sprays right now I wish I could yeah now try not to go too fast today now when I taught at that uh event there back in uh April 23 I just gave five guidelines and I gave some warnings I'm just going to go over that here for a few minutes here I'm already at 11:30 okay okay so about to preach about an hour okay I'll go a little bit further and then I'll finish here tonight by God's grace just let's just take one Sunday and overcome the lust of the flesh a good good reminder on the lust of the flesh amen amen I need it I know you do too I'm sure you do do it I need it often from time to time so I gave five guidelines the first guideline is that the uh eating meat is a good thing as long as it's the right kind of meat like I said you don't fast food meat is probably the worst kind yeah it depends what they do to it right depends what they do to it uh that's in 1 Timothy 4 let's go to 1 Timothy 4 these ones I don't have on my no I do yeah 1 Timothy 4:3 now remember in context Paul says seducing spirits will anoint people to say you can't eat meat that's why I told that brother Irvin I said that's from hell that's from the devil trying to tell you you can't eat pork now maybe you got to eat it moderation right and make sure it's the right kind of pork from the right kind of farms and so forth and you don't want to overeat on certain types of meat of course but the the the Bible says forbidding to marry 1 Timothy 4:3 remember doctrines of devils so a devil will say you can't marry right there was a scandal I'm just going to briefly share this there's a scandal not far from here if I'm not mistaken it it was kyoga Falls I'm not mistaken about 10 years ago and the ministry was telling the people the preachers were telling the people don't get married because the Rapture is too close and you don't want to raise kids in this uh this wicked world that's foolishness that's foolishness that was a doctrine of a devil that's so selfish yeah right and it also goes against God's command to be fruitful and multiply and later that church had scandals about abuse sexual abuse with the leaders see wherever there's leav I'm going to preach on that here pretty soon by God's grace if they don't clean out that leaven it's only going to grow yeah it's going to cause some type of sin in the F in the church the church family I say like that but the Bible said don't give heed to it don't accept it the Devils that say forbid to marry or command to obstain from Meats right vegetarian only well you're missing out if you're a vegetarian I'll tell you that we had my wife make some lamb man my goodness you're missing out if you're a vegetarian I just can't stop licking my fingers after eating that lamb like man this is the best meat I've ever had in my life no wonder God gave them lamb Hallelujah which God hath created to be received with Thanksgiving God said you should receive it with Thanksgiving amen which believe and know the truth remember God came down in Genesis 18 and abrah get said go get some meat go go get some beef and give God some beef and God ate it Hallelujah you had some milk you had some cheese there and some beef from Abraham and Sarah so Sarah did a good job with that meat Hallelujah she could really cook that meat God liked it for every creature of god let's say creature of God ready creature of God every creature of God is good right and not nothing to be refused if it be received with Thanksgiving but a lot of foods you buy going out to eat those aren't creatures of God or they're modified creatures of God so you got to be very careful right so you see most fast foods are not creatures of God y but Paul gives us the freedom to eat the right kind of meat MH and this related of course to the brother Irvin situation down there the battle against legalism I said brother don't let that demonic legalism come back and don't let it come on your church that's the same Spirit they overcame it's the fear of man y they in the Amish community they're under the fear of man and then by the grace of God the message Has Lifted it off them and then Satan sends this guy in there to try to bring them back under bondage right but what what the Bible say be not entangled again with the Lo of with the yok of bondage Hal but you're God's free servants you're the people of God hallelujah that's interesting you know even a day like this Satan's still trying to bring legalism back into the churches yeah with diet oh you shouldn't eat meat you shouldn't eat shrimp or you shouldn't eat pork like we said now the second point I made was you know you might want to do a vegetarian diet for a temporary time but if you go vegetarian the fulltime you're going to miss out on a lot of important nutrients and meat you saw that with Daniel remember Daniel 1:12 Daniel said give us 10 days we're just going to eat vegetables and drink water and after 10 days they look healthier in the face than all these people eating meat yeah right and then he said then when Daniel fasted in Daniel 10:3 he said I ate no Pleasant bread I don't wonder what that Pleasant bread means I looked it up and I didn't know what it meant neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth so when Daniel fasted he also didn't eat flesh neither did I anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled that's quite a fast there yeah and that's when God remember God sent the angel we looked at that how the Angels wrestled right Michael come around and said let me fight this Prince of Persia and then the angel could get down there and delivered to Daniel Hallelujah so pul means vegetables that's why you know you've heard uh Rick Warren of course he's a false teacher he's he's in cahoot with the Pope but he did a series on uh the Daniel diet it helped I I forget how many thousands of pounds the people in a church lost they added up all the pounds they lost well the first of all they're probably eating really unhealthy right so if you go back if you go to a vegetarian diet for a short time yes you'll lose a lot of weight but you'll also miss out on some nutrients so yes you'll see effects of that there's wisdom of course the Bibles fill with the wisdom of God but remember it's a trap it's a snare Satan's trying to get you to focus too much on enjoying the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life These are snares these are traps and God's given us Grace to see the traps so we don't fall into them praise God Amen Hallelujah that's what the Bible said um L Satan should have an advantage on us we know Satan's devices I I kind of repeated that or switch that verse around but we're not ignorant of Satan's devices we know how Satan tries to trap each one of us how many how many can say Amen to that you've seen Satan try to trap you in this lust or this this Pride or whatever more you've seen it and so we got to we got to take advantage over Satan and live a Godly reverent fearful life Hallelujah not evil fear but Godly fear you'd be surprised somebody will take that clip and they'll say well brother jusie believes we should be a fearful people you devil leave me alone it's sad I should say God forgive them but see you know there there is a there is a time where this is what I call a natur natur cleansing this is the cleansing you people should do if they want to be cleansed right go to a really healthy diet okay that's what Daniel did as a cleanse now the third part I said was fasting Again Church fast uh D remember Daniel just drank water and had vegetables for that was a 21-day fast water and vegetable fast okay but brother R you know said normally I fast Tuesday Friday all night and into the morning till 300 p.m. that's my fasting but sometimes God will put me on a longer fast I'll fast all day or I'll fast uh two days or three days MH so so fasting cleanses you automatically right fasting is a natural cleansing for you right to cleanse your body and then the fourth point I brought out in uh uh that town I can't remember now what was that kidon there you go kidon was about wine uh trying to not drink wine out in public just uh drink it at Communion right I would not even advise it drink it in your home because most of the wine today has way more alcoholic content than in the days of Jesus like the wine they would drink at a wedding or something like that it had to have way way today's wine has way too much alcohol not even the same okay and then the last part I brought was balance I said you you just have to bring balance to your diet because remember when John the Baptist was here in Jesus they one of them was mocking uh Jesus because you're they say you're a wine Biber and then they were mocking uh um they're mocking John the Baptist right well they fast too much well you drink too much well I can't please I you can never please a devil amen you you can never please accusers of the Brethren you'll never please them because their whole focus is to find fault with you amen hallelujah remember that critical spirit scripture the Bible said a critical spirit a frower heart findeth no good right so you know somebody has a critical spirit when they say nothing good about you they only want to find fault with you Hallelujah right that's so you got to have the balance remember Paul yeah that's a good one Paul said in Philippians 4:6 let's read that Philippians 4:6 and S that's a good scripture for this right here I just read this weekend did uh maybe didn't think about emphasizing this I like to emphasize this Philippians 46 and 7 do it on time okay now actually let's read verse 5 Philippians 4:5 let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand see moderation that self-control bodily uh humiliation bodily sanctification be careful for nothing be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus how many times do that helped you Church Hallelujah now Paul go down to verse 11 not not that I speak in respect of what for I have learned look Paul's a grown man I think he died at 65 if I'm not mistaken but he's still learning as he's in his 50s and 60s I have learned in whatsoever State I am there with to be content church I'm sure you and I we're still learning to be content in 2024 remember that was brother ad's father-in-law told him you know when he married hope brother man said I'm really poor I can hardly make her a living but I'll do everything I can and what did the father-in-law say the father-in-law said be content with the things that God has allotted you in life just learn to be content with what God has allotted you in life amen other words if God want you be rich he would have made you rich God wanted to make you middle class thank God God want to make you poor he might do that but the thing to do is be content in whatever state you find yourself in praise God right now look at verse 12 now look he had Paul had to learn I know how to be abased which means humbled and how to abound have lots of things y now this is inflation season so we're we're learning about being AB based most of us praise God if you're not see we have you know other time periods there's a lot more money inflation was down we're able to save more well this is a different time you have to learn to be content whatever time you're living in amen everywhere and in all things I'm instructed both to be full and to be hungry so see he knew how to be full right to eat he knew how to be hungry he knew how to fast both to abound and to suffer need so Paul could be in a spot where I'm suffering because I'm lacking but I'm still content amen now most of us don't have to deal with that most of us right like I don't have food I don't I don't have clothing I don't have transportation but Paul said I've learned that that's something the Holy Spirit has had to teach me so friends I'll just say like this whenever whenever we find ourselves discouraged let's pray God help me to be content in this situation am because I know you'll bring me out praise God Amen Hallelujah and church this is a prophet of God God God let a prophet who see Jesus who saw visions and dreams was caught up to the third heaven Hallelujah God let him be a spot where he was hungry and didn't have food only had one more coat left he only had one cloak Hallelujah and yet God could teach this man Godly fear and contentment I know God can teach us that as well how many believe that amen glory so I just taught the saint or not the Saints I I taught the people there the kidon balance so eating meat's okay right everything in moderation a vegetable diet can can be like a natural cleansing but don't don't just go all vegetables and then fasting and and limit your wine consumption for us it's only uh communion and then having a balance there's times of fast and there's times to there's time to enjoy a feast there's times for that as well we do that too much let's be honest we do that too much in America there's too much feasting didn't Jesus say or no Ecclesiastes said it's better to go to the house of morning than the house of feasting right like like that joke uh I forget who said that might have been brother cam the cam said you invite the church over for Fellowship uh everybody will come over for food you invite them to a special prayer meeting very few people come brother Williams laughing I've heard that for 20 years I've always thought was funny because people are always picked to go to the uh the natural blessings right the God help us amen now what I'll do is I'll um I'm going to close with this I I just want to show this to the church just for a moment here so here was the Tipping Point when I was I was abusing my body this is a sample of what it was like those are my feet I wanted to put that up on the screen there this was about 2012 I looked it up today it was 2012 and this is why this this topic is important to me cuz I've been through it okay and I've had to learn you know uh so you know growing up we were poor but whatever little money we did have every Friday you know my mom would buy us you know pizza and Coke that was our uh celebration because we made it through another week y'all know Grandma Ruby my children to celebrate you we made it through another week the bills are paid the lights are still on the water's still on the electricity is still on she was flurge a little bit and get all six of us some pizza and some coke you know you know but the the sad part is I got older I just got into the habit of going out to eat a lot McDonald's Wendy's Taco Bell you name it you know now when I got to college I was on scholarship so I got all these checks I was like a rich man I had more money than I even know what to do with cuz I was a poor boy well I got into really bad habits in college and I'd go to McDonald's for the Eggman muffin every morning then if I was out for lunch I'd get a a Wendy's Burger the Baconator well before whatever it was before the Baconator and then some nights I go get Chinese and uh yeah I was just ate way too much fast food and my favorite drink was Dr Pepper my H my wife probably remembers me buying that Dr Pepper and I didn't church I didn't realize that this was a snare of Satan right it's a snare of Satan and when it became a snare was around this time as soon as I would eat the fast food these red and that's just what was on my feet I told you it was all over my uh midsection loins and everything like that thighs short shortly after I eat a a Wendy's Burger I break out and it was itchy like I I sometimes I have to go in the bathroom just to itch right and I met another brother one of brother Brooks's children had the same thing but it would it manifests in their hands and they get red all these red dots over their hands and itchy hands okay and so uh I would lay at the altar my wife that altar out there that platform and that well this one but the platform I lay the Altar and say God give me Miracle God give me a miracle God give me a miracle brother Jim prayed for me numerous times for that Miracle well God didn't give me a miracle God gave me a wife said you're eating too much fast food drinking too much sugar and I went on like a 20 someday fast from sugar and now it's all I mean it's all gone but I had to maintain I I never get this anymore I never get this anymore I had to maintain that now this would hurt me uh I couldn't sleep at night some some nights I had trouble sleeping I wake up scratching now this hurt me the the most when I went over to you uh Guyana because they ate a lot of processed foods like you know foods that were not whole food just like food in a bag or food in a box you know all the preservatives all the chemicals in there all the pop they would give us this was FL it would flare up I took I actually took that picture in Guyana and because this would this would hinder me from you know just feeling good right feeling good and so that was the Tipping Point for me and then uh through the help of my wife you know I was able to learn how to uh and I'm still learning but I was able to learn some of these uh guidelines and so in the evening service I'm going to go through some guidelines on that and then I'll do like a Bible study and so forth uh by God's grace the last verse I want to read though is um you got your Bible Psalm 90 vers2 Psalm 90:2 I'm going to close with this I've already been an hour and a half has it felt like that has it hope it hasn't felt I've already seen pretty happy I don't see anybody sleeping so that's good by God's gra but if you need a rest get your rest amen Psalm 90:12 it's more of a lighthearted kind of message but still important super important if you if you're honest with yourself it's super important because it's a snare it's a trap of the devil to get your body sick right Satan wants to get your body sick so why so your body can't serve God right that's why and look and then people can lose their lives prematurely you know so then their loved ones will be without a a family member because they were caught in a snare that's especially apparent with drunk and driving and drugs now thank God those didn't don't impact Us by God's grace but you can easily see how it impacts people in that manner Psalm 90:12 so teach us what' Paul say Paul said I'm learning to be content as a grown man amen right a grown man like me so teach us to number our days so I had a a I had a uh sorry coworker died at 54 that's just 11 years older than me right brother mu's wife that's 15 years older than me brother Cam and Simon just turned 45 couple last week right my brother's Simon's 47 teach us to number our days that we might apply or give our hearts unto wisdom amen praise God and remember Church you know I always think of you know these examples you know God didn't call Abraham till he was 75 Moses finally got God finally got a hold of him at 80 years old brother Bosworth said I really didn't start my Ministry till I was in my 80s when I heard brother brandom preach yes but what if somebody mistreats their body you know like my grandpa or brother James like we talked about I don't know but they they admitted they missed out on missionary work because they didn't treat their body the right way friends I don't want to miss out on what God has for me because I don't have the wisdom to live it now amen you understand this is an awful snare if people don't treat their bodies the right way and so what we need is wisdom of the Holy Spirit to glorify God in our body and our Spirits which are Gods amen I have six kind of guidelines we'll go over uh this evening by God's grace but let's stand to our feet and musicians can come by God's grace a little different topic you know I've been preaching on the dimensions and I had another sermon ready to go but I just thought you know I'll just take all day today we'll look at the lust of the Flesh and overcoming that by the grace of God how many were helped today by the word of God God Amen let's bow our heads here for a word of prayer what did Jesus say Saints what he say he said Watch and Pray always that you don't get caught up in some type of lustful Trap Of Satan lust the Flesh and now it's also of course lust of the eyes pride of life These are snares Satan sets out and we've got to have the wisdom of God to overcome it and we will if we're watching and if we're praying amen so let's have a word of prayer how many would raise your hand and say remember me brother Jesse as you pray God bless those hands father God we thank you for today Lord God as we sang earlier I sang on purpose make us more like you Lord Jesus lord it's always boggled my mind I guess I should say bless my mind that right before you died Lord you said I sanctify my myself for their sakes a man who never sined still could sanctify himself and God that's what we want to we want to we want to sanctify ourselves Lord God we're Sinners saved by grace but Lord we don't want to give the enemy Lord even an [Music] inch Lord we know the devil sets all these snares like the days of Noah the days of lot and Lord we need to walk Watch and Pray so Lord you saw the hands that were up in the name of Jesus Christ Lord anoint your people to watch where they're walking Lord watch their habits hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus and Lord we pray now Lord God give us Grace to teach us to

those numbers Lord God lord I want to apply my heart to wisdom Lord God so Lord if you would call me to a different Ministry or just to continue this ministry I can do it because you've helped me Lord
