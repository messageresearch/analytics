[Music] here tonight [Music] i like to get back to that series on the mystery of israel's blindness here let's look at that tonight so romans chapter 11 please romans 11 verse 1. so one is a beautiful scripture then we'll go down to verse 25 by the grace of god this is part of the saints i just got to switch out these batteries real quick i think they finally died after like three weeks they lasted a long time so whoever bought those batteries thank you those are like the the king of batteries right here i think they're called max what they call max or something so romans 11 1 and then romans 11 25. is that okay can you hear that now okay all right let's read verse one together romans 11 1. on three one two three i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin now go down to verse 25 let's read that together all right let's read uh romans 11 25 on three one two three for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles come in i'm sorry be coming thank you may god add his blessings to remus word you may be seated praise god so uh we started this series back on uh november 11th that was veterans day and we looked at uh the history of israel we started there at cain and abel and then seth and showed how god called israel made them a kingdom of priests unto god above all nations how many remember that that israel was above everyone else that shouldn't stumble us if we say the bride of jesus christ is dearly beloved above all churches right because a church is represented by a woman in scripture so that won't stumble us by god's grace so let's uh then we looked at uh the first uh the confusion is can they be saved can blinded jews be saved uh could could they be saved in jesus day paul's day and can they be saved today while blinded and the answer is yes because god keeps his covenant he still saves blinded jews as long as they keep god's covenant that he gave them the old testament because they follow the old testament commands and he promises them white robes of eternal life praise god which is the great revelation of the fifth seal which we'll be looking at here tonight by god's grace uh so we looked at i looked in the scripture i found six proofs that god can save blinded jews the first one was jesus praying on the cross father forgive them they don't know what they're doing now i hope you thought deeply about that statement that's quite a statement uh there were some people in the crowd that knew what they were doing when they were saying crucified crucified they hated the messiah they hated his power they hated his truth but there were some people in the crowd that were saying crucified crucified and they didn't know what they were doing because jesus said father forgive them they don't know what they do right but there was some that their names were getting blotted off the book of life when they were saying crucify him crucified him okay that was from psalms 69 i just want to refresh you on that one uh of course if uh if someone's listening and didn't get part one this is a crucial scripture for understanding this because we have to recognize in psalm 69 verses 20 to 28 that god was pardoning some at the cross and then he was judging others at the cross it's a uh it kind of reminds us of the sheep and the ghost doesn't it right you have two groups you have some that are being pardoned uh uh they're gonna be saved right they're gonna be forgiven because jesus wouldn't lie if jesus says forgive them they're forgiven praise god can you imagine being forgiven and not even understanding what you're doing right i believe that's happening to some people today i believe there's some people that really love god but they're turning from the message and they don't know what they're doing they're leaving behind brother branham as a prophet they're leaving behind the message they're leaving behind us they're leaving behind other churches and they're not even aware of what they're doing because they've allowed some lie some root of bitterness or some uh they've allowed some stronghold to be built up in their mind they've given a place to the devil in their mind and now all they can think is evil thoughts about brother branham or all they can think is evil thoughts about you and i just because we believe god sent a prophet who was vindicated with many vindications praise god amen and i think the best vindication is the word of the lord the revelation of the holy spirit praise god because brother braham said the seven seals were his greatest meetings of any meetings amen he said better than any healing healing meetings better than the salvation meetings he said because this is revelation of truth praise god amen oh it makes me happy tonight praise god that god sent a prophet to finish the mysteries of god and gave him many vindications praise god he raised up a u.s senator praise god out of a wheelchair amen god took his picture with him with a pillar of fire in front of thousands of people in texas praise god this was no an ordinary man this was a prophet of god amen and yet some people brother jose can walk away they can they can believe it for a while but then they can walk away and i believe god is merciful to some of them that don't know what they're doing i believe god can still save them because i believe god is a god of mercy praise god and why would jesus say that why would jesus say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing still forgive them and that would only does that forgiveness only apply just at the cross or would it be god's way of mercy all throughout the plan of god i believe it'd be all throughout the plan of god because we see it in matthew 25 as we'll get to tonight we see people mercy that didn't expect it right and so when we see that we see a pattern of god's behavior all down through the bible times and all down through history praise god and we know the other example right joseph pardoning his brothers did they know what they were doing they didn't know what they were doing they were blinded right they didn't understand and joseph had to tell them you're forgiven god did this praise god amen god did it yes god allowed it god allowed them to get angry with joseph and throw them in the pit of him in the pit and sell them off to egypt so that god could preserve life and yet joseph forgave them because they didn't even know they that they were in the plan of god amen oh church can we say like this how many know that god's thoughts are higher than our thoughts amen god's ways are greater than our ways we may not understand what god's doing but god is doing something praise god we're even now even now by god's grace he's doing something now in 2020 as we come to the close of this year praise god he's doing something now we may not be able to see it but our duty is not to understand everything it's to believe his promises amen yes we'll understand a lot of the word we'll have good understanding in the doctrine and and how god works we'll have good understanding in that but we won't understand everything and even like we were talking on sunday with the squeeze we don't we didn't we don't even know what's going to happen with the squeeze there's some quotes there brother man says we'll be hunted down there's other quotes where he said the rapture will be so easy he said it'll be he said it'll be an easy thing it'll be just like going for a walk right and then there's other quotes that brother adam says that jesus will keep us from that our temptation right uh and so there's some quotes that make it look like there's pressure there's other quotes that make it look like it's going to be uh he calls it an easy thing but we know this if the anointing's on us it will be an easy thing praise god if the anointing of the holy spirit is transforming our minds then we'll look past these five senses praise god and we'll look to that sixth sense of faith praise god amen that's right now so that's the first one psalm 69 20. now verse 20 let's go down to 21. they gave me also golf for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink so this is of course speaking of the crucifixion now look at verse uh 26 for they persecute him who has thou smitten and they talk to the grief of those whom now has wounded add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousness let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous what a statement this is a psalm of david wow david again is prophesying of the crucifixion praise god how many times does he do it as a type of christ praise god hearing prophesies he says let their names be blotted out in other words god was looking down and he was seeing which ones at the cross were sincere the ones that were sincere and despised jesus he said i'm going to blot your name off the book in heaven he said but those you that don't know what you're doing i forgive you praise god i'm grateful for god's forgiveness how many want god to forgive you when you don't know what you're doing how many want god to forgive them when you do know what you're doing amen right i want god to forgive me when i purposely do something wrong or i'm in the flesh or i'm upset or i'm discouraged or i'm i'm doubting or anything like that i want god to be merciful and forgive me praise god amen jesus didn't pray in vain did he do you think he said a vain prayer of course not that means god forgave some of those that didn't know what they were doing but scripture tells us some of them did know what they were doing and so their names were blotted out now let's go to romans 11 here i just want to bring that back up that was such a powerful point to me i didn't really catch that until i wrote this chapter and i thought that would be necessary to show by god's grace so romans 11 uh there's three great truths regarding israel's blindness in this chapter three great truths the first one is they're not blinded forever praise god right that's verse one and now read verse eleven we read verse one for our opening romans eleven one they're not blinded forever now think about that hath god cast away his people it looked a lot like he was going to cast them away because he said i was married to you in ezekiel 16 but then i found you immoral so i i put you away i'm writing you a bill of divorcement remember that in jeremiah jeremiah says god wrote a divorcement for israel and sent her away right he was so upset with israel he gave a divorcement against him sent him away and said i'm taking a gentile bride you would think that he'd be done with her but he wasn't because god is a god of mercy praise god and he's going to remember the covenant he made to their fathers abraham isaac and jacob praise god hallelujah and remember his word he remembers his love for those that are faithful amongst israel praise god look at verse 11. i say them have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid so everybody see when you stumble does that mean god's done with you when you stumble no sir he says god forbid but rather through their fall salvation is coming to the gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy in other words i'll say like this jews should watch our services and they should be jealous of how we love god right they should be jealous of our joy our freedom our liberty right our they should be jealous of us and the power of god because they've turned it down they turn on the power they turn on the blessings of god they should be jealous of our spirit that we have amongst us praise god the holy spirit that's amongst us hallelujah the bible says it provokes them to jealousy they should be jealous of of your feeling of how you feel forgiven praise god of how you feel so close to heaven are you assured of your destination you're assured to reach heaven you're you're guaranteed to reach the goal they should be jealous that you've got a seal praise god that your destiny is sealed to the day of your redemption praise god that's what the bible says they should watch and be jealous i'm glad pakistanians are watching for jose i'm glad colombians are watching or anything i i hope i hope if they're not born again i hope they're a little jealous too praise god of the freedom and love that we have in christ jesus amen i never forget when that uh hindu guy came to our church over at waterloo him and uh he came in there with john and i and he's like how do you preach like that he said how do you how do you rebuke all the sin john john and i were just kind of laughing he's like how do you do that he said if i preached like that acted like that my wife would laugh me out of the church because he said i can't live any of those things he said i'm a hypocrite to my wife now think about that church he was just walking by and heard us clapping and singing in that little hole in the wall and he said i just want to go in there and see what it's about and it so moved him that he had to come tell us that he was amazed by the sincerity and the love that we had and the standards of truth that we had praise god he didn't he wasn't used to he didn't see that and he was so thought so much about it he spent an extra two hours after service to tell us what he thought about it does your life should your life and your love make people jealous yes mine does at least mine john and i and we did at least a few years ago right all of us all of our love for god it made them jealous it made them take notice praise god that they had to recognize we've got something they don't have it's christ amen it's god's love it's god's power it's god's spirit it's god's strength praise god amen remember i i didn't plan to say that but story just came to my mind they just get jealous of you now look at verse 15. now the second fact is they're not forsaken for all time that's the first the second is he's saving gentiles while israel's blind and while they stumble so they're going to stumble the bible said they're going to stumble i really don't want to trip and fall on the floor but i was going to just demonstrate it they're going to stumble but not to the fall so they're just going to stumble but eventually they'll get back right they're going to stumble but not fall and be put away i'm glad god brings back the stumbling praise god i'm glad god brings that back those who struggle praise god amen now verse 15 let's read that for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead oh isn't that beautiful church in that beautiful what do you got tonight you got god reconciled to your life you you in other words you had god had no part with you didn't want to talk with you right because we were aliens outside the scripture we are far off from god but god reconciled you say hey come back to me come back to fellowship come know me i want to know you i want you to be in my family praise god that's a reconciliation and the bible says when the israel comes back when their spiritual eyes get open it's like they're going to have life from death it's like they're going to have a resurrection that's what the holy ghost is it's a resurrection praise god it's a seed that's quickened praise god that then right and it quickens my i got in the book i got eight different eight different uh symbolisms that the bible gives with a born-again experience one it's like putting on clothes two it's like getting rain right a third one is like this one it's like life from the dead it's being rotting out and then dying and life springing forward there's all these different it's like an empty cup being filled great god amen it's like a man being circumcised right there's all these different illustrations that god gives us and they're all true and they all point to the fact that we were dead in sins but now we're alive in christ glory thank you lord hmm i heard brother brown say that this week he goes after he said something honey that's how i feel praise god oh my thank you jesus so he's not forsaking israel for all time he's saving the gentiles while they're blinded uh let's read 23 here romans 11 23 and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graft in for god is able to graft them in again wow god can cut off a branch now jose would know about a lot more about this than i would because he's a good landscaper and i'm not god can cut off a branch have it just sitting there and then whenever he wants he can just graft it back in how long does a branch last like that for jose if it's cut off do you know okay yeah that'd be interesting so uh i watched some videos and uh and we've gone to uh apple we've gone to a few apple orchards like two or three and i've seen branches that were grafted on and i've always wondered how you know how long do they got how long can they last being cut off until they get put back in but god is so great he's able to cut off the branch it lays there he's able to graft in the gentile branch produce all this fruit i'm talking about your life church amen is that right your life should have the fruits of the holy spirit praise god amen he's able to and see all these fruits of this gentile uh the gentile branch but then the bible said he's going to cut off the gentile branch and he's going to graft back in israel and they'll bring forth much fruit praise god amen so see their blindness is only temporary because that that branch will be grafted back in now verse 25 though is has an important statement at the very end it says blindness here's the third and most important part the blindness in part has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles come in i'm sorry let me go back and read again the blindness in part has happened everybody say in part ready in part just two little words in part blindness has only happened partially to israel not all israel was blinded to the messiah especially back in those days right and at 120 in the upper room get the holy ghost and all these other jews 3000 on the day of pentecost from all different nations jews three thousand got the holy ghost and got born again there so see it's only in part it's a partial blindness it's not a full blindness all right so that's the most important parts to say there now i want you to look at this too let's look at verse 5 romans 11 5. now romans 11 5 says even so then at this present time also there's a remnant according to the election of grace so that's what paul's saying there is a small group of elected gentiles remember the bible said many are called but you are chosen right so election means call they were called uh to this so i like how the bible says it it's an election of grace it's a calling of grace praise god god has done this as a favor to us how many appreciate god's favor to save you from hell praise god amen this is an elisa is a calling an election of favor amen he called you in his favor praise god an election of grace and he uses himself as an example paul said i'm an israelite i'm a seed of abraham i'm in the tribe of benjamin and so he says i'm one of those elected grace i'm so glad i'm one of those millions that brother branham saw running to him i'm beyond the curtain of time praise god i believe i'm one of them praise god just one of those that are elected to grace in this hour praise god amen remember paul said god forbid he would cast away his people he says it twice church twice he says god forbid because god is not gonna put them away notice and notice if you read this church paul never condemns israel does he he never says all these are oh they're surely headed for hell or anything like that he never says anything like that right now he reconciles them i'm sure he reconciles the gentiles now while the majority of israel is blinded pull up luke 21 24 this is such a uh foundational scripture for this revelation this uh revelation of the mystery of israel's blindness jesus christ calls it the times of the gentiles praise god so we're not you know with the church ages we're not you know making that up that's from christ christ calls it it's a time of the gentiles and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations look at that all nations israel's and all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down in the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled so that means uh that means israel israel is not going to have control over jerusalem until the rapture goes right until the time of the gentiles be fulfilled so we got that's why we always keep our eye on israel right that's why we're interested in these peace deals right they have another one this week they made another one this week i think it was saudi arabia if i'm not mistaken they're in the talks i don't think it's official but they're in the talks so jerusalem will be uh it'll be taken control of by gentiles until the time of the gentiles is over and i don't know church i don't know if we'll see uh the gentiles lose their control i don't know if we'll see the temple rebuilt so the thing to do is stay really close the thing to do is stay attached to christ like a grafted branch and bring forth much fruit amen that's the thing to do how do you say how do you bring forth much fruit brother jesse abide in christ and christ is the word stay in the word stay in prayer jesus said apart from me you can do nothing i don't know about you but i want to do something for jesus and so if i'm gonna do anything for jesus i gotta abide in jesus i gotta abide in the word i gotta stay connected to the word in order to abide in christ that's how you bring forth much fruit all right now that's the that we there are six there's six proofs god can save blind and jews we've gone through two the cross jesus prayer paul's writing in romans 11 they can be saved uh next foreshadowing in the life of joseph all right so this shows that jews can be saved at the white throne judgment despite uh rejecting christ in their lifetime joseph's life's life before slavery types jesus's first coming to earth and remember a type four tells someone or some event to come in the future that's what a type is now let's go through these these are just real beautiful to go through joseph was beloved of his father jacob christ was beloved of his heavenly father joseph was spiritual he shared prophetic dreams with his brothers who despised them can you imagine despising people's dreams you know why it despise them because they were bowing down they didn't want to be humble right right but if ever if i ever saw a dream of bowing down to jesus i'd say amen right because he's he's the one we're all going to bow down to praise god he said uh then christ was spiritual preaching and prophesying to israel who despised his words joseph was sent to check on his brethren but they sold him to egypt christ was sent to preach to israel but they sold him out to rome joseph was falsely accused and in prison jesus falsely accused and arrested while in prison joseph ministered to two prisoners one lived one died while on the cross jesus was between two prisoners one was promised eternal life in paradise and the other lost joseph was resurrected out of prison and set as second in command of pharaoh jesus was resurrected on the tomb and ascended to the right hand of the majesty on high tonight where he sits tonight making intercession for you amen he still sits up there wanting to hear your prayers wanting to hear your worship wanting to meet your needs if you just believe it praise god amen well second in command joseph was given an egyptian or gentile wife just as christ now offers salvation to the gentiles and he's been given a gentile bride the new testament church during the famine joseph's brothers go to egypt to get food but they're blinded to their brothers our identity yet he's merciful to them and the saints said they're blind and they don't know who he is but he's still merciful to them they've done evil to him right they've done evil they understand it but he's still merciful to them he still feeds their hungry souls oh my what a savior in type jesus was crucified in order to spiritually save all people gentiles and jews during the spiritual famine of the seven church ages let me know this has been a spiritual famine the bible said there be a famine not for the food or water but for the hearing of god's word right and you know what was the worst famine the worst famine was actually during the fourth church age brother braham said that was the darkest time now is the most deceitful time right the most deceptive time but brother rams said in the in the that third tier church age jezebel uh took them to the very depths of satan can you imagine that that woman leader taking them to the painted face short-haired bob-haired sexy dress murderous woman she took them to the very depths of satan as low as you could almost go take the word from them take everything away from them uh they hardly have anything right but then god jesus said don't touch their oil and wine praise god hallelujah don't touch the the revelation that they got don't touch the holy ghost of the god let the saints keep that experience with god amen but jezebel took them to the very depths sounds like a famine to me right they're battling the very depths of satan himself yes we know it's true now the white throne judgment i'm sorry i got one more to go joseph then gives his brothers land in goshen with everything they need so will christ reveal himself to the jews during the tribulation and re-establish them in their promised land jerusalem so he reestablishes his brothers praise god that's what we should be doing is there anybody that you can help and strengthen this week think about that anybody who can strengthen over thanksgiving break right well at least for me i don't know hopefully you got nobody know you guys don't have to work over thanksgiving but who can you establish who can you strengthen who can you be a blessing to to make them stronger and to make them more in love with christ who can you help out that's a good question i trust the holy spirit we'll put somebody in your heart here i know we can help out that columbia sister can't we jose praise god there's somebody there if we if we have ears that can hear right hear what the spirit says to the churches let's hear what the holy spirit's saying and we can help somebody out praise god strengthen them establish them help them now joseph being merciful to his brothers is like the white throne judgment when jesus has all nations before him and he grants eternal life to the surprise doers of good works that were seemingly blinded to his identity during their lives this group has to include israel because the bible said all nations are there this is a blessed group they're saved but they're unaware of christ's presence living inside his followers in other words they're blinded to christ's body his church but let me say like this real christians are not blinded to other christians and the saints said i'm talking about if you've got the holy ghost you are not blinded to other believers go to philippians lydia keep up philippians 4 3. now this is right where i left off with my series on the philippians so it kind of fits i guess for tonight lord willing we'll pick it up maybe sunday we'll see what the lord puts on our hearts all we do is lay ourselves before him and ask god to be merciful let's see if paul how do we bother the holy ghost let's see if he could discern well are these people saved or not can i recognize the body of christ or not look what he says i entreat thee also true yoke fellow help those women which labored with me in the gospel with clement also and with other my fellow laborers whose names are in the book of life amen praise god can paul recognize who's saved church can paul recognize it yeah how do you recognize it the people that came alongside the message and yoked themselves to my ministry amen so joseph leave your names on the book of life sister naomi sister beatrice and my children you little children i believe your names are on the land's book of life praise god remember there's two books there's the lambs and there's a book of life that records all the people that are living but there's a lamb's book of life that's a special book that you can't remove those names hallelujah it's those who recognize the messenger and labored with that messenger for that day oh yeah we know who the body of christ is praise god glory praise god but these people there's a whole big multitude sister beatrice a whole multitude and they're like when did we ever see you i see christ in jose all the time right i hope you see him in me praise god i i want to i see him in you but they're like we didn't even know you were there and yeah brother ann's whole ministry saints is to get you to see what christ in you praise god you're you're god's masterpiece right now is that right the identified christ of every age it's christ in you praise god and you're telling me these people had the holy ghost and like when did we ever see jesus i never knew there was jesus that's that's the only way we see it is in you right the only way we jesus can do anything with hands is your hands right the only way that we can you can spread the gospels through your feet praise god the only way you can preach is through men of god praise god the only way you can train those children and lead them to christ is through your mother's praise god and grandmas for beatrice that's the only way you can do it he can't use anybody else but when we see something happen when we see god do a miracle or see somebody say or something that's christ in them like when naomi and beatrice prayed for my wife for the transverse that was christ of them i clearly saw christ in them because they prayed i'm scared we're scared my wife and i are scared they pray with faith they raise our faith and the next day god hears their prayer instantly like that and like i said i didn't go run to my mom who's got bob here i didn't even go tell her to pray for me because i didn't need to because god had these sisters right here to pray for us amen see so look at the scripture church look at the scripture a holy ghost-filled saint can recognize other holy ghost-filled saints now there's a few cases sister beatrice knows this very well there's a few cases people we thought heather and his book on the life sometimes turn out we don't know if their names are on the book of life but most the time with most saints that labor with the messenger like paul most of time we know their names on the book of life because paul said i know there are names on the book of life because they labored with me in other words they were yoked to the message church praise god amen they were tied to christ they were tied to god's ministry amen praise god you know church we're really one of the few churches out there that believes in the fightful ministry most denominational churches don't accept any prophets now we don't have many living today right we don't have many brother books prophesied sometimes you know for 30 years and years between i'm waiting for the next one actually but we're one of the few churches sister beatrice in the world that believes in the five full ministry right we got pastors teachers right we got evangelists uh apostles we got prophets we actually believe in prophets today praise god most people don't believe in that and so it separates us right away as wow we're part of the let groom praise god we're a part we're just like paul's group praise god where they had prophets among them amen now our at least in my life the the most prophecy we've done is through prayers through dreams right through dreams and also speaking the word that's for telling the future then it happens right now not every time right i'm still waiting on some of these things i've spoken to i'm still waiting on some of them but the times where it's happened that's the spirit of prophecy is the spirit of jesus christ amen now i didn't mean to go off on all that but praise the lord anyhow amen now see paul knows whose names are in the book of life because you've labored with me i've labored with you i believe your names in the book of life i hope you believe my name's in there too because paul said those who labored with me yoke fellow you realized her she's calling him a bunch of cows did you realize that yolk fella right how many ox right we got any oxen brother says i'm the ox of the team well you can't god doesn't mix other ox with donkeys right like that that's scriptural so god's likening us unto laboring laboring cattle praise god we're just laboring together we're both working together praise god we're both working for the kingdom of god amen we're yoked together in christ jesus amen yes so jesus saves a group who doesn't know who jesus was while on earth they didn't even know who he was but he saves them because they gave him food drink shelter clothing made sick visits and prison visits to the body of christ now here's what i bang and i were emailed about this few months ago is vengeance out there god bless him if he is here's the thought on this this is my thought you know because many times we believe well people got to repent and go to heaven like the thief on the cross i agree too so i so this is what i i've just boiled down to if god saves these people and they're not even realizing what they're doing then to me uh when they when they went and visited the sick person in the hospital that was them trying to contact god saying god forgive me help me to do something right i just want to be what i just want to do something right now that's the only way i can understand it if god does have to say through repentance like the thief on the cross uh then that's the way i'd understand it they they uh they they uh they give food right they give clothes i'm sorry i can't remember the other one oh then they made they made prison business they go visit a persecuted christian and on their way there they're like if there is a god or god i know that's real uh forgive me of my sins i'm going to go visit this christian in the hospital i don't know how it works out but we can all clearly see that this group that saved they don't really know who jesus was right they didn't know when did we see you lord when did we see you but yeah we see god all the time in each other praise god i know about you but i see my wife all the time because she's really patient with me brother jose and she labors and serves these children like like like christ like that's i guess that's the best thing i could say it's like christ and i want to work my tail off so i so they see christ in me only such a devoted dad such a faithful provider that they see christ i want them to see the kindness of jesus christ in me sister teachers that's what i want them to see that there is a dad there that's got the holy ghost that's my dad i hope that's what they say i didn't tell them to say that i don't even know if they say that but that's how i want to live my life praise god that they can see jesus christ in me amen so just like jesus like joseph uh jesus was not blinded to their identities he remembered their good works to the church and he and they obtained mercy just like joseph remembered the good things that the brothers did right they were honest remember they were honest he tested them he put their money back in their back and joseph remembered that they were honest they learned their lesson he remembered the good things they said does my father yet live give me back i want to see daddy praise god amen glory now go to acts 10 34 and 35. then i got another scripture i wrote down i guess i emailed to myself using my voice while i was driving that's really nice i like that voice dictation i'll say hey and i'll say email myself this while i'm driving that's really nice uh acts 17 please 34 and 35. and i'm looking up another scripture just bear with me oh yeah okay all right let's read that how be that certain men claim unto him and believe that's paul among the witch was dionysus the r.o paguet and a woman named uh demerius yeah and others with them verse 35. now i'm sorry i'm in the wrong i must have had a typo was that act 17 ah it's acts 10 acts 10 i'm sorry x10 i i read it wrong i'm jumping too far ahead forgive me acts 10 34. i'm in a big old hurry why am i in a hurry i shouldn't even hurry then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons right but in every nation he that fears him so leave this up here for a while lydia and worketh righteousness is accepted of him so again that that's how i think god could save a muslim now i could be wrong on this but that's what's what i believe i believe that's how god could serve a hindu he really is not into hinduism he's really not into muslim faith he know it's there's none there's no life in it right but yet he fears god he knows there's a god and he he goes to visit a christian in the hospital and he fears god he knows there's a god somehow he can't explain the creation you don't really believe the muslim faith you know he just follows along with it but he fears god and god doesn't respect he's not a respectable person so god's looking for every person that fears the living god and then perhaps through that visit to the christian in the the prison that was his time to do good to jesus and he didn't even know what he was doing he maybe he wasn't sure about jesus i don't know i but how else can you explain it by the scripture we have to look at the scripture and they don't let jesus when did we see you so that they didn't have a dream of jesus they didn't have a vision brother jose they didn't know they didn't even know jesus when did we see you we never saw you we never saw a vision right we never saw a dream but because they did something righteous to a part of the body of christ jesus says you've done it unto me amen now now go to acts 17. now here's the one that's a real stickler here 17 30. well actually go to 29 29. this is paul's beautiful message on mars hill for as much then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like under gold anybody just get happy there you're god's child praise god did you see that i am a son of jesus praise god i'm a child of god amen i'm the offspring of god i'm i'm his son praise god we ought not to think that god is like on the gold silver stone graven by art and man's device next verse 30 because he has pointed day in which he will judge the world of righteousness i'm sorry what was that verse is that the right verse oh sorry okay and the times of this ignorance god winked at so he winked at that uh the previous verse was idolatry right stones and wood and gold he winked at that kind of idolatry but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent how's that done through preachers right that's done through preachers so this is why i said like if god does save these people by repentance then that let's say that muslim person you have to say god forgive me maybe you don't even know his name's jesus but he knows there's a god he knows he's not allah because he don't talk back right he sees that there are the murders he sees there they mistreat women they abuse women from young ages they do evil things women are they don't even have equal status they're like dogs they're like servants in the muslim faith many times but he but somehow he he says god forgive me i know this is a righteous person i knew that i knew that christian uh he's in there falsely i'm gonna go visit him in prison and that must be his time of repentance remember church all we hear about the thief on the cross is he says why you space why why are you thief speaking all these evil things about jesus he's done nothing wrong then he said remember me when you go to your kingdom right he said i'm guilty he said we're all guilty but this man has done nothing wrong so see as long as these people and nations say they're wrong they know they're guilty they haven't seen jesus they don't they're not going to see jesus as the white throne judgment and as long as they do these acts it's as if they're repenting that's what it looks like to me okay i hope that helps by god's grace let's do one more here uh give me uh let me set timer here give me ten more minutes here let's get started on this fifth seal because it's a beautiful beautiful uh teaching here okay so this is number three notice number four we have the first proof of jesus prayer jesus forgives those that are that don't know what they're doing uh romans 11 proves he still says blinded uh jews foreshadowing the life of joseph that's number three proves he saves blinded jews and number four is the physio revelation six nine through eleven lady can you point out there revelation six nine through eleven this is irrefutable evidence and the part i like it's got thus saith the lord behind it praise god brother and said thus say the lord the revelations of those seals are right thus saith the lord revelation 6 9-11 when he opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and the testimony that they held verse 10 and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true thus not or dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth verse 11. and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said to them that they should rest for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled all right now there's a four proofs these are jews you probably can say them right after i do they're slain for the word of god and not the testimony of jesus right doesn't say anything about the testimony of jesus it just says they're slain for the word of god and the word of god is the old testament that's revelation 1 2. can you pull up there revelation 1 2 and revelation 1 9 both say this revelation 1 2. john says i bear record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ amen look at verse 9 i john also am your brother in companion tribulation and the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that's called patmos for the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ so these souls under the altar do not have the testimony of jesus christ they're not slain for jesus they're saying for the word of god all right second they call for vengeance on those who killed them but christians do not call for vengeance stephen in acts 7 verse 6 uh said lay this not to their charge and jesus on the cross said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing real christians pray for the forgiveness of their persecutors third white robes were given to them after they well after they died but christians have white robes already right the baptism in the soul represents as type as a robe because jesus said you'll be endued with power from on high in luke 24 49 and dude means clothes in other words you're going to get a clothing of the baptism of the holy ghost praise god and then paul said in romans 13 14 he says put you on the lord jesus christ amen he didn't say leave it on the hangar he said put on jesus christ so see the holy spirit is like a garment so when you're born again and you're a holy ghost filled saint uh the bible tells us this you have your the holy ghost is like clothes you're clothed in other words the white robe is on your soul we'll say it like that now the real right robe is a glorified body or the theophany right the real white robe is the theophany in heaven that's the wheel with a real white robe sorry i got my words mixed up here but see if when someone's born again they've got the white robe and as soon as they die they go put on that white robe because it's that theophany paul said when my body dies here i go to be clothed with that eternal body in the heavens oh i can't wait to be close with that one praise god i can't wait to drop this one off and get a real one praise god a real white robe a real body praise god that's eternal we'll have no ending no pain see so jesus promises the fifth seal israelis robes just like joseph gave his brother new raymond in genesis 45 22 when he made himself known to them praise god pull that up there genesis 45 20. remember that he reveals himself and then he blesses them with new robes praise god right romans and the bible called it revelation 7 the bible said the father seal is written upon their foreheads amen hallelujah see there's there's these different symbols god uses see on the forehead circumcised filled up uh uh and now here clothed with right white robes praise god all these all point to the baptism of the holy ghost yes here it is uh to all them gave me each man changes of raymond but to benjamin he gave 300 pieces of silver and five changes arrangement praise god that that's the type of being saved your eyes are open to christ oh it's joseph my brother it's jesus our savior and they get the baptism of the holy ghost they get food and new clothes amen praise god what a blessing and fourth and finally he says there's more fellow servants brethren of the jews who must be martyred to fulfill a divine appointed number god's the only one who knows his number because remember they cried out at the cross they said let his blood be upon us and our children that self-inflicted curse we talked about so only god knows that number yet he'll end that persecution when the 144 000 jews are converted praise god and lord willing next time we'll look at this this fifth seal also shows the three different locations for souls after death you have under the altar that's the jew you have paradise which must be by this near the near to the throne of god and then you have prison in the heart of the earth you have three locations right because god's perfected in three three locations for souls then i can find the scripture under the altar paradise above the altar or the heart of the earth the prison house i don't know about you church but isn't it beautiful to see how faithful blinded jews as long as they're true to god's covenant they find shelter for their souls under the altar of god what a beautiful place to be can you imagine you're blind your whole life and you don't even know you don't even know the name of god the god in heaven can you imagine that you don't know god's name in heaven you know there's a god but you think his name's just jehovah right or or just the i am you think that's his name and you don't even know that he's got one name that's above all other names amen and your your whole life you try to serve god as a faithful jew and eat the right foods and try to wear the right clothes and don't eat shrimp and all these things don't eat pork and you sacrifice all that and you go to heaven and you find out it wasn't it wasn't what i thought the god of the old testament is jesus of the new praise god and yet brother sister he still don't hold it against you he says come there's a place for you you had to be blinded so i could see see these other ones up here see these other ones with white robes and palms palm leaves he said i had to blind you in order to save them now how do you think they feel you think they feel pretty good yes they're right under the altar of christ they're right under that altar and they can cry up and say how long well that's basically how they live their life right with the altar thinking oh we're going to get the sacrifice oh we need to alter we need the temple back we need that's all they thought about was the altar to get the temple back and so god fittingly puts them under the altar so they can be close to the altar and because that's what they wanted this whole time they're expecting a physical one but god shows them the true altar the altar of jesus christ let's stand to our feet praise god what beautiful shelter god gives he's blind to jews what sweet confirmation that we have to know that whatever covenant god makes even with a blinded person he keeps praise god amen oh my honey if god ever gave a promise and somebody is able to accept that promise god is going to keep his side of the bargain praise god amen hallelujah thank god even though it's not his current covenant they're blinded to his current better promises he he accepts them when they live under the old covenant because every word of god is yea and amen hallelujah let's bow our heads for a moment musician musician you can come thank you lydia for helping out with chad church if god has shelter for jews that don't recognize the blood of jesus christ how many are thankful that there's a shelter for you as well you're above that altar somehow there's altar in heaven we're above that they're below the altar they're looking up to that but we're above that in other words we've already benefited from the effects of that altar we recognized it we we accepted it we believed in it we didn't speak against it right the jews speak against jesus they don't believe he's the messiah but yet god in this mercy has a place of rest for them praise god and let me just say this too if they can cry out and be heard with a loud voice and they they didn't even accept the blood of christ during their life do you think god will hear us if we cry out loudly praise god and we know who's in heaven we know who the high priest is we know the way to worship it's repent right because without unless you repent god's not going to hear our prayers we know the way to get the blessing back on us praise god if we backslidden and we feel cursed or we we accept the box of rattlesnakes we know the way back right it's very clear through repentance so let's take a moment and let's talk to the lord today you don't got to be loud the beautiful thing is the bible says be still and know that i am god you can be still you can whisper like hannah you can whisper that prayer or you can just mouth the prayer be merciful to me god i've fallen short of your glory god i've really failed this week or god what whatever prayer the grace of god is there to meet it praise god let's pray tonight heavenly father we're grateful for your mercy what shelter you give to blind what a faithful prayer answering god you are to them [Music] when you told us to pray without ceasing come to
