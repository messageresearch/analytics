========================================

amen God bless you all amen thank God for that song for all the songs amen but that song that last song bless into my heart amen thank God for bringing us here safely today amen left South Carolina it was 23° and I get here and you guys are a little lower than us so uh so me and brother Jesse yesterday we were running from the building to the car and uh this is the first time that I can remember cuz before leaving home you know I try to take inventory okay I got this this this I got socks I got belt so I did that two or three times I'm shooting out the door cuz I'm going to an airport I never used before and I'm riding down the road and I'm running it back through my mind okay I got this this this suit jacket I left my suit jacket hanging up so praise the lord it's okay though that don't stop the program of God amen amen I don't want to keep you standing long it's good to be here I'm grateful that the Lord is saw it to allow our paths to cross again I know brother Jesse isn't here but wherever he is I know the Lord is going to bless him and use him as in my heart I feel he always does um I don't believe he realizes the impact that he has uh not just locally but just through his efforts you know for what he sends out um cuz I got friends and whatever a brother that lives near the airport I was coming from he said make sure you greet brother Jesse for me brother I was like I will you know he said I watch his I watch I watch his YouTube videos you know so uh we never know how how we affect other people but God does and whomever is intended to reach or to touch or to change is going to achieve that when it comes from God so God bless each one of you let's get right into the word it's good to see everyone again amen uh my my xrp brother my xrp I know he's keeping in tune with everything and I'm not going to make no more comments about that it's time for the word so but it's good to see you all all right Joshua chapter 7 and starting at verse one Joshua 7 verse1 and as as I believe the intention is for all of the word of God um what's upon my heart is is to to just help right put my shoulder together with the rest of the ministry and of course under the leadership of God to help to unlock all the full potentials of each one of us because it's going home time and um and we need one another yes more than maybe what we realize or rather I'm going say more than what we're mindful of so in Joshua 7 starting at verse one it says but the children of Israel committed a trespass it says in the accursed thing for aing the son of Ki uh the son of zabdi the son of of Zarah of the tribe of Judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel let us pray Heavenly Father Lord we pray that you would help us this morning we're grateful for what you've done so far uh throughout all of our Lives Lord each one of us Lord have things that we can just give you Thanksgiving for father even for just being here Lord you brought us to this Place Lord you brought us to this phase of our lives but Lord there's yet more to be accomplished father there's more that you want to do within our lives and father that's why we're here Lord you gave us the desire to even be in church this morning Lord that's not a like thing many times we don't really see the power of what's really working within our lives Lord because it just happens in such a natural way but yet it's the supernatural moving of your spirit you brought us all us here safely father God we thank you for that Lord there are many that got into accidents today there are many that died today Lord God but you saw fit that we might be here Lord evidently it's for a purpose there's something that you want to achieve within each one of our Lives Lord help us to draw closer to you and may you just be able to have your way more than what you have before father that's your desire and that should be our desire to give you that first place forgive us of our sins forgive us of our iniquities Heavenly Father Lord we don't want to hurt you father we want to be able to Lord be pleasing in your sight and it's not that we're not Lord because you love us Lord with a love that can't be touched but Lord you have a desire for us Lord there is a place you want us to come to and so you gave us you provided all the tools the necessary tools for us Lord God to come into those places we thank you for the precious gift of your your Holy Spirit father it's been moving in all of our Lives Lord and may it move in a greater way in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ may you bless your word to the hearts of your children in Jesus name we ask it amen amen God bless you Sint you may be seated for those that don't know me um brother Dennis McBride um Columbia South Carolina uh five kids my wife my everybody is getting bigger and older amen rightfully so right that's what life does you know that's the intent my oldest is 26 my youngest is 16 that's my my baby girl four boys and a girl uh my son Benjamin he got married so uh kind of embarking on new territories there for me right but God's grace he's doing well amen so we just thank God for not only what he's doing in my life but I know each one of you can see his hand in your lives as well so I'm just grateful for what he's doing amongst the body um okay this particular message here um it really did something to me it really um it really did something to me in a good way um you know God always he has his ways of encouraging us you know he has his ways of dealing with us to help us to um to become better positioned so that we can be better used by him yes right amen and for the theme of what we're going to talk about this morning morning so that we can be a better benefit to one another amen right cuz we're a body yes amen what's what's one common thing about the body that you living in right now for for every part of your body what's what's one common thing they're all connected your whole body is connected one part is connected to the other and that helps with the functioning of the whole body and you need for every part of your body to work in the intended manner that's right isn't that right your thumb is a very little compared to your forearm and your bicep your thumb is kind of small in respect to your thighs and your feet right but if it don't work how would that make you feel would that affect you yes what if your fingernail somehow came off it serves a purpose that's right right uh what if all your fingernails came off you couldn't scratch right so if mosquito or whatever get on you couldn't right so it'll affect you if it's not able to do what it was intended to do if it's not there right that's how we affect one another so in our opening scripture here I chose this and this is kind of going to reach out and reach deep into different areas but I chose this portion uh just because of how it's worded right our bodies are connected the head connected to the neck so on and so forth right uh and here it's it's not a glorious thing to highlight but yet I believe it's a needful thing God gave Israel a promise um and and he he had intended on giving them everything that he said that he would right uh his word Can't Fail his promise Can't Fail amen right so God made this promise so it's as good as done that's right as soon as he declares it it's done so God told him I've already given you the land that's right amen it was already their he said just go and take it right so now he's leading them into this these battles or whatever to obtain the promised land that he said he had already given them so it didn't matter who is in the land the bottom line was the land was theirs and I want to encourage you because it doesn't matter what you have going on in your life you're going to come into the place that God promised he's going to bring you into sometimes our battles get hard they get heavy and they can be a bit discouraging at times amen but don't don't let the Giants in that land the demons that show themselves to be strong be a discouragement to you because your God is greater can we say praise the Lord today praise the Lord amen I know there are heavy burdens I know there are obstacles there are things that we're all really going through right because especially once you make that decision to live for God your battles are going to intensify they're going to multiply that's right you know and then you know because we have this sometimes thought of how Christianity should be you know man Lord I'm making a decision for you so now I know I'm going be shed with all kind of blessings and benefit and that's all true but the way in which he does that we don't we don't all we're not ready for that because God allows you to experience the bitter moments all of that is a part of giving you the promised land because there are things that he's establishing there is a relationship amen right there's a relationship that he wants to have a meaningful relationship amen not just coming to church and then going home and getting used to a religious program but no matter if you in the church or whether you at your in your at your job or whatever act an actual relationship to where he comes and moves on your heart and he talks to you and you can come to recognize that voice and then you can begin to talk back to him and you see him coming in and in a in a very intimate way moving in your life that's where it's at amen blessings thank you Lord you know all the things you do for me thank you Lord but that relationship that's his heart's desire amen he do all of that just to show you I'm real amen I'm on your side I'm here to take care of you I'm your God I'm your father I'm your husband I'm going provide everything I said I'm going provide for you but I want you to love me too amen amen yes I don't want to be the only one just giving my whole heart and making sure you're taking care of and looking after all of your needs and being there for you what about you and what you give to me that's what I want amen amen amen so with that being said I have to bring it to this place because in the midst of our battles God is delivering us from ourselves yes amen you can't really blame the devil for nothing cuz who makes the decisions Satan can't make listen Satan can't make no one of us do anything right can we say praise the Lord to that Satan can't make no devil can make you do anything all the devil can do is suggest to your mind what it's trying to lure you into but you have the power of decision it can't move Satan could not overcome Eve until her mind first changed she had to make the decision to consider what Satan had presented to her and once she did that she gave him the open door to come inside of her then that's when you begin to see her views change it's because when she opened up her mind to consider what Satan was saying the Spirit came into her right then and that's what brought about the the further changing of her views she began to see the tree as being one that was good for food and to make one wise but that was because Satan now had come in and now his mind was taking over her mind and causing her to see his what he had as being good and that's the only way a person can sin is because Satan successfully sells to you his product and causes you to see some sort of a benefit or something that you can achieve by giving yourself over to this thing and that's where bondages occur that's that's where oppressions come in at meaning now this evil spirit is moving and it it and the more place you give to it the stronger it becomes into what the Bible calls a stronghold because you a child child of God you don't want to do these things but because of the areas of weaknesses you find yourself giving in Temptations mental cuz Spirits they speak to your spirit right those the a Spirits a demon's voice comes to you in a form of a thought just like God's voice is thoughts he'll put on your heart to go pray but you just find yourself thinking on it but it's actually God speaking to you he'll tell you to go read your Bible the devil ain't going to tell you to do that ain't that right right but that's how that communicate and it listen that communication is taking place right now angels are present the holy spirit is present but demons are present and they try to work to distract us from the things of God to help us not Not to cause us they want to cause us not to be able to tap in to that flow of the spirit of God to be able to hear his voice it happens God God moves in such a simple way Saints we won't even it's like if God don't help us to catch it we'll miss it cuz he's so simple and he moves within natural things in the day of the Judgment who's going to judge the world it's going to be the Saints yeah yes right natural people common people you and I with common simple voices that people come across all the time right but in that day of judgment they going to be surprised to see us standing with our Lord and they're going to be judged based off of how they responded to you and I you understand that yes but all that stage is being set right now every anointed sermon you understand what I'm saying every day that we go out into the world and the world crosses our paths there are things that God moves you to say and sometimes it's just your life being lived it's preaching it's saying something it's uttering forth the voice of God and in that day of judgment people are going to come up and they're going to be without excuse because they would have came in contact with God in a Veil form and you understand what I'm saying only by the grace of God can somebody see beyond that Veil many rejected Christ and the day that he was on the earth and he was fully God in flesh that's right many people bumped up against him in the marketplaces right and didn't even realize who he was and this is the bride coming of Christ he's here right now am veiled secret things David he had a desire he really wanted to live close to God but he he he he was a man he felt he knew his passions he knew his weaknesses you can see it all in the Psalms he's pouring his heart out amen and I love I mean but David was very real with himself right he had some blind moments like he did with bash Sheba right but that's when demons get upon people that'll blind a person's mind to make them not realize and see things in the right reality he just got caught up in a moment of passion that demon had taken control of him and he even had a man killed to try to hide his sin when you got to hide anything you ain't got to ask nobody if it's wrong that's right if you got to hide it that mean it's wrong that's right and we all the Lord brings us through all these places to navigate our lives and all the cuz you know he he's combing through our lives because we're going to be right where we need to be in the exact form that we need to be in God will not fail his word will come to pass so because we have a high calling like we do God can't let us get by with nothing absolutely nothing because of who we are we are part of him we are part we are his wife we are the very word itself you were born with that seed of God inside of you and God comes to meet that to activate that to release the life in that seed just like a normal g a gardening out in the field he lays the seed there and he comes and he takes care of the ground around it to create the atmosphere so that that life can be released amen that's what you and I have been experiencing MH but because of that see God is he's light and in him is no Darkness at all amen amen so even though we were born in sin shaped in iniquity right that seed once that life is released God begins to come to you and I and the Bible calls it the circumcision made without hands what does that mean he's circumcising he's cutting away those things that are not supposed to be there yes amen even when you begin your walk with God and you actually begin to show signs of life meaning you see that he's moving the Bible says when that tree begins to bear fruit now that Gardener will come in and he'll Purge it that it might bring forth more fruit because there are things that are still there that's hindering the full blooming the the the full ripening of that fruit that's in your life those those leaves and those branches that get into the way of the sunlight that's trying to shine down into our life to bring everything out to way to to the way that God intended for it to be then God will come in by the Holy Spirit and he'll begin to bring a word to cut away all those things that's blocking or hindering the full the full shining on of his light of his life right so in the process of that that purging it brings us to this because secret things Paul David said Lord cleanse me from Secret faults if you have anything Secret in your life right now you already know you already know what you need to do don't let it just go free don't let that devil have his way God did all that he did so that we can be free amen so be honest with yourself don't play don't play with it you understand what I'm saying cuz if if we're the bride of Christ this is where our heart is Lord I don't want nothing in my life I don't want no hindering we pray that prayer right Lord come and move in my life Lord I want you to feel my life that's right but then the devil can just bring these little Earthly carnal insignificant when you really look at it how none of it benefits us temporarily some kind of little fleshly appeasement or satisfaction or whatever but what has it done for you but hold you back Paul was speaking to the bride of Christ in his day and he told them let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily does what he said beset us that we might run more freely yes when you ain't got no weights on you man you can take off that's right you got those weighted vests you know I had a friend of mine man he tried to kill me but it was in a good way we were exercising together and he had that weighted vest and then he let me use we were going up a man I about hund and something stairs and we were up and down we you know I guess the number of stairs at the end of every everything man I I I I guess it was like 2000 and something it was tough but how much more freely and easy it would have been if I didn't have that vest on I probably could have did three 4,000 could have doubled it but when you got that weight on you you can't move but so fast you feel it it begins to Bear you down so Paul is saying that's what sins and stuff do for us it weighs us down you know in some places it immobilizes you it paralyzes you so aen he was told by God he understood that's why he did it like he did people that have secret faults in their lives they know what they know it's wrong you can't do that and be a child of God and not feel that uneasiness I never gave you my title the title is coordination amen amen coordination and my subtopic is connected amen when you allow yourself to deal with secret sin in your life when you allow it to be there you're not just affecting yourself this is my main point you're not just affecting yourself it might feel the that devil will make you feel as though in that moment that you can just just you know for whatever it might be you know you can just give in to me and we can just have our time or whatever it'll just be you ain't hurt nobody else but you are in that moment in that secret moment when you're yielding yourself over to an evil spirit you're not you affecting yourself but you're not just affecting yourself aen did not realize that he was connected that's right yes to the whole group of Israel but notice how it says in verse one it says but the children of Israel committed a trespass but it was only aching but God accounted it to the whole group do we see that the children of Israel he said committed a trespass in the accursed thing then it says for aen the son of Camry took up the accursed thing and the anger of the Lord notice now was kindled against who now I want to I'm not going to read all of this verba but I want you to understand something there was a group called AI that they were supposed to go and fight against God had made them a promisees that no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life Joshua knew that he believed God he knew that God was a god of his word so he went out to do exactly what God was said to do and he expected God to move in the way that God said he would move cuz he knew that God couldn't lie but now they're going out and now they're going to assess the situation Joshua say I need for a few men to go out and assess the situation for me and let me know what we need to do to be able to take this land they went out they looked over the land or whatever and the men said they came back and say you know we don't even need everybody we we will be able to take care of them with a few few men so they narrowed it down to a few thousand then they went up against them in their minds cuz listen they didn't know what aan had done in secret listen to the Saints aan knew that he wasn't supposed to have that garment that gold or that silver but in that moment when he was in a place maybe it was a lot of things going on everybody moving around or whatever and that devil just was able to catch his attention I say look aan look at that garment isn't that nice look at the material look at the colors you ain't seen nothing like that before you know he say look at the Gold you know how much you know how much money that's worth the value in that gold and that silver so in ain's mind all about himself just like right now each one of us have a mind mind and nobody knows what's going on in other in each other's mind but God does but this is what was going on now he begins to be sold this product of the devil he said why don't you just go I understand God said but look and now he's trying to make him not even think about God's word in the right way have no fear of the Lord the Bible says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom that's right it helps to guide you it helps to it helps to to kind of guide your day-to-day steps when you can be mindful of him but aan is having this mind battle now he he can't he can't be free with it cuz anything that's right you can just do it openly if there's an apple here you know and and it's for everybody you can go grab a apple and just start eating in front of everybody you ain't got to go in a corner and H unless it ain't your apples and then now you you took somebody else Apple then you go in the room and close the door and try to eat it and throw the little Coral away somewhere wrap it up in the when something ain't right you got to move like that cover your steps make sure nobody got no signs or no evidences of what you've done and those things exist amongst God's people and that's the kind of slavery that the enemy tries to cause us to to be caught up into you become a slave to these secret things so he was he was ushering aen into a slavery and he sold them on it and aen was like well nobody ain't looking gathered it up probably wrapped it up real good somehow then he went he he went to his tent you know kind of like tried to hold it in an unassuming way you know the devil tried to make you real slick with it right you know what I mean you cover all your steps you try you try to appear normal praise the Lord but on the inside is something else going on so he gets to his tent he takes it and he finds a spot and he goes and he hides it and every movement everything he just did it began to send a ripple effect through the whole Camp so now that was done he was satisfied because he took it he he he was satisfying his lust you see so now that was done so now he's going to go back out like normally like he going to go out and try to be amongst the group yeah let's go get him let's go get him so now they go out to fight and now all of a sudden they begin to be beat now the men of AI begin to drive back Israel and thousands of men died why did they die Saints Joshua said hold on hold on hold on something's wrong God what's happening here you said you gave us the victory you said you gave us the land you said no man will be able to stand before us so Joshua is confused and going through the anguish of what just happened why because of one person's secret sin amen right he called Everything to a hope he went out and he began to fast and pray Lord what's happening here why do we have men die Lord he he he got to deal with the families the wives the children that's left behind now because their daddy ain't there no more why did that happened Saints because of one man's secret sin watch this it says in verse 5 it says and the men of AI smot of them about 30 and six men I'm sorry 36 men it says for they chased them from before the gate even unto sharum and smok them in the in the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water so it wasn't thousands it was 36 it says it says and Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the Earth upon his face before the Ark of the Lord until the even tide he and the Elders of Israel and put dust on their head and Joshua said alas oh Lord God wherefore hast thou at all brought brought this people now now now it's changing Joshua's mind God I know what you said but look at what just happened that's not according to your word but he didn't know Saint Saints this is going to go pretty deep here you you got 36 corpses out there you got a leader that's confused cuz he know that he's teaching them right he's being the best leader he can be but he didn't know it was somebody in his church that was giving themselves over to something that was causing spiritual death listen achen was still alive he's the one that sinned he was still alive 36 men went went from this life to the to the next life and the man that did it was still alive and he knew what he had done but he was holding it watch how God deals with their Saints and Joshua said alas oh Lord God wherefore has thou at all brought this people over Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us he's questioning God that secret sin of one man caused the leader to question God he says would to God we have been content and dwelt on the other side Jordan oh Lord what shall I say when Israel turn turneth their backs before their enemies because that was going to to affect every other battle they lost heart then they lost confidence they want they weren't on to winning streak no more so that was going to make it difficult for them to be able to face the enemy because now they wouldn't be able to have the same expectations Lord have mercy oh Lord what shall I say when when Israel turth their backs before their enemies for the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of of the land shall hear of it and shall invi and shall Environ us round and cut off our name before from the earth and what Willl thou do unto thy great name and watch how God responds he says and the Lord said unto Joshua get thee up wherefore liest thou he says thus upon thy face you know what I said you know the word I gave I specifically said don't you take of the accursed thing so you know I can't fail on my promise Joshua so it had to be a failure somewhere in the camp God knew it but listen now please don't lose sight that they were all connected every member of Israel was connected amen ain's failure it affected the whole group and God is holding the whole group accountable able you understand that God is holding a whole group accountable for one man's action and they didn't have nothing to do with it they didn't even know it took place and notice how God talks in verse 11 Israel have sinned you see it Israel have sinned oh my and they have also transgressed my Covenant who he said they you see that he says and transgressed my Covenant which I commanded them for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and disassembled and all also Al so and they have put it even among he says there who wants to be responsible for somebody else's actions like that who wants to be held accountable for something that you can't even control but that's how God set that's how God set it up and I'm going to bring it to the present day because that that's how it's set up amongst you and I right now let me keep with this therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies but but turn their backs before their enemies because they were a curse neither will I be with you anymore my anointing is not going to be there my helping hand is not going to be among you the whole group had the spirit of God withdrawn from them Lord have mercy why because of one man's lust was it worth it was the stealing of those few items the transgressing of God's word was it worth it he says will be he says neither will I be with you anymore except ye destroy the our curse from among you so then Joshua he says okay and now the spirit of God is there upon Joshua still because now the now discernment is beginning to move so Joshua had all the tribes to come and the spirit of the Lord had him narrow it down through a particular tribe and then then God had had him narrow it down to a particular family and then God had him narrow it down now now each person of the family begin to come by and then when it got to aen verse 20 says and aen I'm sorry verse 19 and Joshua I'm sorry let's go Verse 18 says and he brought his household let's go to verse 16 it says so Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribe and the tribe uh and a tribe of Judah was taken and he brought the family of Judah and he took up the family of zah zarit of the zarit and and brought the family of the Zar heits Man by man and zabdi was taken now he's narrowing it down and the spirit of the Lord is moving very keenly now right verse 18 and he brought his household Man by man and aen the son of Camry the son of uh zabdi the son of Zara of the tribe of Judah was taken and Joshua then now now now now now he can't he can't hide if he wanted to Joshua you can imagine how ain's heart is feeling it's about to beat out of his chest cuz for one he was in that presence now just like in the New Testament you know with with with Peter and the husband and the wife once they came in and and into that presence something happened and they lost their lives cuz God was showing I ain't playing no games he was going to make sure that church started off right so when they had that secret sin amongst them and they didn't even have to do it but Satan sold them on the fact you can keep a little more money back you ain't got to give everything and it cost them their lives because of ties paying in their part amongst the church and the devil was able to trick them to make them think they were getting by and they lost their lives but but now aan is standing there and in verse 20 and um I'm sorry verse 19 and Joshua said unto aan my son give I pray thee glory to God uh glory to the god of Israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou has done hide it not from me and aan answered Joshua and said indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel and thus and thus have I done when I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonia garment and 200 sheckles of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekel weight then I coveted them and took them it says and behold they are HID in the earth he buried it under the Earth in the ground he says in the midst of my tent and the silver under it so they go in they find these items they bring them out and in verse 20 2 says and Joshua said why H has thou troubled Israel he says the Lord shall trouble thee this day and they stoned him it says here and all Israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire he wasn't the only one that died he calls other people that what the partaker of his sin and didn't even know nothing about it not only the 36 men but there was others that was there with him that died as a result of what he did isn't that something so you and I we're connected we're connected in a very close manner more than what you realize the decisions you make it don't just affect you good or bad you can make good decisions you can choose to serve the Lord give your life to God uh uh fight against him you know the Bible say withstand the enemy and he'll flee from you right you can fight that good fight of Faith you can labor you can you can pray through you can fast you can you can fight and God will give you Victory and that in turn actually CA blessings and and and and and and just things that that's that's necessary and needed amongst those that are connected to you that you'll become an a a conduit you'll become an open Avenue for the blessings of God to flow through to your family to your loved ones by you being in your position somebody might have a need to be prayed for and now God can use you work through you to lay your hands on somebody and they be healed they they they they they begin to reap the benefits of your close walk with God isn't that what happened on Pentecost right they they gave themselves to God and they were filled with the spirit of God and look how many people benefited amen from the people giving themselves over to the right things Peter didn't know that that man that was laying at that gate was connected to him glory to God huh amen and and as he gave himself to God now that man was able to receive his healing that was already ordained of God to happen but had Peter not been in his position had he been elsewhere in his spirit and in his mind that man would have still been crippled but because of the obedience and the humility that Peter entered into through the baptism of the Holy Ghost he was able to be a blessing and not only that the Bible says that as Peter walked by people laid in Peter's Shadow and were healed he was connected to every one of those lives God already knew who would be healed by Peter Shadow you understand what I'm saying so it works both ways so now coordination that's my title coordination means the process of organizing people or groups so that they can work together properly and well it says the harmonious functioning of parts for Effective results God didn't put us here for no reason there's an eternal purpose that's within each one of Our Lives amen and God God wants that individual purpose in each one of our Lives to come to its full potential and be effective Amen to serve the purpose that God put it here for to be able to be a blessing to the entire body so that the body can be well and be whole and be able to move forward according to what God had in his mind every one of us have a daily part to play Within that right now every one of us in our decision making we play a part in the functioning and the moving forward of the body of God the holy spirit is here coordinating all of us come from different walks of life different backgrounds we're each dealing with different things in different areas of our lives and the Mighty God is amongst all of us working Among Us healing us delivering us bringing us to our rightful positions that he ordained for us and the closer that we each get to him we begin to see an enhancing of the atmospheres and everything it's a different atmosphere in your home the more we humble ourselves husbands and wives praying giving ourselves to God you can't tell me you don't feel the sweetness of that atmosphere glory to God you can't tell me you don't feel the power of that Spirit it moves across your heart sometimes it just brings you to tears here recently I just been in a whole different place man I wake up and I want to pray and I I ain't I'm not I'm I'm I'm not trying to put myself on the pedestal because I'm not by far I'm just saying I'm just I'm just kind of sharing with you amen I have a death sentence in my life all I want to do is die amen I want to die for you amen but Le Brandon said living He said eternal life is living your life for others amen I'm talking about coordination and connection living your life for others I ain't talking about doing good deeds I give you a ride brother on your tire flat I come change your tire out what's the point of me coming to help you change your tire out and then go and do a secret sin amen I'm not living for you I did a good deed I can feel I help the brother out today I helped the sister out sister you need some money for grocery I give you some money for grocery and man I said oh praise God brother you didn't know I needed we have no food but then you go and do a secret s mhm you tell me what what benefit was the giving of a grocery now that might have satisfied a natural need but you're hurting that sister more you ain't living for I'm living for brother look I was there for when she needed me Lord let me be the one to be used but yet at the same time spiritually speaking you're doing things that's hindering her in some way form of fashion Paul said do I give my body to be burned do I got faith to move mountains do I got all wisdom I got Revelation you know I I I feed the poor and all he said though I do all of that but if I have not charity he said it don't profit me nothing charity is love charity is God himself the holy ghost tabernacling in your body having me preeminence you understand what I'm saying the love of God living inside of you causing you to become the Living Word character Behavior righteousness not your own righteousness but the righteousness that exceeds that of the phes not by our willpower but by the power of the Holy Ghost Christ in you living his life through you amen you understand what I'm saying and it's so simple that's why people are missing the third pull everything is so simple it's just Christ having a preeminence inside of an ordained soul and when he chooses to show himself he has a vessel that's died and has loves him enough to where he can just move through at any given time that's the life of Christ amen you understand and the Bible says he's the first born among many brethren oh man this thing goes so far Saints pray for brother MCB what time is it I'm not I'm probably have to pick this up at the latter service I didn't know how it was going to go all right so let's touch on this part here cuz that was the Old Testament right but let me share with you something here uh just to kind of connect it along with that the message of adoption 1960 this is May the 15th and it's adoption number one notice what the prophet says here this is the New Testament now meaning after Calvary right the Holy Ghost given and all of that just to show you that God is the same he says here there's where the church is failing today he says on that walk do you know that even your own behavior listen now can knock somebody else out of getting healed amen I got a few examples here that just really to be honest it brought me to tears just to even consider the fact that Lord I can actually be used to hinder somebody from being healed notice how he said that your behavior your thoughts can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You Believers not Sinners but Believers he's bringing the bride body to a Perfection he's bringing us up to that Capstone Saints he says your your unconfessed sins if you believe can cause listen now remember he told Israel all Israel had Israel sinned I'm not going to be amongst Israel no more right watch how he says this he says you your misbehavior of unconf of you Believers can cause this church to bitterly fail one man's actions one woman's actions secret sin and the church itself you you're not seeing it move forward you you the atmosphere is not quite right and one individual could be the cause of that entire thing we actually have a responsibility to one another more than what we realized and the day of judgment he says you'll be responsible for every bit of it oh you say now wait a minute brother brandham well that's the truth think of it he says and they said and they slayed the amorites and the Hittites but there wasn't one herd among any of them until sin come in the camp and when achen took that Babylonian garment and that gold wedge and hid it under under his Camp he says then the next day they lost 16 we know it was 36 it says Joshua was say stop stop wait a minute there's something wrong something's something something's wrong here we're we're we're going to call seven days of fast God made us a promise there would be nothing hurt us our enemies will fall at our feet and there's something wrong here something went wrong somewhere cuz we got 16 dead many uh uh men laying here their Israelite brothers and they're dead why did they die innocent men because one man stepped out of line you see the reason this needs to be taught the church lining up listen the church lining up with the word of God lining up with God and lining up with each other lining up with each other I never considered this in this way until the Lord dealt with my heart on this so I have a responsibility to you when you talk about living your life for other brothers that's me not allowing the Devil to have any room in my life right because I know it can affect you in a great way the ministry brother Jesse all of us we have that responsibility right but now we're seeing it's not just us but it's everybody you actually contribute to the success of the church pay your ties all of that that's fine but the biggest contribution is you can give your life amen yes amen watch it's a scripture I'mma go over I'm I'mma come down to a close here all right because I'm not even nowhere near it he says the church lining up lining up with the word of God lining up with God and lining up with each other walking perfectly upright soberly before all men he says fearing God because one man stole a gar G and done something that he should not have done took the life of 16 men he say I think it was 16 maybe more he says I believe it was 16 men that was dead Joshua said there's something wrong God made the promise and something's wrong when we bring the listen to the Saints he says when we bring the sick up before us and they fail to be healed he says we need to call a solemn fast call an assembly something's WR wrong somewhere God made the promise God's got to stick to that promise and he will do it now I know there are other things that factor into that so and I just want to say this for conscience sake there are times in which God is working something out in in an individual's life and if the prayer is not answered is not always due to a secret sin lying amongst the people it's just that what God intended to achieve in that person's life life through this Affliction it hadn't been achieved yet a good example is Paul he had an issue with his eyes he prayed to God three times isn't that right yes and God did not come and heal him but God G gave him he told him why he says through this Affliction you have it's causing you to actually be to be used in the way that you're being used for the kingdom of God huh and when God revealed him that it was a reason why that had to be there then he said I glory and my infirmities then because when I'm weak then am I strong he said the power of Christ now can rest on me and because he was solely dependent on God because he was receiving so much Revelation until he could have easily gotten puffed up and gotten the big head you know so God said now to keep you from getting the big head I'm going let this messenger of Satan Buffet you in your eyes and keep you low right so that that mixture is there too but I just want us to be aware of this part right so that we can check up so that we can understand the responsibility that we have to one another amen can we say praise the Lord Saints he says here my oh my I'm I'mma start with this one right here and then we'll pick up from this on the second Service Coordination working together God taking a group of people that didn't have no connection meaning they don't we didn't know one another right then God brings us together under the under the umbrella of his word and his Spirit right amen so now he begins to work with us in our individual lives to bring us to that place to where we can be useful in the body of Christ right and that work is still in progress we're all still a work in progress but it's moving right now I know it is right we're not a bunch of sinners in here and what have you but we are people right and we have things that we're still overcoming right even after Israel came into the promised land and had possessed a lot of land Joshua came up at a certain point he said there's still very much land to be possessed we ain't done yet right we ain't done yet Saints God is still moving there are still things in our lives need to be uprooted amen right so that the clear flowing of the spirit of God can come in and feel those void amen and we can become full of the Holy Ghost and now man it's I mean it's unlimited what God will do Among Us you understand the need for this when we understand our responsibility and our accountability to one another and then we all we all in unison together as they did in in the upper room they were up there and they they they they all came to that same Focus their focus became on God Amen and they they were they were ready to lay it all out and then it came down that promise came down in the room was filled and they all became filled with the Holy Ghost and look what happened after that point there's more that God want to do Among Us Saints watch this now now outside of the the Dome of our own lives there's a bigger picture there's a church world that's being moved by evil spirits 200,000,000 Horsemen that was loosed at the river Euphrates they're moving brother Brandon said in the ecclesiastical realm there's going to be a c Coalition there's going to be a a un a false Unity of those churches and they're going to be a boycott and they're going to try to clamp down on the people of God and we are that people you understand what I'm saying so there's going to have we going to have to be in a real place with God because we won't be able to gather like this for long that's been said for years and we're closer to that now than what we ever were before you understand so the holy spirit is moving to bring all of us to our positions within the army of God Amen watch this now I'mma bring it down to this point right here this message is called humble thyself brother brandom says I was thinking and that's very serious that's not to make you afraid that's just the reality he said you watch when that squeeze comes upon the bride he says watch the third pull then now this is this is pertaining to that third pull watch what he says now what's going to bring the third pool into a full manifestation you ready for it yes amen he says I was thinking here one of uh I was thinking here of one of one little illustration to back up what we what he said he says now we look at this watch he says and find out what time it is he says unless that every instrument in that watch he says is coordinating everybody say coordinating one with the other we'll never know the correct time he says is that right he says and that takes all of us he says all together if we want to see the third pool really do something for God he says it's coordination what does coordination mean again just a refresher the process of organizing people or groups so that they work together well properly and well the the harmonious functioning of parts for Effective results so brother brandom is saying here that in order for this third pull to actually come into being watch he says if we want to see the third pole really do something for God its coordination with every one of us together to Humble our ourselves before God and confess our wrong and pray and believe God for these things it's going to take coordination he says each one of us understanding the responsibility and accountability that we have to one another amen how we can affect one another being my that's enough I don't want to hurt my brother I don't want to hurt my sister I don't want to the cause of somebody else not receiving their healing I don't want to be the cause of a church not being able to progress forward because of what I'm doing in my life I'm dampering the atmosphere of the whole church that's not my opinion I just gave you the facts of it you can go back and study it that third pull he said is hinged upon the coordination of the church that's why God is bringing us all into that place he's dealing with us he's dealing with me like I said I got a death sentence in my heart all I want to do is die I see the needs I see needs I see my own needs but I see needs I see needs among my family right I'm like Lord if my dying can cause my family to live can cause them to be delivered then Lord let me die yes let me live my life for somebody else can I give you one more scripture yes amen we okay I got to I want to share this with you man praise the Lord okay it says this is my commandment that you love one another amen glory to God he says as I have loved you amen how did he love us Saints he died for us he died listen now he said it he says oh my because I live he said ye shall live also they were already alive but according to the first birth he was talking to people that was living and breathing their hearts were beating their lungs were function but he said because I live ye shall live also there was another part to them that had to be released and it took him going to Calvary death burial and Resurrection to cause the igniting of that life and the releasing of that Eternal part of who they were to come into a manifestation amen and they begin to live in his sight Oh my he says this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved loved you he says greater love haveth no man than this that a man lay down his life it says for his friends amen he says ye are my friends noce now they sing that song I Am A Friend Of God I Am A Friend Of God I Am A Friend Of God I can't do that better than you brother he says notice now ye are my friends he says if ye do whatsoever I command you so many people sing that song and they're not the friends of God because they don't respect his word now in the Amplified Bible it reads as this it says this is my commandment that ye love and unselfishly seek the best for one another just as I I have loved you no one has greater love nor stronger commitment than to lay down his own life for his friends ye are my friends if ye keep on doing what I command you eternal life is living your life for others laying down your life for your friends amen that's not a physical death altogether but it's a spiritual death to self so that somebody else might Thrive and receive what that what they stand in need of may the Lord bless all of us Saints Amen to become coordinated amen because we are connected amen yes you can't deny that now you could have denied it before you were mindful of before but from this point on you see it amen by the grace of God so may we love one another am God bless you Saints let us all stand together and let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise [Applause] thank you Lord amen um if anybody desires prayer as we bow our heads
