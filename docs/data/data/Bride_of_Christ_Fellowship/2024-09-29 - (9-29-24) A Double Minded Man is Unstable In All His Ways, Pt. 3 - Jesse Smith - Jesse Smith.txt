========================================

house the Lord hallelujah let's go to James chapter 1:8 we'll read James 4:8 I want to continue this little series here wasn't expecting it to be a series but feeling the inspiration of the Holy Spirit praise God so part one we looked at James 1 and James 4 and then Eli and Wednesday night we looked at part two we looked at James chapter 3 and we looked at the life of King Saul so that was quite astounding to me I'm certainly enjoying the word of God I trust it's a blessing to you Hallelujah today we want to look at a little bit about the fivefold ministry here as it relates to the scripture so James chapter 1 ver 8 read James 4 ver8 James 1 ver8 this is the this is the double mindedness that you and I will battle uh because we go through tests trials we have to suffer through patience right learn patience and this is a double minded that will battle Lord do you hear me Lord uh am I going to make it through this trial Lord what's your will Lord I need wisdom that's the double-mindedness that will battle praise God all right now let's read verse eight ready one two 3 a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways we saw that with Eli he was unstable in his parenting unstable in his spiritual walk with his health right we saw it with everything in his life was unstable because he was double-minded now let's look at uh 4:8 by God's grace let's read this on three one two three draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye doubl minded amen let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make ano unto God God sees all our needs this morning God is able God is faithful Hallelujah he's Eternal he knows all things he already knows what tomorrow holds father God we thank you again for today Lord let your bride come forth as we've sang Lord God we know we're Onward Christian Soldiers we're marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before Lord God hallelujah we remember the cross Lord and remember you died to forgive our sins and then you sent your spirit to empower us to live a Christian Life on the front lines of the battle so strengthen us today Lord God as we all battle double mind Lord as the scriptures Plain on this father help us to learn from these examples of Eli uh Lord uh we saw King Saul on Wednesday Lord and the scriptures we be looking at here today Grant it Lord Jesus may your spirit minister to every need Lord God and we know Lord all things are possible Lord to them that believe so father minister to your people in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God hallelujah so remember uh James 1 deals with you and I we'd say the these are the battles that we would struggle with as far as we'd say holy ghost filled Saints uh by the grace of God uh lacking wisdom sometimes we lack wisdom for our lives we need God's Direction what is God's will for our life and the Bible tells us to not be tossed to and fro uh but to have a revelation to seek God and trust God lord if I ask you for wisdom you're going to give it to me Hallelujah then we saw in James chapter 4 in the beginning there was Wars and fightings among the church members and also there was adultery in the church and uh James says these things ought not to be so he said because these people are double-minded they've got dirty hands and dirty Hearts is what James told us so we see there's two kinds of double-mindedness there's a double mindedness the believer who's living in Victory will uh have to battle and overcome but then there's double mindedness uh we'd say for make Believers or foolish virgin or something along those lines where uh they haven't got enough Grace to really live above the things of the world praise God how many want to be James chapter 1 Believers that's what I want to be Hallelujah I want to be one of those now I want to take this thought this thought struck me real good I think I mentioned in a couple times but not really preached on it um James 1 verse6 so right before verse 8 where we get the double-minded man verse six says but let him ask in faith nothing wavering so you can ask in assurance and this is what we're you know we're taught brother BR taught us this I try to remind you of this after we say a prayer for you go back and thank God that he heard your PR prayer praise God while you're finishing the service praise God uh on Monday praise God on Tuesday amen praise God let it be a uh let it be something that's finished in your life praise God it's got to be finished right because we have to ask with an assurance Lord I know you heard my prayer last week uh think about it you know last time you come up for prayer are you still hanging on to God's promise amen hallelujah that's what the Bible's telling us don't be double-minded be assured if God didn't send it a week then he'll send it next week brother BR says if you send it don't send it next week he'll send it next month Hallelujah so you have to have that confidence that's what we have to ask in faith with nothing wavering you I think about my my loved ones that I prayed for over the years you know for I prayed for my dad for almost 40 years I'm 40 almost 44 I've probably been praying for him my whole life but I I I have to apply this to my life I'm not going to waver I'm going to trust God right now my mind might battle but I've ultimately got to choose either Faith or unbelief and by God's grace we're going to choose Faith Hallelujah because you got to ask in faith ask with Assurance I know hears me with nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed so here's the this is like a metaphor James gives us when someone asks for a prayer request if they don't accept that God heard them they'll be tossed like a wave back and forth and we've seen some mighty waves with these hurricanes right this hurricane down there you've seen some mighty waves and today this morning I saw Bridges collapse and fall and be washed away bridges of hundreds of tons of concrete and uh the wa the the waves just wash it away and they and they they'll say now now these roads are roads to Nowhere or that bridge is no more there's no more Bridge there right and that's that's the imagery James is giving us our faith can't be like that we can't be driven well I believe it today or I don't believe it tomorrow we've got to we got to have such a walk with God that God's word I say gives us a revelation it does something deep down inside of us something is quickened on the inside of us praise God we've got to be able to come back to that when God quickened it to me God revealed it to me uh God made it known to me Hallelujah the Gates of Hell won't Prevail against that Revelation hallelujah it's either that or we're going to be tossed like those waves tossed back and forth uh is he does he hear me will he answer does he care does he love me of course God loves us hallelujah amen but we need reminders of that Hallelujah that God hears our prayers amen and we got to have that kind of Faith but we we see that we get this idea of being tossed this means agitate Hallelujah so uh they're tossed like waves agitated like waves Hallelujah it means to Breeze up uh like a fan or Billows like we sing about the Billows roll Hallelujah to Breeze up toss back and forth so if we're not truly convinced when we come up for prayer if we're not truly convinced when we even pray at home then we're going to be tossed back and forth and James said that's not the place you want to be as a Believer you want to know that God will work out uh that P patience will have her perfect work in your life hallelujah amen Bible says in James 1:7 let not that man think he shall receive anything of the Lord now this is this is book of Acts faith and the church said James was one of the original book of Acts Believers amen he was a step brother to Jesus we'd say you know that's right and so he's writing the first uh Epistle of the New Testament the first letter inspired Bible piece here or letter of the New Testament and he tells us we cannot expect to receive anything unless we have faith that God heard our prayer amen hallelujah so God help us to believe I know some Services church it's harder for others to believe than others but our desire is to encourage everyone let's believe on God's word hallelujah let's believe with all of our hearts we all go through ups and downs sometimes we find oursel on the mountain top praise God it's easy to say Amen those times other times we find ourselves in the valley it's hard even to squeak out of Amen but either way God's word is true Hallelujah and God will come chasing us down right God will come uh seeking us out as the the great Shepherd who seeks and saves that which was lost did you ever think of that that sheep was always a sheep is that right church he was never a goat that sheep was always a Sheep amen you always a child of God you're always a daughter of God Amen and God will come looking for you because he's the great Shepherd Hallelujah he's the faithful one but James says please don't be double-minded because this produces an a condition of being unstable or inconstant Conant is another word that's why I like the name constant from our Lamplighter book there Hallelujah the certain ey of The Splendid way Hallelujah he was constant now I read I read this to you last month or maybe a month before brother R was talking about Abraham Abraham was no special man he said come down from the Tower of Babel perhaps come out of an idolator Bunch his father no doubt they were making Idols he came down to the land of Shar down there to dwell in the city of er while he was there God spoke to him by Grace he said oh how Abraham tested God's patience notice the human the believer tests God's patience we all experience that times don't we right we all struggle to believe does God hear me or not and during those times we're actually testing God's patience but Church beyond all of it behind all of it it's actually God testing our patience Hallelujah so we see it in our human failures in our human uh weaknesses when we get feeble-minded or we get tired or worn out or depressed or discouraged it's it's as if we're testing God's patience but God's patience can never fail Hallelujah brother Maham said Abraham spoke of us God took Abraham by grace and saved him that's how he takes you by Grace he said how do we test his patience he says today we're up tomorrow we're down one day we believe the next day we're wondering isn't that the truth I I was hoping to to hear some more amens Hallelujah isn't that the truth someday we you think about where you were last Sunday or the Sunday before or the last time you had a great experience in your life where are you not today where where's that same Victory we had two weeks ago or a year a year ago even where is that see we're up and down God help us to be faithful God help us to be constant God help us to remember that Revelation that he already put in our soul Hallelujah Satan tries to make us forget but God wants us to remember the promises of God that's that's why Peter said stir up uh yourselves by way of remembrance he says one day we believe the next day we're wondering today we're Methodist tomorrow we're Baptist right and some Churches you know today I go to this church in the city tomorrow I go to the next Church in the city right just toss all about toss from that to that I believe I don't believe that church to this church is toss all around that's what he says tomorrow the tummy a comes and we don't know whether we believe it or not God help us but yet in the midst of all that God wants us to stay put it's the so it's the battle it's the battle to stay single-minded on God's word despite our sickness despite our struggles God wants us to be single-minded but brother says but he saves us anyhow if it wasn't the grace of God we'd all be gone sure God Saves Us by his grace all right now I saw this connection James 1:6 with Ephesians 4:14 so if you have your Bibles go there by God's grace and while while we're turning there I just thought of that you know this this whole series was of course stirred up by what brother Dennis preached and then brother Ben NAD uh but then also there was a question on YouTube I made a video about Derek Prince I don't know if you saw that or not um Derek Prince said uh brother brandham had two Spirits working in him and that didn't sit with me really good that didn't sit good at all with me and I thought about it and uh and that's not true you know uh he he uh Derek Prince said brother Ram was controlled by two different Spirits that's a lie to be controlled means to be possessed so it's just ridiculous he don't even the people don't even know what they're saying now blessed his soul he passed on in 2003 but I'm not trying to rebuke him or anything like that God bless him for his faithful years of service but to say something like that it it would mean you're possessed by God and the devil at the same time I'm sorry God doesn't operate his business like that hallelujah what what he was trying to get at which he was wrong what what he was trying to get at is that sometimes Church were double-minded that's how this opened up to me I was like there there's got to be something he's talking about in the scripture and that's how it opened up to me the double-mindedness now brother R was single-minded on Christ I be people like Derek Prince and other ones you know uh Gordon Lindsay and different ones Ern baxer I believe they were the double-minded ones now I say that humbly but I believe I got proof of that because they reject the Lord Jesus Christ baptism they reject serpent seed they reject the God's one person you got to be double-minded to accept things like that that's right Hallelujah now we know Ephesians 4:11 speaks of the fivefold ministry praise God what does this do verse 12 it perfects the Saints for the work of the ministry so it perfects you uh gives you the work of the ministry and it edifies the body of Christ Hallelujah see it does three things there until so it's going to do this until we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man so mature unto the measure of the stature of the full fullness of Christ so all the fullness of Christ that were to manifest the fivefold ministry will bring you into that hallelujah praise God why wh so what's the point of that because we want to avoid verse 14 which is connecting with James 1:6 that we henceforth be no more children see it's children it's it's immature Christians that are tossed to and fro remember James gave us that same language tossed right tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine see so so one week they believe this side of the doctrine the next week they're back over there few years later they're over here and over there and all these different things that that they're get they get tossed back and forth I used to believe this I don't believe that God help us to find the truth on something and stay with the truth Allelujah see that by the slight of men now that means the uh like the the rolling of dice so false preachers get anointed by demons and and they they they just try to gamble they just try to deceive a person with their preaching ing make it a A sly they put like they try to put sly little lies in their sermons that's right and cunning craftiness whereby th Li and weight to deceive now often they're trying to deceive you mostly into money mostly false preachers are after money that's the one they're after the most right but then there's women also popularity so that's why they want to deceive mostly it's because of money right because what where do most people want to go how many people we had just this year come by and say oh we're looking for a church and they say well there's another church here there might be the same distance which church do they normally choose the bigger church right my wife and I my wife and I seen that different three or four couples this year uh which church you want to go to the big church little church it's always the big church and that's fine go where God leads you right but see most people are attracted to crowds money buildings all these type of things but we've got to be attracted to the word of God hallelujah we just got to be what God called us to be brother bam I just listened to brother BR yesterday he was saying the whole armor of God he was saying we're just a little group here we only have 300 or 400 people now we call that a big group but brother said we're just a little group that was in 1962 he said we're not with that big group he said but you notice God's normally with the small group not the multitude he said wherever two or three are gathered there I am in the midst Hallelujah so see it's you know it applies of course to the 300 as well you know but it's wherever the Believers are praise God so notice if if if listeners to preaching if they don't accept the true five full ministry what would they do they'll be tossed to and fro on every wind of Doctrine and I preached doctrines of devils two years ago I went through all those examples the main one right now is Prosperity Gospel oh if you're in the message you ought to be rich and healthy and God wants to heal you every time and all these what a bunch of nonsense yet the very same people that say that their loved ones will die or you know uh where was your faith you know they're almost admitting that they're wrong I mean their own actions prove they're wrong right but they're they're admitting through their preaching showing that they're wrong praise God no healing rest in any man uh no no blessing rest in any man blessing and healing only rest in the will of God hallelujah that's right Church you can't add Bible said you can't add one cubit to your stature praise God you can't make one hair red or one hair white or whatever now they can do it with with with dyes but that that's a demonic we know that Hallelujah you can't make one white hair black or or brown or whatever the color is it's God who's in control praise God so see if we have the true five-fold Ministry we will not be tossed to and fro that's my testimony that's many people's testimony I know in the message they're no longer tossed to and fro God has showed them the truth they're on the highway to Holiness praise God Amen like I told you I had that one college roommate he was good man good man but you know when things were going good he would wear the sweatpants you know but I remember specifically in the summertime uh he he he claimed to be Holiness he's the one that would speak in tongues and so forth like that all the time he'd speak in tongues I said that's fine I remember specifically that one hot day he said he looked at me he said he said Jess he said man this is too hot for me I'm sorry he said I'm sorry I've got to break the Holiness standers I got to take off my shirt and my sweatpants and we're standing amongst all these people and all these all these Sinners are watching him take off his shirt and strip down while I stay in my my t-shirt and sweatpants and that's just how it was he would go back and forth right wavering back and forth tossed right back and forth moved by conditions but a child of God is not moved by conditions amen like like Simon Simon told me a few years ago he went to Cedar Point and guess who he runs into a piano player in a certain church and she's got short song because it's so hot she got long hair it's uncut maybe I guess I can't always tell that but then she you know she and he's like oh my goodness you know in his mind he's like Mercy oh what's happening you know see that that's what happens to so many people when conditions change their standards change they get tossed by the Heat or they get tossed by by by by pressures of the world but a real child of God stays with the word of God hallelujah brother said if you don't catch in these minor things he said when the major Comes The Rapture it's going to go right over your head he's talking about cutting hair and wearing the right clothes and dressing holy and modest we got to catch it in everything hallelujah it's got to be a reality to us without compromising on the word of God that's right Hallelujah but see these fluctuate to and fro and this is the same guy you know that uh I love a man but this is the same guy he would go to meetings one time we were praying for the Holy Ghost in our three or four of us and he started breaking out in one of these holy ghost laughing spells he called it but I found out later that wasn't the Holy Ghost they literally laugh until they can't laugh anymore like they're just you know we're praying and if you haven't seen it Kenneth Hagen did it Kenneth copelan all these false prophets it's an evil spirit to possess people I always thought that was really strange but I found out later it goes along with that speaking in tongues is the evidence if they take that and they they try to pretend to speak in tongues they can actually get an evil spirit possessing them right because there's no there's no correction on the tongues brother Ram said if you don't have an interpretation for the tongue then you don't know where it came from and that's a very dangerous thing to do right that's why tongues unknown tongues are not the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen how Hallelujah a baptism of the Holy Ghost will produce a see and hear experience it'll produce the Life of Christ amen it'll put you into service so you can Faithfully serve God hallelujah hallelujah you're into service amen you can serve the Lord under the power of God hallelujah amen glory to God but see these outside the fivefold ministry are those disobedient to the five-fold ministry they fluctuate they're tossed to and fro from every move or every exciting thing or every every wind of Doctrine now church I'm not I'm not throwing anybody under the bus because like I said brother man says sometimes we struggle we got a tummy ache I'm trying to be gracious today right I want to be gracious today because I might be on the mountain top you might be on the valley or in the valley and I know what it's like to be in the the valley too we've all been through there but thank God he walks with us with us through the valley praise God now verse 15 what is the what is the true five-fold Ministry produce it speaks the truth in love and it grows up into him in all things which is the head even Christ so see remember all things right that that's if a person is single-minded then their whole life is stable I made a list uh and I didn't read it on Wednesday night so let me scroll up to that because we talked about how Eli was unstable in every era of his life he couldn't get it under control he couldn't get his health under control he couldn't get his job under control his family finances relationships now that's just five areas right there now some people say there's more erors such as attitude priorities thinking commitments Faith generosity values and growth that's what John Maxwell thinks there's there's 12 domains in the human life but see that's what the real fivefold ministry will produce if we love God it makes us stable in all things we grow in our health we grow in our occupation we grow in our faith we grow in our relationships amen we become mature we become more stable in Christ hallelujah amen now is it Satan's job to shake every one of us yes right he's like a lion lion seeking whom he may devour but thank God Jesus came that we might have life and have it more abundantly praise God how many living in the Overflow today we almost s that one by God's grace but I thought I better limit this song service and look at verse 16 from whom the whole body fitly joined together see that's why the body of Christ needs one another we're joined together and we're compacted by that which every joint supplies see every Born Again believer provides something for the other believer that's why brother Ben was preaching to to us stay in your position amen right because that's what it says right here every joint you know every person has a joint or or you're connected somehow according to the effectual working in the measure of every part see every uh yeah every believer has a Measure of Faith as a measure of the one of the nine gifts of the Spirit perhaps more than one praise God Hallelujah and it makes increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so it is a love of God that works through every believer to edify one another to strengthen one another we got to have love love has to be our most important attribute hallelujah amen because the love of God Will Supply what we what the other person needs in the body of Christ Glory so the Bible said no I'm sorry now I'm going to Webster's Dictionary Webster's Dictionary agitate so tossed agitate means to excite often trouble the mind or trouble the feelings to disturb so again people disobedient to the five-fold will be disturbed in their mind and their feelings now we all get feelings Disturbed quite often right sometimes every day but it's a pattern we want to look at the pattern of Our Lives which direction is our life going is it more like Christ or we kind of just you know staying the same God help help us not to stay the same Hallelujah brother R says you really can't stay the same right we should see a trajectory of mostly going up kind of like the stock market right it should kind of be like that constantly going up right we should get Victory on Victory growing in grace and the knowledge of the Lord the word fluctuate in Webster's Dictionary means to shift back and forth uncertainly so see surprises you know sometimes people's character surprises us it shifts from good to bad like Eli like King Saul was just a classic example I think I counted there was 10 or 11 shifts from good to bad good bad good bad bad bad bad good bad bad bad good it was it was constantly this man's life was uh it was a constant unstable life Hallelujah and church I looked it up that's what I was telling the children I tell my Lydia helped me on this one he killed 85 priests and their families that's what the Bible says King Saul killed 85 priests and then families on top of that and God still forgave that man that's why we sing about God's Amazing Grace Hallelujah that's why I told the children what I did after I turned off the live stream you know God can save to the utmost think about that God can wipe out 85 Plus murders in a moment prayer now look was he sincere he was up all night church on his face all night and all morning praying on his face remember that we just looked at that in 1st Samuel 28 that's sincerity see if a man or woman are sincere God will get down to business with you Hallelujah but if a person's wavering toss back and forth James says don't let that person think they're going to receive anything from God see even Saul had to get down to business he had to get on his face and lay before God and say take this uh uh spirit to kill David take this off me right take this off me and God did it how many know God's faithful amen oh my so agit fluctuating remember all those that oppose the true five-fold ministry will fluctuate by every wind of Doctrine Hallelujah we see that because a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways now I got a picture on my phone I'm not going to show it but Simon preached a sermon three years ago and brother Steven was sitting right there now he's got a baby him and Elizabeth there I'm just trying to uh what's his last name naava I think he changed it now he changed it to something else anyways brother Stephen and I was s right right be in the back and Simon put up three unstable scriptures and I thought oh my goodness something just struck me about that well this is the morning three years later I'm going to preach it praise God so there there's always a time and season for Everything James 18 says a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways that's the one that impacts us when we need to know the will of God when we need the wisdom of God but it seems far away seems like God doesn't hear us anybody ever felt that like God didn't hear your prayer well you're not alone James says join the club he said but you better get get Faith amen you better seek God till you get a revelation praise God CU you're not we're not going to receive anything from God until we're determined that God hurt us now the other there's two more unstables in the scripture second Peter 214 and 15 now this is speaking of false preachers like balum uh I think Cain's even in this section if I'm not mistaken and Kora having eyes full of adultery again look again adultery just like Eli's sons and just like James chapter 4 adultery sexual sin in the church and that cannot cease from sin they just can't get the victory you know church we ought to come to church sometimes and we're walking in Victory Hallelujah we all go through seasons of Trials Seasons when the enemy is fighting but let's thank God when it when it's our season when we're not fighting trials Hallelujah but see the but these people that are like balum uh who the other ones Kora forget the other one Kane yeah Kan they can't cease from sinning so Cain kept sinning wherever he went right balam kept sinning even though he didn't give a false prophecy he he was true to his gift in that sense of Prophecy he couldn't curse Israel but then he kept sinning he taught Israel to commit fornication isn't it interesting how sexual sin is always tied into these things man beguiling what do they do they beguile unstable Souls they deceive them like Eve was beguiled to morally or utterly seduce and heart they have exercised with Covetous practices curse children now just focus on that word remember Paul said in Timothy we should exercise ourselves unto what godliness so see Church what what matters is our daily lives our daily life is our exercise our spiritual exercise how many know that your exercise isn't going to be so much today it's going to be tomorrow and Tuesday and Wednesday that that's going to be your I mean you can exercise one day a week you'll get a little bit of benefit I I exercise usually one day a week maybe two you'll get a little bit of benefit but if you're exercising three or four times a week you're going to get a lot more benefits praise God so this is the the illustration he gives us we must ex ex I'm sorry we exercise exercise oursel unto godliness I can't say that word today but see these uh Sinners the false preachers they are exercised unto covetousness so see it's all about them the money women popularity it's all about them verse 15 they have forsaken the right way and have gone astray fing the way of balam the son of Boer who loved the wagees of rightness you look at what a person does for money many times you're going to find out where they stand with God sometimes how do they handle their money look at balum right look at all these people so see it's it's it's connected in there look at all these false preachers like I told you that preacher uh he just came out this week he was 73 years old he was one of the he was one of the Holiness preachers now of course they let their women wear pants but he was considered the Holiness preacher and he had a 5-year relationship with a 29 year old woman so 29 28 27 26 25 he's a 73 year old man thought to be the most one of the most holy preachers and see church people can hide these things for a long time but your sin's going to find you out Hallelujah that's right we must love uh we must love the wages of Holiness praise God Amen but these people love the wages of unrighteousness the popularity and you know what you know what he he confessed to he says it was because he traveled Alone by himself he didn't travel with his wife all the time and who knows who did a good job of that brother Bram and who also Billy Graham do you remember that brother BR said Billy Graham before he go into any hotel room he would send a man in there to check to make sure there was no women hiding in there because they they were that happened to him before they tried to tempt him with prostitutes bil Graham said that right they'd send a man there make sure there's nobody in there and Billy so Billy Graham never traveled alone right and how did this man fall in 2024 actually 5 years earlier 2019 through just travel alone having all this free time without that accountability so see how much wisdom we can get from these preachers now I know Billy Graham got off as he got older but when he was in the beginning he was pretty faithful he was brother Ram said he preached salvation like nobody else could preach it right Hallelujah now he got off by the end he was basically saying it was okay to commit abortion by the end end he believed in abortion how does that happen my goodness but look at this here the wages of unrighteousness so see wherever the money's coming from if the people are Unfaithful they'll be devoted to the money and they'll they'll just follow the money right they usually say follow the money Trail is that right Hallelujah that's right Church my goodness so see so we see unstability or instability James says it they'll be in unstable in their ways of their life all their ways second Peter 2 says these preachers like balum unstable they can't stay on the way of right now second Peter 3:14 and remember Simon had this right up here so I'm kind of uh piggybacking his thought there maybe I should say eagle backing or something like that lamb backing second Peter 3:14 wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things what the Millennium Hallelujah and the future home that's what he's talking about new Heavens new Earth be diligent that you be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of the Lord is salvation see that's why time's going on there's nothing wrong with the bribe God's saving more souls Hallelujah that's why we're still here God still saving Souls amen hallelujah like a brother just texted me a brother texted me yesterday he said he was out in a meeting with brother Ben NAD in Arizona he said brother Jesse he said I can hardly contain myself I know I got the Holy Ghost now so I thought God bless brother Ben brother Ben picked him up from the airport they had Fellowship all weekend they went to all these meetings in a row God is still filling with the Holy Ghost you just got to bring an empty vessel Hallelujah he said bring your empty vessels not a few hallelujah amen God's still filling with the Holy Ghost and church he oh yeah that's right he uh he's from Northwestern United States so he traveled very far all the way down to Arizona to go to those meetings see God honors a sacrifice Hallelujah that's why God is holding off the Rapture that's why God is holding off the Millennium because God is still showing longsuffering even now look at verse 15 even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written you now leave that up there this is just struck me Peter calls Paul Beloved the same man that said you're to blame MH see now that's real Christian love right you can take rebuke some from somebody to their face and turn around and say that's my beloved brother oh that's real love right there amen right that's real Christian love oh I love it isn't that beautiful remember brother man said Paul brother man dramatized it he walked right up and put his finger under his nose and said you're the one to blame segregating against the Gentiles Hallelujah he said that's my beloved brother my beloved friend would do that to me praise God hallelujah verse 16 as also in all his Epistles speaking in them of these things which in which are some things hard to be understood how many remember when we preached through Romans some of those things were hard to understand now here here we go here we're getting to this uh fact where people turn away the fivefold ministry or they're double-minded which they that are unlearned so that means they don't study enough before they decide on a matter and the Bible said it's a shame and Folly to answer a matter before you hear it that's right right it's a shame it's a f it's foolishness to say there's no such thing as serpent seed if you haven't studied it out praise God that's right they're unlearned they don't pray brother they don't pray enough they don't fast enough they don't seek God enough they don't study their Bibles enough to really get the revelation of it that's right right what do they do they're unlearned and they're unstable what do they do they rest that means twist like a serpent like a serpent twist right that's what the so he connects them back to uh to balum see these these people these false preachers they'll preach the prophet's message but they're twisting it for their cursed practices that's right Hallelujah remember the wages of righteousness Hallelujah where do they do that as they also do other scriptures unto their own destruction now these are people that are lost now these are lost preachers so I'm not talking about foolish virgin preachers I'm talking about lost preachers so the Lost preachers will twist the scriptures for the wages of unrighteousness or women or popularity or money now money and popularity often go together right because you've got a big church you become the big you become the big preacher right you become the big guy on the on the Block verse 17 ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware less also being led ye also rather being led away with the air of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness so there see there's the toss there's the instability see church God wants us to steadfastly to eagerly do what's right all the time amen how many still got the fear of the Lord we preach on that one brother uh texted me he said he Saidi just listened to all your three fear of the Lords he said ' I was so encouraged he said I wept I shouted I cried I screamed God gave me the victory over depression he' been bow in depression all week I said Thank God Amen that's what the fear the Lord will do amen it'll bring back your love for God your reverence for God hallelujah amen so that and that's a precious brother who battled a lot of health problems he B he told me he batt a lot of health problems sometimes he felt like he couldn't even get up out of the bed and he was feeling sorry for himself so he got depressed but he watched those videos and the fear of the Lord anointed him Hallelujah to get up and trust God hallelujah Not To Doubt amen God bless that man I know his name too see so so instability will c will will cause you to fall away from being steadfast marching forward Hallelujah I love verse 18 but growing Grace and in knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever amen those are Peter's last words before he's martyred right shortly after that he's martyred what's his last words grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ Hallelujah have more grace have more knowledge more understanding of the riches of Christ's Grace hallelujah oh it's beautiful now I'm just going to give you a simple example here I've done it before but I just thought it would be a perfect time to add this in because it's speaking of the five full ministry friends have you heard me say before brandom Tabernacle is resting or twisting many scriptures now I'm not saying they're the the destroyed group but they're certainly off the word of God they're twisting the scripture which means to pervert or change it these are the five main areas remember they neglect the preaching gift so they're basically telling preachers go bury your gift in the ground that's what they're telling them to do right sit down and bury your gift Don't Preach now how many I hope I hope the devil's not uh bwing anybody today and say I wish brother Jesse would stop preaching right but but that that's the idea right that's the idea that that brandom Tabernacle I'll just oh just press play you don't have to preach second they neglect Gathering more as we see that day approaching right they haven't had a church service since March 20 20 20 they've not physically gathered in church since March of 2020 when the Indiana shut them down the state of Indiana because they have too many people right you remember that you had you had to have like six feet between every person remember that bu of nonsense and then now they admit it's wrong well this one's going to get cut off of YouTube eventually in two years their Bots will finally chase us down say we removed your sermon from YouTube go ahead and remove it Mercy God's word cannot be stopped Hallelujah see they haven't gathered Ed since two since March 2020 I'm just going to say this if if those PE if those leaders had a real Shepherd's Heart they would at least use the facilities that they got they got brandom Tabernacle you can sit 300 people in there they have the the the youth building you can sit at least like 500 in there why not at least Gather in those two and do like a satellite church like Elevation Church does I think they have uh 12 Satellite churches for Steven fdick all these churches around the nation they all just sing they got their live bands and they all sit down and watch the screen at pastor pastor fdick preaching with his big guns right there his big muscles see so because what did Brother Bram do when brother Bram had Construction in in early 1963 did they still meet in the brandom Tabernacle yes and what did they do they just let if there's an overflow he said you got to sit in your cars and you know what he did he got radios like at a drive-through theater you could set the radio on your window that's a pastor's heart at least come to church at least gather Moors to see that day approaching but for four years they've neglected the Gathering Together of the Saints praise God and you know they they have communion today at 5 o' and so that uh everybody can drive by this weekend anybody could drive by the Tabernacle and pick up the wine they need for communion so it's just like a it's like a fast food thing like just stop in get my wine see I'm going to go have church in my house except brother Bram never did that right right except look at that there's no preacher serving them the the bread ah see they've neglected the five-fold ministry they become their own that's the Book of Judges right there the glory they become their own judges right they become their own priests my goodness gracious there's no Pastor there's no preacher to feed them the Bread and Wine and next Sunday we've got communion praise God brother R said it's a showdown Hallelujah that's right to Showdown are we with the word are we believing the word of God and as I've said before I encourage everybody to take communion every time because I don't see many people I don't see brother random sitting out of communion when he was going through tough times right we talked about that I preached over that recently I would say always take it but make sure you take it with a pure heart because many are weak and sickly among you if they don't discern the Lord's body praise God that's right amen hallelujah three they add so much to brother braham's word they say so much brother Braham didn't say fourth they add to the Bible and they changed the Bible which fifth ultimately leads to idolatry so that's what I believe and remember Brother Joseph is 69 years old he was born in 1955 he'll be 70 years old next year and that that church back in 2010 had $110 million saved up in bank accounts and assets and everything like that where are they at now the reason they had to build the church was because they have over 1,000 people and they didn't have a congregation for a thousand people so many people have moved into Jeffersonville so how how much tithing can you get out of a thousand people maybe 250 tithe payers there and it's all flowing in nobody's coming to church they're just sitting at home see Church which one is it money women or popularity I'd say it's two of them that caus them to twist the scriptures brother brandom fulfilled all the five full ministry I'm sorry that's a twisting of a serpent Hallelujah he did not but oh you can sit at home while we're having construction that's a twisting of thep scripture brother Ram never did that he never said that Hallelujah see that uh every word on tape is thus say the Lord I'm sorry brother Ram never said that hallelujah it's twisting it like a serpent twists around its prey choking them so much they won't even gather together more as they see that day approaching in 2017 I watched the video this morning of Brother Joseph saying I never told people to leave the churches and just play the tapes well look what happened he now led them into that seven years later that's what he's LED them into he says I've never done that that's what he's done right the next year see actions speak louder than words anybody can say whatever they want it's how you act that's right it's how you actually the words you say the actions you do the way you live your life how you exercise yourself whether unto uh righteousness or unrighteousness that's what matters praise God and then remember the very next year brother Joseph said they've got to catch the vision they've got to play the tapes I'm sorry you can't do both you can't say I'm for the five-fold ministry preaching and then say no they've got to play the tapes you can't say that you got to say one or the other praise God and see they've made their stand but thank God the true bride has made her stand as well amen Lord let your bride come forth Hallelujah and remember in 2020 and I want to show you remember I mentioned this this is the tossing of the waves in 2020 Joseph said let's elect Pete Buddha remember he was running for president too they said brother brother Joseph I heard him say he said get that gay man in there so we can go home that's what he said and everybody's clapping and screaming so so see he somehow he thinks a gay president means the Rapture where's the bible say that anybody got a Bible verse for that I'll be waiting brother William I've sent lots of messages I'm I'm really studying the scripture to see where it ever says that does that is that the sign of the Rapture no two years later uh with the war in Ukraine he said look there's the war going on we'll be going home anytime soon so see they go from this they go from Pete budajudge then they go to war in Ukraine and then was the war in Israel all these are supposed to be signs that they're the true bride church right in 2020 they finished their church building we saw it right Carris and Victoria we saw we took pictures with it like this is an empty church it should be filled but it's an empty church they're not Gathering more see I'm a witness they they're breaking uh Hebrews 10:24 and 25 they finished it in 2022 but it still remains empty no one's Gathering more as they see that day approaching did Brother Ram teach that absolutely not Hallelujah and now they're having communion in homes rather than with a preacher giving them the bread and the wine as Jesus modeled Hallelujah Jesus said happy are ye if you do this remember remembering my death till you come remember next Sunday communion by God's grace remember Church they got they got 25 lives uh four times they've called themselves the tape bride think about that tape bride everybody hear me on that let me say it again they call themselves they're the tape bride um does that does that come up if you search the quotes no it don't come up oh so they've added something to the bride yeah of course they have they've added some twisting of the scripture three times Joseph says it in 2024 July he said we are sure and we are not ashamed to tell the world we are your tape bride Sorry God don't have a tape bride he's got a five-fold bride he's got the fivefold until we all come in the unity of the faith hallelujah amen he said in September of 2023 he said dear tape bride what a day we're living in what a great time the Mysteries the secrets all that's being revealed to us every day Oh you mean like uh every word on tape is thus sayi the Lord I'm sorry that's not a revelation from God that's a revelation from the enemy because that exalts brother brandham as equal with God you'd be surprised how many people send me comments and say uh brother you follow William brandom how can you make his every word thus sayith the Lord see that's the connotation people have that if you follow brother brandom every word he said was th thus say the Lord I said when did I ever say that I said brother R is a prophet of God but prophets make human mistakes they're only infallible with thus say the Lord thank God we've got thus sayith the Lord hallelujah but see that's the connotation around that the devil's told so many lies on it but thank God that we've got the truth thank God that the Holy Ghost is uniting us hallelujah under the fivefold ministry into all truth hallelujah amen and they're the ones that let the women preach and let the women cut their hair and watch filthy movies and get filled with demons por porn demons all these things depressed demons all these uh uh cigarette demons alcoholic demons they get all these demons in them and they say we're the ones off tear the ones off amen whose whose works are exercised unto godliness God help us to see that's one of the greatest blessings we have is that we exercise ourselves unto godliness Hallelujah because remember the false Church uh the Bible said we have more and more ungodliness that remember preach that on avoiding uh vain babblings they increase unto more ungodliness so see Church you're going we are going one one way or the other thank God we can look at our lives today as I said on Wednesday thank God we can look down at our fruit baskets then we look at get your fruit bastic this week you got some good love in there got some good uh longsuffering in there got some joy in there anybody got any gladness today amen but you really need it for other people that's why you need those fruits right look down at yourself you know I always see Haven carrying in the basket of eggs well that's kind of what we do we carrying the fruits of the holy spirit in the church show some love so show some longsuffering have have some Faith praise God amen amen that's what we should show but brother uh William how come my list of these false brandom Tabernacle doctrines how come that keeps increasing more and more right it used to be 10 I was looking at my notes I used to have started with seven I had seven false doctrines then it went to 10 then went to 20 now I'm at 25 and they're never repenting of anything now church I'm not saying pat yourself on the back I'm saying let's realize the impact of the fful ministry on our lives let's make sure were really obeying the word of God see because it's going to produce it's it's supposed to produce this Bible preached by men who are filled with the Holy Ghost are it's supposed to preach and produce maturity the fullness of Christ in your life not the fullness of the godhead body that was only Jesus but the the full maturity of a Christian that's what this Bible is supposed to produce if you eat the book amen hallelujah amen that's what it's supposed to produce right but we'll all be tempted on our journey we all be tempted there'll be traps laid there where it'll try to make us double-minded or traps certain places we got to bypass the traps praise God we got to bypass those and we got to keep pressing on with a single mind we got to be steadfast the Bible says how many want to be steadfast amen that's what the fivefold ministry helps us do Hallelujah and again he said it in uh December 2020 dear resting ones he said we're happy because we're eating the Holy Ghost food that doesn't have a bone or a seed in it and yet brother Ram said his sermons have seeds in them again saying something brother Ram didn't say it's these people are insane they're they're just insane he says we call it tape food for a tape Bride come on that's what I say to come on brother that's why I just stopped giving up I sent about 50 emails after I'm like I give up they're probably not even getting to him I just can pray for him but see at least they email me he emailed me back at the beginning he actually wrote me a letter back at the beginning which I greatly appreciate but my last email was brother does the third person of the Trinity burn in your heart did I show you that and he he just wrote back one sentence he said brother Jesse I believe every word on the tapes is from the Lord okay so that I just wanted a yes or no answer that wasn't a yes or no answer so he's basically saying yes the third person of the Trinity draws in my heart well how many people do you have in your heart then how many people are possessing you hallelujah how many people see now that's now to me that's ears that can't hear right that's a unstable person that can't take anything back to the word of God you mean you can't take three persons and and look at a quote that was in 1953 so you can't look eight years later where brother man says three persons is thus say the Lord you can't look at that understand brother brandom just he corrected himself no he's got to so correct or so worship and adore every word of his father on tape that's an idolatrous Spirit you can't and you can't even look church we should be able to look at our own lives what things have we understood better now that we're further along the road goodness I told you that one example uh sister Zur sent me that message for brother Brooks was preaching in 2007 and uh he said Paul could not have lived in this day he said so we've got we've got to have the greatest Faith there ever was and I stood up and said amen and now I I think no Paul definitely could have lived in this day right because we're all growing in the understanding I see things I don't amen anymore right because I understand things better praise God I say it like this my Zeal doesn't eat up my wisdom as much some of you caught that good because you understand I'm not saying I'm perfect I'm far from perfect but one thing that for for sure this word is perfect am and we should see ourselves by love edifying one another right through the love of the Holy Spirit uh The Joint supplying all that we have need of and we should be seeing ourselves mature in the stature of Christ Hallelujah that's right the Bible doesn't call them tape bride Bible just says his wife has made herself ready she's the bride she's the one Paul wrote about Hallelujah let let me go through these 24 lies real quick I got it it's only 11 I got plenty of time Hallelujah not even 12:00 usually 12 I'm like okay I better finish up here I still got half an hour the first lie every word on tape is thus say the Lord tapes can never be wrong tapes have no mistakes tapes have every answer number two all the answers are on the tapes number three un and Joseph says this unquestionably believe everything on the tape in other words pull off your discernment you don't need discernment anymore I I've got the video videos all these number four every church is a tape church and you've got to press play on the tape it's a it's a false vision of a denominational mandate he said every church has got to play the tapes number five the tapes are the token that means like I said that means my phone has the token brother because I have all brother BR sermons on here my how is my phone born again looks like it's just getting older all the time don't look like it's born to me I got to keep cleaning it don't look like it's born again verse I'm sorry the sixth lie tape boys are the true five-fold Ministry tape is the primary Ministry preaching is secondary brother brandom said opposite brother said tapes are secondary I've got the quotes on the video number seven Billy Paul bless his soul my wife prayed for him the 9 he died she come up for prayer crying for Billy Paul Billy Paul said brother random was uh equal to Jesus in every way except the Corporal body that's a lie that means brother Mam's soul and mind was exactly like Jesus that's impossible brother Maham sinned many times he said I make thousands of mistakes number eight they call they called anyone Deus who doesn't play tapes so we're a Deus I'm not a Deus I'm a Paul I'm a Timothy or something like that I'm not a Paul I'm a Timothy you know I follow the prophet because they said brother Bram is dead but uh he still got a living Ministry I'm sorry once you die like like God told Moses God told Moses you're going to die and I need a man to stand in your place to lead the people in and out and church isn't he the same yesterday today and forever am right Hallelujah number nine uh they said Revelation 2216 is Jesus telling us to be tape churches but no it was uh Jesus telling us is Jesus telling us to listen to all the letters right in the Book of Revelation he said uh he said uh uh make make sure the churches hear the letters that that that he gave to John it's to they totally they totally twist these scriptures they suck the life out of the the people number 10 they said the angel of revelation 22 6-9 is brother brandham so they say brother Bram is revealing to John all these Mysteries I'm sorry there's no pre-existence of souls brother Ram plainly taught us that they said brother Ram do you believe in the pre the Mormon pre-existence of souls do you see this I just struck me Mormonism has infiltrated brandom Tabernacle they got a false prophet and they got pre-existence of souls right they' got a false prophet like Joseph Smith and they've got PRI instance of Souls and brother said I he said I know you're wondering if I believe in that I do not believe in that well then how could brother R exist to reveal the Book of Revelation to St John if there's no pre-existence of souls oh my help us Lord number 11 they say the absolute are the tapes no they're not the absolute points us to the tapes brother Bram said an absolute is all powerful Unlimited in power Hallelujah and brother R said I don't have all the power brother R said actually I have no power Jose Lopez has no power but he's got Authority amen hallelujah brother William you have no power but you've got Authority Hallelujah but see the absolute has all power that's the word of God number 12 then they name calls make Believers or unbelievers those who don't play tapes in church they say we're make Believers number 13 they say and he said this thus sayith the Lord brandom Tabernacles in the perfect will of God by playing the tapes while decreasing live preaching I'm sorry I just can't go along with that you can't be in the perfect will of God and you can't you can't be in the perfect will of God and change one thing Paul said one thing yet they've Chang many things but if they change one thing Paul said they cannot be in the perfect will of God number 14 they say brandham Tabernacle is the greatest Christians of all time I've made a video on that I got the screenshot they haven't changed it I checked they didn't take it down they still think they're the greatest Christians of all time and they don't go to church brother William they say brother R was the greatest prophet of all time and Joseph said I've got the greatest Ministry of all time just to press play he said I've got the greatest Ministry of all time oh then he said Billy Paul was the most blessed person on the earth because he got to know brother brandom the Most Blessed see the greatest it's all about who's the greatest the pride of life God help us to be humble in this time but the question is can we be content with being humble can we be content with that and not have to have more Applause to our name oh yes Jesse yes brother Jesse yes yes brother William yes yes Malachi yes can we just stand with God's word whether people clap or not that's what God wants to see Hallelujah stand up stand up for Jesus ye sold soers of the Cross Hallelujah he said prophets are not judged they he said prophets cannot be corrected that's number 15 I'm almost there he said prophets do not make mistakes and yet even Joseph corrects his dad on tape I have a video of that he corrects his dad because there's a quote brother said there can't be any more time there can't be another generation and Joseph on tape says well look God has had Grace on us and now there is another generation he actually corrects his dad and yet he's the one that says you can't correct it my dad oh God help us what would daddy say my goodness number 16 they say brother Ram is their Pastor no dead man can be your pastor right can't marry you can't bury you you know can't dedicate you can't do those things he can't feed you the word of God number uh that was number 16 yeah brand T brother Bram is their Pastor that's why it gets into spir spiritualism because even with their email this weekend they they have a recording they say Press Play Let brother brandham pray for the symbols the bread and the wine he said they said brother brandham is going to pray for our symbols and then brother br's going to pray for us while we wash one another's feet like acting like he still alive and he said wait until brother R prays then partake of communion because now it's been blessed by the pastor these people that's all I can say these people see how much they hate the five full ministry church I've told you no one's treated me worse online than the Bram Tabernacle people call me Judas up and down devil Satan all these things all because I stood on other quotes that they don't like because I got quotes from my side brother Jose you know I got quotes we got quotes we got quotes amen right no one's been more harsh to me and that's okay they can do whatever they want I'm almost done 17 they don't gather more uh as we see that day approaching and they claim to have home tape churches which do not exist in the Bible number 18 they said like life only comes through the tapes it doesn't come through preaching I don't know about you but how many got a good blessing from a preacher lately we had a lot of preachers in 2024 we needed a little break here financially but also TimeWise as well they said it only comes through tapes it doesn't come through preachers now we know it comes through Christ but it's through the five-fold ministry all right next one I got a scroll I didn't get them all in the same place number 19 God's program is to press which deletes the five-fold ministry brother brother said God's program is preaching the word of God there's exact quotes on the exact opposite side just brother said don't change a thing number 20 Joseph said we're now in the wedding ceremony brother R says the wedding ceremony is the rapture right that's why I preach invisible Union we're only we're only United invisibly to Christ not physically the wedding ceremony hasn't happened yet he said we're going to the meeting in the air that's the wedding ceremony number 21 the tapes are God speaking lip to ear to Joseph and his church that's what he says that was and lip to ear is not even in the Bible it's mouth to mouth in numbers 128 God said I'll speak with Moses mouth to mouth so lip to ear is not even the scripture it's mouth to mouth or face to face right but they believe if you press play it's God speaking to us just like it's God in in our face see they' made God the tape everybody see that now everybody the God is now the tape God is not the Holy Spirit we say God is the tape because every word from the tape is thus sayith the Lord that that's what they say not I say all right I'm GNA try to build this up eventually so I can get some amens back in the church I know this makes us kind of feel bad but I just I want you to see what the fivefold ministry should produce and I I have to I want to show you the contrast I haven't done this for a long time church right I haven't I haven't really blasted you know the brandom Tabernacle for a while but I want you to see this is what a double-minded condition brings you to so far off my goodness you're off on here on the tapes you're off on preaching you're off on the pastor you're just off on everything tossed back and forth oh Pete Buddha Jud is a sign of the Rapture no no it's Ukraine no no no it's Israel and Hamas what's the next one Camala is is Cala the sign of the Rapture the sign of the r Rapture is that we love his appearing glory and the fivefold is uniting the church into one Faith hallelujah amen other words the latter rain amen abing faith is striking the church and it'll bring her right back to where they were at the beginning that's thus sayi the Lord from Joel 223 through 26 Amen in her will be the fullness of Pentecost hallelujah amen that doesn't mean that doesn't mean you and I have to produce all of Pentecost it just means we have to do our share amen amen Church how many people do you think how many people are recorded telling a paralyzed man to rise up and walk oh we just talked about that didn't we um like Peter Peter the Bible only records one person doing that it wasn't like every person had the power oh such as I have give I Thee such as I have give I Thee such as see we we think about the Rapture and uh rapturing Faith like all of us are going to be speaking the storms and and raising people up and emptying out the hospitals but is that exactly what the Bible says says the Bible doesn't say that that's just what some people make of it see I want to be mature I want to know the fullness of Pentecost is going to be in our church but we've only got to do what God's called us to do there's no pressure on it right there's not pressure it's just the love of God working in your heart see Peter already had that he said such as I have amen glory he already had he's like I know I've got this in me I know God's revealed this to me I seen a vision hallelujah praise God such as I have see God's going to lead you uh to minister your gifts right God is going to lead you into the ministry of gifts by the grace of God just like at Pentecost God will do what God wants to do praise God not what we want to do that's right right like I I how many how many wouldn't want to speak salvation to their parents right or their uh best friends or their co-workers or their children who wouldn't want to be a Hatty right right but not everybody was a Hatty right not every not everybody got the power of the spoken word it's you and I staying obedient Glory it's you and I staying stable in the word of God until God wants to pick up this vessel now I'm going to use this vessel for the glory of God hallelujah I filled this vessel now it's time for me to use this vessel I know right where that vessel's at I'm going to go get that vessel I want a real good drink of Pentecostal water amen amen glory to God Amen Hallelujah see that's what happened when when God sent me out to Iowa God sent Malachi and I out to Iowa that's what happened we we went out there and God used us as vessels for a good drink of Pentecostal water so two people could get Miracles and how many men how many men wept their way up to uh Deliverance by God's grace let's say five 10 praise God hallelujah that's five more than they had before God wanted a drink of Pentecostal water now what does God want today Hallelujah that's the question it's just a home Church you know just a regular Sunday but what kind of drink does God want today in our lives Jose sees it amen hallelujah that's that right brother we're all vessel God wants to take God wants to use us so he can have a drink so he can pour out his Pentecostal blessings upon the church Hallelujah you've been very faithful here thank you Church number 22 they say they hear from God just like Abraham did in Genesis 18 how did God hear from Abraham Abraham came to him in a physical body so now they believe the tape is just like the physical body of God it's complete idolatry just like genesis 18 I said that's idolatry you guys are insane you're not you're not hearing that same way it's not the same a tape is not God brother Braham said mechanic God never ordained mechanical devices to preach the gospel praise God that's what he said amen number 23 press play and Obey is the perfect will of God and God is and will be pressing play in heaven now there is a quote where god brother man talks about God pressing play in heaven but it's only one quote but they're making it seem like God is going to come up and say okay Angels be quiet time to time to have church let's PR let's press play on brother bram's tape tape cassette click and God's just going to sit down they make it like God's going to sit down and listen to the tapes of brother brandom now come on people God's going to stand there and he's going to speak he's got eyes like fire Jehovah amen hallelujah he's got eyes like fire amen he can talk for himself Hallelujah he's not a tape he's God he's a spirit he's a person he's Eternal he's Jehovah hallelujah amen 24 they say you got to put brother R back in the Pulpit because this is his Pulpit brother Ram said many times that's uh he said the world is my Pulpit right he saying as a as a missionary the world is my Pulpit but he wasn't saying that I need to I I need to be in every person's Pulpit by pressing play that's a lie if that was the case why did Brother Ram tell Perry green to start a church and preach and ordain him and we got the 45 minute sermon on it where he says God will bless brother green to preach the gospel he never said press play brother Green Goodness all right I gota get under control here okay now I've always liked when Donnie Reagan or other people like they they other preachers they have this great Revelation and I I always like when they make this disclaimer they say what I'm going to preach uh they say one uh after I preach this I'm no longer liable for the way I act because I might be shouting and rejoicing and screaming all over the place I was like that one amen sometimes I want to feel like that too okay and that was 24 right was that 24 and then 25th is now the tape bride that's the 25 did I get 24 I just want you to see some stability examples of stability yes yep okay so 25 is tape uh tape bride there is no tape bride in the Bible there's no tape Bride on the tapes all right now let me try to close brother Ram's talking about making ready he says now you say certain things will take place and then I'll Make Ready brother ramam said make ready now for the Rapture I've just related to you Pearl Harbor of many places where they refuse to hear the warning they refused to listen to it nothing was left but Divine judgment upon the people now all that will not go in Christ will be under God's Wrath and divine judgment please don't let that happen to you so he's talking about the Rapture right he's talking about Pearl Harbor oh I I I uh by God's grace I brought in September 11th and now we can see with this flood and hurricane Church it went up into uh North Carolina and they they didn't think it'd go up there these people had no warning like we never know that's like they asked Jesus when that remember when that uh Tower fell Jesus said were they more Sinners than anybody else and Jesus said no basically that was God's plan that was God's time for them to go a tower fell on them and people died and Jesus said that was God's time we better be ready by God's grace is that right that's what brother Ram saying make ready now now look no matter what the brandom Tabernacle ever turns out to be don't you let it be you he's basically saying if brandom tabernac Tabernacle turns out to be bad don't be bad he said you be a servant of Christ oh man it just struck me there they're serving the tapes they're serving their Pastor instead of serving Christ because if they serve Christ they do the word of God let me say like this whatever bride of Christ Fellowship let me bring it down home amen come on Church whatever this church turns out to be you follow Christ Hallelujah follow the word of God if brother Jesse gets off on some false thing you try to corrected by the word but if he don't be corrected you stay with the word hallelujah amen that's what see that's what brother does the church is named after him but he's saying it's not in a church I mean you must gather more as we see that day approaching that's part of it but if a church if you're if you can't be in Love with a Church you got to be in love with Christ Hallelujah don't let it be you no matter what the church world does you be a servant of Christ it's not up to the brandom Tabernacle neither is it up to any other Church see I can't get you ready this church coming to church can't get you ready you've got to get ready every that's what brother man is saying Bram Tabernacle can't get you ready right you've got to get yourself ready for the coming of the lord it's up to you as an individual to be ready at the coming of the Lord you must be ready I must be ready I'll sweep my own steps it's up to you to sweep your steps I usually sweep mine with a broom or my blower right I got my uh my blower there I forget the name name the brand name of that one I got my Ryobi blower and I every almost every day I go by and blow all the leaves off my steps that's what brother BR says we got to clean out our steps praise God he said it's up to you to sweep your steps leave mine alone me leave yours alone you've got to make your garment ready again he says it later you might have the name of church you might have the name of brandom Tabernacle or Methodist or whatever you Church you go to that isn't it friend see it's something different it's your character that's what God is a looking at Hallelujah so God's not looking at oh you go to this church you go to that church go to that church God's not looking at that he's looking at what does your character speak are you exercising under righteousness or are you exercising unto unrighteousness what's your daily life look like Hallelujah then brother said this don't forget he says forgot to highlight this one he says don't forget this Tabernacle will lose its strength brother Braham said that in uh 1963 this Tabernacle will lose its strength remember that this is the target where Satan's got every gun in Hell trained on it see that where has Satan been attacking the most brandom Tabernacle and boy they've really they've really suffered spiritually every gun in Hell think of that every gun in hell just like in the days of Wesley right or days of Martin Luther every gun in hell was pointed at Martin Luther John Wesley and then isusa street right and then brother brandham and they're still today and brother BR said this Tabernacle will lose its strength what strength do we have the word of God is the only strength we have you're only as strong as your adherence to the word of God hallelujah all right I'm closing with this because it's almost 12 I'll try to close before an hour and a half okay I put this quote out this week anybody see the quote I put out about uh be certain of God anybody see that on online okay good well good amen hallelujah good so brother man was talking about Elijah and the widow woman remember she had a she had she's a widow and she only had one son brother Ram said she probably stayed up all night brother Jose praying because she knew this is going to be our last day I've just got enough oil and flour to make one more cake my son and I are going to eat it and then we die that's what brother man's talking about so brother man's talking about a woman who saw day after day inflations Rising more and more famine more and more famine my days are numbered it's almost time it's almost time to die every day was more and more God didn't answer all those days think of that God didn't answer all those days nothing and this is what brother man says in this context you know it's a strange thing may God let this soak into every one of you if you never never hear me preach again let this be a message it's a strange most strange that sometimes that God does things that way God will not answer your prayer for day after day after day after month after month after year God let a a mother with one child to feed one she only has one mouth to feed God let that mother battle where is God all these days where is God Where's God what about my baby God what about my baby God what about me God let it go down brother said isn't that strange you know when we have confessed our sins and met every requirement that God requires we've believed on God there's a circumstance that has to be met it's according to his will so brother says look at this situation this is God's will God allows these things it's his will he says and we've confessed our sins and we've made all all the wrongs that we have done right done everything that we know how to do every requirement that God has made or asked we've met that requirement and yet he lays silent he just won't answer us so that woman with the one child prayed all those days all those months the famine was wasn't it three yes three and a half years three and a half years she prayed God I need some more oil God I need some more need some more bread need some more it's like God never answered God was silent right some people write the silent God right sometimes he is on purpose brother tells us why it's for his will I'm sure that I'm speaking to people this morning who has come to that place anybody come to that place before he's like God God's silent God don't hear me God why haven't you answered me the widow woman felt the same way after this brother R breaks into Shadrach mikhak and abedo after this same thing well God we're not all we knows we're not going to sin we'll die for our faith I'm going to trust you whether God Saves me whether God lets me die I'm just going to trust God Amen I'm not going to compromise and worship these Idols amen amen he's brother man says I've been there many times myself when I've went back and traced my life and turned over every stone that I find I've did something wrong I'd go confess and say Lord I'll make it right and go do so so brother am say well Lord last year I said this to my wife he'd go to his wife honey forgive me then oh yeah maybe I did that wrong to brother Billy Paul Billy Paul forgive me he would go through his whole life and confess everything and then ask God and then God still want to answer him how many of us have done that you've actually how many of us have spent time going back this last week Lord did I do anything wrong is that why you're not answering me brother BR says I've done that many times he said I turn over every stone you ever done that look at every area of your life is there any sin under here did I do anything wrong Lord have I mistreated anybody have I done anything wrong financially have I anything wrong with my health have I anything anything wrong with my job brother BR would go through every area of his life he said Lord I'll make it right and then come back and say now Lord Thou Art God you'll answer me surely I met every requirement that you require me to do do and every requirement I've met it okay so look look what brother would say I confess to my wife I confess to this come back and say God surely you'll hear me and then he says these words and still he won't move seems to set silent that's when you've got to be sure that he's God don't be discouraged the only thing is that in your heart you have to be certain of God hallelujah think about that he went through every era of his life now come back and say surely God will answer me now and God still don't answer I've met every requirement God how come you don't answer me because God is still God and he has a will for your life see church sometimes this is what I feel like too sometimes sometimes I feel like we have to earn things like we get in the mindset well if I earn it then he'll surely get give it to me whatever we're longing for right brother R tells us plainly I I've done this many times and still he won't move he said be certain first before you do anything be certain in your heart that it's God and when you've met everything that he said then you're sure that he's God that's when Faith goes to work right there Faith stands steady for it knows that he is so what we talking about double mindedness right surely this surely this mother battled double-mindedness well God did you hear me I I I felt anointing yesterday surely you heard me no year after year three years month after month she was battling uncertainty but she had to be certain that God was God she had to be certain God had a plan for Life how many know God's got a plan for your life but we don't like the part of the plan when God doesn't answer us God seems like he's silent I've met every requirement and still God's silent he says and if you've met every requirement you believe that he is Faith holds steady oh blessed be his name Faith won't move for it's sure that God is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him amen so see you got to look we got to look at it like if God's not answering my prayer he's asking me to be more diligent right he's building up diligence in my life Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience God is brother kind he's trying to build this up in my life he's trying to make sure that I I really got the goods amen he wants you to have patience he wants you to have longsuffering he's trying to build this up in your life if he still hasn't answered your prayer brother Bram said may this go way down deep and never move from you brandham Tabernacle let me say like that may this go down deep bride of Christ Fellowship and may it never leave from you praise God if you've met God's requirements and in your heart you believe that he is God is only testing your faith for he loves to do that amen if God hasn't answered your prayer yet youve met every requirement God loves you he's just testing your faith hallelujah hallelujah it's a test it's a trial think about this woman three and a half years never got to answer till the last day Hallelujah think about all these saints that never got to answer and die right there was no there was no great miracle at the end nothing nothing exciting nothing Supernatural the the Bible said they'll get the reward on the other side Hallelujah they died not receiving the promise Hebrews 11 Hallelujah he says he's only he loves to test your faith you confessed your sin and you met every requirement that God requires and still he lays silent remember faith says that he is then Faith holds on to it not knowing what it's all about but it knows that he is and it's certain that he is God I'm almost done I got three or four more paragraphs so bear with me then remember if he is his words has to be true and if he required you to meet these circumstances and you did he's obligated to take care of his word don't back off and say well I never got healed oh he said oh poor weak faith don't believe that if everything is confessed and everything is out and you met God's requirement Faith holds right there there's nothing will move it he is and you're sure and then he quotes Isaiah they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings of eagles they shall run and not be weary if they walk they shall not faint Hallelujah Oh Glory wait then or sorry he says wait when you've met his requirement that brings your faith to a showdown if you've met God's requirements that he's made and you fully considered it and you've done everything God has required you to do then your faith rests right there that he is be certain of God two more paragraphs I'm almost done you know he loves to test us so he says it again he loves to test you he loves to see if you'll pass the test now I like I love giving tests brother William but I don't like grading them so much I could do without the grading the giving is fun because I get it's a nice and quiet I just get to walk around and help people everybody stays in their seat takes their nice test real good right nature you've seen it I love giving tests but I sure don't like great in them but God loves to test us he loves to see the reaction oh he loves to see the reaction of your faith in other words God loves to see you say Lord I trust you I haven't seen the answer I I I I haven't heard your voice it seems like you're silent but I still love you am cuz I know you're a rewarder of those who diligently seek me he loves to see you give praise even when things aren't going your way in other words he loves to see your he loves to see that you trust him even when you're not getting what you want because what does that show that shows unconditional love should our love be conditional well God gave me what I want that's why I love him or should it be unconditional should be uncondition like God's love you know he loves to test us he loves to see the reaction of your faith did you know that God likes to see how you'll react when you say oh Lord I believe you Thou Art My Savior I believe that you are the Healer I believe that you're the one who gives me the Holy Spirit and these things that I'm requiring you are the God who gives that and then when you confess all your sins and promise God what you'll do if you'll get well and then because it don't happen you run off like a coward somewhere God can't use that there's no way for him to use you there's no way for him to answer you because he only Answers by faith then all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer but true real Faith stands there being sure that God is be certain that he is so see that that widow woman she didn't run off to Ahab and say okay I'll worship Jezebel's Idols I'll go to Jezebel's Temple she could have but she had faith and God sent her a prophet amen hallelujah she could have sold out she could have been a pro she could have been a prostitute right she could have gone in the city been a prostitute make money and come out there but she stayed true to God and God sent her a blessing praise God hallelujah last paragraph and if God asks for this thing to be done his requirements like confessing sins praising him to confess your sins and so forth and you've done it faith says that he is it's certain that it's going to happen your request has to be granted oh I hope you don't miss that if you're sure of God God is sure of his word he's only waiting to test you let's stand to our feet Malachi can come lady can come how many want to be certain of God today Hallelujah Hallelujah let's sing God I love you my Lord with all of my heart you're my everything you're the reason I sing how me love him with all your heart today praise God how many thankful for the word of God today hallelujah amen church we want to be single-minded oh yes I hope everybody can see I'm not bashing anybody here or even online I mean there's Mercy for everybody if there's Mercy for Saul there's Mercy for the online people too there is Mercy if you just say I did foolishly just like David said Lord I've done foolishly have mercy forgive me God did but as we can see from the scripture God's love tests us and we want to pass the test so let's pray that God will strengthen our hearts to believe that we can give God praise in difficult Seasons I don't know which one of you are battling whether you know is God silent why has why why is God silent to me I don't know who's battling that today but that's the quote the Lord put on my heart for the end of this service here because that's what we often battle right the double mindness willo battle is Lord what's your will God how come you haven't answered and the Bible says you got to be certain that God is Let's Be certain today of God's presence Hallelujah God's word father God we thank you for today Lord God thank you for this word Lord I've so enjoyed it today Lord God lord and the way I'll show that the way our church will show that we've enjoyed the word is by putting it into action Lord God father as this quote Lord as I was there on my knees praying and studying this quote came to me Lord I thought I want to close with that it wasn't in my plans but it was right before I left home Lord God oh God how you love to test us Lord God sometimes it seems like you're silent Lord God but yet you're still a loving God you're asking us to be diligent you're asking us to have faith Lord God in your promises Lord God we thank you Lord God for your love Lord we want to take this moment we want to give a sacrifice of praise Lord I didn't know who would be here Lord God we're missing Mercy I forgot to pray for them I missing Austin Lena Lord God brother Van's family there Lord God and Lord even the live stream as Lord these videos have been giving people Victory fear of the Lord has been giving people victory over depression Lord God grant it Lord God May each person here Lord God receive a fresh anointing of the Holy Spirit Lord God may they be certain of God Hallelujah Lord if they feel like you're being silent may they trust you that you are God and you're a rewarder of those who diligently seek those who diligently praise God those who diligently wait upon the Lord that their strength might be renewed Lord God let us remember your love today May each and every person Lord be visited by the angel of the Lord hallelujah May the Holy Spirit visit each person and show them your love Lord God because you are near to those who trust in you who fear your name Yes Minister to each and every person we pray Bless the people they've been so kind and sat through the long sermon Lord God I trust it was food for their souls Lord as I said last week Lord when I was here preaching Lord God you told Peter if you love me feed my sheep yes Lord I love you I've tried to feed your sheep today

faith that Blessed assurance
