talk to him for just a moment our gracious heavenly father lord we counted such a great opportunity to stand here this morning lord not only here behind this desk but each one of us have the opportunity to st today lord to stand in your presence lord the opportunity to make things right lord the opportunity to grow the opportunity to be changed the opportunity for healing lord the opportunity today to worship at the feet of the king of kings and the lord of lords lord what a great opportunity we have this morning lord i pray that each and every one of us would recognize that opportunity now that not a one of us lord would take it for granted but lord may we seize that opportunity may we grab hold of it lord lord may we make the most of this moment lord not knowing if it be our last lord not knowing how many more opportunities we'll have to gather together lord not knowing lord how long it'll be before you come lord may each one today make their calling and election sure lord may each one today take another step with you move closer to you today lord lord for truly that's why we're here lord to hear from you lord to grow in you to take another step lord to fulfill all that the word has spoken of us lord jesus father we ask you to come now take control of this service lord i pray it be delivered in the spirit you gave it to me father lord i pray lord that it find good ground today lord lord help me now to get out of the way lord help me lord god lord not to hinder in any way but lord you speak through me lord you knew every heart lord that would be gathered here today lord you knew every need lord and you provided for it lord i believe you provided a word for our needs today lord and i pray now that you just take control that you speak lord lord from the beginning to the very end may everything lord be according to your will in jesus name we pray amen amen amen god bless you today saints if you will turn with me over in your bibles over the book of exodus the 14th chapter we'll also be reading from deuteronomy the first chapter hey man while i have this opportunity i'd also like to thank the the church body here for the outpouring of love and support for the pruitt family that we've experienced in the last couple of weeks not only from this church family here but from the bride around the world we say thank you from the bottom of our hearts it's wonderful to be associated with god's people amen exodus 14 verse 15. it says i'm going to read one verse here and it says and the lord said unto moses wherefore christ thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward emphasizing there that they go forward deuteronomy the first chapter and the fifth verse it says on this side jordan in the land of moab began moses to declare this law saying the lord our god spake unto us in horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this mount turn you right there turn you there's a turn made there's a corner turn in other words quit doing what you've been doing it's time to do something different you've been where you're at long enough it's time to turn turn ye and take your journey and go to the mount of the amorites and to all the places neither unto in the plain in the hills and in the veil and in the south and by the seaside to the land of the canaanites and unto lebanon unto the great river the river euphrates behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the lord swear unto your fathers abraham isaac and jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word as you have your seats so many scriptures as i looked through this this week so many scriptures that i could have used or could have read but these two here succinctly really summed up the theme for what i want to speak on today and if i give this a title today it would be it's time to move it's time to move there in the first scripture in exodus 14 and 15 it says the lord said unto moses wherefore christ unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward notice in this he doesn't he didn't say i realize it's going to be difficult i realize there's something in front of them i see this i see that i see these circumstances he just said they need to go forward they need to move on and then the next scripture the lord spake unto you and says you have gone round this mountain long enough it's time for you to move now i don't really know where you're at this morning i don't know each and every one of you's personal experience with the lord we're all at different stages along the journey obviously but wherever you are today you can't stay there wherever you are whether you're the most saintly of saints among us whether you're a borderline believer a backslider or shall i say even a sinner that has never accepted the lord jesus you cannot stay where you're at today you must go forward you must move the word of the lord is calling out to you today saying go forward leave where you're at take a turn do something different and walk forward in the lord today the entire history or story that we of the bible deals with god moving and god calling us people to move and also it deals with the response of the people that he is dealing with and in this we find that god is always trying to get his people to move according to his leading you know many times people move but they're moving on their own accord many times people are moving and they're going here and they're doing that it's because what they think and according to their understanding and i think i should do this and i think i should do that but i believe in this day with the pillar of fire return to the back in the church again that we should be a people that are led by the pillar of fire a people that are led by the holy spirit and in this interaction with god and his people he's always trying to get them to move according to his leading and he's always calling them out of something or else he's calling them into something and these two things go hand in hand and these things go together because he's always trying to get you to come to something better god's always trying to get you to come to something better so many times we're holding on oh but god this is good god this is a blessing i don't want to let it go and if you could just see what he's trying to call you to if you could just see where he's trying to trying to call you to you would recognize he's always trying to call you and lead you into something more and into something better he calls us out of bondage and he brings us to deliverance he calls us out of sickness and he brings us into health he calls you out of a lost condition and he brings you into salvation he'll lead you from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the holy ghost he's always trying to lead you into something more something deeper something greater in his spirit when we walk with god we find that he doesn't take you to a lesser place it's always to a greater place because our god is a rewarder our god is a rewarder of those who serve him our god is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him our god is a rewarder he will be indebted to no man and he's always rewarding you he's always leading you to something greater first samuel two and eight says he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifted up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory he wants you to move from whatever condition you're in today to the next because by nature our god is a great shepherd and the shepherd wants to lead and a shepherd wants to protect and many times it's us that get ourselves in trouble the reason he had to leave the 99 and go find the one is because the one thought he knew a better way the one thought he could find his way better the one hard-headed one how many of us have been that one before thought we could go and do what we want to do and i've got plans and i've got ideas and i need to do this and he had to come bail you out because he is the great shepherd and he needs a people we must be a people that are willing to follow his leadership god leads we follow that's how this thing works out you want to know how to make it a lot easier god leads you follow wherever he tries to get you to go just go look if you're his child he's going to get you there in the end he may have to take you through all kind of stuff he may have to save you many times because you thought you knew better the easy way is god leads i'm going to follow lord wherever you lead me today i'm going to follow you we speak and we believe and we say that we are a people of faith but faith doesn't always just mean believing for miracles sure we need that and we do but faith isn't always just believing for miracles faith is believing that if he said let's get in the boat and cross over to the other side that we're going to cross over to the other side no matter what comes no matter what happens that's what faith is that's why they're in mark 4 when the disciples begin to question and they begin to worry and they begin to doubt he comes up and he asks them he says why don't you have any faith why don't you have any faith we're a people of faith we can trust it listen this is an eternal god with an eternal word and if he said it he said it then it's going to happen listen there is no devil in hell that can stop an eternal word of god there is no devil in hell that can stop a seed gene of god if he said you're going to make it you're going to make it if he said i'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle it might as well be me if god said by my stripes you're healed then by you his stripes you are healed there is no devil in hell that can stop an eternal word of god and god said get in the boat we're going over and i say let's get in the boat this morning and let's trust no matter what ways come no matter what storms come we're going over because nothing can stop the eternal word of god you can have faith in this god today you can have faith for your situation because this god has never failed i failed many times you have failed many times man has failed all through the ages but this god has never failed and you can put your faith in him today and he's calling us today to move many times we become comfortable where we are because we're so much different than the world there's such a difference there we're separated from the world we feel like we've done what we need to do but you have to understand the world is not your standard the world don't look at the world and go look how good i am listen they are no standard to measure yourself against the only time you should worry about what the world looks like if there's somehow some way you start looking like them then you got problems but don't judge your christianity based off how much you have separated from the world sometimes we feel like look how far i've come so i'm good enough i'm comfortable and we set down right there and we begin to occupy a position we began to go on the defensive and i have this and i'm setting up my fortification and woo the devil ain't gonna take this from me that's good but you've turned your back on where you're supposed to be going you got here and you set up a fortification and said i'm not giving this up that's fine don't give that up but move on take another step go further go deeper go to more he's expecting you to come further with him this morning because he has so much more to give you he has so much more to offer you don't settle down where you are this morning we sat down right there and we began to occupy a position but this morning i want to say god is calling god is calling some of you this morning to repentance god is calling some of you this morning to walk with him like never before he's calling some of you this morning to step out in faith and trust him for a situation he's saying you've been in that mountain too long you've been in that situation too long i've been pushing and i've been prodding and i've been trying to make it this way so you would see and i've been trying to call you out so you would see i've been trying to make you miserable so you would see and this morning he's just saying it's time to move it's time for you to look at this situation and realize i've been here too long i've put up with this long enough this morning i'm taking the step i need to take and i'm walking out in faith i'm doing what you're calling me to do i know you put it in my heart lord and i just haven't been able to do that but today i'm pushing aside fear i'm pushing aside anxiety i'm pushing inside doubt i'm pushing aside worry and i'm going to step out to what you're calling me to do i'm stepping out into this situation and i'm going to trust you this morning he's calling you to make a move and when god calls you to move it's time to move genesis 12 1 now the lord god said unto abram get thee out of that country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house and to a land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed so abram stayed there thank you lord for this promise i know you're going to fulfill it but i don't know what's out there i don't know how you're going to provide for me what about my family we make a good living here i like this church this is the church i've been in my whole life this is all i know i'm comfortable the first verse said get thee out and so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him abram depart i want you to notice here there was a part he had to play look there was a promise given but it came with a part for you to play he had to be willing to move and i want you to notice it's not always in the instant that you move and not always in the instant that you obey that all of a sudden this thing that you need or this blessing you're expecting or whatever it is god has for you is just poured out upon you all right but no place you've never went anywhere that it didn't start with a step you got up this morning out of bed and you took a step and you wasn't in the church house but it was the first step to getting here it was the first step to being where you are and when he caused you to move many times we get impatient because we take that step and then another step and the blessings aren't just overflowing all over so we're like god why what no god said move so now you just trust him put your faith in him he said get in the boat we're going to the other side he said move just move just keep walking keep being led by the pillar of fire keep being led by the holy ghost and when the time comes when the appointed time arrives he's going to pour out the blessing on you that he's promised for you he told abram all this stuff all these blessings that he was going to all these promises that he said move and abram had to move for a really long time before it came to pass but it came to pass he said we're going over so we're going over he said you can have your children so you could have your children he said you could that the mothers wouldn't be bearing so you won't be buried he gave promises just keep holding on and at the time appointed those things will come to pass just keep moving just keep walking but you got to move this morning relationship with god is progressing with god you do not have a relationship or shall i say a healthy relationship if you're not progressing genesis 5 22 and enoch walked with god after he beget methuselah 300 years and begets sons and daughters and all the days of enoch were 365 years and in it walked with god and he was not for god took him in other words notice there was movement brother brown said let's take another man with this quickening power there was a man way long ago by the name of enoch when a new thing come along when something come along and said well now we have to go back to the old school or this or that the other enoch walked with god whatever god said do enoch never missed one word he walked with god what was he he was a son of god oh enoch was some super special powerful that's why he was able to walk that's why he was what was he brother branham said he was a son of god he was an eagle that had been called for that day everything that god told him to do he went and done it no argument about it he just went and done it help me lord because i feel like that's one of the biggest issues how many times does god move on our heart to do something and maybe it's just small maybe it's just an unction and so we push it away we figure nah nah surely not when enoch heard an auction from god he just went and done it church today we have to learn how to hear that unction again too many of us have gotten out of tune with that unction it's because what we feed on what we listen to there's so many voices maybe not even sinful voices maybe not even worldly things but it's this voice and that voice and politics and news and this and that and we're missing the unction because those voices are so loud those voices are blaring those voices are out there and there's an unction telling you move move today move deeper in me move away from those things move deeper into the promises of god we have to do more here than live the beginning of these verses talk about enoch living but at the end it talks about enoch walking so we have to do more than live we have to do more than occupy we have to be progressing we have to be led and being led means that you are moving all right no matter i could put a rope around brother joe and i could pull on him as hard as i want to he's not being led as long as he sits in that chair there is someone trying to lead him there is someone pulling at his heart too many times we we mistake the pulling on our heart as us being led that's not being led that's god trying to lead you all right but it's not just leadership we have to be willing to submit to that leadership how many times do things get turned sideways and upside down and we say why god why why didn't you say something he's going are you kidding me i've been trying to move you away from that situation for a decade i've been trying to move you away from there for years for months and weeks and you just wouldn't listen you weren't willing to move your lips may have said you were this may have said you were but you were not willing to do what i ask you to do we have to be led we have to be moving that means you must be growing you must be walking you must be performing the will of god it means we are not to be where we were 10 years ago it means you are not to be where you were five years ago you are not to be where you were one year ago if you are it's time to move it's time to move listen god is always moving and yet he's never changing his promises are true his promises are steadfast he doesn't move away from those promises but he moves into them he moves deeper into his word he moves farther into the promised land he moves further away from egypt he is constantly moving and yet he is never changing and he's always leading his people forward where to where are we going brother aaron towards the ultimate goal he's leading you towards a rapture he's leading you towards a body change so many times we're holding on to these little bitty things and he's saying child don't you see what's right here at the end of the road i have a body change for you i have a deliverance for you i have the ultimate healing for you it's a body change it's a rapture i've gone to prepare a place for you can we not this morning just release our wants release our desires release the things we're holding on to and say god take me to that i'm hungry for that i'm desiring that i want to go home i want to change i want a new body but you got to let go this morning and begin moving begin walking we got to be moving towards the finish line and we can't be a people who drive our tent stakes down too deep to where we get too comfortable right where we're camped at even if it's at a place of great victory even if it's a place of great victory look many of us have experienced great victories where we're walking with god and god came down and did something so mighty and miraculous in our life and it was so wonderful and yet we stay right there we glory and we praise the lord for it and yet we look up and five years later that's our last testimony that's the last time god spoke to us that's the last time we've moved it's a wonderful thing that happened i believe in testifying of the past i believe in pointing to it as a god that does wonderful things but what has he done for you today what has been your communication with god today what has he spoken to your heart today where has he moved you from today and yet many people are camped down at their last great victory or even they've camped down at the place of a great truth that's what happened to men down through the ages they camped on a great truth a wonderful revelation listen standing where you were standing 15 years ago and preaching the exact same thing you preached 15 years ago is not something to be proud of you have not had anything deeper or more opened up to you as a christian you haven't walked you have an advance i'm standing right where i stood 15 years ago brother shame why haven't we moved why haven't we progressed why haven't we went further why haven't we grown we can't be there many have great testimonies of what god did and yet that's where they still are and on the other side of that many people get stuck in the place of great tragedy in a great tragedy will strike their family and the rest of their life their life is formed and revolves around that tragedy well i am this way because this is what happened to me no no you are the way you are because we choose to be what we are i know i know what about i was raised in this home and i was done this and this happened you are the way you are because you choose to be what you are that's why you are the way you are and yet we camp down on this hurt or this thing that happened we allow it to mold us because we never allowed ourselves to be led out of that situation by the pillar of fire that says child i know that hurts i know that's horrible but come with me i'll be the bomb in gilead come with me i'll heal that hurt come with me i'll wrap my arms around you move on from that place i've got greater things for you walk with me grow with me and suddenly even though that thing will always be a part of your life it is not what defines your life but your relationship with jesus christ defines your life because you're walking and you're growing and you're moving and he's changing you from glory to glory and you're becoming more and more like jesus christ down through the ages we find both kinds of people those willing to move and those unwilling to move god would send a messenger direct to each age with greater illumination and greater revelation than the last he would send a messenger with a mighty message but when that man would depart and go off the scene instantly they would organize that work and they would stake their tents down right there and the light would move on to the next messenger in the next age and amongst those who would receive that message some would walk and grow with it i want you to get that they would walk and grow with it some would camp down on the very first part they heard and say this is the truth and i won't move from it well they were right they did have a truth they camped down on a truth that is absolutely correct but in that truth they drove down their tent stakes so deep that they were unable to move on to further revelation even within each age within each message there is growth there is to be progression the growth isn't just from age to age it's not just from age to age but within each age within each stage there is to be growth because in each age there is further unveiling of god that takes place to each individual but there is a certain amount of growth that takes place once again within each stage so many times we think martin had this and it was that little thing and they got it all at once and then it moved and then we got this and it was all revealed all at once and then that's all of it but no there's growth that takes place so there was those that followed the message of luther's day that advanced and grew more than others that claimed to believe the same message there were followers of luther that were more advanced than other followers of luther there were followers of wesley that were true followers that were more advanced than other followers of wesley although they were under the same message they were walking under and moving under that message listen on the way to the promised land and we'll say this more than once today they had to move constantly that didn't mean they had a new messenger it didn't mean the message changed but underneath that message the pillar of fire moved underneath that message corners were turned underneath that message one day they were worshiping one way and the next day they were dancing on the banks of the red sea because they moved underneath that message and that messenger because they were walking with god they progressed further than those who staked down they didn't put a period after their revelation but they allowed it to continually unfold as god allowed it to as far as god was allowed to underneath the revelation for that day and then as the wheat grew there was an advancement into wesley's day and the message for that hour and those willing to move moved right in those not willing dried up right there where they were and some come in and said this is the truth right here and they buried their tent stakes and they grew no more that's where they stayed but those willing to move grew in the light of the word as it advanced within its stage towards the next stage and even if they were someone that was called under that age and they couldn't advance to the next stage themselves or see the next one they grew as far as that light would allow them to all right understand that it's not just here's the revelation for the age but they walked as far as they were able to walk in the light of that day whereas some people staked down as soon as they saw the first little bit of light but they walked and they grew and that's the exact same thing that has happened in our day there is a moving and there is a growing that has taken place in this age in this hour there is revelation that has come to this age not not a new revelation that the prophet didn't bring we're not saying that any anyway but a people who actually eat from the book that became opened people that actually saw the book is open instead of going [Applause] yay did you know the book's open brother joe so does everyone else that proclaims to believe the message but most of them don't know what's in it because that's as far as they went the book's open but he's calling you today he's saying now come come take the book there's a part for you to play you gotta move you gotta feed you gotta come take the book got to move in this word you got to let this word take on flesh you have to become the the bone of his bone and the flesh of his flesh you you not just yea the book's open take the book feed on the book eat the book live the word let it kept preeminence in you and keep moving keep walking keep going as far as the light of the word will let you go you have to move today you have to move it's not just god sent a prophet thank god he sent a prophet thank god he did but at that point when people accepted that and they stopped there they stayed in an infant state but god can't come back he's not coming back to marry an infant there is to be a mature word bride living and breathing and walking on the earth that has fed on the word and who has grown up in maturity because they have walked and they have continued to grow in the light of this last day it's not an infant broad on the earth because there's a people instead of just saying god sent a prophet and his name is william branham that they've actually grown and moved on underneath the message that he actually delivered they've actually allowed it to come in them and change their life and grow from glory to glory to where it's not just an infant bride on the earth anymore but it's a mature elect lady that is coming to her position growing and moving under the message of malachi 4. oh but brother aaron you don't understand we've arrived we're here there is nothing more for us to attain that's the exact same attitude that denominated every other age it's the exact same attitude that caused them to dry up and die every age prior to us couldn't go any further because they said this is it there is no more and when when god would move on they would say that's not of god this is god that's not god this is that's why when people are won't move with the spirit and they see you move they see you run shout dance they go that's not god because they're unwilling to move he said in deuteronomy 1 7 turn you not a new message not a new messenger but a corner was turned a direction changed and you know men in our nature have problems not picking on the men humanity how about that in our nature have problems turning corners we have problems when god moves in a certain way for so long accepting when he moves in another way or when he does something else no no no that's not god because this is god well why can't this be god and that be god why does he have to move within your little shoebox within your little box of how god does things god said turn he said turn you've been in that same place way too long you've been standing there too long and he's telling you to turn a direction has been changed and people have a problem changing directions and usually what you'll find is men who can't turn corners will always criticize those that do men who can't turn a corner will always point at the ones who do turn corners and say they're compromisers or they're going backwards or they've gotten off the word when in reality the ones who turn the corners or the one who saw the movement of the pillar of fire and they said come on church take up your kent stakes pack up the camp it's time to move this morning it's time to go god's doing something and i don't want to be left right here i don't want to be left behind he's moving on can you imagine can you imagine being there in egypt and and putting blood upon the doorpost because that's what the message told you to do and then the next day they gather everyone together and they're marching out and we're standing there going look at them fanatics the message was to put blood on the doorpost where are y'all going you're leaving the message you're leaving them as the message put said put blood on the doorpost so i'm going to stay here every day and put blood on the doorpost where do you think you're going fanatics why are you moving what's wrong with them did the message not say put blood on the doorpost i'm with the message but the message turned the corner and said it's time to leave it's time to go and people who can see you said i'm going i'm leaving i'm not staying here another day i thank god for the flood on the dorm post i thank god for that but today the message said get up and get out and i'm moving with the pillar of fire today [Applause] i'm glad that we're at a place where we're allowed to grow i'm glad that we can advance because as long as we're still here there's more to accomplish if we had achieved it all we wouldn't still be here but there's more to grass more to accomplish more people to reach there's more power of the gospel for each and every one of us there's more for us to experience there's more for evening like tabernacle to do there's more for the bride of jesus christ to do that's why we're still here that's why we have to continue moving look you're never going to get to the promised land staying where you're at unless you think where you're at is the promised land you got ripped off branham says i've noticed among our brethren that many of you as coming into the full gospel people coming from the baptist church myself excuse me and accepting the doctrine of the baptism of the holy ghost being a separate work of the holy spirit and i thought then when the martin luther reached justification by faith he thought that settled it that was the light for his day and he preached it and believed it and held on to it and it was the light of that day then he entered another veil a man john wesley when calvinism began to sweep the nation and they'd settle down to saying what god's going to do he will do and it does that's no good to have a revival god raised up john wesley and he certainly smashed calvinism to the ground to the other places where it ought to have been in its right balance under the works of sanctification the second work of grace nazarene's carried it on and along come the pentecostals then next and the baptism of the holy ghost moving on up into higher heights and now when the brethren received the baptism of the holy ghost they said this is the summit this is all of it but brethren that's wrong see there is no summit to god's power there is no summit we move on and on and on it's the unlimited resources of god has never been tapped yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about it's never even been revealed to archangels and it's laying just ahead for his church that will believe i think i'll stay right here no sir he said it's laying just ahead things that hadn't even been revealed to archangels he said there's no limit to it i say today we move towards it i say today we get up and we go and we march and we don't stop until we're living in the glories of god living overcoming lives living and breathing victorious christians the bride of jesus christ in flesh because it's all just ahead of us but you're not gonna get it sitting where you're at this morning he says for i has not seen ear has not heard neither has it entered the hearts of men what god has for them in store that love him so let's move up and claim our rights as god opens the gates and swings out the welcome mat let's move on up into deeper depths and never colonize ourselves to organize ourselves and to get into a place where this is well we believe this and that's all let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from god let's believe this plus let's believe in door blood on the doorpost plus leave in egypt let's believe what god has today plus i think that ought to be the motive of every man and woman that loves the lord jesus to receive all that you can from the hand of his bountiful mercies that's my heart he says in churches many times they'd never say it but you can see the attitude of well this is all there is to it by the fact that the church is dead that's right there is no moving in the spirit there are no baptisms there are no repentances there are no healings there is no nothing and there's nothing going on nothing brother aaron you just want every service to be people running and shouting absolutely not but i expect there to be life i expect to see lives changed i expect to see overcomers i expect to see sinners weeping their way to calvary i expect to see the things the gospel promised actually happen forgive me for believing that the word is true and that those things are supposed to happen amongst believers it's not often spoken but it reflects in the fact that there's a dead church and once you settle down to that you become comfortable with that then the pillar of fire moves on the pillar of fire will not settle over a dead church brother brown says they followed the pillar of fire they kept it in the will of the lord by do they kept in the will of the lord by doing so how beautiful through 1500 years of dark ages though they failed to see it but there was a fellow one day by the name of martin luther he saw the pillar of fire and away he went on the first reformation but you know what he organized his church so tight it began to be to only the lutheran church you was either lutheran or you wasn't in it pillar of fire won't hang over nothing like that so away it went luther couldn't follow it because luther had been dead for years and another round of servants and apostles or apostles of the church in another round and another round weakened down just like the disciples and the pillar of fire moved away from the lutheran church luther couldn't go because he had all his rituals and everything rode up then there was a little fellow by the name of john wesley in england he saw it and the way he went and he had a revival that saved england the united states the english known world in that day the wesley revival wesley george whitfield oh asbury many of them they had that great revival and then the first thing you know they got so organized down until they began to get after to get after a few rounds just as cold and starchy as they could be why is it that he always equates cold and starchy with denominationalism because it's den brother aaron what do you think every message church should be alive how that life shows itself in your church is not for me to say but i know that it always showed itself the same in the bible so if we're going to go by the bible standard i have a pretty good idea of how it should show itself alive in your church and it should not be cold and starchy he said that's right the pillar of fire won't hang over that let's read that again they was just as cold and starchy as they could be that's right the pillar of fire won't hang over that so away it went and a bunch of people called pentecostals seen it and away they went after it and they built them a church under it but you know the sad part the pentecostals are so organized the pillow fire is moving out again and they can't go that's right but the pillar of fire is moving anyhow god said it would that's right they had the sign of the fire by night and the cloud by day that led them listen the pillar of fire is moving anyhow you can try to sit down on it you can sit there and fold your arms and say i ain't going that's okay somebody always sees it and goes with it some sat down and said this is it i won't move i'm not gonna worship like that that's okay you won't hinder me because the pillar of fire is moving on anyhow and i'm going with it today i'm marching where the pillar of fire tells me to go and that's been the problem so many have camped down through the ages but there's always been somebody that was willing to go always somebody who wasn't ashamed to walk in the light always been somebody who wasn't ashamed to worship in spirit and in truth [Music] i believe there's a people today all around the world that are still growing that are still progressing that are still maturing that are still being led by the holy spirit in this day why because we cannot continue to perpetuate the ages we can't do what the other ages did they didn't rapture you won't either if you do the same thing but god said i will have a bride he said there will be overcomers in laodicea i say it might as well be me it might as well be you i'm going to set my eyes on the pillar of fire and i'm going to move today i'm going to go where it goes i'm going to stop where it stops but i'm always going to be ready to move when it moves again [Music] there is a people moving forward today under the leadership of the pillar of fire people who are looking away from circumstances people who are willing to look away from politics and get their eyes on the fact that the pillar of fire is still moving oh but there's a c in the way he said speak that they go forward but what are we going to do about food when we get over there go forward what about water there's no water in the desert go forward but what about go forward but you don't understand go forward we could have a lot of what ifs in the day we live oh but there's so many people falling away go forward there's ten thousand fallen on this side and a thousand go forward today but look at politics in the government and covet go forward but what about my situation go forward trust the pillar of fire he said we were going to the other side i say go forward you can trust this god today you can have faith in him today just go forward that's what a mature bride does she presses on a mature people willing to move when the pillar of fire moves the move is on for the bride he says some of you people that really believe this to be the truth that we're entering another age we're entering the rapture age you know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better it must get worse how many knows that it's got to get worse it can't go like this see it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend it's it's on the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's thus saith the lord. if you're slumbering today wake up if you luke warm today wake up it is the time it is the hour it is the moment that the move is on for the bride that's dust saith the lord and it's getting closer than it's ever been to going home time the prophet would say the train is in the blocks it's the flashing red lights but the sign of is coming we're right at the doorstep of eternity wake up and move this morning find the oil get the oil trim your laps get ready he's coming go ye out to meet him move you know israel had been in egypt for 400 years and all things seemed to be as they had always been to those that can't see with a spiritual eye and those who have lost their faith and lost their way this is where they end up nothing's going on nothing's happening i'm gonna take my jacket off bud joe i'm gonna tell them like i told them my brother jason jackson's i used to keep my jacket on because the complex of how fat i am but then i looked in the mirror and realized it didn't help so i might as well take it off nice might as well be cool that jacket didn't help nothing you get your eye off of spiritual things get in trouble they get their awful spiritual things and they don't see that nothing's going on they don't realize that nothing's happening to the point that most didn't even think about a delivery anymore i wonder truly and i know there's many of you you can say oh i do i do and i believe you i wonder if every one of us every single day spend a lot of time thinking about the rapture or if we've gotten so beat down so caught up in life so trapped in a slave mentality if i gotta go make bricks for pharaoh that we forgot there's a deliverance promise we forgot there's a promise and we forgot that it's gonna happen no matter what's going on on thursday at work no matter what happened on tuesday at work no matter what went on in the argument that happened in your home that has nothing to do with the promise and some got to the point where they didn't even think about the deliverer anymore so beat down consumed with the slave mentality but there were still some there that were ready to move there was some that hadn't given up hope i'm one of those this morning prophet of god says little old frail body lost a lot of weight up the creaky steps he goes he goes over there and kneels down and he says oh jehovah and i love the way brother brown says that he speaks to jehovah because it's in real talk you don't got to be fancy listen to what brother brown says he says he prayed like he'd never prayed before he said jehovah looky here looky here you're a real god we believe you got ears we believe you got eyes and you know all things and we believe you're the god of the hebrews and we're the people of the promise we believe you keep your word said look at the heathens out here and how they're taking cheap labor and building great big roads and idols and everything you jehovah would you sit in heaven and let the heathen rule over us i don't believe you'll do it amen brother brown says i still don't believe he'll do it amen when the devil comes in god is still god remember that this morning when the devil's coming after you god is still god you are still his child you still have every right promise to you you have the authority to stand look the devil in the eye and say back up get off my property i'm moving this morning i'm taking another step you back off because god is still god he says right he will not permit the devil to do that i believe it's the day that when fashion and nonsense and all this tommy rot's going on still god reigns and he's still god right what we need somebody like hamram got the burden on their heart who will stay there and pray it through until the heavens has split open you under god comes down and answers prayers amen evening like tabernacle move today move under a burden of prayer move to a deeper sincerity move to a deeper consecration somebody that'll begin to pray god this is your word fulfill your word move lord you see how the heathen rage you see how they're trying to ruin this and ruin that and keep us down but i don't believe you're gonna let it happen today because god is still god there's gonna be somebody that falls to their knees and begins to pray god fulfill your word god move in our life god send a rapture god send deliver us we're believing we're praying we haven't given up we're holding on we're moving today we're pressing the battle fulfill your word lord you promised it we believe it [Applause] you got to be more like amram god you are still god that burden had taken a hold of amram's heart a moving was taking place in his heart oh god fulfill your word because the time of the promise was drawing nigh brother brown says also he was told by his mother of his mysterious birth and how that the time of hand had come close to the hour that there was to be a deliverance amram and joshua the sons and daughters of levi began to pray to god to send the deliverer when you see the time of the promised drawing nigh it sets people to praying and hungering acts 7 17 says but when the time of the promise drew now which god had sworn to abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt the time hopefully this will give faith to some people holding on for things he's very specific when he says the time it's amazing to me that an eternal god spoke an eternal word that so often references time all throughout the scriptures we find it and it's because that even though he is not a time being he is a god of perfect timing because he recognizes the fact that you have to live in a body subject to time and so he's a god of perfect timing and he has placed something on the inside of us that allows us to recognize those moments predestinated moments in time that you an eternal being dwelling in a time body are able to recognize because god put that seed gene on the inside of you i can remember the night that my son jude was healed of his kidney trouble lydia had been out and the nursery changing changing him and most of you know how his kidneys worked or didn't work and how one-on-one worked at eight percent and they had talked about removing it and but she walked in the back door to come sit back down service was almost over and as she walked in the door she went to turn right and the lord spoke to her and said it's his time now she didn't wait to see if there'd be a prayer line she didn't wait to see she dropped the bags right there at the floor on the door dropped and to the front she went because something on the inside of her recognized a predestinated moment how wonderful our god is an eternal god with an eternal world dealing with eternal beings trapped in time bodies and yet he puts a seed gene on the inside of us that allows us to recognize time moments when we have need of him and i'll never forget the powerful moment and i remember after it was over i remember sister vicki telling lydia i know he's healed i felt the power of god fall in the place it's just little things like that that you remember as time goes on we take him back to the doctor not too long after that and the very doctor that had been treating him begins to try to explain to us that there's been some kind of mistakes and somewhere along the way somebody misdiagnosed him man you've been treating him for six months i don't know i found him but god allowed her to recognize a moment he is very time specific he fulfills his eternal word but it's in time moments and over and over and over scripture would say at the time appointed oh brother heron i've been holding on for this promise so long what he's saying genesis 18 14 is there anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son let me encourage you in your struggle where you're at what you're dealing with there is a point in time for your deliverance there's an appointed time for your miracle there is a point in time that's coming there's a point in time for salvation there's an appointed time for your children there is an appointed time that god's going to move on the scene for you and exactly what you have need of is going to be taken care of in a moment and i believe that each and every one of you are going to recognize that moment something's going to flash on that seat gene you're going to say this is it this is the time this is the moment and when he moves on your behalf you're going to be able to walk right into it and play your part and move because something is speaking down to you that word's calling out to that word that life's calling out to that life you say this is it i've held on i've prayed i believe and here i am my moment my miracle my moment right here in the presence of almighty god he has a time appointed for each and every one of you and what you're holding on for and the time of the promise had drawn now and god was going to send a deliverer a mighty message one that would take them out but one that would also take them in on this journey there would be times that they made camp and stopped why brother aaron because the pillar of fire stopped the pillar of fire stopped and it was the pillar of fire doing the leading not moses and if we could get that back in our pulpits and we could get that back in our homes it's where it was the pillar of fire doing the leading it was the pillar of fire the holy spirit doing the directing and it wasn't man going i think this and i'm gonna do that and i'm gonna take this job and i'm gonna leave this church and this and this and this without any leadership whatsoever then we'd be a place to where we're moving and progressing in god instead of stuck in a camp somewhere or wandering around a mountain that we've been wandering around for 40 years and god's saying turn this morning turn away from that get back under the leadership of the holy spirit and begin to move numbers 9 15 and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until the morning so it was alway the cloud covered it by day in the appearance of fire by night and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then after that the children of israel journeyed and in the place where the cloud abode there the children of israel pitched their tents at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyed and at the commandment of the lord they pitched as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents and when the cloud carried long upon the tabernacle many days and the children of israel kept the charge of the lord and journeyed not and so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle according to the commandment of the lord they abode in their tents and according to the commandments of the lord they journeyed and so it was when the cloud abode from even until the morning that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up they journeyed or whether it were two days a month or a year that the cloud carried upon the tabernacle remaining there on the children of israel abode in their tents and journey not but when it was taken up they journeyed no it wasn't it was taken up and they went yeah i bet if i stay here a couple more days i can catch them i can catch up to them i like it here this is a nice oasis really the pillar fires moving at 2 am and i gotta move no they journeyed when it moved they moved when it stopped they stopped we have to be a people once again led by the pillar of fire they were led by the pillar of fire and they had to be ready to move whether it was convenient whether it was unconvenient whether it was comfortable whether it was uncomfortable and it didn't matter what everybody else in the camp thought but it's a wednesday night brother aaron and it's really it's a teaching service and there's nothing going on and the lord's moving on me right now i don't know what to do i better sit still doesn't matter whatever else is doing it doesn't really matter but the lord moved on me and i was about to speak in tongues but i quinced it really you just admitted that the lord moved on you and you quenched it boy i wanted to get out of my seat and run not bad enough because you didn't move i saw you aaron you're dealing with the motion okay what i'm dealing with is if god moves on you to do something do it he moved on me yesterday to go to prayer and i had somebody in my heart and i knew i should have done it but i got caught up in this now it doesn't matter when it moves it doesn't matter how unreal it seems to you or it doesn't make sense just move and do what he's asking you to do be willing and able to move whenever he moves it doesn't matter what everyone else is doing you can't care what everyone else is doing the one who is leading you is telling you today it's time for you to move is he talking to me you it's time for you to move if the pillar of fire moves you have to move and that's been the failure of the church all down through the ages and we see in the failure of the church rising up once again they camp down on a truth they put a period at the end of their experience and in so doing they lose the leadership of the holy ghost because the pillar of fire moves on and they're so concerned with where they set up their camp they've camped down they put their stakes in too deep and the pillar of fire moves and there they stay camp down on truth camp down on truth and yet getting no closer to the pillar of fire brother joe if my ultimate goal is to make it out that back door and i say but this chair is comfortable is that true or these chairs pretty comfortable bro joe it's a truth it's comfortable but you're supposed to go out that back door now you don't understand how true this is this chair is comfortable and no matter how long i sit here on this truth i will never get any closer to that back door no matter how long they stayed camped down and their truth and it is a truth they're not moving towards the promised land they are making no progress church i don't want to be a sitting duck today i don't want to be stuck there on the ground not willing and not able to move sitting still while the enemy gathers around sitting still making myself a target sitting there while depression circles me like hungry wolves sitting still why am i so depressed because you've been in the same spot for 10 years you hadn't moved in five years depression's got me bound down well today get up and move away from that spirit move away from that thing move away from sickness move away from anxiety people get hung up on the same old stuff because they're in the same old place and they haven't moved in years and years and years and they wonder why can't i overcome you've never got out of the reach of the taskmasters you've never moved far enough away from egypt you're still right there they're like whoo-hoo i left egypt the egyptians like i see you you're still right there move move today i will go forward brother branham says my if any time it ever looked like they ought to retreat was then but god has no retreat there's no place to retreat in god go forward the doctor says it's cancer go forward he says it's tb go forward the devil says you can't give this up go forward your if your home says you're going to be fanatical go forward the church turns you out go forward there's no retreating back go forward speak go forward speak what his word and go forward thus saith the lord and move on thus saith the lord and move on i love that this morning this is going on that's going on my trials my trust thus saith the lord and move on move away from that thing this morning the pillar of fire has come back into the church and it's still moving and it's still leading and it's guiding and it's doing the same exact things that it did in the bible it's producing the exact same works that it did in brother branham's ministry the word is preached and healings take place the word is preached and people are filled with the holy ghost the word is preached and you see deliverances the word is priests and there's salvation the word is preached and you see an outpouring of the gifts of the spirit i'm not ashamed to say that you see the gifts poured out when the word is preached and if you aren't seeing those things if you aren't experiencing those things it's because you've camped out where you are right now for far too long you've been there too long and you can't become a mature word bride sitting there at the age of seven you've grown none you've moved none and yet we are to be a mature word bride we say he's coming back for me you gotta reach maturity oh we're a mature word broad church brother aaron and yet the law sit there and stay lost demons torment the young people lust and pornography runs unchecked nothing's said about it nothing dealt with maybe because the same problems in the leadership afraid to speak out against things there's no shout of the king in the camp oh we're on this journey are you we must be on different roads there's to be a shout of the king in the camp because there's victory in the camp because the enemy can't stand before us because we're moving forward to onward christian soldier slaying any enemy that comes up against us not backing up not backing down if it rises up we cut it down there is rejoicing there is overcoming there is power in the house of god because we've moved forward underneath the anointing of the holy spirit we are to be a church on the move a church that makes the demons tremble listen rahab didn't give that testimony to the spies because she heard about how nice their camp was there is fear in everybody and strength left and nobody because y'all's tents are awesome i mean i've seen how y'all lay in those tents comfy cause we heard how the red sea parted how you came across and how you crushed this king and crushed that king and you moved forward and you came forward and the demons know you're getting closer and the demons know you're taking more ground and you're taking more ground and you're possessing this and you're possessing that and you're taking this and you're taking it back and you're cutting this one and you're killing that one and you're marching on and on and they know you're getting closer and closer and closer and they're trembling and there's fear and there's no courage left and they can't stand before you because you're a living church a breathing church a powerful church moving on underneath the anointing of the holy spirit satan be careful she's coming she's crossed the red sea she's crossed jordan she's killed this king and she's coming after you to tear your kingdom down hallelujah hallelujah come on now it's time to move from unbelief into faith it's time to break camp it's time to pull up those tent stakes come on it's time for dry bronze to move it's time for cancers to move it's time for mountains to move it's time for you to move [Applause] [Music] what we need today is a good old time holy ghost revival what we need today is an old time shaking again of the power of god a movement of the mulberry mush bushes to go forward to battle again god's given the moving if people would just listen to it and believe it it's time to move it's time to go i hear russell i hear russ that's what's been happening i hear things going forward you look at a different interpretation there and actually a movie is the sound of marching soldiers in the treetops you're encamped about by angels and he's gone before you what do you have to fear oh i've been sitting here waiting on i'm waiting to move okay it's time he's telling you this morning i've gone before you i'm taking care of the enemy now it's time for you to move and come on move with me don't be afraid move you hear the russell means he's gone before you it's a moving it's one step closer they moved with moses underneath the same message not something new it's a coming out but it's a going in the coming out was great church but i'm ready for the going in i enjoyed the coming out i enjoyed seeing those kingdoms tore down but i'm ready for a going in and in order to go in you're going to have to move and it's in this time it's in this hour under this message that we're going to cross over and we're going to go in and we're going to possess all that was promised to us it's not something new i'm just telling you something's happening i'm just telling you you don't don't put your tent states buried too deep in your own conceptions of how things are supposed to be because there's something happening it's time to move well brother aaron it's been happening well sure it's been happening it's the greatest message to ever strike the face of the earth and it struck the earth a good while ago now it's been happening the move is on that's thus saith the lord that was spoken right here in shreveport in 1965 so the move has been on since that time i'm not trying to tell you this is a new move i'm just saying if you can't feel the change in the air come on now i'm just telling you if you can't feel the change in the air if your soul isn't just a little bit excited if there ain't something telling you that it's happening if there ain't something telling you there's a shaking going on if there ain't something telling you that wraps your day is just around the corner i don't know what to tell you because i feel it in my bones i feel it in my soul i realize we're right here i realize there's a wrestling he's gone before us there's no devil can stop us now we're moving now we're walking towards that other ram now we're right on the virgin any day we're going to take that final step we're going to cross over it's not a new move i'm just telling you get ready get ready get ready to move you'll be ready to move because the move can be happening all it wants to and if you ain't moving with it it's doing you no good people are being shook like never before people are finding freedom they've never had miraculous is happening all around us brother branham says oh my the time is here now to speak i believe the time is here for us to speak don't you think so i believe the time that the church should move up or is going back i believe the time that the signs of mark 16 ought to be following the believer don't you believe so [Music] church the patriarchs longed to see this day they were excited and they wanted to be a part of this moment and you have that opportunity and yet brother branham looked at it and said the church is afraid to move he said the church is afraid to move he said so wrapped up in tradition don't be afraid to make that move church if you do you're going to dry up if you don't move you're going to drive right where you sit you got to be willing to move with the spirit move with the message move with the moving move with the moving we got to learn from ages going by great and powerful moves of god that just dried up to nothing dried up to nothing because they were unwilling to move when there was a further unveiling or when light shed on something that they had not seen before even if it had come through the message of their hour but because they hadn't seen it originally when light shines on something move to it walk in the light that's what you're called to do some people are so stuck forgive me but some people are so stuck on god's sent a prophet that they have no desire to move from that revelation there brothers branham said believe that plus believe that well what's the danger again stay in that a good thing that god sent a prophet absolutely in my study and i came across this and it kind of shocked me talking about being stuck in place that all the way through the end of the second century they were still devout followers of john the baptist that believed he was it and never were able to even look and see what his message had pointed to but they walked with john they walked with john it was all about john and john and john and john and they never would accept what he actually pointed to that he was the forerunner of the coming of jesus christ the messiah and they walked under this revelation that john was a prophet and it was a truth but they never got any closer to heaven walking in that belief because there was one he pointed to that said i am the truth and i am the life he is the way but they were stuck on john and they were unable to move then you got others that that are that are stuck in pharaoh worship which means sure you can worship but only go so far only go a little bit they put limits on how god moves they limit how you're allowed to respond they limit how far you're allowed to go and therefore they limit their own victory and they try to hold people in fear and they try to hold people in bondage because they're kingdom builders is what they are they're kingdom builders and they're trying to hold people under their self and so they point at other ministries and they run them down and they point to other things and they point to miracles and they say this isn't needed and that isn't needed and it's all excused because it's not happening in their church and it's not happening in their church because a long time ago the pillar of fire moved and they were camped down and they were unable and unwilling to move at the time and so they try to hold people by fear and yet i believe that true seed of god won't stay there true sea of god won't stand for that brother brown says but the world is beginning to find where your secret is what makes that power what's these fellows doing they're finding and trying to say that the days of miracles has passed there's no such thing as divine healing now listen close and all this here shouting and praising the lord and all these signs and wonders are not right and it's because they don't know god they've never been born again i'm gonna read that again they say there's no such thing as divine healing in all this here shouting and praising the lord and all these signs and wonders are not right and it's because they don't know god they've never been born again god's bible says that he's the same yesterday today and forever and his power is the same they've come too late to tell me about it i've experienced it and i know what i'm talking about listen man does not orchestrate this movement of the holy spirit so therefore man will not be able to stop it they may can stop it in their little corner they might can stomp it out in their little church and watch it shrivel up and die but what's going to happen is those people those true seeds of god they're not going to stand for that and they're going to go somewhere and find somewhere where the holy spirit is moving where there's life flowing where there's lives changed where they can be delivered where they can be set free because there's something that longs on the inside of them to be with a living god in a living presence in a living atmosphere it's not orchestrated a man and so man cannot stop it look i don't want to argue with them if that's where they want to operate let them operate right there i don't have time i'm moving i'm moving on brother branham says don wells the one that wrote me received the holy ghost dr rodhead the president of the great sudan missions received the baptism of the holy ghost in my front room see now he said brother branham the move is on so some of them when i said lee they thought it was dr lee at memphis so they wrote that they wrote there and told them oh no certainly dr lee wouldn't believe that i said what about it i said if he wants to travel in an ox cart let him go we're on a jet plane let's move on we're a different type of baptist let's go on the move is on god is moving among his people i say if they want to travel in a horse and buggy let them alone if they want to travel in an ox cart let them all but i say today that the move is on and there's a people that are no longer bound to earth but they're in a jet plane they're in the astronaut age and they're moving on look the move is on that's thus saith the lord and people are moving out and they're looking for life and they're fine in life because the spirit's being poured out in the last days upon all flesh and they're willing to do whatever it takes to get in the atmosphere of life and they're moving and they're looking and they're searching and they refuse to be held down they refuse to be held in bondage they refuse to be held there they say i gotta move i gotta go i gotta go the pillar of fire is moving and i'm going with it i'm moving with it i won't be caught sitting here they're going to places where life is because the move is on where the holy spirit has preeminence where there's worship in spirit and in truth you say well that's just tommy rot oh that is emotion that dancing and carry-on is idiotic it was actually a quote where brother brown agrees with that it calls it idiotic i'll read it to you and if jesus was considered a holy roller himself he died on the cross as a heretic and the early church was considered a bunch of nitwits paul told agrippa in the way that's called heresy so worship by the god of our fathers i'm glad tonight to join with and say in the way that's called holy rollers crazy nonsense idiotic worship i'm going to worship jesus christ in the power of his resurrection by the holy ghost amen in the way that's called idiotic count me in if that's what you want to call it the prophet of god said that's how he was going to worship that's how i'm going to worship if you don't like it you want to call me an idiot that's fine i'll be over here with brother brad i'm you calling what you want to i'm just saying i'm doing what he said do if you don't like it you can take it up with the prophet because that's not an errand quote i've got a lot of those but i don't bring those over the pulpit that's the prophet of god and he said that's how i'm gonna worship i think i'd rather have a little joy i think i'd rather have a little shouting i think i'd rather have a little dancing i think i'd rather have a little bit of holy ghost worship and take all the criticism in the world than sit there in a place that's dried up dead more than just sitting there don't move like a bunch of bumps on a pickle sitting there just staring at the pulpit don't know what's going on ain't moved in years and years and years and years and you're dead that's fine call me an idiot i'd rather have a little emotion i'd rather have a little running around the church a little shouting a little praising because i've seen the fruits of it you say it's emotion i say i've seen the sick healed you say it's emotion i say i've seen people feel with the holy ghost you say it's emotion i say i've seen people save i've seen lives changed i've seen people completely their lives revolutionized and changed in a moment if you want to call it emotion i'll take that kind of emotion it makes me emotional thank you jesus when you move thank you for saving thank you for calling we're a church that's willing and able to move the pillar of fire moves on it's a quote the pillar of fire moves on and god moves with it and somebody sees it and goes on i skipped a lot so bear with me here hopefully i can bring this right back in see there are movements against the movement movements against the moving of the spirit the brown says they got people to obey them until the time came that their way of worship did not in any way at all resemble the early days of pentecost and that's why we hammer against it so much he says that the bride of the last day is going to move and will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ but see that spirit of denomination will work itself in and bring formalism and try to formalize the worship denomination is not a headquarters somewhere all right denomination doesn't mean you have soup suppers on tuesday and you go feed the old people on thursday and you do this and and then you report to headquarters and the nomination is a spirit that binds the moving of the holy spirit it drives tent stakes down really deep it puts everything in a box it puts a period at the end of experiences and hating programs becomes your program bless god we're not a denomination are you not that becomes all you stand for when it gets to the point that all you stand for is standing against things then you're not standing for anything don't tell me look if you have something so amazing then point to it tell me what you have show me the life that's exactly right preach the gospel when hating everything becomes your gospel you have no gospel to give and that's the spirit of denomination to where your services become so ritualistic that it's like a catholic mass oh not so brother aaron is it not predictable we're going to sing this many songs we're always going to invite the preacher out on this song he's going to preach about 45 minutes we're gonna have two songs at the end we're gonna dismiss when's the last time that the spirit had such control of the service that you were shocked at how it went i can't believe that happened and i don't mean the preacher went five minutes too long but the lord moved in a way that blew your mind because it wasn't put in a box that is the spirit of denominationalism brother branham says that's the commission of the church today lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us that we might run the race with patience that is set before us hebrews 12 said seeing we're compassed about with such a great crowd crowd of witnesses how the miracles was done by faith said let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily beset us we're stopping too much for little social things we're stopping too much and tolerate with the world we're stopping too much to see if we don't get a little bit too fanatical i'm scared more i'm more afraid of a person that's afraid then i am the person that's a fanatic that's right i'd rather have a little wildfire than have no fire at all sure i would i'd rather be around a fire that's popping and jumping anytime if the world's cold than to be around an iceberg certainly don't paint a fire you can't get warm by a painted fire you got to have some real fire church i'm more afraid of people that are afraid of being fanatical than i am of the fanatical because someone who's afraid of the fanatical will never be able to move even when it is the real thing the real spirit of god moves and they're sitting there going i don't want to be a fanatic is it not okay to be a fanatic for jesus is it not okay we got to be a church on the move evening light tabernacle marching to the orders of the word sold out separated moving from glory to glory from victory to victory following the leading of the pillar of fire i believe that this church moves i believe that you are a living testimony that the message of malachi 4 works i believe that you are a testimony of hebrews 13 and 8. i believe you're a testimony of john 14 12. believe you're a testimony that by his stripes we are healed you hear the critic critics say what about when you pray and pray and pray and it doesn't work and you lose someone like this church lost sister karen see that's not how i see it brain bleeds brother joe had tried time after time and failed because by his stripes i'm healed they came and attacked our sister karen and couldn't take her so that brain bleed you know what it tried to do it tried to take her sight and cause blindness couldn't even take her sight as a matter of fact in the midst of its attack trying to take her sight not only does she receive a healing and a deliverance but a little boy got up and walked and ran been walking and running just fine ever since he's fast just asking he says cheetah brain bleeds brought an attack against our sister karen and out of it we got a testimony because by his stripes we are healed because hebrews 13 8 were a living testimony of it they couldn't even take her sight it couldn't even take her joy so it comes back again in a bigger batter more menacing attack and it comes in and it hits her and it causes a midline shift and it says this time i got her she's only got five minutes to live and even if she lives past that she'll be a vegetable wrong again devil once again hebrews 13 8 once again by his stripes i'm healed he raises her right up from that she makes a complete recovery she travels the world she testifies of god's healing and his mercies she runs around this church as a testimony that by his stripes i am healed she testifies by a life lived with her shoulders back and head up let me remind the devil that he failed i would like to tell him that his brain bleeds failed all that happened was sister karen was used by the lord jesus to remind us once again that divine healing is real that divine healing is the truth and that is the earnest of a new body sister karen testifies to you there is a resurrection there is a new body there is life satan you failed out of everything you did there is a church that saw divine healing and the reality of it and then it was a testimony there is a resurrection it was the earnest that i have a new body waiting for me and she did her job you said and brain bleeds took her nope brain bleeds didn't take her the lord jesus said you've done your job sister karen come on well done my good and faithful servant you ran a good race she testified a living testimony by his stripes i am healed and although we're always going to remember her and we will always honor a life a remarkable life live for the lord jesus you will not find this family nor will you find this church camp down in mourning we're moving you're not going to find us camp down here camp down in sadness camp down and woe is me we're going to keep right on moving proclaiming god's a healer god's a savior he fills with the holy ghost he heals in every situation we're going to keep preaching this glorious gospel of the lord jesus because it's the truth and because it works and in sister karen's life it proves that it works so we're not going to camp down there we're going to move on because she won church she won we're all gonna win you can't fail if you're moving on if you're following the pillar of fire you win that's how this thing works brother brown said we believe that through divine healings we have the earnest of our redeemed bodies and if there is no divine healing now there is no resurrection of the body divine healing is the earnest of our redeemed body did you ever think of that if there's no divine healing then when we go to the grave that's all of it you'll be there forever and your dust will go away and there'll be no more of you see but look at the day we're living in what's promised for this day where are we we've moved on up the pillar of fire moves and the children of israel moved with the pillar of fire or they went back to egypt oh moses this is a good spot let's camp right here the lord just opened the red sea this is where the power of god is let's camp right here let's stay right here god's moving right here surely god is here moses god just rained down manna for the first time ever do you realize that baked bread just don't fall out of the sky what's wrong with you moses is a big deal we should stay here but the pillar of fire moved and he moved on moses why do we have to move why do we have to move moses because it was more than signs and wonders because it was about more than the red sea opening it was about more than leaving egypt it was more than man it was more than water in the rock it was more than all that it was about a bride marching to a new home we can't stay here it's about more than all of this it's about going home it's about leaving it's not just about staying those things are just allowed to give you the strength to take another step move another day fight through another obstacle overcome another enemy it's about a bride on the earth onward christian soldier bone of his bone fighting moving moving moving moving we can't stay here because it wasn't just about coming out it's about going in i'm gonna start bringing this down i know i've been a while and we may i just felt led to go this way it may take a little bit of a turn now is the time for these things then why would we not want these things in our services and not just in our services in our lives the moving of the spirit is not just for church services the point of great church services isn't to have great church services that's not what it's about oh the spirit moved why whoo so we could have fun in church so we could run and shout and now the point of great church services isn't to have great church services it's those people's lives can be changed and it can carry on beyond the church service it's so people can encounter a living god is to allow the spirit to have free reigns so that births can take place so that the holy s in that holy spirit atmosphere people can receive a new birth and from there people can move above sin from there people can live above temptation i'm not too much worried about how you live sunday and wednesday although you better live good those two days too but what about the other five days of the week is the spirit moving in your home and in your life the other five days of the week are you able to move out above and claim your promises in church you here claim your promise claim your promise you're like yeah yeah yeah claim a promise on monday you're like so far so much it's just easier to stay camped right here the good camp i long for the spirit to move in our services i love it when he moves down amongst us and there's believers and there's rejoicing and they're shouting in the shout of the king and praise and worship but i want it to be more than that i want it for you to be more than a church jump i want for you to be more than a church shout i want it for you to be more than a church dance but i want you to allow him to move every single day in your life and allow the spirit to begin to move you higher not move by run shout dance jump wonderful i love those things but is it moving you closer to that land are you moving closer in a relationship with god is it moving you into a deeper and more sincere relationship if the prophet of god was told he needed to be more sincere then what does that say about you and i the one that we hold in high respect high regard you have to be more sincere lord help me lord help me get you to the point to where you begin to live your life in an atmosphere not just church services you live your life in an atmosphere where all things are possible are all things possible in the atmosphere you live in on tuesday at 9 30. that's tough ain't it i know buddy i'm surrounded by a thousand heathens at 9 30 on tuesdays bless their hearts it's hard to walk in that atmosphere but we're not supposed to leave the holy ghost in that atmosphere right here what kind of atmosphere men do you bring to your home from work what are we producing when we talk about we want to see the spirit move in church but what's it producing in your homes lord we need to move i mean that sincerely lord i need a move evening like tabernacle needs a move we need to move today i don't just mean i need to see people rejoice lord we need a real sincere get back to god holy ghost move where we die out to our ideas we die out to our thinking we die out to our worldly pleasures and the things that we think are okay and this and that when we die out and say god i need a move in my life we need to move in the lives of the people of evening light tabernacle we need to move to consecration we need to move to dedication to where we can at least get people to show up for the services we have i mean we only have two a week can we get dedicated enough to be in the house of god on a regular basis don't tell me that your prayer life is where it's supposed to be don't tell me that your family alters where it's supposed to be on those nights of the week and you can't show up on wednesday because you didn't stay home because you was having family prayer there's got to be a move to dedication and a move to sincerity yes we want to move yes we want to move yes we want to move but where is it taking us to what's it doing for us church is time to move the lord is already moving oh my how the lord loves to move and see his people move with him see his people take up the tent stakes and say lord i'll go lord i'll move where you're moving it's time to move and you're not going to get to that promised land going around the same mountain you've been going around over and over and over again i don't just want to see you move in church i want you to put it in action i want you moving on monday i want to see you moving on tuesday wednesday thursday friday i want to see you moving each and every day growing and progressing getting what you asked for going on the offensive for too long it's been all about i'll protect my home that's fine you should but we're not to be a people that's just great at defending what we have we are to be gaining ground taking it from the enemy taking the attack to the enemy i love how it was brought out the other day that the gates of hell will not withstand that means that the gates of hell were under attack because they couldn't withstand it it's time to go on the offensive church it's time to move out from your comfort zone and move out against the enemy let's get personal let's buckle up for a moment how about you you when's the last time you progressed i didn't say when's the last time you held your testimony i didn't say have you fallen i said when's the last time you progressed till you can honestly look back and go man i've come a long way when's the last time you progressed and you moved not backwards not on your own but following the pillar of fire is there a marked difference in where you are today versus where you were a year ago are you more dedicated are you more sincere because there's got to be a pressing forward i press towards the mark not i got this testimony and i'm standing here bless god and heaven's going to come to me one day now you're pressing you're pushing not just occupying not just staying still but gaining new ground have you advanced have you taken another step like we said not to a new message not to a new doctrine not to a new gospel this is the gospel paul preached they shouted back to brother branham we're resting on that this is the gospel paul priest i'm not telling you to move out from another i'm telling you to move in it move under it feed on it let it take you where it's supposed to be taking you brother joe told us wednesday night this is not a picnic this is war you don't win wars sitting still and you don't win wars camp down you win wars advancing have you gathered a fresh experience today or does your experience have wiggletails in it have you been gathering fresh mana i want us just for a minute to move away from the group mentality and please don't think i'm in any way trying to beat anybody over the head this just came to me so strong this week i said lord just help me deliver this in a manner of love is we got to be moving and it probably spoke to me more than it'll ever speak to you i got to move i have to move but let's get away from the group mentality because a lot of times what we what we like to do is we see that the group is moving forward we see that the bride is progressing and many times we take comfort in the success of the group and so we deflect our own shortcomings by focusing on the success of what we've affiliated ourselves with kind of like the guy celebrating the super bowl championship and he was on the practice squad really he didn't do anything just to make a point we sit there and go man the bride is moving forward the bride is overcoming our church is on fire evening like tabernacle is on fire the services are incredible the sick are healed people are being filled with the spirit we've had baptisms the spirit is moving in our church and i say is the spirit moving in you right now this isn't about evening like tabernacle this isn't about the bride world why this about you as an individual has the spirit been moving in you and have you been moving with the spirit brother aaron you're talking to the sinners you talking to the backsliders talking to every one of us because we all have to be going forward i wonder how long some of us have been camped out exactly where we're camped out this morning where you're currently at how long have we been there you know many people recognize they need to move and sometimes we're afraid to move because we feel safe where we're at we feel comfortable where we're at we feel comfortable with what we've done we've conformed i dress right i don't curse i talk right i don't tell dirty jokes i listen to tapes i come to church i believe the message good steps believe this plus can you add to that today can you take another step today i've been filled with the spirit and i've walked with god for many years how's that fire burning today how was that hunger when you woke up this morning how's it going to be in the morning that spot that you're currently in may be a spot that god led you to i'm not saying you're in an ungodly place there were many places that the pillar of fire led the people to and stopped and they camped the place you're in may be a place that god has led you to he brought you exactly to where you're at he stopped and it was a place where you were supposed to be you stopped obediently but i asked you where's the pillar of fire at today did it move on did you stay camped did it move on at some point and you remain behind look maybe you danced on the banks of the red sea what a wonderful wonderful thing i believe we literally almost witnessed a reenactment of that that time when sister ruth took that tambourine at the end of that service during our meetings in my mind i could see the the sisters dancing on the banks of the red sea was incredible it was incredible to see even here i can only imagine what was like there maybe you danced there maybe you saw your taskmasters dead maybe you were prayed for and demons fell off and you shouted and you jumped maybe it happened in your seat at the altar and you saw him drown you were set free and today you find yourself still standing on the banks of the red sea you haven't progressed from that point maybe at first you fell in love with the message it was manna you love to gather it you love to eat it and now it's tough for you to even get through a tape look i'm glad you came out i'm glad you accepted this truth i'm glad you accepted this message whether it was in 1983 1991 1976-2006 i'm glad it cleaned you up i'm glad you're here we're on this journey together but i'm asking are you moving have you moved lately have you taken steps look i'm sincerely glad i'm not knocking you i'm proud of what you've done i'm proud of how far you've come and i'm saying it's time to take another step i'm just telling you to move today that's all i'm saying when's the last time you purposely said god i'm taking another step i'm devin deeper than ever before i'm being more sincere than ever before i'm dedicating myself more than ever before it's time to move it's time to walk it's time to grow it's time to seek it's time to move look this isn't a motivational speech i'm sorry but i'm here to tell you you can do it you can do it just step out beyond that fear and step out beyond that thing when's the last time you came to an altar brother aaron i've been in the message 30 years so the altar isn't just a place for sinners that's a place you just need to go have a talk with the lord say lord i'm here today help me take another step lord i'm just trying to walk a little further with you it's time that you take a step move out move out from those personal things holding you back how long have you been camped down with a complex sitting there and that's as far as you'll go because that complex hold you how long you been sitting there with those with those family things that held you down with that bitterness in your heart you can walk away from that critical spirit right now critical spirits go hand in hand with people who refuse to move they got time to see everything and everybody because they ain't got to watch the road they ain't going nowhere and so they look at everybody else and they find faults with every church member with the leadership of the church with the deacons with the ministry with the piano player and the organ player and this player why if you've sold out and you're worshiping it's kind of hard to notice all that stuff if you're focusing on overcoming it's kind of hard to notice where other people are falling quit picking everything apart and move i don't mean just come to church i mean are you fellowshipping with god would jesus have been comfortable walking around in your skin for the last month have a hard time answering that one would jesus have been comfortable walking around in your skin for the last month brother brown says don't try to say well i joined the church 10 years ago brother branham i've been a good faithful member that's fine i appreciate that but let's move on tonight god's moving on he said let's move on god's moving on you can't go in church if you don't move you got to take that next step greater sincerity more of god seek you once moved you're here because you once moved it's time to move again how long are you going to stay where you're at lukewarm bitter hurt don't sit still i'm asking you to move today don't be a sitting duck allowing things to encircle and circle you and take you down it's time for your deliverance today deliverance from what deliverance from the fact that you hadn't moved in five years deliverance from a lukewarm condition deliverance from all the things holding you in that place it's time for your salvation today look some of you have never made a move some of you have never taken the first step today's the day to move today is the day of salvation it's time you make a move towards god and you watch him move and respond back to you he'll do it brother joe every time you got to move you got to wake up and take a step brother aaron why the urgency why do we got to move today because it won't be long and you'll wish you could have this opportunity again it won't be long and you'll say lord i wish i could have just got a little closer do you want to meet jesus the way you are right this second i'm not saying or are you saved i believe you're saved i'm saying you have the opportunity to take another step with him today if you're not saved i'm saying salvation is here for you today but you got a part to play just like abram you got to move today the opportunity is here jesus is calling you he's wound you and he's saying you got to move today church every one of us have to move today what if you're a borderline believer move what if you're the saintliest christian here today move brother brown said there was borderline believers that used to attend the meetings of noah in other words they went to church just like there is now and people sit around all the time in the church but they never make a move to come forward they enjoy hearing the pastor preach and something another but they never make a move forward so then the first thing they never want you want to put their hands in it and they don't want to be identified with it i asked you this morning if you're a sinner or a backslider in the building listen to brother branham you'll either go out of the door a better man or woman than what you come in or you'll go out worse than you was when you come in you can't stay mediocre you've got to make it this was on my heart it was on my heart now it's on your hands you've got to make your decision you've got to make a decision you got to make a decision you've been maybe a good church member maybe you've always longed that you wanted more of god you might wanted to do something for god remember you're only mortal once and that one time is the only time you're going to be mortal this may be the time that you've got to make your decision you're either going to move up with god or stay where you're at you may have to make your decision tonight if it is i pray that you'll throw everything loose remember i don't care what it is if it's a job if it's family if it's loved ones if it's associates if it's your partners whatever it is turn loose of everything today won't you move the holy spirit's asking you today won't you move one word of god misplaced or misconstrued or it's not accepted breaks the whole chain man should not live by bread alone by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god why is it women you hear me preach against these things wearing shorts and paints and hairdos of this bobbed hair and all that kind of stuff and then every year i come back and you're still sitting in the same condition it's because you're leaning to your own understanding instead of the word of god but won't you move today what did he do he's talking about the prodigal he done something about it oh brother sister do you see what i mean he didn't just sit there and say god said so he done something about it if you want to get saved this morning god promised salvation then do something about it don't just sit there it's time for you to move whatever situation you find yourself in today what i want you to take from this is it's time for you to move and you have an opportunity right now in this moment to take another step with god it's time for you to quit living below your privileges it's time for you to come out of that hog pin even if it is a secret hog pin and you don't think anybody knows about he's calling you out of your hog pen today he's saying come on back to the father's house take another step towards the promised land look at the life you're living right now and ask yourself an honest question do i want to live like this the rest of my life then it's time to move you've been laying by the pool long enough but you don't understand how long i've been in this condition the man been laying by the pool of bethesda for 38 years and jesus asked him would thou be made whole not how long have you been here and what's your problem he's asking you today will you be made whole but you don't understand brother will you be made whole will you move this morning will you bow your heads with me i know it seemed that it it took a turn but it's the way i felt led to turn it's time to move i don't care who you are how long you've been here whether you've got the holy ghost or whether you don't know jesus at all i'm telling you right now the altar is open for you are you willing to move are you willing to admit lord i need to take another step are you willing to admit i've been sitting in this place for far too long and today lord i just want to take another step i just want to move with you the holy spirit called out to you this entire service and he said move he said move hey it's okay if you feel like you've taken every step that you should have taken and you can sit right where you're sitting that's fine god bless you but if you're where you were six months ago when you where you were a year ago and you where you were 18 months ago it's time to get out and move it's time to show god you mean business with him because he's calling out to you today and he's saying will you move will you take the step will you dig up your tent stakes of pride will you dig up those things and take a step with me i'm thankful you're on this journey with me but it's time to move brother brown says be sure don't just take a halfway chance on it if there's a little doubt in your mind don't take no chance come on now now is the time now while the fountain is open while the holy spirit is here the master has come that little doubt is what he's trying to tell you you're doubting give it over come on now the master has come and he calls for thee he's calling for you to move we're called to be like jesus we're called to take another step i want to read this quote to you in closing as the holy spirit reaches out and moves to each one today i know it's hot friend i know it is but i hope you
